         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF ever any People had a just Occasion given
them to enter upon those Reflections which
these words naturally present to us; and to
consider, How little dependance is to be placed
upon the<note n="*" place="margin">So <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> v. 3. imports.</note> 
               <hi>Best</hi> or <hi>Greatest</hi> among <hi>the Children of
Men:</hi> I may with confidence say, that we of this
Nation, have at this time, a most eminent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
given us by the Divine Providence so to
do.</p>
            <p>It has pleased God, within these few days, to
deprive us of a most excellent <hi>Princess;</hi> under
whom, we had flatter'd our selves, that we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60624:3"/>
should have long enjoy'd, a more than ordinary
Portion, of Happiness and Prosperity. A Person
she was, as by the Greatness of her Character
qualified beyond most Others to have become a
<hi>National Blessing;</hi> so by the many incomparable
Endowments, God had bestow'd upon her, in a
singular manner disposed so to be. And as this
raised our hopes into some more than ordinary
Expectations from her; so that firmness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
which she enjoy'd, accompanied with
a yet early and vigorous Youth, seem'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
us, that we should be many years blessed
under the influence both of her Authority and of
her Example.</p>
            <p>But alas! how suddainly are all these Hopes
cut off, and our Expectations brought to an End!
And nothing left us but the sad Reflection, how
grievously mistaken we were in our Opinion of
our own Happiness; and how little <hi>trust</hi> is to be
<hi>put</hi> in <hi>Any,</hi> but that <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>alone</hi> enjoys a <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
of <hi>Being,</hi> and therefore can <hi>alone</hi> with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be <hi>depended</hi> upon.</p>
            <p>In the words before us, there are these two
things that naturally offer themselves to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration:</p>
            <p>First, That it is a vain thing to <hi>put</hi> our <hi>Trust</hi>
in any Man, be his Rank or Condition ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so great; upon this double Account,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60624:3"/>
(1) That his <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>help</hi> us, is very <hi>small:
ver.</hi> 3. And,</p>
            <p>(2.) His <hi>Continuance short</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> ver. 4.</p>
            <p>And therefore to <hi>Trust</hi> in such a person,
must be to repose our Confidence in One, who
oftentimes <hi>cannot help us;</hi> and, in a little while,
<hi>will fail us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That he who will <hi>place</hi> his <hi>Trust</hi>
upon a sure foundation, must place it upon
<hi>God;</hi> who <hi>alone</hi> is <hi>always able,</hi> and will <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
continue</hi> in a Condition, to <hi>help</hi> and
<hi>defend</hi> us.</p>
            <p>And, First, That it is a very vain thing to <hi>put</hi>
our <hi>Trust</hi> in any Man, be his Rank or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
never so Great; Because both his
<hi>Power</hi> to help is very <hi>small,</hi> and his <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
short</hi> and <hi>uncertain:</hi> And therefore to
<hi>Trust</hi> in such a Person, must be to build our
Hope upon one who oftentimes <hi>may not</hi> be
<hi>Able</hi> to <hi>help</hi> us; and very probably, in a
little while <hi>will fail</hi> us.</p>
            <p>This is a Consideration, both so certain in its
self, and so Obvious even to the meanest Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that did we not see Men every day overlook it
in their practice, one might think it hardly need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to offer any Arguments, either to Illustrate,
or to Confirm the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60624:4"/>
If (1) We consider the <hi>Power,</hi> of the Greatest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to <hi>help</hi> us; Alas! How little is it at the Best?
And, for the most part, How useless to us? In
how many Cases does it surpass their Power to do
us any Good? And even in those in which it may
seem the most in their Power to assist us; yet
how many Accidents may there fall out, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
us from being at all the better for it?</p>
            <p>It may be they are <hi>Unwilling</hi> to <hi>grant</hi> us what
we desire of them. Perhaps they are disposed to
do <hi>Somewhat</hi> for us; but they will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to do <hi>so Much</hi> as <hi>our needs require:</hi> And so
spoil all the Advantage we hoped to have reaped
from their Kindness to us, for want of making
their Supply suitable to our Occasions.</p>
            <p>It may be they are willing to do <hi>All</hi> that we
desire of them, but not <hi>Presently:</hi> They put off
the time; till at last, by their delays, their favour
comes too late to us.</p>
            <p>Or lastly; It is possible that in a little while
they may <hi>Change</hi> their <hi>Minds,</hi> and with them,
their <hi>Affections</hi> towards us. And so where we
thought to have found a <hi>Friend,</hi> we meet an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:</hi>
One who is disposed rather to do us a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
than to lend any Help or Assistance to us.</p>
            <p>So Impotent; so Trifling; so Uncertain, and
Dis-ingenuous a Creature, is Man! And then,
What a Vanity must it be for any one to place his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60624:4"/>
               <hi>Trust</hi> upon the Interest or Authority, the Love or
Favour of such a One? Who in the chiefest of
our needs, cannot Help us at all: And in those,
wherein he is able to relieve us, will be apt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
altogether to fail us; Or else to mix so much
of Humane Frailty and Infirmity with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
as shall render it of very little Use and
Value to us.</p>
            <p>Nor let any one think that there is any <hi>Order</hi> of
<hi>Men</hi> exempted from the force of these Reflections.
Even the <hi>greatest Persons</hi> lye open to them, no less
than those of a <hi>lower degree.</hi> Their <hi>Power</hi> indeed
is Greater, and they can do much more for us
than other Men. But yet still it is far short of our
Wants; And cannot answer one half of those
Exigencies, in which we shall stand in need of
some one to Help and Assist us.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Minds</hi> are <hi>Mutable</hi> no less than Other
Mens: And they are by so much the more likely
to Change in their Affections towards us, by how
much the more they are exposed to the Delusions
of those about them; who are still envious of
such as they take into their particular Favour;
and will therefore be still endeavouring, by all
imaginable ways, to bring us into Disgrace with
them.</p>
            <p>Their Favours are, generally, the <hi>Longest</hi> in
<hi>Coming,</hi> and the <hi>Hardest</hi> to be <hi>Obtain'd:</hi> Whilst the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60624:5"/>
very Formality which attends the Dispensing of
them, oftentimes, Costs so much, and causes such
Delays; as is utterly inconsistent with many of
those Wants, wherein we might otherwise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
our selves the most considerable Advantage
from their Favour and Affection towards us.</p>
            <p>And from all which we must therefore conclude,
That it is a very vain thing to place any confidence
in Man upon this first Account, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
Power, even of the greatest Persons, to <hi>Help</hi> us is
exceeding <hi>Small;</hi> exposed to so many Casualties,
and attended with such Inconveniencies, as renders
it of very little Use, and of no Dependance at all
to us.</p>
            <p>But <hi>(2dly)</hi> Were the Case quite otherwise;
were there any Order of Men so perfect, in all
other Respects, that they <hi>Could</hi> supply us with <hi>All</hi>
that we should ever be likely to <hi>Want,</hi> and <hi>Would</hi>
give us whatsoever we should <hi>Desire:</hi> And were
their <hi>Inclinations</hi> towards us so <hi>Fixt</hi> and <hi>Immutable,</hi>
that we might depend upon them that they would
<hi>never forsake</hi> us, but be at all times ready to Grant
us whatsoever we should ask of them: Yet still
their Life is so <hi>Uncertain,</hi> and, at the best, so <hi>Short;</hi>
that it would be a very vain thing for us, after all,
to <hi>set up</hi> our <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>For alas! Where is the Man so Great and Self-sufficient,
that can secure himself the next Hours
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60624:5"/>
Breath? And in the heighth of all his Fortune
presume to say, that to Morrow shall not lay him
Equal with the Dust, and return him to the Earth
from whence he was taken?</p>
            <p>It is an extraordinary Character which the Holy
Spirit gives to some Persons, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxxii. 6. <hi>I have
said that ye are</hi> Gods, <hi>and that ye are all the Children
of the most High.</hi> And yet what follows immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon it? A Sad, but Certain Truth: <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
ye shall</hi> Die <hi>like Men.</hi> This is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of all; The Common End of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
as well as of the Meanest, Persons. Here they
may seem to be a Sort of <hi>Gods</hi> upon Earth: May
dispense the Fortunes of Men as they please; Set
up, whom they will set up; and Pull down,
whom they will pull down. They may be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
too as Such, by Those who know no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
above their Interests; nor think any Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
more worthy of their Regard, than <hi>Those</hi> who
have it in their power to promote them to Riches,
and Honour, and Authority.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Death</hi> observes none of these Formalities.
When that strikes, the Crowned Head falls as
surely before it, as He who had not where to lay
his Head, till the Grave afforded him a place for it.
All the difference is, that as such Persons are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to more Dangers, and subject to Greater
Hazards, than lesser Men; so are their Lives more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60624:6"/>
Uncertain; and, generally Speaking, more Short
too. A Cottage may, and oftentimes do's afford
us an Example of a Vigorous Old Age: But this
is a Sight which the Palaces of Princes are seldom
blessed with; nor can it reasonably be expected
they should often Enjoy it.</p>
            <p>And when this is the Case, what a folly must it
be to build our Hope upon such Protectors? Who
are so far from being able to Help us, that alas!
they are not able to Help themselves, in those
Instances, in which both They and We, the most,
stand in need of Assistance. Whose Breath is not
their Own: Who live by the meer Favour of Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Who to day appear in Glory and Honour; and
to morrow go down into the Grave, and yield to
the Fate of other Ordinary Men.</p>
            <p>So foolish a thing is it, in point of <hi>Reason,</hi> to
<hi>put</hi> our <hi>Trust</hi> in <hi>Man;</hi> be the Place, the Power, or
Authority which he Enjoys, what it will. And
for a yet more sensible confirmation of this Great
Truth; give me leave, but briefly, to illustrate it
to you, in that Fatal Evidence it has pleased God at
this time to give us, in the Person of our <hi>late Royal
Soveraign;</hi> How <hi>little dependance</hi> is to be <hi>placed</hi> upon
any <hi>Human Support;</hi> upon the Best, or Greatest of
the Children of Men.</p>
            <p>If, <hi>First,</hi> We consider Her with respect to her
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dignity;</hi> She was <hi>Queen</hi> of a Mighty and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60624:6"/>
Renowned People: Endued with the Highest
Authority that a Crown could give her; and in
that with the largest Capacity that any Creature
could pretend to, of <hi>Doing Good.</hi> Her Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
were Many, and her Advantages very Great
for such a Purpose. Much was expected from
Her; and we must, with Gratitude, Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that much she did Do.</p>
            <p>For indeed, <hi>2ly;</hi> Her <hi>Will</hi> was not at all Less, nay
I may venture to say, it was much Greater than her
<hi>Power.</hi> Nor did she value any thing so much in the
Eminence of that Station to which it had pleased
God to raise her amongst us; as that it put her
in a Condition of extending the Exercise of her
Vertues a great deal farther, than it had been pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for her to have done in a Lesser Fortune.</p>
            <p>Never was there Any in so High a Place,
more free and easie of Access, even to the most
Ordinary Persons: More Desirous to Oblige all, or
that better knew how to Do it. Insomuch that I
believe it has seldom been known that Any ever
Applied to Her, but what have gone away Easie
and Contented from Her: And either obtained
what they wanted, or not known how to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
if they have not.</p>
            <p>The truth is, She was a Person in whom <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>Grace</hi> seem to have concurr'd, to make up
One great Master-piece of Excellency and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60624:7"/>
Her <hi>Natural Disposition</hi> was Free and Generous;
Open and Sincere. She had a Sweetness of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
finish'd and heightned with a large mixture
of Christian Charity and Compassion: Such as
never loved to see any in Misery, Otherwise than
as it gave her an Opportunity thereby of Doing
somewhat for them to make them Easie.</p>
            <p>Thus was she fitted to <hi>Do Good:</hi> And a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Dexterity She had in the Doing of it. She
knew <hi>What</hi> was fit to be done for Every One;
and <hi>After what Manner;</hi> and <hi>At what Time.</hi> And
seldom did She Vouchsafe a Favour to Any, but
the very Way that she bestow'd it in, doubled
the Obligation; and made a deeper Impression
upon the Mind of Him who receiv'd it, than the
Benefit it self did.</p>
            <p>In short; So Great was her Comprehension;
So Correct her Judgment; So Easie her Dispatch,
of whatever came before her; That God seemed
to have fitted her Soul to her Place and Character:
And to have given her a Capacity as far beyond
that of Other Common Persons, as she was in
Rank and Dignity above Them.</p>
            <p>Such good reason had we, upon All those ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
to expect some more than Ordinary Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
under her Government; and to put a greater
<hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in her, than was almost fit
to be placed in any Creature. And the more to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60624:7"/>
encourage us so to do, it had pleased God to all
his Other Endowments, to Add such a Vigour
of Body, and Firmness of Constitution, as seem'd
to Equal the Vivacity of her Mind: And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
us almost an Age of Happiness yet to come,
under the Influence of her Conduct.</p>
            <p>And now, when so many Circumstances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
to encourage our Relyance upon Her;
who could Blame us for being willing to flatter
Our Selves, that such a <hi>Queen</hi> was certainly raised
up by God to do some extraordinary Good for
that <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> to which He had given
Her? But alas! a Sad Experience has shewn us
that we ought not to have <hi>put</hi> our <hi>Trust</hi> even in
<hi>Such</hi> a <hi>Person.</hi> And if <hi>Such</hi> a <hi>Person</hi> may not
be rely'd upon, We may then safely conclude,
that We must look beyond this World for our
<hi>Support:</hi> And not place our Confidence on any
but that <hi>God</hi> who alone, both Can Do All things
for us; and will continue, for ever, to Help and
Defend Us.</p>
            <p>Which therefore brings me to the Other Point
I proposed to speak to;</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he who will <hi>place</hi> his <hi>Trust</hi>
upon a sure Foundation, must <hi>place</hi> it upon
<hi>God;</hi> who alone is <hi>Able</hi> to <hi>Succour</hi> us in <hi>All</hi>
our <hi>Exigencies,</hi> and will <hi>Always</hi> continue in
a <hi>Capacity</hi> so to <hi>Do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60624:8"/>
And <hi>1st.</hi> That God is <hi>Able</hi> to <hi>Succour</hi> us in <hi>All</hi>
our Exigencies; is evident from hence, that he
is <hi>Able to do whatsoever he pleases both in Heaven
and Earth.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. cxxxv. 6.</note> That he has no Equal, much less
any Superiour Power, to Controul his Will;
and to hinder him from bringing Whatsoever
he purposes, to the End which he Designs.
* That as he is the first Being, and Author of
all Others; So was there Nothing before him
to Confine, or Limit his Perfections. He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
not his Power from Any; Nor has he
therefore any Restraint upon it but what proceeds
from himself, and is subject to his Own Will.</p>
            <p>Man, as he was Created by God, so was he
limited too by him in his State and Condition,
to a certain Degree of Perfection, beyond which
he cannot Go, nor Raise up himself above it.
And therefore, whatsoever Power he has, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
within those Bounds which the Divine
Wisdom has thought fit to set to it: Nor can
he Go, the least Tittle, beyond what God has
permitted him to Do.</p>
            <p>But God himself is Free and without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.
With him nothing is impossible, but
what is Sinful; And that is not an Instance of
true Power, but of Impotency and Infirmity.</p>
            <p>So that if we would then <hi>Trust</hi> in <hi>Man,</hi> we
must do it with those Restrictions which his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60624:8"/>
requires us to limit our <hi>Trust</hi> withal: And
depend upon Him as One whose <hi>Power</hi> may <hi>fail;</hi>
Whose <hi>Mind</hi> may <hi>Change;</hi> nay, whose very <hi>Life</hi>
may be <hi>taken from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But with God we shall need none of these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferves.
He is Absolutely Able, in Every thing, to
Help and Succour us: And in all such Cases where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is fitting for Him to Do it, He will help us, if
we do but duly apply our selves to Him, and depend
upon Him. And when such is the Advantage of
God, in this Respect, above Any of his Creatures;
much more above Man, the Lowest of all the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Kind in Power and Dignity: Well may
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> pronounce him <hi>Blessed,</hi> whose Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Piety have taught him to fix his
<hi>Trust</hi> there, where Nothing can hinder it from
being Beneficial to Him, but his own Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
to seek for Help as he ought to Do.</p>
            <p>I say nothing now of the many Other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that might be offered to Encourage us in
this <hi>Trust,</hi> and to shew the Happiness of that Man
who has placed his Hope upon it. Such are,
* The infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, in judging <hi>what is
Best</hi> for Us, and after <hi>what Manner</hi> it will be
most for our Interest to be <hi>Helped</hi> by him. * His
infinite <hi>Knowledge,</hi> for the <hi>Discovery</hi> of our <hi>Wants,</hi>
oftentimes long before We Our selves are sensible
of them. * His <hi>Power</hi> to Relieve Us, not only
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60624:9"/>
in <hi>All</hi> our <hi>Exigencies,</hi> which I have before Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
but to Do it in a <hi>Moment,</hi> at the very <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute</hi>
that it will be most Seasonable for Us to have
it done. And, not to mention any more; * His
<hi>Ability</hi> to <hi>Prevent Evils from Coming</hi> upon us, no
less than to <hi>Free</hi> us <hi>from</hi> them, or to <hi>Support</hi> us <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
Them, when they have Overtaken Us. And
in all which the Wisdom and Power of Man can
either Do Nothing at all, or Nothing Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to what God is able to Do.</p>
            <p>But One Consideration more there is, which
neither the express <hi>Words</hi> of my <hi>Text,</hi> nor the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the present Discours, will permit me to
pass by: And that is, <hi>2dly.</hi> That God is not only
thus <hi>Able,</hi> as I have shewn, to <hi>Help</hi> us in <hi>All</hi> our
<hi>Needs;</hi> but <hi>will continue</hi> for <hi>Ever</hi> in a <hi>Capacity</hi> to
<hi>save</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> Us. For God is Eternal in his
Duration, as well as Infinite in his Power; and
as He never had a Beginning of Being, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can He Ever Come to an End of it.</p>
            <p>Now how far this sets him up above all
<hi>Earthly Benefactors,</hi> I have already shewn you;
and the mighty Loss, we have just now sustain'd,
does but too plainly Declare.</p>
            <p>When One of our <hi>Earthly Benefactors</hi> Dies, not
only all his Good Dispositions towards us perish
together with Him, but all his Power too of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them in Execution, from that instant, Ceases.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60624:9"/>
And we from thenceforth become as Destitute
and Forlorne, as if we had never had any such
Friend or Patron, to rely upon. In such a <hi>Trust</hi>
therefore there is no certainly: Nothing on
which to build any lasting Hope; any wise and
comfortable expectation.</p>
            <p>But <hi>God endureth for ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. ix 7. cii. 12.</note> and therefore his
<hi>Help</hi> can never fail us.<note place="margin">Psal. xlviii. 14.</note> He will be <hi>our God unto
Death;</hi> Nay, and even after it too, will save and
deliver Us. The Grave it self, which puts an
end to all things else, cannot take us out of his
hand, nor deprive us of his Protection. But in
that melancholy Place and State, tho' we know
but little else of what relates to it; yet this we
are sure of, that our <hi>Souls</hi> continue under his
Care: And that, after a certain Period of time,
our very Bodies themselves shall again be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to us;<note place="margin">1 Thes. iv. 17.</note> and so <hi>we shall be for ever with the</hi>
LORD.</p>
            <p>And thus have I shewn you, What the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of that <hi>God</hi> are, above all Other <hi>Supporters,</hi>
in whom our <hi>Text</hi> exhorts us to <hi>put</hi> our <hi>Trust;</hi>
and pronounces Him <hi>Happy</hi> who has taken Care
so to do. And when such are his Advantages
above any of his Creatures, in this respect, as
well as in All Others; What resolution can we
better take up, than that which is pointed out to
us in that Exhortation of the Evangelical Prophet,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60624:10"/>
Isai. 26. 4. <hi>Trust ye in the</hi> LORD <hi>for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
for in the</hi> LORD <hi>Jehovah is everlasting
strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this may suffice for the <hi>two Points</hi> I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to speak to: I shall only draw a few plain
<hi>Consequences</hi> from what has been said, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Discourse. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Since such is the Vanity of <hi>putting</hi> our
<hi>Trust</hi> in any <hi>Humane Help;</hi> let us resolve to
take off our Hearts from all such Dependencies:
And not build our <hi>Hope</hi> on such a Foundation, as
we are sure in a little time will fail us, and we
cannot tell how soon it may do so.</p>
            <p>I do not deny, but that as <hi>God</hi> orders the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Mankind by the Ministry of <hi>Second Causes;</hi>
so we may, without incurring any just Censure
for it, look to them as the <hi>Instruments</hi> which he
makes use of in his Dispensations towards us.
Nay, we may <hi>put</hi> some kind of <hi>Trust</hi> too in them:
Provided that it goes no farther than the <hi>Nature</hi>
of such <hi>Causes</hi> admits of; and that we still take
care to look beyond them, to that <hi>God</hi> who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
them to our Interest and Advantage. But
yet, when all is done, our last and highest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
must be placed upon God only; who
alone is Able, and will always be so, in all our
Exigencies to Help and Deliver Us.</p>
            <p>It cannot be doubted but that We of <hi>this Country,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60624:10"/>
and especially We of <hi>this Church,</hi> have indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as great a loss, as could well have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to us, in the unexpected <hi>Death</hi> of our late
<hi>Royal Sovereign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Princess</hi> she was, such as this Nation never
before had, nor was it now worthy of her. To
draw her Character, and set her out to you with
all the Advantage that her Real Worth deserves,
is a Task too difficult for me to presume to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
Though this security I should have in the
doing of it, that let me say what I could, no
one would accuse me of <hi>Flattery</hi> in ir; a Vice ever
odious, and I think no where more so than in
the Pulpit. For howsoever 'tis impossible to
speak of Her, and not say Great things; yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hard it is to speak, but a small part, of what
all must allow might justly be reported of Her.
Let it suffice, at present, to say; That if a <hi>Queen</hi>
so <hi>Vertuous,</hi> that her very Example was enough
to convert a Libertine, and to reform an Age:
So <hi>Courteous</hi> and <hi>Affable,</hi> as to be the wonder and
delight of All that Knew her: So great a <hi>Lover</hi>
of <hi>her Country,</hi> and the <hi>Interests</hi> of it; as to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to hazard what, next her Conscience, she
the most valued, her good Name, and good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the World, for the preservation of them:
So <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> in her <hi>Mind,</hi> as not to have
once known, no not in <hi>Death</hi> it self, what it was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60624:11"/>
to fear: So <hi>Happy</hi> in <hi>Business,</hi> as to astonish, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than satisfie, those who were the best versed
in it: I say, If to have been deprived of such a
<hi>Queen</hi> as this; and that at such an Age, when our
Expectations were at the highest from Her, be a
loss above the power of Words to express; then
such is our loss: The greatness of which
we are so far from being able sufficiently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that perhaps we cannot yet make a just
Estimate of it.</p>
            <p>But yet, were we not hereby too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
how little we ought to depend upon
<hi>such kind</hi> of <hi>Helps;</hi> I might presume to say, to
the Glory of God, and to our own Comfort,
that we had still enough of these remaining, to
suppress all disorderly Fears, and undue Repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
at that which we have lost.</p>
            <p>God has, 'tis true, removed our <hi>Queen</hi> from
us: But He still continues <hi>his Sacred Majesty</hi> to
us, notwithstanding all the Dangers to which
He has been exposed. He has deprived us of the
Benefit of <hi>Her</hi> Conduct: But he has left us <hi>Him,</hi>
under whom <hi>She herself</hi> grew up in that Wisdom
and Courage, we so much admired in Her.</p>
            <p>And even beyond this, we have the Prospect
of a yet farther <hi>Succession</hi> to fill the <hi>Throne;</hi> and
to support the Interests both of the <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>State</hi> amongst us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60624:11"/>
But yet when all is done, 'tis not upon these
fair and promising Expectations that we must
place our <hi>Trust,</hi> or account the Fortune of our
<hi>Publick Welfare</hi> to depend: But it is that <hi>God,</hi>
who has so long and wonderfully defended us,
that must still be our <hi>support;</hi> or all <hi>these Helps</hi>
Nothing to us.</p>
            <p>Indeed these are the Persons by whom we
justly may, and therefore accordingly do <hi>Hope</hi>
to be <hi>Protected</hi> and <hi>Defended.</hi> And a singular
Happiness it is to us, that we have such a fair
<hi>Succession</hi> of the <hi>Royal Family</hi> before our Eyes. But
yet when all is done, 'tis from the Blessing of
<hi>God</hi> in preserving these Persons to us, and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Endeavours, that we must look for
safety: And <hi>God,</hi> even without any such <hi>Helps,</hi>
could, if He pleased, <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>protect</hi> us. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As these Considerations should move
us, not to <hi>put</hi> our <hi>Trust</hi> in any <hi>Humane Help;</hi> so
should they keep us from being very much <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised,</hi>
if at any time such kind of <hi>Helps</hi> shall
chance to <hi>fail</hi> us.</p>
            <p>It was a Great Expression, and argued a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Mind, in Him anciently, who being told of
the Death of his Son, pass'd it off with this only
Reflection; That <hi>He always knew that He was
mortal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60624:12"/>
And the same should be our Consideration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these Occasions. We know that all <hi>Humane
Helps</hi> are Transitory and Uncertain: And why
then should we stand amazed, as if some strange
thing had happen'd to us, when we come to be
Deprived of that, which we always knew we
had no security of.</p>
            <p>I am not so unsensible of the loss we have
now received, as not to think that we ought to
pay a very just regret to it; and to consider se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
with our selves, for what Sins of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
especially it is, that <hi>God</hi> has taken away from
us our <hi>Royal Defender.</hi> But yet I cannot think
that it ought to be any great <hi>Surprize</hi> to us: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be some new Calamity to see a Mortal
Die, and to find that to have happen'd to One,
which happens to Thousands every day.</p>
            <p>Nay, but <hi>Thirdly;</hi> We ought not only not to be
<hi>Surprized</hi> at the failure of such kind of <hi>Helps,</hi> but
neither should we be <hi>immoderately Concern'd</hi> and
<hi>Cast down</hi> at it: Because <hi>God</hi> is never the less <hi>Able</hi>
to <hi>preserve</hi> us for the loss of these; but can either
<hi>raise</hi> us up <hi>New Supporters,</hi> or <hi>save</hi> us without <hi>Any,</hi>
if He rather sees fit so to Do.</p>
            <p>I am verily perswaded that we have at this
time received as sensible a Blow, in this respect,
in the Loss of our <hi>Royal Sovereign,</hi> as could have
befallen us in any One Life, excepting that of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60624:12"/>
His <hi>Sacred Majesty.</hi> But yet far be it from me
so far to <hi>despond,</hi> or to <hi>distrust</hi> the <hi>Providence</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> as to think we must needs be <hi>ruined,</hi> because
our <hi>Queen</hi> is taken from us. This were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to confine too much the Power of <hi>God,</hi> and
to give too great an Advantage to our Enemies;
who because they earnestly wish our ruine, are
therefore ready, upon every Occasion, to flatter
themselves that the time is coming which they
so much desire to see.</p>
            <p>But to shew you how little Reason either we
have to be dejected, or They to exalt their
Hopes, on any such Account; Let us suppose the
Case to be as bad as the most Melancholy mind
can fansie, or our most bitter Enemies could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it to be. That we were indeed left Naked
and Destitute of all <hi>Humane</hi> Help; and had
no prospect remaining of any succour, much less
had so good a one, as I have before shewn; and
as it is evident to all the World that we have:
Yet still I say that all this would not be enough
to warrant us to <hi>Distrust God;</hi> but rather,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We should then more especially <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
upon his <hi>Help,</hi> when all Other <hi>Supports</hi> do the
most fail us.</p>
            <p>It is too common a thing with most Men,
when their Affairs go smoothly on, and all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
according to their Expectations; to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60624:13"/>
attribute too much to their own Power and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and to forget that <hi>God;</hi> without whose <hi>Help</hi>
all their own Endeavours would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
And therefore to prevent this, <hi>God</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
oftentimes to suffer Men to fall into great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
not that he designs their ruine, but only
to make them sensible of their Own Weakness;
and to draw them back to him who is their only
sure <hi>Defence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal xviii 2. lxii. 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Rock</hi> of their <hi>Salvation,</hi> in whom
they ought to <hi>trust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were an easie Matter for Me to confirm the
truth of this Remark in a multitude of <hi>Instances;</hi>
from whence it may appear, that <hi>God</hi> has in all
Ages then especially exerted his Power in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of his Servants, when their Enemies have
thought themselves the most secure of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
But I shall content my self with a few
Examples; tho' such as I am perswaded, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
suffice to shew, How <hi>false</hi> a <hi>Conclusion</hi>
Men make, when they presume to determine;
That because <hi>God deprives</hi> any <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>present,
visible Means</hi> of <hi>Deliverance,</hi> therefore he designs
to <hi>give</hi> them <hi>up</hi> to <hi>Destruction.</hi>

            <p>When <hi>Haman</hi> projected the Universal Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole People of the <hi>Jews;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esther iii. 6. 12, 13.</note> and was
come so near to an Accomplishment of it, that
the Order was signed, and the Command gone
forth for a General Massacre of them; Who could
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60624:13"/>
have imagined any other, but that the final ruine
of that poor Nation was at hand.<note place="margin">Chapters v. vi, vii, viii.</note> And yet by
what a strange concurrence of unexpected Events
were they delivered from his danger, and the
Mischief turn'd upon his Head who had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their Destruction?</p>
            <p>Nor was their Preservation afterwards less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,<note place="margin">Joseph. Ant. l. xviii. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11. De Bell. Jud. Lib. i. cap. 17.</note>
when <hi>Caligula</hi> sent <hi>Petronius</hi> into <hi>Syria,</hi> to
set up his <hi>Statue</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and
the <hi>Jews</hi> resolved, every Man of them, to perish,
rather than submit to so abominable a Profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Holy Place.</p>
            <p>It were too long for me to relate to you, how
far <hi>Petronius</hi> insisted upon the putting of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in Execution; and what he did in order
thereunto. It shall suffice to say, that his Army
was drawn together, and all just ready to come
to the last Extremity: When the <hi>Governour</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how sad a thing it would be to root out
a whole Nation for so small a Matter, stopp'd his
Souldiers, and wrote the <hi>Emperour</hi> an Account
both of what he had done, and how Averse he
found the <hi>Jews</hi> to his Design; and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him not to pursue his Attempt any
farther.</p>
            <p>But in vain was this delay; nor could any of
these Remonstrances alter the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But on the contrary, He renew'd his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60624:14"/>
Orders yet more peremptorily, of having the
<hi>Jews</hi> destroy'd for opposing his Will; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Petronius</hi> himself to be murdeed with
Them, for deferring so long the Execution of
his Orders.</p>
            <p>And now, What could be expected by that
Miserable <hi>People,</hi> but ruine and desolation?
When behold! <hi>God</hi> took their Cause into his
Own Hand: And so disposed Matters, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this <hi>Second Command</hi> could reach <hi>Syria,</hi> the
News of the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s own Murder flew thither;
and saved both the <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Them</hi> from that
Destruction, which was just ready to break in
upon Both.</p>
            <p>So able is <hi>God,</hi> when things seem to be at the
very worst, to interpose his Hand; and to <hi>save</hi>
those who <hi>trust</hi> in <hi>Him,</hi> not only without any
Visible Means, but against all Humane Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.
And for yet fresher <hi>Instances</hi> of this,<note place="margin">See their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story written by <hi>Gilles, Leger, Morland,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Let
me only desire you to reflect how strangely <hi>God</hi>
has preserved, for several Ages together, those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Reformed Churches</hi> in the <hi>Valleys</hi> of <hi>Piedmont;</hi>
notwithstanding all the Power and Malice of
their Enemies to root them out.</p>
            <p>It is but a very little while since we saw them
reduced to so wretched an Estate, that we accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to have been dispersed beyond all Hope
of any future Restitution. Their own <hi>Prince,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60624:14"/>
supported with the Power, and led on by the
Example and Encouragement of a mighty
Neighbouring <hi>Monarch,</hi> had resolved upon their
ruine. Sorrow and Distress encompass'd them
on every side, and from whom to expect a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
they could not tell. And yet, lo!
these very <hi>Churches</hi> are again already restored to
their ancient Splendor: And to encrease the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
are now Protected by that very Power that
before Destroyed Them.</p>
            <p>But what need I lead you into <hi>foreign Countries</hi>
for <hi>Instances</hi> to shew, that <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>confined,</hi> in his
Workings, to <hi>Humane Appearances:</hi> But often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is then the most ready to support his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
when all other <hi>Helps</hi> the most fail Them.
Our <hi>Own Country,</hi> and our <hi>Own Church,</hi> ever since
the <hi>Reformation;</hi> has been more or less a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Evidence of the truth of this Remark.</p>
            <p>How melancholy was the Prospect which our
Forefathers had, at the untimely Death of that
most excellent <hi>Prince,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Sixth?</hi>
When <hi>Queen Mary</hi> being set upon the Throne,
nothing was to be expected by Them, but an
utter Extirpation of all that seemed in any wise
to favour the <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> among Them.</p>
            <p>What she did,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s Hist. of the Reform.</note> and How far she went, in a
few years, to blot out all the Memory of her
Brother's Piety, I shall not need to say: The
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60624:15"/>
History is still fresh in all your Memories. Yet
in the midst of all their trouble; when the Hope
of their Enemies, and their own Fears were at the
Highest; it pleased God upon a sudden to take
off that <hi>Queen,</hi> and put such an End to their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
as nothing else could have done.</p>
            <p>But though by this means therefore we were
secured against their open Violence, yet <hi>God</hi> still
permitted them to endeavour, by secret Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to carry on their Designs against us: And Has
by that means furnish'd us with yet more En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
to relie upon his Protection; who has
so often, and wonderfully delivered us from
their Devices.</p>
            <p>Witness the many subtle and barbarous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
that were made by Them upon the Life of
<hi>Queen Elizabeth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Foulis<hi>'s Popish Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> l. vi c 4. l. vii. c. 3. ad finem.</note> The Open Force, and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Disturbances which they raised up against
Her. And yet in all these they miscarry'd; and
in many of them so signally, as plainly shew'd
the Hand of God was against them.</p>
            <p>When that <hi>Queen</hi> was gone,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Foulis, ib. l x. c. 2.</note> and <hi>King James</hi>
settled upon the Throne, it was but a little while
before they return'd to their Old Malice, but in
a New Way; and that such, as all the Cunning
of Hell had never before contrived; I mean
that of the <hi>Gun-powder Conspiracy.</hi> And that too
was discovered after a most wonderful manner,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60624:15"/>
and at a most Critical juncture, when all was
just come to the Point of Execution.</p>
            <p>I might add to these Examples, the Happy
<hi>Restauration</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> after
the fatal Murder of <hi>King Charles the First.</hi> Their
frequent disappointments since; but especially
that of the <hi>last Reign.</hi> But I think I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
given you <hi>Instances</hi> enough to Convince you,
that were we now left in as <hi>Bad</hi> an <hi>Estate,</hi> as bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be <hi>God!</hi> we are in a very <hi>Good One:</hi> Yet still
whilst we <hi>held firm</hi> to our <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
our <hi>Trust</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> there would be no
Cause for us to Despond: Seeing <hi>God</hi> can defend
us without any <hi>Humane Help;</hi> and, as I have now
shewn you, has often done it, when we <hi>could</hi>
have been <hi>Protected</hi> by <hi>None</hi> but <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this brings me to the next thing I have to
observe from the foregoing Discourse; and that is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly;</hi> That we should therefore be sure <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
to <hi>depart</hi> from our <hi>Trust</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and then we
may be confident we shall not be <hi>Forsaken</hi> by
<hi>Him.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> loves to be <hi>Depended</hi> upon; and has
seldom been known to <hi>fail those,</hi> who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<hi>stuck</hi> to <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A notable <hi>Example</hi> of which we have in the
<hi>History</hi> of the present <hi>Psalm,</hi> and which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
tell us was this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60624:16"/>
When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had given leave to the <hi>Jews</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to rebuild their <hi>Temple,</hi> and
restore the Worship of <hi>God</hi> in it; the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
a sort of mix'd People,<note place="margin">2 Kings xxii. 28, 29, 41.</note> 
               <hi>Half Jews,</hi> and <hi>Half Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi>
so wrought with their Adversaries, that
little was done in it, notwithstanding all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that was shewn them by that great <hi>Monarch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No sooner was <hi>Cyrus</hi> gone, and <hi>Cambyses</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon his Throne; but All Hope seemed ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
lost to them, of either restoring their <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
or regaining any part of that Liberty they
had before been encouraged to expect.</p>
            <p>But what then was their Behaviour on this
Occasion? Did they <hi>distrust God;</hi> and give way
to such Fears as the Insolence of their Enemies, and
their own Circumstances, did indeed but too
much expose them to? On the contrary, it was
at this very juncture of time,<note place="margin">So the lxx. and Syriac, and other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Versions, in the Title of this Psalm.</note> that those two great
Prophets, <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah,</hi> composed the
<hi>Psalm</hi> we have now before us: And exhorted the
People not to consider the ill-prospect which,
according to Humane Appearance, their Affairs
were in; but to <hi>trust</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> who whenever he
pleas'd, could turn all things to their Advantage,
and no doubt in his due time would do so.</p>
            <p>And what was the issue of this Excellent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?
Why in a very few Years <hi>Cambyses</hi> died,
and <hi>Darius</hi> came into the Throne; and in despite
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60624:16"/>
of all that either their <hi>Half Brethren,</hi> or their
<hi>Open Enemies</hi> could do to hinder it, so encouraged
the Work, that both their <hi>Temple</hi> and their <hi>City</hi>
were Re-built; and themselves restor'd both to
their <hi>Liberty</hi> and to their <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if to <hi>Trust</hi> in <hi>God</hi> be able to work such
wonderful Effects as these; How much more
may we promise our selves from it, who have
so fair a Prospect before our Eyes; if we do but
firmly <hi>rely</hi> upon <hi>Him,</hi> and not suffer any thing
to <hi>shake</hi> our <hi>Confidence</hi> of <hi>his Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, <hi>Sixthly;</hi> and to Close all: That
our <hi>Hope</hi> may be sure to have its due effect, let
me add finally; That we must not think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
barely to <hi>trust in God;</hi> but must take Care
withall to <hi>live</hi> so, that we may be, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<hi>worthy</hi> of his <hi>Protection.</hi> We must to the
<hi>Purity</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> add the <hi>Reformation</hi> of our
<hi>Manners;</hi> and then we may securely defie our
Greatest Enemies to do us any Mischief.</p>
            <p>And because <hi>Examples,</hi> in these Cases, are not
only more Instructive than Precepts, but more
apt to Perswade too; and that this is all that
now remains to us of that noble Pattern, which
was wont to shine so brightly in all our Eyes; to
reflect upon Her Piety, and by that to learn how
to improve our Own: I will conclude All with
a few Remembrances of what our late Blessed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60624:17"/>
               <hi>Sovereign</hi> Did, to shew you what we ought to
Do. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Since <hi>Good-Nature</hi> is, I think, by All al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be one of the best Preparations to the
<hi>Divine Grace;</hi> I shall in the first Observe it as a
singular part of the Felicity of <hi>Her sacred Majesty,</hi>
that she enjoy'd all that is properly understood
by that Phrase, in as high a Perfection, as, it may
be, any Person in the World ever Did.</p>
            <p>Her <hi>Temper</hi> was naturally Sweet and Chearful;
Easie to her self, and Acceptable to all others.
And if that Old Rule of the <hi>Jews</hi> be <hi>true,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. R. D. Kimchi, <hi>in</hi> 1 Sam. x. 5. &amp; 2 Kings iii. 14, 15.</note> That
the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> loves to <hi>dwell in a quiet and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Breast;</hi> I may be bold to say that Her Soul
was always in a disposition for that <hi>Blessed Spirit</hi>
to descend upon it, and to abide in it.</p>
            <p>To improve this Excellent <hi>Temper,</hi> she had a
Greatness and Generosity of Mind, equal to her
Rank and Quality: Free from Jealousies and
Suspicions, as she was from Fear of Any. In a
word, Clear of all those Passions which Agitate
<hi>lesser Souls,</hi> and keep them in a continual Hurry
and Distraction.</p>
            <p>Thus was she prepared by <hi>Nature</hi> for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Progress which she afterwards made
in <hi>Christian Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> And as St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells
us to Those, to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi>
heretofore;<note place="margin">Acts xiii. 48.</note> That <hi>as many as were Ordain'd to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60624:17"/>
Eternal Life, Believ'd;</hi> that is, such as were in
their Tempers and Dispositions Fitted and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
for the Reception of what He deliver'd to
them: So may it no less truly be said of <hi>Her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majesty</hi> that She was, in like manner, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to Eternal Life;</hi> and therefore made such
vast Attainments in all those <hi>Graces</hi> that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to bring Her to it.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly:</hi> To this first Advantage, it
pleased <hi>God</hi> to add as great an Eminence of, what
we usually call, <hi>Good Parts;</hi> as I believe has ever
been known in any of Her Sex. Her <hi>Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
was <hi>Quick</hi> and <hi>Piercing;</hi> Her <hi>Judgment, Deep</hi>
and <hi>Correct:</hi> Nor could any thing almost be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to Her, but She was presently ready with
all Clearness to Receive it, and with no less Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy
to Pronounce and Determine concerning
it.</p>
            <p>And when such was Her <hi>Capacity,</hi> it is not to
be wonder'd if She soon came to a right Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the Design and End of Christianity:
And was thoroughly convinced of the mighty
Concern which there lay upon Her, to live in an
exact Obedience to its Commands.</p>
            <p>But this was not all the Advantage She had in
this respect: For though Her <hi>Parts</hi> were such, as
would, with a very moderate Exercise, have
carried Her into a Perfect Knowledge of Her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60624:18"/>
yet She did not rely upon them: But to
Her natural Abilities, added such a Care and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
to Improve Her Understanding, and to
Enflame Her Affections, in all such things as
seemed any way to referr to it; as Few in a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Station have ever done.</p>
            <p>To pass by Her constant <hi>Attendance</hi> upon the
<hi>Publick Service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and those Opportunities of
Instruction which She provided for, on all the
more solemn Returns of it. To say nothing of
Her frequent and useful <hi>Conversation</hi> with those
who Ministred unto Her in <hi>Holy Offices.</hi> What a
large Proportion of Her Time did She every day
spend in Her own <hi>Private Retirements?</hi> And of
which no Business, no Ceremonies, much less
any vain Pleasures or Avocations, could ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
Her.</p>
            <p>What vast Numbers of Excellent Books did
She there read? And that not lightly, or superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
but with the severest Care and Reflection?
And how cautious was She, if any Difficulty chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to arise to Her in Her Reading, which She
could not presently resolve to Her own satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to be sure to call in some of those who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
on Her, to clear it to Her?</p>
            <p>Nor did She in Her <hi>Reading</hi> run lightly off
from Book to Book; the common Method of
Empty and Unsettled Minds; tho' She read over
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60624:18"/>
a great Many. But when She met with any
Discourse that seem'd particularly to Affect Her,
or Otherwise to come up in any peculiar manner
to Her own Circumstances; She stuck closely to
it: And by so doing, evidently shew'd that Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Instruction were indeed the Ends She aim'd
at in this Exercise: That She read for Profit, not
Curiosity; and sought for Use, not Diversion,
in it.</p>
            <p>Such was Her Care to get Instruction: And
the same Excellent Disposition that moved Her
thus diligently to inform Her self in all the Parts
of Her Duty, engaged Her yet more, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To
desire with all imaginable sincerity to be made
Acquainted, with the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Genuine Measures</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>It is the Folly of Many, but especially of Great
Personages, that they cannot endure Correction;
nor will bear to have the Truth spoken freely to
them, in such Instances as are contrary to their
own carnal Desires and Affections. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that they seldom know either Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or their Duty; either what they Ought
to do, or what their State and Cdndition is with
relation thereunto.</p>
            <p>But this was not the Case of that Admirable
Person of whom we are now speaking: She
Knew How dangerous an Instrument of the Devil
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60624:19"/>
               <hi>Flattery</hi> is, and How fatally Her Station exposed
Her to it: And She took care for nothing more
than to secure Her self against the danger of it.</p>
            <p>I shall never forget with what weight of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and sincerity of Concern, I have sometimes
heard this Great <hi>Queen</hi> represent the danger which
<hi>Princes,</hi> above all Others, are apt to run in this
Respect. And with what Earnestness She has
exhorted those about Her, to deliver to Her the
plainest Truths; and with all Freedom to tell
Her if they had Observed any thing Amiss in
Her Conduct, that she might amend it.</p>
            <p>O wonderful Condescension! A sincerity of Piety
beyond Exception! And that in a place where
there are usually but too many Temptations to
Pride and Self-Opinion: And it must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be an Argument of a more than Ordinary
Wisdom and Integrity, to be able to withstand
the Force of them.</p>
            <p>But yet still All this is only the Preparatory,
tho' indeed a very Good one, to that which I
am especially to observe to you, and that is,
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> Her sincere <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> And for
that, give me leave to say thus much; That if
a <hi>Constant Attendance</hi> upon all the <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
both in Publick and Private: If such a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
at them,</hi> as shew'd her Soul to be wholly
fix'd on what she was about; and was enough to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60624:19"/>
have raised a Spirit of Piety in all that beheld
Her: If the influences of this Devotion upon
Her whole Life and Conversation, and those so
Eminent as to speak Her not only Good but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent;
an Ornament to the Court, and an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to Her Religion: If all this may suffice to
shew a Mind wholly consecrated to the service of
God, and the discharge of Her Duty; then was
the <hi>Soul</hi> of this <hi>Blessed Princess</hi> unquestionably so;
and that, for ought I know, beyond Any that at
this Day remains behind Her.</p>
            <p>But for the clearness of Her Conscience in the
discharge of Her Duty, besides what we Saw and
Admired in Her; two Arguments there are that
may especially be offer'd, and I think ought not
to be passed by. <hi>First;</hi> That while She lived,
She was always Easie in Her own Mind: And
which since it could not proceed either from any
Ignorance of Her Duty, or Unconcern'dness for
it; We must conclude it did arise from a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
that She did live according to the tenour
of it. And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That when she came within
the prospect of <hi>Death,</hi> and knew how near She
was to it, She still appear'd Unconcern'd at it:
And thereby gave a finall Evidence that She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Her self prepared for it, and therefore
was not afraid of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60624:20"/>
I should too far Exceed the bounds I am here
confined to; should I enter upon the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those <hi>Particular Vertu's,</hi> which seemed to
Shine in a more especial Manner, above All O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in Her. Bur two there are which I must
not Overlook; and Those are, Her true <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
amidst all the Temptations of a Court and
Crown to the contrary; And Her extensive
<hi>Charity:</hi> Such as sometimes deprived Her even of
the means of exercising of it; And might have
abundantly satisfied any Mind but Hers, who
knew no end of <hi>Doing Good;</hi> but has, after all,
been seen sometimes, even with Tears, to regret,
that she could do no More.</p>
            <p>But I must restrain my self; and set some
bounds to my Reflections, tho' my subject is
beyond Any. And for the rest content my self
with satisfaction to Remember, what I was
wont with Wonder to Behold.</p>
            <p>And, Oh! That it would please God that both
You and I might so effectually Meditate upon
these Things, as to form our Lives according to
Her Example! And become now the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of our great Queen, as we have hitherto
been Her Subjects!</p>
            <p>This will be the best Offering we can pay to
Her memory, who while there is any Sense of
Goodness remaining amongst Us, must never be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60624:20"/>
mentioned without Honour. This is that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of our Great Loss, which our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
expects from Us; what our Souls call for:
And what, if she has yet any Knowledge of what
is Done here below, our <hi>Royal Soveraign</hi> will,
above all things, be the best pleased withall.</p>
            <p>And if we thus improve the Memory of Her
Vertu's, we shall be even Gainers by Her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.
Such a demonstration of our Love and
Honour to our <hi>Royal Mistress,</hi> will do more to
Establish our Tranquility, than any Human
Conduct or Prudence could have done without
it.<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27.</note> It will engage <hi>God</hi> on our side: And, <hi>if
God be for us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 31.</note> we need not fear <hi>who can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then, as we have now paid our just Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to the loss of this <hi>Blessed Saint,</hi> so from
henceforth resolve to make this farther Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it. Let us thank God, that tho' He
has removed One great <hi>Supporter</hi> from us, He has
yet left us Another; And, Our present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
consider'd, the more necessary One to us,
in the Person of <hi>His Sacred Majesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us strengthen his Hands both by our <hi>Piety</hi>
towards <hi>God;</hi> and by our <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>Him:</hi> By
<hi>Uniting</hi> now all that <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> in <hi>Him
alone,</hi> which we before paid to <hi>Both Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60624:21"/>
Let us consider his Courage; and as far as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Piety or Prudence will allow us, Let us
<hi>Trust</hi> in his Fortune: That is to say, as far as
any <hi>Human Help</hi> may be <hi>Trusted</hi> in.</p>
            <p>But yet still let us Remember, that our <hi>Last
Dependance</hi> must be upon <hi>God:</hi> Who as He has
<hi>hitherto preserved</hi> us, so will He <hi>still go on</hi> to <hi>Save</hi>
and <hi>Defend</hi> us; if we do but <hi>firmly Adhere</hi> to Him,
and <hi>Prepare</hi> our selves for His <hi>Favour,</hi> as our <hi>Duty
Requires;</hi> and as I have now shewn you, in a
most <hi>Illustrious</hi> Example, we <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Ought</hi>
to <hi>Do</hi> it.</p>
