            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98876:6"/>In which words of our Saviour, there are two
things <hi>supposed,</hi> and a third is <hi>taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First of all it is suppos'd, that All to whom
the words are spoken, either <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to be,
Christs Disciples. And that not only in <hi>profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
but in <hi>singleness</hi> of heart; not only <hi>verbally,</hi>
and by name, but very <hi>really</hi> such. This is easily
collected from three words in the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Ye are my Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the second place it is suppos'd, that such
as are <hi>really</hi> Christs Disciples, (not in shew, but
in substance, not in hypocrisie, but in deed) ought
to endeavour to make <hi>it known to all THE
WORLD,</hi> that they are <hi>such.</hi> Their <hi>light
must shine before men,</hi> by their <hi>Procope</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi>
in the <hi>SCHOOL</hi> of Christ. This is apparent
from two words more, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>All
men shall know it.</hi> And were it not so in good
earnest, their Master would never have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
them (as here he doth) to the infallible
meanes of its attainment. For</p>
            <p>Mark attentively in the third place, the most
important <hi>Lesson</hi> which here is <hi>taught,</hi> (and
which is <hi>now</hi> of all Lessons the most worth
learning, especially if we reflect on the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Occasion</hi> of this <hi>solemnity,</hi>) by what certain
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>way of proof,</hi> ye may make men
<hi>know</hi> ye are Christs Disciples. This is deliver'd
in the first and the last words of the Text,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they shall know it <hi>even by
this, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, If ye beare love to one
another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From these three parts there are just as many
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98876:7"/>
Propositions, into which the Text is very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
dissolv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first is this. That all who are <hi>Auditors</hi>
of Christ, or all to whom he is <hi>revealed,</hi> do
stand obliged by that meanes, to be very <hi>really
his Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second this. That their Discipleship, if
it be reall, will also be <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>exemplary,</hi> so
far forth as to be <hi>known,</hi> and taken notice of by
<hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is this. That the surest <hi>Testimony</hi>
and <hi>proof</hi> of sincere Discipleship under Christ,
and the principal <hi>Instance</hi> or <hi>effect</hi> wherein its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
doth consist, And that which by
Christ is here pronounced as an <hi>unerrable mark</hi>
or <hi>Criterion</hi> of it, is this Divine Qualification of
<hi>mutuall Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this indeed is the proposition, upon which
I have fastned my Meditations, because it is that
which suites best with the principal end of our
present meeting, and that wherein is swallowed
up the <hi>prime Importance</hi> of the Text. Not only
the prime, but the whole <hi>rational.</hi> Importance.
And I verily think you will say as much, if you
duly compare the Proposition, with the <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Emphasis</hi> which is to be put upon the
words.</p>
            <p>For first our Saviour doth not say, Men shall
<hi>guesse</hi> or <hi>conjecture</hi> that ye are mine, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
they shal <hi>know</hi> it. Nor 2ly doth he say, Your
Discipleship shall be known as a speciall <hi>Secret</hi>
to very <hi>few,</hi> but as the Sun in his <hi>Meridian,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>All men</hi> shall know it. Nor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98876:7"/>
thirdly doth he say, All men shall know that
ye <hi>seem</hi> to be by a Disguise, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that ye <hi>are</hi> my Disciples without a fiction. Last
of all, he doth not say, Your Discipleship shall
be known by such deceiveable Tokens, as your
Assembling your selves in the <hi>House of Prayer,</hi>
your crying out<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 7. 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>Lord Lord,</hi> your <hi>doing<note n="†" place="margin">

in my name,</hi> your being <hi>Orthodox</hi> in Judgement,
and jumping together in <hi>Opinions;</hi> but by <hi>This</hi>
it shall be known, as by a <hi>Token which never fails,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, If ye have Love for
one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must therefore begin with <hi>That</hi> Proposition,
which is last in <hi>Order,</hi> but first in <hi>Dignity.</hi> And
which being as the <hi>Heart</hi> of the whole <hi>Body</hi> of
<hi>Christianity,</hi> deserves to be (like the <hi>Heart</hi> in the
<hi>body</hi> of <hi>man</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Aristot.</note> The first thing
that <hi>lives,</hi> and the last that <hi>dyes</hi> in our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
For can there be any thing in the world
of greater consequence then this, which gives
us a Token whereby to <hi>know</hi> we have an <hi>Interest
in Christ?</hi> and such a <hi>sure</hi> token too, as cannot
possibly <hi>deceive</hi> us? yet even such is that <hi>Love,</hi>
with which I am now to <hi>entertain</hi> you, and
which if you take into your <hi>hearts,</hi> as well as
into your outward <hi>eares,</hi> will (I doubt not) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with it that <hi>peace of Conscience,</hi> which is to all
that feed on it, a <hi>continuall<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 15. 15.</note> Feast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because there is hardly any word that
is more equivocal than <hi>this,</hi> I must needs Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
an Objection, by shewing <hi>what Love</hi> it is
which our Saviour meant, when he appointed it
for the <hi>measure,</hi> by which his <hi>Scholars</hi> are to be
<hi>scann'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

farther yet, A man may do the very things

And yet he may be <hi>frozen</hi> for want of <hi>Love.</hi> So
I collect from the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
            <p>It concerns us therefore to know, what love
this <hi>is,</hi> (having seen what it is <hi>not,</hi>) by which a
man may be known to be <hi>Christs Disciple.</hi> And
the shortest way to know this, is to reflect a
while on the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> For such as was
<hi>his</hi> Love to <hi>us, such</hi> must <hi>ours</hi> be to <hi>Him</hi> and to
<hi>one another.</hi> We have his own word for it in the
verse immediatly before my Text, and <hi>c. 15. v.
10, 12. If ye keep my Commandements, ye shall
abide in my love. (v. 10.) And this is my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
that ye love one another, even as I
have loved you. (v.</hi> 12.) Now we know the Love
of Christ was both <hi>extrensively,</hi> and <hi>intensively</hi>
great; and proposed (in both respects) not
more to our <hi>wonder,</hi> than <hi>imitation.</hi> First it
was so <hi>extensively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Great, as that it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>All</hi> in generall, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10.) <hi>to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

man</hi> in particular, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9.) not to a <hi>world of

the <hi>whole world</hi> without exception, (1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 2.)
without exception of the <hi>ungodly, (Rom.</hi> 5. 6.)
without exception of <hi>enemies, (Rom.</hi> 5. 10.) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception of them that <hi>perish,</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1.)
And so <hi>intensively</hi> great was the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
that it made him empty himself of glory, and

               <hi>obedient

whilst his enemies <hi>sought his;</hi> He in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their <hi>safety,</hi> as they in order to his <hi>Ruine.</hi>
It made him <hi>once</hi> our Priest after the <hi>order</hi> of

            <p>Thus Christ, as our <hi>Master,</hi> hath set us a <hi>Copy</hi>
of <hi>His Love,</hi> to the end that we, as his <hi>Disciples,</hi>
might do our utmost to <hi>take it out.</hi> Our Love
must be so <hi>extensive,</hi> that it must reach even to
<hi>All;</hi> not onely to all our fellow-<hi>Disciples,</hi>
but to all men living upon the Earth; it must
reach unto our <hi>Enemies,</hi> and of them to all <hi>sorts</hi>
too; not onely to those <hi>without</hi> the pale of the
Church, (who do us little or no hurt) even
<hi>Iewes, Turks, Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> for whom
we pray <hi>once a year</hi> in our English Liturgy; But
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98876:10"/>
to our Crueller Enemies <hi>within</hi> the Church, our
particular <hi>Persecutors</hi> and <hi>Slanderers,</hi> for whom
we pray in our Liturgy <hi>three times a week.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the Hypocrites of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> did
constraine the word <hi>Neighbour</hi> to signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a <hi>Friend;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 43.</note> esteeming it <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> and
<hi>Zeal,</hi> to hate an <hi>Enemy.</hi> And some there are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Christendom, who feigning God from all
Eternity to have <hi>hated</hi> more then he <hi>loved,</hi> think
they acquit themselves fairly (and look upon it
in themselves as a <hi>God-like property)</hi> if they are
much <hi>less</hi> inclinable to <hi>love</hi> then <hi>Hatred.</hi> They
know they need not love <hi>more,</hi> then the Saviour

taking it for granted, that he dyed onely for
<hi>some,</hi> they think they need not exhibit their
love to <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such men must be taught, that even our <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies</hi>

a Lesson only to be found in the School of Christ.
But yet how <hi>Difficult</hi> soever, it is not <hi>impossible</hi> to

<hi>reap,</hi> but after the measure that he hath <hi>sown;</hi> He
will <hi>not suffer us to be tempted above what we are

to make it as clear as the Sun at Noon, that by

he speaks of <hi>Love</hi> in a <hi>Christian,</hi> as <hi>Demosthenes</hi>
did of <hi>Pronunciation</hi> in an <hi>Orator.</hi> As if it were
not only the <hi>first</hi> Thing, but also the <hi>second,</hi> and
the <hi>third,</hi> and so indeed the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>All in All</hi> of
a Christian. For mark the words of that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
whom we cannot accuse of <hi>vain,</hi> or <hi>needless</hi>
Repition. <hi>He that loveth another hath fulfilled the
Law</hi> (v. 8.) <hi>All the Commandments of the Law are
comprehended even in this, Thou shalt love thy
Neighbour as thy self</hi> (v. 9.) <hi>Love worketh no evil
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98876:14"/>
to his Neighbour, therefore Love is the fulfilling of
the Law</hi> (v. 10.) Three times in a breath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
so much as a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> love is reckon'd to be
the <hi>Pandect</hi> of all things requisite to make a <hi>Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let any man say within himself, <hi>How can
this be?</hi> Since Gods word tells us, that <hi>so it is.</hi>
And yet I think it is easie to shew you <hi>How</hi> too;
For the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Law morall</hi> doth consist
of <hi>ten Members,</hi> which are call'd the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> or
<hi>ten Commandements of the Law.</hi> The Lord Jesus
hath reduced those <hi>Ten</hi> to these <hi>Two, Thou shalt
love thy God with all thy Heart, And thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as thy self.</hi> On those two <hi>Hinges</hi> the very
<hi>Door</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> doth seem to <hi>turn.</hi> For on those
two Precep-s <hi>hang all the Law and the Prophets,</hi>
(Mat. 22. 40.) But St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath reduced them all
to <hi>One.</hi> For thus he speaks to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>All
the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou
shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> The reason is,
because the Love of our Neighbour (in the high
Degree I here speak of) doth carry along with it,
the <hi>Love of God:</hi> Either of them (saith<note n="*" place="margin">Bene intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentibus utrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que invenitur in singulis. Nam &amp; qui diligit Deum, non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um potest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnere praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientem ut dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat proximum; &amp; qui superne ac spiritualiter diligit proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, quid in eo diligit nisi Deum? <hi>August. Tract. 65. in Joh. à med. Tom.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>Austin</hi>)
is inferr'd by either; for if we really <hi>love God,</hi>
we shall <hi>obey</hi> him when he commands us to <hi>love</hi>
our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and if we really <hi>love</hi> our <hi>Neighbour,</hi>
it is for the <hi>Love</hi> which we beare to <hi>God.</hi> Observe
the Logick, by which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> argues both back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and foreward. <hi>By this we know we love the
Children of God, when we love God, and keep his
Commandements,</hi> 1 Jo. 5. 2. There he argues from
the <hi>first</hi> Table to the <hi>second.</hi> Now observe how
he argues from the <hi>second</hi> to the <hi>first,</hi> and that
two waies, both in the Negative and the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98876:15"/>
In the Negative thus; <hi>He that loveth not his
Brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God
whom he hath not seen?</hi> 1 Jo, 4. 10. <hi>He that shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
up his Bowels of Compassion from his brother,
how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</hi> 1 Jo. 3. 17.
Again he argues it in the Affirmative. <hi>We know
that we have passed from death unto life, if we love
the brethren,</hi> 1 Jo. 3. 14. <hi>Hereby we know weare of
the Truth, and have Confidence towards God, if we
keep his Commandements: And this is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
that we love one another</hi> (v. 19. to
v. 23.)</p>
            <p>Hence you see it is evident, There is not a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Demonstration of our <hi>loving God</hi> with all our
<hi>hearts,</hi> then the loving our <hi>Neighbour</hi> as <hi>our selves.</hi>
From whence it follows, that every <hi>sin</hi> must needs
argue some <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> For if against the first
Table, it is through a <hi>want</hi> of some <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God.</hi>
And if against the second, it must needs be for
<hi>want of</hi> some <hi>love</hi> to <hi>Men.</hi> Again, it follows on
the contrary, that where <hi>Love</hi> is perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
no Commandement can be broken. For,
<hi>loving God with all our hearts,</hi> we shall keep the
<hi>first</hi> Table; and <hi>loving our Neighbour as our selves,</hi>
we shall not fail to keep the <hi>second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have shew'd in the <hi>Great,</hi> I can easily
shew in the <hi>Retail</hi> too, to wit, that <hi>Love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of the Law.</hi> For if we love <hi>God</hi> as we ought
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to do, we shall certainly have <hi>no God but Him.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Much less shall <hi>we worship a Graven Image. We
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> shall not lift up his Name in vain.</hi> Nor shall we fail
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to <hi>keep holy his Holy Dayes.</hi> And if we love our
<hi>Neighbour</hi> as Christ <hi>requires,</hi> we shall be sure to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98876:15"/>
render to every man his Due. And so by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
we shall <hi>honour all our Parents and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
whether <hi>publick,</hi> or <hi>private, Ecclesiasticall,</hi>
or <hi>Civill.</hi> Then for the Neighbour who is <hi>equall,</hi>
or in any degree <hi>inferiour</hi> to us, we shall be sure
<hi>not to injure</hi> him in any kind. From whence it
follows, <hi>we shall not kill;</hi> (for that were to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure</hi>
him in his <hi>Life.</hi>) Nor <hi>commit Adultry;</hi> (for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
that were to <hi>injure</hi> him in his <hi>Wife.</hi>) Nor <hi>steal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
or Plunder;</hi>) for that were to <hi>injure</hi> him in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
               <hi>Goods.</hi>) Nor <hi>bear false Witness;</hi> (for that were

shall not thus injure him either in <hi>Deed,</hi> or in
<hi>Word,</hi> so if we love him as <hi>our selves,</hi> or as <hi>Christ
lov'd us,</hi> we shall not do him any injury, no not
so much as in our <hi>Thoughts;</hi> we shall <hi>not covet,
or be desirous of any thing that is our Neighbours.</hi>

Thus the four Precepts of the first Table, and the
six Precepts of the second; Or if there is any<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 13. 9.</note> other
Precept besides these Ten, they all are briefly
comprehended in this one word, <hi>Thou shalt love,

            <p>And so I hope by this time, we are all of

to the <hi>numbers</hi> of <hi>four</hi> and <hi>seven.</hi> And the
Disciples of <hi>Plato,</hi> by their fancifull <hi>Idaea's</hi> in
the <hi>concave of the Moon.</hi> And the Disciples of

And the Disciples of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as well by the

ye may know the Disciples of the <hi>Scribes,</hi> by their

of all <hi>living creatures.</hi> And the Disciples of

            <p>Whilst I am thinking what proper <hi>Uses</hi> are
to be made of this <hi>Scripture,</hi> the words of
St. <hi>Paul</hi> which he writ to <hi>Timothy</hi> do straight
occur to my remembrance; <hi>All Scripture</hi> (saith
he) <hi>is by divine Inspiration, and is profitable
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98876:16"/>

unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17.
Were there no other Scripture, then that with
which I have entertain'd you, I should think
it very <hi>profitable</hi> for each of those ends, and
esteem the preacher well <hi>furnished for every
good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, it is profitable for <hi>Doctrine,</hi> because it
teacheth such as are ignorant, the true impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which doth not consist
(as some would have it) in our being <hi>born</hi> of
<hi>godly Parents, believing</hi> the History of the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> making <hi>profession</hi> of zeal to <hi>Christ,</hi>
posting up and down from <hi>Sermon</hi> to <hi>Sermon,</hi>

is comprehended under the <hi>Form of Godliness,</hi>
that is, the Image, the Picture, the Counterfeit
of Devotion, (as the word in the<note n="*" place="margin">

it will, yet if he <hi>act</hi> in contradiction to the
Commandements of Christ, that very <hi>acting</hi>
is nothing better, than <hi>a Denial of the Faith.</hi>
And so 'tis call'd by the Apostle, 1 Tim. 5.

               <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>fruits
meet for Repentance.</hi> Whatever some <hi>Mockers</hi>
are wont to say; we finde by the Tenor of the
Gospel, that a material part of <hi>Godliness</hi> is
<hi>moral honesty.</hi> The chief ingredients in a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
life, are <hi>acts of Iustice,</hi> and <hi>works of
Mercy;</hi> than which there was nothing more
conspicuous in the <hi>life of Christ.</hi> The <hi>second</hi>
Table is the <hi>touchstone</hi> of our obedience unto
the <hi>first.</hi> Our chiefest <hi>duty</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> is our
<hi>duty</hi> towards our <hi>Neighbour.</hi> God will have
<hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> to be performed to <hi>one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
before he <hi>accept's</hi> of any <hi>sacrifice</hi> which
can be offer'd unto <hi>himself.</hi> For what saith
our Saviour? <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 23, 24.</note>
               <hi>and there remembrest that thy Brother hath
ought against thee, leave there thy gift before
the Altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to
thy Brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi>
As if he should have said, <hi>Get thee gone, and
be Honest, before thou talk'st of being Godly.</hi>
Now together with <hi>this,</hi> compare St. <hi>Iohn's</hi>
way of reckoning<note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 10</note>. <hi>In this the children of
God are manifest, and the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
whosoever doth not righteousnesse is not of

                  </gap>s. 14.</note>.
<hi>And we know that we have passed from Death
unto Life, because we love the Brethren.</hi> Nor
doth our Saviour say (in my Text) By this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98876:17"/>
shall all men know that ye are my Disciples,
if they see <hi>ye love God,</hi> But by this they shall
know it, <hi>if ye love one another.</hi> Because our
love of one another doth <hi>presuppose</hi> we love
God; which 'tis<note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 20</note> 
               <hi>impossible</hi> we should doe, in
case we love <hi>not</hi> one another. <hi>For he that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his Brother is a Murderer, and abideth in
Death,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Thus ye see how this Scripture is profitable
for <hi>Doctrin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for Doctrin, so also for <hi>Reproof.</hi>
Because it serves to convince us of the small
proportion of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which is to be found
among'st men who are commonly call'd <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
How much there is of the <hi>word,</hi> and how
little of the <hi>thing. When the son of man cometh
shall he find Faith on the Earth?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 18. 8.</note> Yes, store of

shall he finde <hi>Love</hi> upon the Earth? shall he

which worketh by <hi>such</hi> a Love, as is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Obedience?</hi> and the mother of <hi>such</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
as is <hi>impartially</hi> due to the <hi>Law of
Christ?</hi> Alas! how frequent a thing is it, for
Christians to <hi>persecute</hi> their fellow-Christians,
and then to reckon it as the <hi>character</hi> of their
<hi>Discipleship</hi> under Christ? As if they read the
Text <hi>backwards,</hi>

And I must tell you, before I leave it, that the

that every Christian in <hi>particular</hi> hath a full

(as it seems at<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 21.</note>

A true Feast of Love must be for <hi>all comers,</hi> as
