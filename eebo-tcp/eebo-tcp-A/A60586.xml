            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> tends to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Reaſon and
Learning, how it has brought
into the World a better and
more certain knowledg of God and of our
ſelves, how it has advanced the common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
of nature, and has chaſed away with the
clear evidences of its truth thoſe thick ſhades
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101752:4"/>
of error, that had darkned the underſtanding,
and has removed all thoſe prejudices, that
were taken up from ſenſe and a very partial
and deceitful obſervation of things, may be
fully demonſtrated by comparing the former
eſtate of Mankind, before the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
in the fleſh, with the preſent, wherever it is
received in its truth and power. Men before
were led by opinion and conjecture and fancy
only, as to matters of Religion and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of another World: They had fears up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them indeed of a divine juſtice, that would
revenge the violation of the law of nature ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
here or hereafter; and a reflection upon
the ſtrange traverſes and difficulties of life
had taught them to expect another life after
this: but their eyes were dim however, and
they could not ſee far into futurity; they
could have no clear deductions of particular
truths for want of a right knowledg of true
and certain principles: hence it was, that
they were ſo inconſtant and wavering, and
knew not well where or what to fix on. But
<hi>Chriſt</hi> by his appearance and manifeſting the
will of <hi>God</hi> to us,<note place="margin">

is, in reference to <hi>God</hi> and his attributes, the
miſery we are in by ſin, the means of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
from this woful eſtate of life, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the Soul, and the like; which
before thoſe great <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> notwithſtanding
all their vaunts and queſts after learning, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they ſet up Schools and were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
to give names to Sects, had but a very
imperfect knowledg of.</p>
            <p>But while theſe truths were received by
thoſe, that were willing to be taught, and to
ſubmit themſelves to the dictates of reaſon,
and convictions of miracles, which were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to give all poſſible ſatisfaction to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
others, who were reſolv'd before
hand not to be convinced, who had rather
remain in their ignorance and idolatry and
their ſins, then be converted to a new Religion,
and reduced to ſuch ſtrictneſs of life, as that
requires, from their debaucheries and brutiſh
pleaſures, who had rather fall down before a
Statue or a Picture, becauſe their Fathers had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101752:5"/>
done ſo before them, and becauſe it was the
eſtablished Religion of their Country, than
acknowledg and adore a <hi>Crucified Saviour,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it upon the account of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of
<hi>Faith,</hi> without ever examining the weight of
the arguments, that would have enforced them
upon their belief: They could not in the mean
while but acknowledg the happy and glorious
change, that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> had wrought in the
World, how much it exceeds and goes beyond
all the morality of the wiſest and beſt Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and Founders of Republicks, how it not
only laies down rules for the right ordering
of life, but furniſhes its votaries with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to practiſe them; not only ſhews us a way
to walk in, but takes us by the hand and leads
us in it: but the difficulties, it ſeems, that
are to be met with in conceiving ſome of its
myſteries, offended them. This was their
pretence and their plea for their infidelity;
they would have demonſtration for every
thing, they would be taught and convinced
by Syllogiſm, their Pride and their Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and the opinion they had of their own
learning would not permit them to believe.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101752:5"/>
They made their underſtanding the meaſure of
all truth, and what did not ſuit with thoſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and low principles they had taken up, was
ſcornfully rejected by them. <hi>The Jews,</hi> ſaies the
<hi>Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 1. 22, 23. require a Sign, and the
Greeks ſeek after Wiſdom; but we preach Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
unto the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the
Greeks fooliſhneſs.</hi> But how irrational was the
demand of both? for what greater ſign could
there be to the <hi>Jews,</hi> than the fulfilling of all the
<hi>Propheſies</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even to the
minute circumſtances of his life and death, and
thoſe <hi>mighty miracles that ſhewed forth themſelves
in him?</hi> what greater wiſdom could the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi>
pretend to or deſire, than the <hi>wiſdom of
God in a myſtery,</hi> as it is called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7.
than thoſe clear diſcoveries of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and the eſſential perfections of the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
than the admirable contrivances of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of mankind by the ſufferings and
death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Son of God, than the ways
and means of recovering the dignity of our
nature, and of living here like men, and of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
hereafter like Angels? Such a wiſdom, as
will not only gratifie our earneſt deſires and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101752:6"/>
purſuits after knowledg, but will make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
too for ever. Their weak and blear eyes
could not endure ſuch a great light that
brake in upon them,
and therefore they were
deſirous to retire into
the ſhade. They could
not fully conceive and
comprehend them, they
ſeemed therefore fooliſh
and impoſſible notions,
that were owing wholly to
an ungovern'd imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <p>But now after ſo many myriads of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts

ſeverely the principles, on which it is

that men who have been baptized into

the <hi>Son of God</hi> as an impoſtor, and ſide
with the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
as a doctrine not to be endured and embraced,
and make uſe of their very arguments for the
defence of their infidelity? But we know
whence the malice and the infidelity of theſe
<hi>Theiſts</hi> proceed; they have abandoned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to a wicked life, they are immerſed in
ſenſual pleaſures, which they make the only

which is a <hi>Doctrine according to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101752:7"/>

            <p>The <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> do not ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
theſe men, as the ſeverity of its commands.
Theſe they cannot away with, their luſts help
them to arguments againſt the other, and
they content themſelves with little pieces of
Sophiſtry, and think to vindicate the ill courſe
of life, they have taken up, this way. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
conſcience and an ordinary reflexion upon
the works of nature will not permit them, it
may be, to deny a <hi>God,</hi> though they live, as
though there were none: They will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
him, it may be too in a good humour, the
Creatour of the World, but not the Judg and
Governour of it; they look upon themſelves,
as only born to gratifie their ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite;
They declare equally for a liberty of
living and thinking as they pleaſe. They will
have no reſtraint laid upon their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or their lives. <hi>Christianity</hi> is too ſtrict,
and therefore too difficult for them; They

               </hi> Their evil education

the leſs inexcuſable upon the account
of its myſteries, while they acknowledged the
rules and inſtitutions of it to be according to
the higheſt reaſon, and the exaltation of the
humane nature, while theſe men pretend its
myſteries to be therefore incredible, becauſe
the rules of it, which thwart their luſts ſo
much, are ſo ſevere. Little or no good I
know is to be done upon theſe men by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or argument, of which they are ſcarce
capable, who turn all things into Burleſque
and ridicule: They it ſeems are too witty (for
ſo they call their boldneſs and want of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
either to underſtand or embrace the
principles of Chriſtianity; but their ill lives
ſhew, that were they as clear as the principles
of <hi>Geometry,</hi> ſo long as a ſtrict and holy life
is as neceſſary and eſſential to the being of a
<hi>Christian,</hi> as a right and ſound faith, they would
except and cavil at them, and at laſt reject
them; and if the <hi>Goſpel be hid,</hi> be eſteemed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101752:8"/>
after ſo many clear and undoubted revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

            <p>But theſe are wild and extravagant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
of debauched underſtandings and lives,
and only to be confuted by the ſeverity of
laws; and of the two the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion

are the more dangerous enemies, who deny
the truths and myſteries of it, upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

<hi>to watch and ſtand faſt in the faith, and quit our

            </p>
            <p>To evince therefore the unreaſonableneſs of
their pretenſions, I ſhall endeavour in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
diſcourse to make out theſe two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>1. That the great <hi>myſteries</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101752:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ought not to be any way prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the truth of it.</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> requires
us to believe theſe myſteries, upon ſuch
grounds, as we cannot reject, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
violence to our faculties, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that the rejecting and disbelieving
them muſt be unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>1. The great <hi>myſteries</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
and ought not to be any way prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to its truth.</p>
            <p>They who find fault with <hi>Christianity</hi> for
propoſing ſuch great myſteries to our beliefs,
and would have all things ſo plain and obvious,
that they ſhould command and force aſſent,
ſhould firſt trie their reaſon in ſolving the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of nature; and if notwithſtanding all
their labour and toil, after the moſt accurate
reſearches into the nature of ſenſible beings, of
things that we daily ſee and handle, of things
that ſeem to lie level with our underſtanding,
and are no way diſproportionable to it, they
cannot pretend to a perfect knowledg of them,
if the ordinary operations of nature be ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe,
and unintelligible, and theſe depths are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101752:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not to be fathomed, if her ſecrets are beyond
the diſcovery of the moſt piercing judgment
and reaſon; <hi>Religion</hi> with greater reaſon muſt
be allowed to have its myſteries; there being
ſuch a vaſt diſproportion between things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>God</hi> and his nature, and the things of
the world. The contemplation of nature is
curious and uſeful; it is a part of the ſervice
and worſhip we owe to God the Creatour, to
admire his wiſdom and power in the beautiful
frame and order of things, which is beſt done
by enquiring into their natures and properties,
into their powers and operations and qualities,
by examining the curious contexture and the
fitneſs and uſefulneſs of their parts, and there
is nothing in the whole univerſe, but deſerves
to be conſidered, and very much conduces to
this end.</p>
            <p>This is the buſineſs of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and what
contemplative minds labour in the ſearch of,
to diſcover and make out how things were at
firſt made, and are ſtill continued in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to find out their peculiar virtues,
whereby they produce ſuch a variety of effects,
and how they may be altered or improved for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101752:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the farther uſe and benefit of mankind. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of which can be effected, at leaſt but
very imperfectly, and in a way ſcarce tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by acquieſcing in general obſervations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from weak and ſlight notices, without
deſcending to ſevere trials and experiments, or
by relying upon the principles of <hi>ordinary Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi>
that are confeſſedly unintelligible, and
which inſtead of explaining nature, do but
perplex and confound the underſtanding, and
which have nothing to maintain and keep up
their credit, but the authority of a name and
the immoderate love of antiquity. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>hypotheſis</hi> we fix upon, they who have the
deepeſt inſight into nature will be forced to
confeſs, they ſee but a little way, and all that
they can pretend to is but conjecture and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
that when they may ſeem to arrive at
ſome ſatisfaction in the order and connexion of
things, it is very poſſible and likely, that
things may be made and exert their cauſalities
otherwiſe, than they ſuppoſe, be their fancy
never ſo ingenuous, and their reaſon never ſo
profound and ſtrong (for who will be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous,
as to limit either the wiſdom or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101752:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
power of <hi>God,</hi> that he can do no more, or
muſt do what they fancy?) that there are thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of things, that they cannot give any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
account of, and that the more they
ſeek to comprehend the reaſon of things, the
more they are at a loſs, the more they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied,
and the effect of their ſtudy is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but diſorder and trouble of mind.</p>
            <p>Now if we are convinced of the weakneſs
and inſufficiency of our reaſon in our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſpeculations, if it fails us, when we attempt
to give an account of our ſelves, and the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of our minds, and when we have to do
with plain matters of ſenſe, how unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
muſt it be to comprehend and make out
things, that ſtand at that infinite diſtance from
it, to which it bears no proportion? They
may as well pretend that all theſe great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and perplexities, we meet with in the
conceptions of things, ſhould be taken away,
that all men ought to be born compleat Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
and be inſpir'd with the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of things, which they cannot attain to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſeveral years, ſpent in labour and ſtudy, that
nothing ſhould exiſt, but what we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101752:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that the truth and poſſibility of
things ſhould not derive from the will and
pleaſure of <hi>God,</hi> and from that <hi>Idea</hi> he has in
his divine underſtanding, but only take their
meaſures, and be judged by thoſe narrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
we borrow from ſenſe. Men are not
to be diſputed out of the belief of their ſenſes,
that there is no ſuch thing as motion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity
of parts in extended matter, becauſe of
the great difficulties, that attend the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, and things are daily produced and
by degrees arrive at the perfection of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and perform actions ſuitable to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
natures, though <hi>Philoſophers</hi> diſagree in
their opinions, and are diſſatisfied one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and cannot tell how or in what manner
they do all this.</p>
            <p>2. Thus <hi>Nature</hi> has its <hi>Mysteries;</hi> and who will
undertake to explain Secondly, the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of
<hi>Providence,</hi> and account for all thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
events, which have hapned in all ages of
the world; <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the
wiſdom and power of God! how unſearchable are
his Judgments, and his wayes past finding out!
Rom.</hi> xi. 33. It is preſumption to enquire too
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101752:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
buſily into the ends and reaſons of <hi>God</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
with men, as well as impiety to find
fault with them. This ſhould ſatisfie us, that
<hi>God,</hi> who is of infinite perfection, neither does
nor can do any thing, that is unjuſt; that he
governs the World by an infinite wiſdom, that
he permits men to act according to the liberty
of their will; and that they ſtand accountable
to him for the actions of their lives; and that
they are but his inſtruments to bring about his
eternal purpoſes and decrees; and that nothing
comes to paſs without his ordering or foreſight;
and that all thoſe croſs diſpensations are for
wiſe ends, beſt known to himſelf. Why things
are thus, for inſtance, why the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by him to be his peculiar people; why
the coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in the fleſh was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
ſo long; why ſo many <hi>Heathen Nations</hi>
lie yet unconverted, and the like, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
wholly to his divine will and pleaſure,
which is guided by rules of eternal rectitude
and wiſdom. Let it abundantly content us
in all changes and chances of this mortal life,
in all thoſe diſtinguishing acts of Providence,
that are every where viſible between Nation
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101752:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Nation, or between man and man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the outward conditions and ſtates of
being, that <hi>God</hi> will have it ſo. <hi>God is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in his doings with the children of men.</hi> Theſe
things call for our admiration: They are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
not to be enquired into; which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we look, whether up to heaven, or down
upon the earth and ſea, and obſerve what is
done in each, or whether we turn our eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
we ſhall find our ſelves ſurrounded with
wonders, too great for our knowledg, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to baffle and confound our curioſity,
and to convince us, that there is as well an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
diſtance between <hi>God</hi> and us, in reſpect
of wiſdom, as of power. Now would theſe
men have the ſtate of things altered and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and the world new modelled, and new laws
given to mankind, and a new nature too, and
all things reduced to an eaſier order, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by their fancies, that ſo nothing may
be above their capacity and underſtanding?
What is this, but the effect of a fooliſh pride,
that is diſcontented and troubled, that ſo many
things are out of his reach and power, and that
will ſcarce be brought to acknowledg, that <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:101752:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can do, more than they fancy or comprehend?</p>
            <p>3. Beſides, thoſe who object againſt the <hi>insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
religion</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the greatneſs of its
<hi>myſteries,</hi> may uſe the ſame arguments againſt
the principles of <hi>natural religion.</hi> That there is
an infinite being, in whoſe <hi>Idea</hi> is eſſentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
all poſſible perfection, is the voice and
dictate of nature, right reaſon, and conſcience,
and evidenced by the conſtant and uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
order and courſe and frame of the univerſe,
and by the univerſal conſent of mankind, who
have rites and ceremonies of religion, their
Prieſts and their Sacrifices, to whom they offer
up prayers and oblations, to whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
for juſtice when injured, and to whom
they flie for refuge and ſuccour, when they
are diſtreſſed and in danger, as it were by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
and without any deliberation. But
notwithſtanding this evidence and clearneſs
and demonſtration of the exiſtence of a <hi>God,</hi>
they will not pretend to underſtand fully the
nature of the <hi>Godhead.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> is infinite in
eſſence and power, and that all things owe
their being to his will, they muſt be forced to
confeſs, or elſe deny his being, and fancy an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101752:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
infinite ſeries of cauſes, infinite periods of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and an infinite ſucceſſion of generations,
which is abſurd and contradictious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
though they have only a negative no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of infinity. Our underſtandings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach ſo far, as to have a compleat and
comprehenſive notion of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give ſatisfactory accounts concerning the
affections of a natural body, as motion, place,
time; much leſs can it be expected, that we
ſhould do this concerning eternity, immenſity,
or the other neceſſary and eſſential attributes
of <hi>God:</hi> ſo that the difficulty of conceiving
a thing does not any way hinder the truth and
poſſibility of its exiſtence. However the moſt
ſcrupulous and inquiſitive may be ſatisfied,
that there are ſuch attributes, and that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
upon a reflection, not only on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>God,</hi> but on the ſcant meaſures of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
in creatures, it is neceſſary, they ſhould
be above our reach and comprehenſion. As
we may diſcover much in a curious piece of
art, or wonder of nature, as the Load-ſtone,
or any Electrical body: we may find out ſome
virtue in a plant, or mineral, or peculiar ſort
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101752:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of earth; and yet oftentimes after a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſearch, the beſt <hi>Naturalists</hi> are forced to
confeſs, that there is or may be at leaſt a
great deal more, than what they have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>But here, they ſay, that the underſtanding
neither does nor can admit of any thing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible;
and we ſay ſo too. <hi>God</hi> doth not,
and conſequently the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, which
is the <hi>doctrine and revelation of God,</hi> does not
propoſe any thing to us, as the object of our
faith, that is really impoſſible in it ſelf, and
involves in it a perfect and manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
and nothing leſs can or ought to be
judged incredible. But when they pretend,
that no propoſition ought or can be believed
farther, than it may be cleared up to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
by the evidence of natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or of the things themſelves contained in
it, we reject it as an unjuſt and unreaſonable
demand, which will fully appear by ſhewing
the falſeneſs of both parts of the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>1. It is utterly falſe, that nothing is credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but what can be proved and made out by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101752:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reaſon. There are indeed ſeveral degrees of
credibility, according to which the mind does
admit ſome things with a greater eaſe and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
than others. But however be the matter
propoſed never ſo unlikely or unuſual, if the
authority be juſt and good, it muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be pronounced incredible, becauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
it is not fully agreeable to the preſent
ſtate of affairs and practice of the World, or
becauſe I have ſome little prejudice againſt it.
For as in a matter of fact, where there are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
proofs given of a Relators both honeſty
and knowledg, when I have all the aſſurance
in the World, that ſuch a matter is capable of,
and that he could not miſtake in underſtanding
it, and that his words and thoughts do not in
the leaſt diſagree, when I can object nothing
but a groundleſs ſurmiſe, that poſſibly, and for
ought I know, it may be otherwiſe, this will
challenge my aſſent, and be a ſufficient warrant
to me to believe it, whether I have a clear <hi>Idea</hi>
of it or no: for this unlikelineſs and ſeeming
repugnancy of it, may ariſe from my being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of ſeveral circumſtances, the knowledg
of which would render it probable and eaſie:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101752:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo is it in matter of Doctrine; whatſoever is
propoſed by <hi>God,</hi> becomes thereby immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
credible, and my aſſent is rational and
juſt, though the thing be above my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and this I muſt aſcribe to the greatneſs
of the object, and the imperfections of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which neither is nor can pretend to be an
arbiter and judge in ſuch <hi>matters, which are too
high for it:</hi> ſo that before a man can ſafely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
a doctrine, that is revealed, incredible,
and reject it as ſuch, he muſt queſtion the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and veracity of <hi>God,</hi> and maintain, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is poſſible, but what we can comprehend;
and thus under a pretence of caution, betray
the greateſt immodeſty in the world, when he
himſelf believes ſeveral other things, upon the
bare teſtimony of men, which neither his wit
nor curioſity, nor his reaſon can ever be able
ſatisfactorily to make out and demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>2. It is equally falſe, that no <hi>Propoſition</hi>
ought to be believed, but what may be cleared
up to the underſtanding by the evidence of the
things themſelves. The falſeneſs of which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
I ſhall fully evince in theſe three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
by ſhewing</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:101752:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1. That it deſtroyes the nature
<hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It takes away the bleſſedneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardableneſs
annext to it.</p>
            <p>3. It reflects on the Wiſdom and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
of <hi>God,</hi> who may, if it pleaſes him,
propoſe ſuch things to us, and command us
to believe them.</p>
            <p>1. It deſtroyes the nature of <hi>Faith.</hi> To
believe in general, in the proper notion of it,
is to aſſent to things upon the diſcovery and
atteſtation of others, which are not evident and
apparent of themſelves; that is, when I have
no demonſtrative or ſenſible knowledg of
things, I admit and judge them to be true, not
becauſe I either ſaw them, and can aſſure my
ſelf of them by any of my other ſenſes, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are ſo evident to my reaſon, that I
muſt needs embrace them, as a principle or
concluſion in Philoſophy, but becauſe I have
received them from another, who informs me
and gives me this account of them, for whoſe
ſake I aſſent to them as real and certain. By
which it is diſtinguished from ſcience, which
is grounded upon the evidence and clearneſs of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101752:17"/>
the apprehenſion of the reſpective propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
or objects, when things are ſo plain
that they do neceſſitate our aſſent, as that
the oppoſite members of a true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
contradiction cannot belong to the ſame
thing at the ſame time, that equals added
to equals make equals, that in a triangle,
three angles are always equal to two right
angles, and the like. And the like aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and certainty of knowledg is gained,
when we draw concluſions according to
rule and the laws of method from firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which are aſſented to, aſſoon as they
are propoſed, and the terms underſtood;
whence there is an immediate dependance
and connexion of things, and one thing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follows another; Then we are ſaid
to know a thing, when we can run it up to
its firſt principles, can trace its original and
cauſe, and underſtand its effects and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>This diſtinction being ſo juſt and natural,
to call for evidence and demonſtration in
things propoſed to be believed, is to confound
different aſſents of the mind, to turn <hi>Religion</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:101752:17"/>
into Science, to deſtroy the truth of Hiſtory,
and Tradition, and Revelation, and to fall into
<hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> and doubt whether any thing be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
but what we ſee and can prove and
repreſent by a Scheme, and at laſt queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whether our Senſe, and what we call
our Reaſon do not deceive us, or elſe,
which is the effect of a greater phrenſie,
run our ſelves into this groſs abſurdity,
that we are as wiſe as <hi>God,</hi> and that he can
do no more, than what our groſs fancies will
have him.</p>
            <p>That then ſome of the grand articles of
Religion are not ſo clear, as <hi>Propoſitions in
Metaphyſicks</hi> or <hi>Theorems in Geometry,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are not clear at all, cannot be objected
againſt their credibility. They are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as certain and as infallible; nay more
certain and more infallible, if infallibility
may be ſuppoſed to admit of degrees;
but in reaſon, it cannot be expected, our
knowledg of them ſhould be as explicit and
as clear: <hi>Supernatural Truths</hi> are not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be determined or judged of by proofs,
derived from nature or ſenſe; they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101752:18"/>
proofs of their own, as all other arts and
ſciences have.</p>
            <p>To judge of theſe things therefore by our
narrow conceptions, is a moſt falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
way of procedure; and indeed
it cannot ſeem ſtrange, that ſo much <hi>Error</hi>
and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and all that direful train of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,</hi>
in matters relating to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
which have ſo much diſturb'd the peace
of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> ſhould ſpring from this one
abſurd and corrupt principle. Hence it was

we underſtood the manner of their ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences.</p>
            <p>3. It reflects upon the Wiſdom and Power
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101752:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>God,</hi> who may, if he pleaſe, propoſe theſe
things to us and command us to believe them.
For that <hi>God</hi> may do this, who can queſtion?
or deny, that we are as much obliged to give
up our judgments and underſtandings, as our
wills, to his will, to aſſent to any ſpeculation
or truth of doctrine revealed by him, as to any
mode of inſtituted worſhip commanded by
him, or any precept of Morality; and that I
am not to object and throw in my little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
and probabilities, becauſe it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
or in the leaſt, evident to my reaſon,
when the nature of the thing renders it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that it ſhould, or if it did not, yet his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſhould be enough to force my aſſent?
now to fancy, that nothing is or ought to be
credible, but what can be made out and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to the underſtanding by the evidence
of the things themſelves, deſtroyes this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
which has its certainty from, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by, ſeveral of the divine attributes. The
Wiſdom and Power of <hi>God</hi> are both infinite,
and therefore he knows more, and can do more,
than what we poſſibly can conceive: otherwiſe
we muſt equal our little knowledg, which we
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101752:22"/>
chiefly derive from the images and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of things in our minds, and which every
contemptible inſect and vegetable is too big
for, with his; and upon the ſame account, we
muſt fancy our power equal too: which is the
effect of an irrational pride and madneſs, like
that of the <hi>Apostate Angels,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
throw off our dependence upon him,
and deny to yield obedience to his laws, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they do as much croſs our vitious and
corrupt inclinations, as the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of our
<hi>Faith</hi> do our narrow conceptions and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
An infinite underſtanding only can
fully comprehend an infinite perfection; ſuch
a proportion between the faculty and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
being altogether neceſſary: for if it could
be comprehended by a finite intellect, it would
immediately ceaſe to be infinite. How inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
then is ſuch an inſolence! How vain and
fooliſh are ſuch imaginations! and <hi>every high
thing,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſpeaks, extravagant fancies
and conceits, that get into the brain, <hi>that exalt
themſelves againſt the knowledg of God,</hi> which
ought to be captivated and made ſubject upon
the higheſt Reaſon in the World to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101752:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and doctrine of Chriſt: which will appear
by deſcending to the</p>
            <p>2. Second Particular, I propoſed to make
good, that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> requires us to
believe its <hi>Mysteries</hi> upon ſuch grounds, as we
cannot reject without doing violence to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and conſequently, that the rejecting
and disbelieving them muſt be unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>Now the grounds are chiefly theſe two.</p>
            <p>1. That we believe and admit the divine
Revelations.</p>
            <p>2. That we yield obedience and ſubmit
our underſtandings and all the powers of
our minds to the Will of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That we believe and admit divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations;
becauſe <hi>God</hi> is of infinite veracity,
and to deceive is repugnant to the holineſs of
his Nature; there is an utter impoſſibility in it.
Now if we repoſe ſo much truſt and confidence
in a friend, becauſe we have tried him, and
know that he is a man of great integrity, and
that he abhors the very thought of deceiving
any one with the leaſt falſehood, and ſpeaks
exactly according to his knowledg without any
reſerved or ſecret meaning or equivocation, or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101752:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concealing part of the propoſition in his mind
that it may be otherwiſe underſtood than he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it; much more with all the readineſs of
ſubmiſſion of mind imaginable are we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
whatever comes from God, without the
leaſt demur, or doubt, or contradiction. This
an infinite and eternal rectitude does juſtly
challenge from us; for <hi>God</hi> may aſſoon deny
his being, as falſifie his word; ſo that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
goes about to queſtion or disbelieve any
thing that <hi>God</hi> has revealed, will run himſelf
upon one of theſe two groſs and abſurd impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,
either doubt whether <hi>God</hi> himſelf has an
exact and perfect knowledg of thoſe things, he
has propos'd to our belief, or whether he has
been juſt and true to deliver what he knows.
It is a moſt rational concluſion of St. <hi>John</hi>
1 <hi>Epist.</hi> v. 10. <hi>he that believeth not God, has made
him a lyar.</hi> No difficulty then can or ought
to deter me from the belief of a thing, if <hi>God</hi>
has once revealed it; nor can the mind of man
poſſibly deſire a greater ſatisfaction than this.</p>
            <p>2. That we yield obedience and ſubmit our
underſtandings and all the powers of our
minds to the will of <hi>God,</hi> for</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:101752:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1. That there are thouſands of things <hi>de
facto</hi> above our knowledg and conception can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deemed by any, without the higheſt
immodeſty, an unjuſt poſtulatum.</p>
            <p>2. That all or at leaſt moſt of our knowledg
deriving from ſenſe, the more things are freed
and abſtracted from the entanglements of groſs
matter, the more difficult is the conception;
becauſe they fall leſs under the examination of
our ſenſes, from which we receive ſo great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
in our infancy and childhood, which
make that deep impreſſion on our fancies, that
they are not eaſily to be removed.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>God</hi> by virtue of his abſolute dominion
and ſoveraignty may command us to aſſent to
things above our reach, and conception, and
knowledg. <hi>Faith</hi> is not to chooſe its <hi>Object,</hi> no
more than a mans will can preſcribe and ſet
to him a Law, becauſe its whole and only
power conſists in the liberty of obeying or not
obeying of a Law preſcrib'd by a ſuperiour
Power. Whatſoever Doctrine therefore is
delivered and revealed by <hi>God,</hi> becomes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
credible, by reaſon of the authority,
that does accompany it, and enforce it upon
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101752:24"/>
us. The Articles of <hi>Faith</hi> carry along with
them ſufficient motives of <hi>Credibility,</hi> but then
theſe motives muſt not be fetched from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the things themſelves, as if they were to
be ſo evident, that our Reaſon might fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their connexion and dependance, but
from without; that is, my <hi>Faith</hi> is rightly
grounded, and an obligation lies upon me to
believe, what is propoſed by God, if it be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
ſo to be, by juſt and rational proofs;
and if the authority be certain and infallible:
God therefore declaring his Will, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Revelations he has made of it by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power, this latter is a ſufficient proof, and
a juſt and rational ground of my Belief; for
how abſurd would it be for any one, becauſe
he cannot comprehend and make out a thing
fully, which in the nature of it, and by reaſon
of our weakneſs and incapacity, is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible,
and which he ought to acknowledg to
be ſuch, unleſs he will preſume to meaſure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
and graſp Infinity with a ſpan, therefore
to doubt of ſo plain a truth, as this is, that the
divine Power cannot be made uſe of to confirm
any <hi>Propoſition,</hi> but what is exactly true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101752:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo that this is not to forego our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as
the <hi>Socinians</hi> plead, for nothing is more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the principles of right Reaſon, but to act
according to it: and therefore to ſay that we
<hi>Believe I know not what,</hi> if they mean, that the
objects of our Faith cannot be proved to exiſt
with the ſame kinds of proofs, as what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to our ſenſes, or as a propriety may be
demonſtrated of the ſubject of a ſpeculative
Science, this cannot be any prejudice at all to
our belief, becauſe in all Faith, whether Humane
or Divine, there cannot be the ſame clearneſs
and evidence, but that there are ſuch Objects
of our Faith we are as certainly aſſured, as if
we had a particular demonſtration of each.</p>
            <p>Now that the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by ſuch an authority, and therefore are
to be believed by us, and conſequently that the
<hi>Christian Religion</hi> requires our aſſent to no more,
than what is apparent to be <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Will,</hi> we have
this aſſurance, that they were atteſted and made
good by the miracles of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> by theſe
he proved his Commiſſion to be deriv'd from
<hi>Heaven.</hi> This was the belief of the <hi>Jews</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
both Learned and Unlearned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Nicodemus</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:101752:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was fully convinced of the truth and evidence
of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 2. <hi>Rabbi, we know, that thou art a
Teacher come from God, for no man can do thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
that thou doſt, except God be with him.</hi> In
the caſe of the blind man, who was reſtored to
his ſight, the doubt was rational, <hi>How can a man,
that is a ſinner do ſuch miracles?</hi> Joh. ix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. <hi>If
this man were not of God, he could do nothing,</hi> v. 33.
that is, he could not do ſuch things, as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the power of a meer Man, which we ſee
him do. It was nothing, but a moſt unjuſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to our <hi>Saviours Perſon,</hi> and to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Birth and Parentage, ariſing from a
falſe principle concerning the temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> through a miſunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Propheſies, that made them, againſt
their Belief and Conſcience, reject the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſo many evident and often repeated mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
and though they would not acknowledg
him for their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that came in a way of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and meekneſs, ſo oppoſite to their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and expectations, who thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but triumphs and revenge; yet they are
forced to acknowledg, that the <hi>Meſſias could not
do greater;</hi> and laſtly our <hi>bleſſed Saviour</hi> appeals
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101752:26"/>
to miracles, as to his credentials, as being a
moſt rational motive to work faith in the minds
of the moſt ſcrupulous; <hi>if ye believe not me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the works that I do.</hi> This then is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
confirmation of our <hi>Saviours</hi> miſſion, and
of the doctrine <hi>He</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> delivered
from him, and preach'd through the ſeveral
parts of the World, which they travelled, and
after put in writing for the benefit and greater
ſatisfaction of all ſucceeding Generations. Nor
are we now at this great diſtance of time to call
for new ſigns from Heaven, or to deſire a farther
confirmation of what hath been received ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally
for ſo many ſucceſſions of Ages.
The holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the authentick Regiſters
of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and that
I may add this by the way, were they but of
humane authority, they deſerved not to be
drolled upon, but to be treated with an equal,
if not a greater, reſpect, than <hi>Polybius,</hi> or <hi>Livy,</hi>
not only upon the account of their Antiquity,
but for thoſe excellent remarks they contain,
and the <hi>Theiſts</hi> of our Age may as well doubt,
whether there were ſuch a man as <hi>Cyrus</hi> and
<hi>Alexander,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and queſtion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101752:26"/>
whether <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote thoſe <hi>Orations,</hi> and the
other excellent Books, that go under his name,
or <hi>Virgil</hi> thoſe admired Poems, as whether
St. <hi>Mathew</hi> or St. <hi>John,</hi> who were the known
Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and converſed daily with
him for above three years together, wrote
thoſe <hi>Goſpels,</hi> which contain the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi>
of his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe evidences our aſſent is raiſed,
which make it rational and juſt; our Faith is
reſolv'd into the teſtimony of <hi>God,</hi> which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the rule of it, we believe nothing, but what
our Saviour and his Apoſtles taught, for which
we have the authority of their words, and what
the whole number of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> People embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and received, as the juſt and true meaning
of them. Now becauſe we cannot reconcile
theſe expreſs and clear Revelations of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi>
laid down in plain expreſſions, as that
<hi>Chriſt is the ſon of God, was in the beginning with
God, before the world was made, God manifeſted in
the fleſh, God bleſſed for ever,</hi> and that <hi>he and the
father are one</hi> (not to deſcend to the other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which are laid down as clearly) with our
narrow conceptions of things, is moſt irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101752:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to conclude againſt <hi>God</hi> in favour of our
ſelves, meerly for this only reaſon, becauſe we
cannot tell or underſtand, how it can or ſhould
be, when he hath told us expreſly it is ſo. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they heap up ſtrange and abſurd inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and which are impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be true; they deny to words their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and natural and genuine ſignifications;
they fancy nothing but improprieties and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities
of expreſſion; and admit of abſurd
notions for all their high vaunts and pretences
to reaſon, which deſtroy the very deſign and

So far is that from having the leaſt truth in it,
which the Enemies and Oppoſers of this
<hi>Doctrine</hi> affirm, without the leaſt ſhew of

It is but a natural inference, that all our
enquiries into the <hi>Articles</hi> of it be ſober and
modeſt; that we expect not a comprehenſive
knowledg of them; that we be not too buſie
and curious in our Searches into the Secrets
of <hi>God;</hi> that being conſcious to our ſelves
of the defects, and ſhallowneſs, and weakneſs
of our Reaſon in leſſer matters; how imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and untrue oftentimes our collections are
of ſenſible beings, to which our faculties may
ſeem proportionate; and to what errors and
deluſions we are ſubject, by taking up falſe
notions, by fancy and prejudice; we learn
to be <hi>wiſe unto ſobriety,</hi> and <hi>not to think of our
ſelves, above what we ought to think.</hi> It was
nothing at firſt, but an overbold curioſity,
not content with <hi>Revelation,</hi> and with juſt
proofs of it, that raiſed in the mind thoughts
of Diſbelief; but it ſtopt not here; it ſoon
improved into a proud conceit of maſtering
all the difficulties of <hi>Religion</hi> by the ſtrength
of Reaſon; and to this we may juſtly impute
the original and growth of all thoſe <hi>Hereſies</hi>
and <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> that have been vented from
the very firſt Preaching of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to this
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101752:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
day. It is a vain thing to think to do this;
'tis a paſſing beyond the bounds which <hi>God</hi>
and our own Nature hath ſet us; a piece of
Sacrilegious raſhneſs, as <hi>Salvian</hi> juſtly words
it, in his third Book <hi>De Gubernatione Dei,</hi>
ſpeaking of the various diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
<hi>Hoc ipſum genus quaſi Sacrilegae teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis
est, ſi plus ſcire cupias quàm ſinaris:</hi> The
<hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as they are not to be tried,
ſo neither to be proved by the <hi>Principles</hi> of
<hi>Mathematicks</hi> or <hi>Natural Philoſophy.</hi> It is as
great folly to attempt it, as to expect it, both
ariſing from a wantonneſs of Wit, which
quickly looſes it ſelf in a Labyrinth of wild
Opinions, and pleaſing it ſelf with new No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Ideas, is more and more perplext
and entangled, and is ſcarce ever reducible
to a right and ſober temper.</p>
            <p>What ill ſucceſs the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> have had in
their attempts this way upon the Articles of
Religion, <hi>Christendome</hi> has long ſince had ſad
experience of; theſe men guilty of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extream would ſcarce acknowledg any
thing of <hi>Myſtery</hi> in it; all things ſeemed ſo
clear to them, as if they had had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101752:30"/>
Revelation; they have thrown open the
<hi>Vail, that covers the Ark;</hi> they define boldly,
and obtrude their Conjectures for Oracles.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> ſhall be explained and
proved by the Writings of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi>
thus proſtituting the Majeſty of the Sacred
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> and corrupting the Simplicity of
the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> by their niceties and
ſubtilities of Diſtinctions, and expoſing it
the more to the Cavils of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the falſeneſs of their Principles, and
the weakneſs and incompetency of their
Proofs, are more encouraged to reject the
truth of it. Hereby too a <hi>Contentious</hi> and
<hi>Diſputative Theology</hi> has been introduced in the
<hi>Schools;</hi> and unneceſſary and bold queſtions
ſtarted, impoſſible to be reſolved with any
ſatisfaction, which perplex and confound the
Underſtanding, and are ſo far from <hi>Building</hi>
us up in our <hi>Holy Faith,</hi> and from explaining
the Doctrine of it, that it has ſcarce ſuffered
by any one thing more. Some things we
may underſtand, but we ſee more to admire,
which with all our art and ſubtility we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
attain to. It is enough, that the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101752:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Religion</hi> doth perſwade us by Rational
Arguments to the acknowledgment of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that it laies down ſufficient grounds of
the certainty and neceſſity of our Belief, that
it gives us all the aſſurance we can, with any
modeſty, pretend to, and all the proofs the
nature of the things, propoſed to our belief,
are capable of and will bear. 'Tis Faith in
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> that He is the <hi>Son of God</hi> and the <hi>Saviour
of the World,</hi> that denominates us <hi>Chriſtians;</hi>
to deny this, how excellent a Perſon ſoever
we make him for Meekneſs and Holineſs of
Life, is to renounce <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and in effect
to turn <hi>Mahometans;</hi> for they acknowledg
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to have been a <hi>Great Prophet,</hi> to have
been <hi>born of a Virgin,</hi> to have been <hi>aſſumed into
Heaven,</hi> and the like. <hi>Satis ſit pro univerſis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus
Author Deus;</hi> as the ſame <hi>Salvian</hi> has
it. This is that, that is equivalent to ten
thouſand <hi>Demonſtrations;</hi> this will level all
thoſe objections, that are raiſed againſt the
<hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> that will ſilence all
the <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> of <hi>Corrupt Reaſon,</hi> and cut off all
thoſe Arguments, which preſumptuous Men
are wont to make: and certainly if we rightly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101752:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conſider it, the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as
they are propoſed in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are by
reaſon of the great difficulties, that attend
the conception of them, ſo far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
that they ought thereby to become
more credible; that is, they are more worthy
of the infinite Majeſty and perfection of <hi>God,</hi>
by how much they are above the reach of our
Faculties.</p>
            <p>2. Let us remember that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of Godlineſs,</hi> and conſequently that the
<hi>Great Myſteries</hi> of it ought to have an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon our Lives and Practices. As on
the one hand, to ſay, that theſe <hi>Great Articles</hi>
of our <hi>Faith</hi> are nice <hi>Speculations,</hi> and the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Belief</hi> of them, as they are propoſed, not
neceſſary, and to queſtion that Senſe of them,
in which they have always been received by
the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is to undermine the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi>
of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> So on the other ſide,
it takes off very much from the obligation to
Obedience, and dulls thoſe affections, which
a reflexion on theſe <hi>Great Myſteries</hi> muſt needs
cauſe in the mind.</p>
            <p>That <hi>God</hi> ſhould ſend his <hi>Son</hi> into the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101752:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
world to diſcover this Myſtery to us in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and in order to our Redemption, was
the Effect of an <hi>Infinite Wiſdom,</hi> and of an
<hi>Infinite Love;</hi> that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be <hi>Manifested in
the Fleſh</hi> for our ſakes, and ſubmit himſelf to
the weakneſſes, and imperfections, and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies
of the humane nature; that the <hi>Second
Perſon of the Trinity, Co-eſſential and Co-eternal
with the Father,</hi> ſhould condeſcend to aſſume
fleſh, and therein to ſuffer; a reflection on
this cannot but fill us with admiration and
love. One great part of the Worſhip we
owe to <hi>God</hi> conſiſts in our admiring his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Perfections; all our Praiſes and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
are but the outward ſignifications of
this, and faint expreſſions of our thoughts,
which looſe themſelves in the contemplation
of them. Now theſe <hi>Myſteries</hi> afford us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
matter for our admiration. Beſides, what
greater obligation to Obedience can there poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
be, than the Revelation of this <hi>Myſtery,</hi>
upon which our Salvation is founded? A Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Religious Life then is the beſt evidence
of our belief of theſe <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all ſubtility of Diſputation. This eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101752:32"/>
concerns us, who are dignified with
the <hi>Holy Priesthood,</hi> who are <hi>Miniſters of Christ,
and Stewards of the Myſteries of God.</hi> This ſhews,
that we do more than barely aſſent to the truth
of them, when they produce in us all, both
<hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Lay,</hi> theſe effects, for which they
were principally diſcovered; that ſo living in
obedience to the will of <hi>God</hi> revealed to us by
his <hi>Son,</hi> whom he ſent out of his own Boſom,
and in all holy converſation and godlineſs, we
may at laſt be admitted to the ſight and fruition
of his <hi>glorious Godhead,</hi> to ſing Praiſes and
Hallelujah's to the <hi>bleſſed Trinity</hi> for ever and
ever, Amen.</p>

of this Doctrine, which was grounded too

who had to do with them, as falſifiers of the

which they were ſo oppreſſed, out of ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
from which by Tranſcripts it might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

lighting upon ſome of theſe Tranſcripts; which
is to be ſaid alſo for St. <hi>Austin,</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> 3.

had only the authority of ſome of the Antients,

of learning they were not acquainted with in that

more vainly and weakly ſuppoſe, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
made uſe of the ſame <hi>vulgar Latine</hi> edition, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

ſo urged with this teſtimony of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> that they
are forced to make uſe of very pitiful and dis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
arguments to invalidate it. <hi>Socinus</hi> had ſaid
before—<hi>fortaſſe ante</hi> Hieronymum <hi>vix ullus inveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etur,

the falſity of which conjecture, however ſo warily
laid down, has been diſproved; hereby craftily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the citation out of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> he very bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accuſes St. <hi>Hierome</hi> of Forgery, who having got
a Copy or Copies, in which this verſe was added,
<hi>adverſus fidem aliorum omnium exemplarium, tam La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinorum,

publicè eam culpâ &amp; fraude hereticorum abraſam
à vulgatis codicibus fuiſſe.</hi> But St <hi>Hierome</hi> has ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
confuted the falſeneſs and boldneſs of this
Cavil. He was uſed to this kind of language, as if
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101752:39"/>
he had corrupted the Scriptures, but he was no way
moved by it; though this accuſation of thoſe of his
own time perchance may not ſo much be referr'd
to this place, as to his tranſlation in general, and may
proceed not ſo much from heretical malice and
pravity, as envy of ſeveral of his contemporaries,
who were orthodox in the faith, but were no friends
to his new tranſlation. He charges the omiſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe <hi>unfaithful Tranſlators</hi> (queſtionleſs <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Arians</hi>) and upbraids them with it as a
thing manifeſt and notorious, and eaſily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable;
and certainly he would not have made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo obnoxious, unleſs he had grounded his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
upon the authority of ſeveral <hi>Greek Copies:</hi>
with what little pretence of reaſon therefore <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
and <hi>Socinus</hi> fancy St. <hi>Hierome</hi> to have changed
the publick and common reading, let any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
perſon judge. But ſuppoſing that the Copies
of thoſe times varied, which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> grants (and
therefore St. <hi>Hierome</hi> is moſt falſely and unjuſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
by <hi>Socinus</hi> to have been the author of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpolation)
He enquires, <hi>quonam argumento docet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum
ſit rectius, utrumve ſcriptum ſit ab Apoſtolo, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertim
cum quod reprehendit, turn haberet publicus uſus
Eccleſiae?</hi> To this it may be anſwered, 1. that ſome
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101752:39"/>
vitiated and defective Copies, ought not to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
the authority of entire and better Copies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek.</hi> 2. that St. <hi>Hierome</hi> had reaſon
to prefer and vindicate that reading, which gives
ſuch an evident proof of this great Article of the
<hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> agreeable to the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church,</hi> derived down to them by an <hi>univerſal
Tradition,</hi> and acknowledged as ſuch, by all, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a few, whom either diſcontent, or pride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs
of their own parts, and a love of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and of being the author of a Sect, had drawn
into the contrary heretical opinion. Beſides, his
words are ſo clear, that one might juſtly wonder,
that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſhould pretend any difficulty or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
ſenſe in them, as he does in his, <hi>non ſatis video,
quid ſibi velit hoc loco</hi> Hieronymus; but that we have
too juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, how that great <hi>Scholar</hi> was
biaſt and perverted in his judgment, concerning
thoſe great myſteries of Faith; though he is ſo wary
and cunning, as not to diſcover himſelf too open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
He indeed is forced to confeſs the nature of the

with the former verſe to have been

and altered by the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and added to
the former verſe, which is ſaid without any the

has nothing to maintain the fancy, but the great
name of the Author of it.</p>

in the firſt place, that <hi>eo omiſſo meliorem eſſe verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
connexionem,</hi> the connexion is far better, if the
7 v. were omitted, and that therefore it ought to
be ſo, and was antiently omitted; if the ſuppoſition
were true, is not only vain and frivolous, but very
bold and immodeſt to ty the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to ſuch
a way of writing, as pleaſes their humours and
fancies beſt, and ſavours moſt of humane ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,
and by the ſame argument they may reject
not only verſes, but whole chapters in the <hi>N. T.</hi> for
the meanneſs and inaccuracy of the ſtile, and the

2. <hi>Indignum eſt ſummo Deo eſſe testem, inio coram quo

this <hi>witneſſing</hi> is nothing elſe but the declaration of
<hi>God</hi> to mankind by evident ſigns and tokens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our <hi>Saviours</hi> being the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and of
his being born in the fleſh, and that he came from
him. This <hi>God</hi> has atteſted and ſufficiently made
known to the World, and in this ſenſe the Word
often occurs in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> without the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
offered <hi>to the Divine Nature.</hi> The only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
he has for his fancy is a baſe and unworthy
compariſon he conceives in his mind between <hi>Gods</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:101752:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being a witneſs, and mans being a witneſs in our
Courts of Judicature, forgetting the genuine and
eaſie ſenſe of the word, as I have above expreſſed
it. 3. That it is highly probable that this verſe was
inſerted by a <hi>Sabellian,</hi> the contrary whereof is
moſt true. 4. That in ſeveral MSS. and Editions of
modern languages, there is a tranſposition of theſe
two verſes. The ſame before was acknowledged to
be found in ſome <hi>Greek copies,</hi> which no way proves
the pretended interpolation, but only that antient
copies do not all agree. 5. That this v. does very
highly favour the <hi>Arians,</hi> but this is ſuch a ſtrain
of fancy, that he may as well allege the firſt words
of the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to prove <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion
of the eternity of the World. If men out of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate
opinion, againſt the doctrine of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church,</hi> allow themſelves to interpret Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
according to their own fancies, it cannot
ſeem ſtrange to any, that they ſhould go about to
prove and juſtifie their blaſphemies from the
plaineſt texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that in the judgment of
all ſober perſons, who are free from thoſe prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
do moſt evidently refute them.</p>
