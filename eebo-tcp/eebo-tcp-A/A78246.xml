            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>BANGOR,</hi> about <hi>Llanddinam.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Rectory of <hi>Llanddinam</hi> was Anciently divided into two equal Moyeties or Comportions (as they were called) beſides ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſmall Vicarages, and both theſe Comportions, being Preſentative Eccleſiaſtical Livings, were in the Gift of the Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> who is both Patron and Ordinary thereof.</p>
            <p>One of theſe Comportions being in the Poſſeſſion of the preſent Lord Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> fell void by his promotion to that See; and K. <hi>Charles</hi> 2d, <note place="margin">1674</note> who claim'd the diſpoſal of it, <hi>for that one Turn, by Virtue of his Prerogative,</hi> would have Conferr'd it on Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> then, or lately before, a Preacher in <hi>Zealand:</hi> But he being (as is ſuppoſed) unwilling to perform the Conditions required to obtain the Inſtitution, procured the Grant of this Comportion, to be made to Mr. <hi>Spademan,</hi> who had Inſtitution to it in the year Sixteen Hundred Seventy Four, not to his own Benefit, <hi>but in Truſt for Mr.</hi> Hill, as Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> himſelf ſets forth in his <hi>Petition</hi> to the Houſe of Commons, as is mentioned in the Votes of the Fourteenth of <hi>January</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>The other Comportion being fallen void in the Year 1684, <note place="margin">1684</note> Dr. <hi>Humphrey Lloyd,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> took it <hi>in Commendam,</hi> and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Cathedral Church of <hi>Bangor</hi> had not one Penny Revenue to ſupport the <hi>Fabrick,</hi> or maintain the Choir within, ſo that it was maintained only by the Charity of the Gentry and Clergy : And conſidering that the Vicars of <hi>Llanddinam</hi> had but very ſmall Maintenance,<note place="margin">1685</note> procured an Act of Parliament 1. <hi>Jacob.</hi> 2. to veſt both the ſaid Comportions, upon the next Avoidance that ſhould happen in the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Bangor,</hi> not to their own USE, but in <hi>Truſt,</hi> for Increaſe of Five Poor Vicarages upon the Place, and for ſupport of the Fabrick and Choir of the Church of <hi>Bangor,</hi> which was then in great Decay, and ſtill wants very great Repairs.</p>
            <p>This Comportion held by Biſhop <hi>Lloyd,</hi> fell void by his Death, <note place="margin">1688</note> and hath been ever ſince Enjoyed by the Dean and Chapter, and by them applyed entirely to thoſe <hi>Pious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> to which they were appointed by the Act of Parliament, and in ſuch Proportions as the late Arch-Biſhop <hi>Sancroft,</hi> and the then Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> directed; and as they were empowered by the ſaid Act to do.</p>
            <p>The other Comportion became void by Mr. <hi>Spademan</hi>'s not taking the Oaths to the King and the late Queen, <note place="margin">1690</note> of bleſſed Memory, as obliged by the Act <hi>for Abrogating the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and appointing other Oaths,</hi> &amp;c. And is by that Avoidance, Legally and actually Veſted in the ſaid Dean and Chapter, to the Pious and Charitable Uſes aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>But the Poſſeſſion was, and ſtill is detained from them by the Power and Intereſt of Mr. <hi>Hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean and Chapter brought their Ejectment, <note place="margin">1694</note> which coming to be Tryed at <hi>Salop,</hi> there, upon pretence of a Fault in the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were Nonſuited.</p>
            <p>The pretended Fault was, That no Leaſe was Sealed to the Leſſee in the Ejectment, whereas the Common Practice hath been, that Leaſe <hi>Enter</hi> and <hi>Outry</hi> ſhou'd be Confeſſed; but here it was denyed.</p>
            <p>After this the Dean and Chapter brought a new Ejectment, but this was ſtopped by Arts and Amuſements of Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1695</note> in order to delay Proceedings at Law, and to bring this Bill-in-Parliament, to reinveſt the Rectory of <hi>Llanddinam</hi> in Mr. <hi>Spademan,</hi> for the Benefit of him the ſaid Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> which it is Pray'd may not paſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe he never had any Pretention to the Rectory of <hi>Llanddinam,</hi> but to one Share or Moyety of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Tranſaction between Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Spademan</hi> for the firſt Obtaining and Enjoying this Comportion, was by no means Fair and Legal, and tends to over-throw all the Laws againſt <hi>Symony</hi> and for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if one may take a Living, and be Inſtituted to it for the Benefit of another, then he, for whoſe Advantage it is, may ſafely pay Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for obtaining ſuch Living; and he that is Inſtituted, may take the Oath againſt <hi>Symony</hi> ſafely, for he gave no Money, nor knows of none, and yet the true <hi>Symoniak</hi> may enjoy the Profits.</p>
            <p>If one Man may be Employed to take Inſtitution, take Oaths and, make Subſcriptions inſtead of another, then any Papiſt, Socinian, or Jew <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may have the benefit of any of the Dignities or Benefices of the Church, if he can procure any one that will do the ſame Kindneſs; for him, as Mr. <hi>Spademan</hi> did for Mr. <hi>Hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Secret had been known in the late Reign, it is eaſy to imagine what had become of all our Church Preferments.</p>
            <p>Since Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> never had any Legal Title to this Comportion, and Mr. <hi>Spademan</hi> has forfeited his Title alſo (if ever he had any) it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, That ſuch an extraordinary Method as making a new Law, to give him a New Title in Law which at preſent he hath not, will not paſs.</p>
            <p>It is hoped that a new Law will not be made to defeat a <hi>Charity</hi> deſigned for the Increaſe of Poor <hi>Vicarages,</hi> and Maintenance of Ten, or more <hi>Poor Men,</hi> and Youths, and for <hi>Repairing</hi> of a <hi>Ruinous Cathedral,</hi> to which they have a preſent Right, in order to increaſe the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Wealthy</hi> Preacher in <hi>Foreign Parts,</hi> who has already receiv'd the Profits, without any good Right, for 22 Years, amounting to about Seventeen Hundred Pounds.</p>
            <p>It does not appear that Mr. <hi>John Spademan</hi> that took the Oaths at <hi>Hick's Hall,</hi> is the ſame <hi>Spademan</hi> that was Inſtituted to <hi>Llanddinam,</hi> there being no addition to his Name, in the Certificate annexed to Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>'s Petition, ſignifying either his place of Abode or <hi>Calling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor doth it appear, That the ſame <hi>John Spademan,</hi> who was Inſtituted to <hi>Llanddinam,</hi> is now alive; he having never appeared at <hi>Llanddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> ſince the time of his Inſtitution in the Year Sixteen Hundred Seventy four, nor ever attended any Epiſcopal Viſitation, or Dioceſan Synod, which he was as much obliged to do, and as lyable to Puniſhment, for not doing, as any Incumbent in the Dioceſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Paſſing ſuch a Bill as this to reſtore Mr. <hi>Spademan</hi> to what he hath forfeited by not taking the Oaths, may be of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, in the Example, to the Government, and to ſeveral Loyal and Worthy Perſons, who are preferred, and Employed in ſuch Places, as others have forfeited by not taking the Oaths in due time; and ſome that have ſince taken the Oaths, are not Reſtor'd to the Livings which they ſo forfeited; and if the ſaid Comportion had been now a Preſentative Living (as it was when <hi>Spademan</hi> had it in Sixteen Hundred Seventy four) it would have been diſpoſed of ſoon after the Firſt of <hi>February,</hi> Sixteen hundred Eighty Nine, as other Livings a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi> They may <hi>Object,</hi> That it is hard to take advantage of <hi>Spademan</hi>'s not taking the Oaths in due time, he being beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a Weekly Correſpondence between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> no Act paſt here, but was ſoon known there, even to Perſons of leſs Intelligence than Mr. <hi>Hill;</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Prints give Weekly Account of what paſſes in Parliament; as they did of the Depriving of the Biſhops and others for not taking the Oaths; however, an Act of Parliament being once paſt, every one concerned in it, is obliged at his peril, to take noticeof it; and ſo was <hi>Hill</hi> and his <hi>Truſtee Spademan</hi> who did not take the Oaths, 'till he <hi>Heard</hi> the Dean and Chapter were about Seizing the Comportion, as forfeited by the Act, and he might (and no doubt did) <hi>Hear</hi> as well of the Act it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Secondly, That the ſaid Comportion being by the ſaid Act 1. <hi>Jac.</hi> 2. Veſted in the Dean and Chapter <hi>in Truſt,</hi> for the Augmentation of Five poor <hi>Viccarages,</hi> maintenance of the <hi>Choir,</hi> and Repairs of a large Ancient Ruinous <hi>Cathedral;</hi> the Dean and Chapter could but take all the advantage the Law allowed them by <hi>Spademan</hi>'s Forfeiture, in Virtue of their ſaid <hi>Truſt;</hi> and their Neglecting to do ſo, or their Conniving to Divert and miſapply what is by Law appointed for thoſe <hi>Charitable</hi> and <hi>Pious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> would have been in them a kind of Sacrilegious Attempt.</p>
            <p>Such Diverting or miſapplying, (as well as any differnce ariſing about the ſame) being alſo by the ſaid Act of Parliament referred to the Determination of the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canturbury</hi> for the time being.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Spademan</hi> is ſtill as much a <hi>Truſtee</hi> as ever for Hill, as is owned in his Petition (and mentioned in the <hi>Votes</hi> of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> of the 14th of <hi>January</hi> laſt) tho' the Words Declaring ſuch <hi>Truſt</hi> be Omitted in the Bill, as now brought up form the <hi>Houſe of Commons.</hi>
