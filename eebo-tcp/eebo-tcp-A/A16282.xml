            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I doubt not (good courteous Reader) but the commendation of this Worke, and other Hiſtories of like argument, expreſſed at large by the Author in his preface, will paſſe ſo currant with thee, as thou wilt willingly conclude with him, That there is nothing more pleaſant, more profitable, nor more prayſe worthy, then truly, <hi>legendo, aut pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinando,</hi> either by reading or trauelling, to know and vnderſtand the ſituation, lawes, cuſtomes, religion, and forme of gouernement of each ſeuerall Prouince in the world. And ſeeing alſo that (beſides our ſloth and home-lou'd idleneſſe) there be ſo many rubbes, and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to hinder and deterre vs from trauell, as it is, in a maner, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglected, and we thereby depriued of the one halfe of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings: how much more industrious ought we to be, (for ſupply of that defect) to buſie our ſelues in reading the reports of ſuch Writers, (both an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In which rancke, mine Author, and thoſe auncient and famous writers, out of which this collection is gathered (though it cannot bee denied but that there hath beene <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For mine owne part I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my inſufficiency, truely to diſcerne betwixt the one and the other, yet thus much I may preſume to ſay in the behalfe of mine Author, that (to my weake vnderſtanding) in al the courſe of his bookes, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth no vntruths to make them ſeeme probable, nor meere probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites for true, but relateth things doubtful as he found them written by others, and ſo leaueth euery man to his diſcretion, to giue credit as hee ſees cauſe: And although hee maketh mention of ſome ceremonies &amp; cuſtomes vſed in certaine countries, which ſeeme ſo abſurde, monſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and prodigious, as they appeare vtterly voide of credit yet is there no cauſe that that ſhould diſtaſt any one, conſidering that (as hee well noteth in the concluſion of his third booke) all people are not indued with like ciuility, and that there is as great difference in mens liuings as in their collours.</p>
            <p>The pleaſure which I tooke by peruſal of theſe ſeuerall collections, and the profit that I conceiued might thereby redound both to my ſelfe and others, together with the approbation of my indeauours and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the workes by ſome worthy, and worthily reſpected friends, whoſe Iudgements doe farre exceed mine owne, incouraged mee to vndergoe the buſineſſe, and to proceed in that I had already begunne with more alacrity, which after much labour I haue now at length finiſhed, and ſuited in this ragged liuery, and made him to ſpeake in a phraſe though not eloquent, yet I hope plaine and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. And albeit a tale may be much improued by a formal manner of telling, yet gold is more eſteemed of for his goodneſſe then for his collour, and the worthineſſe of the worke ought to bee of more regarde then the elegancy of the phraſe, the one beeing the ſubſtance, the other but the ſhadow.</p>

When as
<pb facs="tcp:24800:6"/>
they, vſing no money, no merchandize, but equalling one bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit with another, had nothing proper to themſelues, but ſea and land as common to all, as the aire and firmament. No man then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped after honor and riches, but euery one contented with a little, liued a rurall, ſecure, and idle life, free from toyle or trauell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with one or more wiues and their ſweet children, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other houſe than the heauens, the ſhadow of a tree, or ſome homely cabbin: their meate was then the fruite of trees, and milke of beaſts; their drinke water, and their clothing, firſt, the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rinde or broade leaues of trees, and afterwards the skinnes of beaſts vnhandſomly ſtitched together.

points to be more mild, more wiſe, and better qualified: and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide all groſſe barbariſme, and beaſtly cruelty, abſtayning from mutuall ſlaughter: from deuouring of humane fleſh, from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and robberie, from open and inceſtuous coupling of children with their parents, before indifferently vſed: and from many more ſuch enormities, applyed their reaſon and ſtrength to recouer the <note place="margin">The earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered from hir firſt rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and barren neſſe, and made fertile.</note> earth, which (beeing then either ouergrown with thicke woods, ouerrunne with wild beaſts, or ouerflowed with ſtanding waters) lay rude, barren, deſert, vnfrequented, and inconuenient for mans dwelling, and (with their induſtrie and labour) playning and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it from heapes of ſtones, rootes of trees, and ſuperfluous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, made it fertill and very delightſome to behold. And allowing the plaines and champion grounds for tilling, and the leſſer hilles for vineyards, did ſo manure &amp; dreſſe the earth, (with inſtruments made for the purpoſe) as it brought foorth both corne and wine in aboundance, which before yeelded nothing but acornes and wild apples, and thoſe alſo ſparingly produced.</p>
            <p>The valleys they beautified and adorned with moſt delectable gardens, and well watered medowes, leauing onely the toppes of mountaines for woods, and aſſigning ſo much ſoyle for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of fruite, as they ſcarce left ſufficient for fuell and fodder. Then they began to people all places more plentifully, to erect new buildings, of ferme houſes to make hamlets, of boroughes great citties, to build temples in valleys, towers on mountaine tops, to encompaſſe their fountains with hewed marble ſtones, &amp; inuironing them with plants on all ſides for ſhadow, deriued their running waters thence into their cities, through pipes &amp; conduits: to ſearch deepe in the ground for water, where naturally it was wanting: to hold in and reſtraine the ſtreames and violent riuers, with dams and bankes of earth, which before would often flow at large, to the great deſtruction of the Inhabitants, and (that they might bee paſſable, and no hidderance or impediment to mens buſineſſe) to build ouer them ſtrong and ſtately bridges, vppon bending Arches or Pyles faſtened and firmely rampered in the ground, to caſt downe Rockes in the ſea, which whilome were woont to bee daungerous for ſaylers, to make hauens, inroades, and harboroughes both in Ilands, and on the Continent.</p>

To digge Dockes and Rodes, wherein ſhippes might reſt in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, free from danger of wind or weather. And ſo diligently to decke and garniſh all things both by land and ſea, that the earth (as now it is) compared to his former filthineſſe and deformitie, may be thought to be an other earth, different from that it was before, and not much vnlike that moſt delectable garden, out of which our vnfortunate firſt founders <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were eiected <note place="margin">The earth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</note> for tranſgreſſing the diuine commandement.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, many moſt noble Diſciplines, and liberall Arts, were by men found out, which (that they might remaine to all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie) were by diuers Characters, and new-inuented notes of letters, committed to bookes and tables, and did ſo farre exempt and aduance them beyond all humane condition, as they might haue beene thought rather to leade the moſt bleſſed liues of dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied men, then men indeed.</p>
            <p>Had not Satan the Prince of the world, and enemie of mankind, (by ſowing his moſt peſtilent Cockles amongſt the good corne) confounded their moſt intire and happie eſtate. For he ſeeing the multitude of people increaſe, and the pleaſure of the world held in better eſtimation, ſtirred vp with enuie, firſt found them guiltie to themſelues for committing damnable ſins, and afterwards made them with curioſitie to affect the knowledge of future and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things, from the obſcure anſwers of Oracles: And to the end he might aboliſh all knowledge, of one true and onely God, and <note place="margin">The true God forgotten.</note> trouble all mankind with ſome notable euill: he taught them the prophane worſhip of falſe gods and goddeſſes, cauſing them to commit idolatrie, and do reuerence vnto them, making the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian Temples in one place, the Euboian in another; in another the Naſamonian, and the Dodoman okes (by his diuelliſh inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to vtter foorth Oracles.

            <p>Moreouer alſo, after Chriſt Ieſus, the true Sonne of the liuing <note place="margin">Jeſus Chriſt reduced the world from error.</note> God, appearing in fleſh, and pointing out to the erring multitude the perfect path-way of ſaluation, by his word and example, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting to newneſſe of life, to the glory of his heauenly father, and ſending his Diſciples forth into all the world, by their whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine and preaching, had confounded their damnable idolatry, and ſpread abroad a new religion, and new inſtitutions of life, yea and preuailed ſo much, as being receiued of all nations in the world, there could nothing more be deſired for the obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of true felicity: when Satan returning into his former ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and going about to circumuent, and get againe his habitation in mens curious hearts, which before (by the comming of Chriſt) hee was forced to forſake, reduced ſome into their former errors, and ſo corrupted and blinded others with new hereticall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it had beene better for them, neuer to haue taſted the truth, then ſo ſodainely and maliciouſly to forſake the knowne way of ſaluation. For now at this day all the people of Aſia the leſſe, Armenia, Arabia, Perſis, Siria, Aſſiria and Media, and in Affrick, the <note place="margin">The large Countries of the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</note> Aegiptians, Numidians, Libians and Muritanians. In Europe, all thoſe of Greece, Miſia and Thrace, vtterly abiecting Chriſt, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and with all honor and deuotion adore, that moſt accurſed and Epileptical <hi>Makomet</hi> and his damnable doctrine.

But the ſincere and right beliefe of our Sauiour Chriſt, wherewith (by his ſpeciall grace) the whole world was once illumined, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained onely in Germany, Italy, France, Spaine, England, Scotland,
<pb facs="tcp:24800:8"/>
Ireland, Dacia, Liuonia, Pruſſia, Polonia, Hungaria, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Iſles of Rhodes, Scicilia, Corſica, Sardinia and of ſome few beſides. So far hath that moſt cruel enemy of mankinde preuailed, by bringing in ſuch diuerſity of manners, ſuch hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and damnable ſuperſtitious abuſes in ceremonies and ſacred things, that whileſt euery nation contendeth by ſtrongeſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prooue that the GOD which they worſhip and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore is the true and great GOD, and that they onely goe the <note place="margin">The diuerſitie of worſhipinge is the ſeminarie of diſtention.</note> way of eternall happineſſe, and all others the by-path that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to perdition.</p>
            <p>Whileſt alſo euery ſect indeauoureth to aduance and ſet forth themſelues, it inſueth that (each one perſecuting other with mortall enmity and deadly hatred) it is not onely daungerous to trauell into forraine nations, but in a manner vtterly bard and prohibited, which I perſwade my ſelfe is the cauſe, that the names of bordering nations beeing ſcarce knowne to their neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt neighbors, whatſoeuer is either written or reported of them, is now accounted fabulous and vntrue: the knowledge whereof <note place="margin">The Greeke Philoſophers firſt glory.</note> notwithſtanding hath euer beene reputed ſo pleaſant, ſo profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſo praiſe-worthy, as it is moſt manifeſt, that for the loue and deſire thereof onely, without other cauſe at all, very many forſaking father and mother, wife and children, countrie and kin (and that which is more) neglecting their owne health, haue aduentured through great difficulties and daungers, care and troubles, long and tedious iourneies into forraine nations, onely to furniſh themſelues with experience. So as it is vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true that not in theſe daies onely, but almoſt from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, All thoſe haue bin generally eſteemed men of greateſt authority, wiſdome and learning, and by open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent haue beene elected and choſen Maiſters and Gouernours, Councellors and Iudges, Captaines and Controllers, who hauing <note place="margin">The law-giuers firſt authority.</note> ſometimes trauelled ſtrang countries, haue knowne the manners of many people and cities, for euer as thoſe auncient Philoſophers of Greece and Italy, which were firſt founders of ſundry ſects wherin they inſtructed their Diſciples &amp; Schollers, as namely <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> of the Socratick ſect, <hi>Plato,</hi> of the Academicke, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> of the Peripatick, <hi>Antiſthines</hi> of the Cynick, <hi>Ariſtyppus,</hi> of the Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naicke,

Wherefore ſeeing there is ſo great pleaſure and profit in the knowledge of countries, and of their manners, and alſo ſeeing it is not in euery mans power, nor yet lawfull for many cauſes, for euery one to trauel and behold lands far remote: thou maiſt (good gentle reader) as wel by reading comprehend &amp; vnderſtand, the moſt renowned cuſtomes of al nations, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral ſytuation of each country, expreſſed in this booke, and that as readily, &amp; with as much pleaſure, as if, taking thee by the hand, I ſhold lead thee through euery nation one after an other, &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully relate vnto thee, in what place, and vnder what kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, each nation haue liued heretofore and now doe liue.</p>
            <p>Nor would I haue thee diſtaſted or carried away, for that by ſome too ſeuere reformer, it may bee obiected and laide in

they were couered, beeing burned and broken, they brought foorth the formes of all creatures: of which, thoſe that did moſt participate of heate, tooke theyr place in the vppermoſt region, and became flying fowles, thoſe which were moſt neere vnto the nature of the earth, became ſerpents, and other earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and thoſe of the watery condition, were allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Element of the ſame nature, and were called Fiſhes.</p>
               <p>But when the earth (with heate and wind waxing euery day dryer then other) ſurceaſed from bringing forth the greateſt ſorts of creatures, thoſe which ſhee had already produced, brought forth others of the ſame kinde, by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall commixtion one with another.</p>

               <p>Now thoſe which (attributing nothing to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence) were of opinion, that man had this manner of <note place="margin">The firſt men were the Aethiopians.</note> beginning, did hold alſo, that the Aethiopians were the firſt of all mortall men, vſing this coniecture for their reaſon, that the country of Aethiopia, by reaſon of the vicinity and neereneſſe of the heauens, did before all other lands begin to waxe warme, the earth from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning lying long ſoaked in water: whereof it happened, that of that firſt temperature of heate and moyſture, man himſelfe being firſt begotten, would with a better wil hold that place wherein hee was borne, than to goe ſeeke ſtrange countries, all other places beeing vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto him.</p>

               <p>Some ſay, that thee that did moſt excell others in comlineſſe of body, skill in breeding cattell, ſtrength and riches, him they elected for their King.

And hee that beſt deſerued of their citty, him next vnto their King they reuerenced as God.

Theyr cuſtome was (as the Greekes were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) to circumciſe them-ſelues and their children: they write theyr letters from the right hand to the left; and men wore two garments, the women but one: they had two ſorts of letters, the one prophane, the other holy, but both of them deriued from the Aethiopians. The Prieſts ſhaued their bodyes euery third day, leaſt they ſhould hap to bee polluted with any filthe, when they did <note place="margin">The cleanneſſe of the Prieſts.</note> ſacrifice: they wore paper ſhooes, and linnen veſtiments euer new waſhed, and alleagded that they were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for no other cauſe, but for cleanlineſſe ſake, for that it is better to bee cleane then comely.

               <p>It was not lawfull for the women to doe ſacrifice, no though they were conſecrated to their God <hi>Iſis:</hi> They liued of meate made of a certaine corne which they call Wheate, and drinke wine made of Barley, for grapes there <note place="margin">The Aegiptians wine.</note> are none growing in that country. They eate raw fiſh dried at the Sunne, and ſome powdred in brine, and birds alſo, but altogether rawe, but the richer ſort feed vpon Quailes and Duckes. When many are aſſembled together at meat, and that they be aroſe from dinner or ſupper, one of them caryeth about, vpon a little Beere or Cheſt, the picture of a dead body, eyther made of wood, or elſe much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a dead corpes, in painting and workmanſhip, of a cubite or two cubits long, and ſhewing it vnto euery one of the gueſts, ſaith vnto them: In your drinkings and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments behold this ſpectacle, for ſuch ſhall you bee when you are dead.

Thoſe which incounter in the <note place="margin">The Aegiptians ſalutations.</note> wayes ſalute one another with congee below the knee: They are clothed (as I haue ſaid) with linnen garments fringed about the legges, which they call Caſſilirae, ouer which they we are a little ſhort white garment like a cloake, <note place="margin">VVollen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned.</note> as it were caſt ouer the other: for wollen garments are ſo contemned, as they are neither worne in temples, nor ſerue for winding ſheetes.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:24800:19"/>
to learne their manners, lawes and wiſdome (in which they excelled all nations of the earth) as <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and after him <hi>Homer, Muſaeus, Melampodes, Dedalus, Licurgus</hi> the Spartane, <hi>Solon</hi> the Athenian, <hi>Plato</hi> the Philoſopher, <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> of Samos, and <hi>Zamolzis</hi> his diſciple, <hi>Eudoxus</hi> alſo the Mathematitian, <hi>Democritus</hi> of the cittie of Abdera, <hi>Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> of Chios, <hi>Moſes</hi> the Hebrew, and many others, as the Aegiptian Prieſts make bragges, are contained in their ſacred bookes, I thinke it very conuenient to ſpend ſome little time further in deſcribing the manner of liuing of the Aegiptians, that it may bee knowne what one or more things, euery one of thoſe worthy men, haue taken from the Aegyptians, and tranſported into other countries, for <note place="margin">Many cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies vſed in Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, borrowed from the Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</note> (as <hi>Phillippus Beroaldus</hi> writeth vpon <hi>Apuleus</hi> Aſſe) there be many things tranſlated from the religion of the Aegip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians into the Chriſtian religion, as the linnen veſtments, the ſhauing of Prieſts crownes, the turning about in the Altar, the ſacrificiall pompe, the pleaſant tuning notes of muſick, adorations, prayers, and many other more like ceremonies.</p>
               <p>The Egiptian Kings (as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> writeth in his ſecond booke) were not ſo licencious as other Kings, whoſe will ſtandeth for a law, but followed the inſtitutions and lawes of the country, both in gathering money, and in their life and conuerſations.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:24800:20"/>
nothing vnfit to be done by a King, for ſeldome doe the rich and mighty men become euill if they want miniſters to foſter them in their euill deſires. There were certaine howers appointed euery day and night, wherein (by the permiſſion of their lawe) the King might confer with others. The King at his riſing receaueth all the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſupplications that bee ſent or brought vnto him, and then pauſing and conſidering a while what is to be don, he giueth anſwer to euery ſuter in order as they came, ſo as all things bee done in their due and conuenient time. This done after he hath waſhed his body in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his greateſt ſtates, and put on his richeſt robes, he ſacrificeth vnto his Gods: There cuſtome was that the cheefe Prieſt, when the ſacrifices were brought before the Altar, and the King ſtanding by, praied with a lowde voice <note place="margin">The Prieſts praſied the good Kings diſpraiſed the bad.</note> in the hearing of the people for the proſperous helth and all good ſucceſſe of their King that maintaines iuſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſubiects, and more particularly to relate his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as to ſay that he obſerued piety and religion towards the Gods, and humanity to man, then to call him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, iuſt, and magnanimous, true, bountifull and bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all his affections, and beſides, that, that hee laid more eaſie puniſhments vpon offendors, then their crimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and beſtowed fauours beyond mens deſeruings, and holding on this prayer, at length he purſueth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with a curſe, and freeing the King from blame, layeth al the fault vpon his miniſters, which perſwade him to doe euill: Which done he exhorteth the King to leade a happy life and acceptable to the Gods, and alſo to follow good faſhions, and not to do thoſe things which euill men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to, but ſuch as cheefely appertaine to honour and vertue. In the end after the King hath ſacrificed a bull to the Gods, The Prieſt recyteth out of their ſacred
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:24800:20"/>
bookes, certaine decrees and geſts of worthy men, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the King being mooued ruleth his kingdome holily and iuſtly according to their examples.</p>
               <p>They haue there times appointed and prefixt not onely when to gather riches, and to iudge acording to their auncient lawes, but alſo when to walke, when to waſh, when to lie with their wiues and when euery thing elſe is to bee done: They vſed but ſimple diet as hauing nothing <note place="margin">The Egyptians ſimple diet.</note> vpon their tables but Veale and gooſe, they were alſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to a certaine meaſure of wine that would neither fill their bellies nor intoxicate their braines. In a word the whole courſe of their liues, was ſo modeſt &amp; ſo temperate as they ſeemed, to be guided rather by a moſt skilful Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the preſeruation of their healths then by a law-giuer.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange to ſee after what ſort the Aegyptians lead their liues, for they liued not as they would themſelues, but as the law allowed them; but it is much more admirable to ſee how that their Kings were not permitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne others, nor yet to inflict puniſhment vpon any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor, being moued therevnto either through pride, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or any vniuſt cauſe whatſoeuer: but liuing vnder a law like priuate men, thought it no burthen vnto them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſteemed themſelues bleſſed in obeying the law: for by thoſe which follow their own affections, they ſuppoſed many things to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, that might breed vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues both danger &amp; damage: for though they know they do amiſſe, yet notwithſtanding they perſiſt ſtill in error, being ouercome either with loue, or hate, or ſome other paſſion of mind, whereas thoſe which liue with vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aduiſe, offend in few things. The Kings vſing ſuch <note place="margin">The Kings ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> iuſtice to their ſubiects, did ſo purchaſe the good wills of them all, as not only the Prieſts, but all the Egiptians, were more carefull of their Soueraigne, then of their wiues or

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:24800:21"/>
by a Praetor or Mayor, who hath rule ouer al the people of that Prouince: The Aegiptians deuide their tribute, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome money which is payd them by forrainers in three parts: the greateſt part whereof belongeth to the colledge of Prieſts, which are of great authority with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, both in regard of their ſeruice to their gods, as alſo for their doctrine, where-with they inſtruct others, and part of this portion they beſtow in miniſtring their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the reſt to increaſe their priuate eſtates, for in no caſe would the Aegiptians haue the worſhip of their gods omitted, nor doe they thinke it fit, that they that be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of common councell, and profit, ſhould want things neceſſary to liue vpon: for the Prieſts in all weighty buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes bee aſſiſtant to the King, both by their labour and councell, as well in regarde of the knowledge they haue in the ſtarres, as by their ſacrifices, foretelling things to come. Moreouer they ſhew out of their ſacred volumnes the actes and geſts of worthy men, by which the Kings may know in their deſignes, how things are likely to ſucceed, and it is not ſo with the Aegiptian Prieſts, as it is with the Greekes, that one man, or one woman ſhould haue charge of their ſacrifices, but there bee many that bee conuerſant about the worſhip and honour of their gods, which leaue the ſame charge of holy miſteries to their children: they be all of them freed and diſcharged from tribute, &amp; poſſeſſe the ſecond place of honor and eſtimation after their King.</p>

               <p>Their common-wealth alſo conſiſteth of three ſorts of common people, of husbandmen, ſhepheards and crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <note place="margin">Their common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of three ſorts of people, husbandmen, ſhepheards and labourers.</note> The husbandmen buy their ground at an eaſie rate of the Prieſts, of the King, or of the Souldiours, and apply their husbandry without intermiſſion, all their time from their infancie, by which meanes they are farre more expert in husbandry then others, both for the precepts they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from their parents, as alſo by reaſon of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall practiſe. The ſheapheards likewiſe receiuing the charge and skill of keeping cattell from their fathers, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that kinde of exerciſe for all their life long: And arts and ſciences amongſt the Aegiptians are moſt exquiſite, and brought to the higheſt ſtraine of perfection, for the Egiptian tradeſmen, (without intermedling in publicke affaires) exerciſe no other labour but ſuch onely as is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther permitted by the law, or taught by their fathers, ſo as neither the enuy of the teacher, nor ciuill hatred, nor any other thing whatſoeuer, can hinder them from that courſe of life they haue entred into.</p>
               <p>The Egiptians cenſured not of things at hap hazard, but with reaſon and diſcretion, for they eſteemed things <note place="margin">How their iudgments were giuen.</note> rightly done to be very beneficiall for mans life, and that the onely way to auoyde euil, was to puniſh the offenders and to ſuccor the oppreſſed, but that the puniſhment due for an offence ſhould bee forborne in regarde eyther of meede or money, they held to be the vtter confuſion of their publicke life, and therefore they ſetled the beſt and choiſeſt men of the moſt famous citties, as at Heliopolis, Memphis, &amp; Thebes, and ſet them as iudges ouer the reſt,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:24800:22"/>
which ſeſſions of Iudges were thought to be nothing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the Iudges of Areopagus in Athens, nor to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or councell of the Lacedemonians, eſtabliſhed long time after them: when theſe Iudges (being thirty in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) were aſſembled together, they made election of the worthieſt man amongſt them, to bee their chiefe Iudge or Iuſtice, in whoſe abſence the whole company aſſembled, appointed an other Iudge to be his ſubſtitute: Theſe Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were all maintained at the Kings coſt, but the cheefe Iudge was farre better allowed then the reſt, who alwayes had hanging about his neck in a chaine of gold, bedeckt <note place="margin">The chiefe Iudge weareth the ſigne of Truth about his neck.</note> with diuers precious ſtones, an Image which they called Truth: and when they were ſet in Iudgment, the Image of Truth being laid before them by the chiefe Iudge, and all their lawes (which were contained in eight volumes) pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the middle of the Iudges: their maner was, that the accuſer ſhould ſet downe his accuſation in writing, &amp; the maner of the iniury, or loſſe, committed and done, and how much he eſteemed him-ſelfe damnified: then was there a time allotted for the accuſed to anſwer his aduerſaries ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations by writing, and eyther to purge himſelfe that he did not the iniury, or to auerre that what he did was iuſtly done, or that the wrong or loſſe hee did was not of ſuch value as was ſuppoſed: after this the plaintiffe replied, and the defendant made anſwer to his replication. So as the pleading of both parties being twiſe heard, after the Iudges had examined and reaſoned of the matter in controuerſie, the chiefe Iudge turning the ſigne of Truth towards him that had truth of his ſide, pronounced the ſentence, and this was the maner of their Iudgments. And now becauſe occaſion is offered to ſpeake of the Inſtitution of their lawes, I thinke it not impertinent to our purpoſe, to make mention of the ancient lawes of the Egyptians:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:24800:23"/>
that thereby we may know how farre they excelled others both in order and vtility. And firſt of all, periured perſons <note place="margin">The lawes of the Egiptians. againſt periurd perſons.</note> were puniſhed with death, as thoſe which had committed a double offence, both in violating their duty towards the gods, and in breaking and aboliſhing faith and truth amongſt men, which is the chiefeſt bond of humaine ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: if a Traueller finde one that is ſet vpon with theeues and robbed and beaten, or ſuffered any other iniury, and doth not ſet to his helping hand to ayde him (if it lye in his power) hee ſhall dye for it, but if hee could not aſſiſt him, then ought hee to make the theeues knowne, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the iniury with his accuſation; which if hee doe not he ſhall be whipped with a certaine number of ſtripes, and bee bard from all ſuſtenance for three whole dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <note place="margin">Againſt ſalſe accuſers.</note> hee which accuſeth an other falſely, and is called in queſtion for it, ſhall vndergoe the puniſhment prouided for falſe accuſers: and all the Aegiptians were at certaine times conſtrained to giue vp theyr names in writing to the Preſidents and Gouernors, and what trade of life they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, in dooing whereof, if any ſay vntruly, or liued by vnlawfull gaine, hee was puniſhed with death: if any one kill eyther free-man or ſeruant willingly, he ſhall dye for it by the lawes: which regarding not the quallity of the eſtate, but the heynouſneſſe of the deed, and the euill mind of the dooer, deliuer men from euill, ſo as by reuenging the death of ſeruants and ſlaues, free-men may liue in more ſecurity.</p>
               <p>The paines of death were not afflicted vpon fathers which <note place="margin">A law againſt parents that murdered their children.</note> had ſlaine their ſonnes, but they were inioyned to ſtand for three daies and three nights about the dead corps (the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like watch ſtanding by to ſee it done) for they thought it vniuſt to depriue him of life that was author of his ſonnes life: but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:24800:23"/>
rather that he ſhould be afflicted with continuall griefe and repentance of the fact, whereby others might ſhunne the like offence. To Paracides was impoſed a moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <note place="margin">A law againſt Pariacides.</note> and extreame puniſhment, for the lawe was, that the liuing body and the dead corps ſhould be bound together ioynt by ioynt, vpon ſharpe Pikes or ſtakes, and burned vpon a heape of thornes, adiudging it to be the moſt hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence that could bee amongſt men, for one to doe him to death violently, of whom hee had receiued life. If any woman great with child were adiudged to dye, her death was deferred till ſhe was deliuered, for they thought it meere iniuſtice, that an infant which committed no euill ſhould periſh with the guilty, or that two ſhould bee puniſhed, whereas but one offended. Thoſe which in <note place="margin">Offenders in the warres puniſhed with ſhame.</note> warres did eyther breake theyr array, or would not obey their Leaders and Captaines, were not puniſhed with death, but with the reproch &amp; ignominy of all men, which diſgrace after they had blotted out by their vertue and valiant acts, they recouered their former eſtate and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and that law brought it to paſſe in continuance of time, that men accounted that diſhonour to bee the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt euill could hap vnto them, and much more greeuous then death. Thoſe which reuealed any ſecrets to their enemies, had their toungs cut out; and thoſe which clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped money, or counterfetted any falſe coyne, or altered it eyther in weight or faſhion, or ſtamped it with letters, or defaced the letters, or forged any falſe deeds, were puniſhed with the loſſe of both their hands: for they thought it fit, that that part of the body ſhould ſuffer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment during life, that was cheefe inſtrument in the offence, and that others alſo being warned by their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and calamities, might abſtaine from the like lewdneſſe.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:24800:24"/>
There were very ſharpe puniſhments inflicted vpon thoſe that had abuſed any woman, for he which defloured a free <note place="margin">A law against adultery and fornication.</note> woman had his members cut off, for that vnder one fault hee had comitted three hanous offences which were iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, corruption of bloud, and confuſion of children; he that was taken in wilfull adultery had a thouſand ſtripes with rods, and the adulterous woman had her noſe cut off, by which diſgrace her beauty was blemiſhed, and ſhee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in that part of her face which did moſt addorne it. It is reported that <hi>Bocchoris</hi> was the maker of thoſe lawes which partaind to ciuill conuerſation amongſt men, which lawes <note place="margin">Bocchoris their law maker.</note> allow that if one lend mony without ſpecialty, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor deny that hee borrowed any, the creditor muſt ſtand to the debiters oath: for an oath is held of great moment as being a religious act: and certaine it is that thoſe which often ſweare doe abrogate their faith and credits, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will ſweare but ſeldome, leaſt they looſe their reputations and names of honeſt men, moreouer the ſame lawe-maker (concluding all faithfulneſſe in vertue) iudged, that men ought by good meanes to accuſtome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to honeſty, that they may not bee thought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of truſt, for hee thought it wrong to thoſe to whome mony was lent with-out oath not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their faith by ſwearing, whether the goods be their <note place="margin">Mens bodies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liable to their debts.</note> owne or noe: The vſury which was agreed vpon by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, forbad that the double forfeture of the thing lent ſhould be exacted: and all payments were ſatiſfied by the debitors goods, but his body might not be deliuered to the creditor, for they thought fit that onely their goods ſhould be ſubiect and lyable to their debts, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies addicted to the Citties, whoſe ayde and aſſiſtance they had neede of, both in warres and peace; neither was it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:24800:24"/>
thought fit that the ſouldiors which ventured their liues, for their countries ſafty, ſhould bee thruſt in priſon for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: which law is ſuppoſed to bee tranſlated by <hi>Solon</hi> to the Athenians, and by him called Siſachthia, prouiding that men ſhould not looſe their liues for the Cittizens vſury: more-ouer the particular law and toleration for theeues amongſt the Aegiptians, was, that thoſe that did ſteale ſhould bring their names in writing to the cheefe Preeſt, and inſtantly diſcloſe the theft, or robbery vnto <note place="margin">The law againſt theeues.</note> him. In like ſort they which had their goods taken from them, muſt write vnto the cheefe Prieſt, the time, day, and houre that hee was robbed, by which meanes the theft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily found out and diſcouered, he which was robbed ſhould looſe the fourth part of that which was ſtolne, which fourth part ſhall bee giuen to the theefe, and the reſt reſtored to the owner: For the lawgiuers opinion was that ſeeing it was vnpoſſible that theft ſhould altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee prohibited, men ſhould looſe rather ſome portion of their ſubſtance, then all that was taken from them.</p>
               <p>The manner of their marriages is not all alike with <note place="margin">Their marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.</note> the Aegiptians, for it is lawfull for the Preeſts to marry but once, but the reſt may marry as oft as they will, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deſire, and ability; and there are no children accounted baſtards, noe though they be begotten of ſuch bond-ſeruants as be bought with mony, for they hold that the father is the onely author of their childrens birth, and the mother to be but the receptacle, and to yeeld norriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The ſmall coſt beſtowed in bringing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children.</note> to the infant.</p>
               <p>It is moſt incredible to ſee with what ſmall and eaſie coſt the Aegiptians bring vp their children, for the noriſh them with the roots of bulruſhes, &amp; other like roots, raked
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:24800:25"/>
and roaſted in hotte embers, and with hearbes growing in fennes and mooriſh grounds, ſome-times boyld, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times broyld on the coales, and ſome-times rawe. They neuer wore ſhooes, but goe for the moſt part naked, by reaſon of the temperature of the country: ſo as all the coſt that a father beſtoweth vpon his childe till hee bee of full age, exceedeth not twenty <hi>Drachmas.</hi> The Prieſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct children both in that learning which they call holy, and in the other which appertained to knowledge and common inſtruction, and they bee very intentiue, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly bent to the ſtudy of Geometry and Arithma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. They ſuffer them not to vſe eyther wreſtling or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, ſuppoſing the dayly vſe of wreſtling to be vnſure and dangerous, and that thereby their bodyes are made more feeble and weake, and muſicke they condemned as vtterly <note place="margin">Muſick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alowd of the Egiptians.</note> vnprofitable and hurtfull in making their mindes effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: They cure their diſeaſes eyther by faſting or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, which they vſe eyther dayly, or euery third day, <note place="margin">How the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians cure the diſeaſed.</note> or fourth day, for they are of opinion, that all diſeaſes had theyr beginning from ſurfetting, and that therefore that is the beſt phyſicke to recouer health, which taketh away the cauſe of the diſeaſe: Souldiers and trauellers are cured for nothing, for the Phiſitians liue of the reuenews of the common-wealth, and therefore are forced by the law to cure the diſeaſed, after the ſtrict forme ſet downe by the beſt Phiſitians and moſt approoued writers: And the Phyſition that followeth the rule of that ſacred booke, though hee cannot cure his patient, yet is hee blameleſſe, but if he cure him by any other meanes then is ſet downe in that booke, hee ſhall dye for it: for the maker of that law was of opinion, that there could not a better courſe of curing bee found out, then that which was inuented,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:24800:25"/>
and obſerued for long time by ancient Phyſitions.</p>
               <p>The Aegiptians worſhip diuerſe creatures beyond all meaſure, not onely while they be liuing, but when they be <note place="margin">The Aegiptians worſhip diuers ſorts of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> dead alſo, as Cattes, Rattes, Dogges, Hawkes, the birds called <hi>Ibis,</hi> Wolues and Crocadiles, and many more of like kinde: neither be they aſhamed to profeſſe open ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto them, but account it as commendable and lawdable for them to doe it, as to doe their ſeruice to the gods, in ſo much as they will goe about into citties and other places, carrying with them Images of thoſe beaſts, vaunting and glorying what creatures they haue adored, at the ſight whereof, all men in manner of ſupplyants, doe reuerence vnto the Images. When any of theſe beaſts die, they wrappe the carcaſe in linnen cloth, and annoynt it with Salt, beating their breſts with bitter exclamations, and annoynting it againe with the Iuiſe of Cedar tree, and other odoriferus oyntments, that it may keepe the longer, they bury it in their hallowed places. Hee that willingly killeth any of thoſe creatures, ſhall haue iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death for it: but if a man kill the Ibis or the Cat, either willingly or at vnawares, the whole multitude fall vpon him, tormenting and killing him without mercy or iudgment. The terror whereof inforceth the beholders to lament his death, and to auerre that the beaſt was kild without any fault of his owne. Theſe beaſts be kept with great coſt and charge within the circuit of their Temples, by men of no ſmall account, eating fine flower and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redge made of Oate-meale, which in their banquets are mingled with milke: They giue them Geeſe alſo dayly both ſodde and broylde: and catch birds for thoſe which eate raw fleſh. To conclude they bee all nouriſhed with maruelous great charge and diligence: and their deaths as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:24800:26"/>
much bewayled of the people as the deaths of their owne Sonnes, yea and their funeralls are farre more ſumptuous than their ability can afford; in ſo much as when <hi>Ptolomaeus Lagus</hi> was gouernour of Aegypt an oxe dying for age in the City of Memphis, hee which had the charge of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him beſtowed a great ſumme of mony vpon his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, which was giuen to him to defray that charge, beſides fifty talents of ſiluer which he borowed of <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>

               <p>Theſe things which we haue ſpoken of, perhaps, will ſeeme ſtrange to ſome, but no leſſe ſtrange will it ſeeme to any that ſhall conſider the ceremonies of the Aegiptians in the buriall of thé dead: for when one dyeth there all his <note place="margin">The ſtrange kind of burials amongst the Egiptians.</note> neere friends and kinsfolkes defile and ſpoyle their heads with earth, and goe round about the Citty wayling, vntill the dead body be buryed, in which <hi>Interim</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waſh themſelues nor drinke wine, nor eate any meate but that which is very vile and groſſe, nor yet weare any good apparrell: They haue three formes or kinds of buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for ſome be buried ſumptuouſly, ſome indifferently, and ſome baſely: In the firſt manner of buryall is ſpent and layd out one talent of ſiluer, in the ſecond twentie <hi>minae,</hi> and ſome ſmall coſt is beſtowed in the laſt. Thoſe which haue charge of the funeralls (which courſe of life decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from their aunceſtors as by Inheritance) bring the funerall expences in writing to the houſhoulders, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at what rate they will haue the funeralls performed, and the bargaine being made, and concluded betwixt them the body is deliuered vnto them to be buried, at the charge agreed vpon: And then the Gramarian (for ſo he is called) the body being laid in the ground, marketh and aſſigneth out a place about the flanck how farre from the left part the inciſition muſt bee made, after that, hee which is called
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:24800:26"/>
the breaker vp or vnboweler, openeth his ſide with a ſharp Aethiopian ſtone, ſo wide as by the law is permitted, which done he inſtantly runneth away as faſt as he can, all the ſtanders by following after, curſing him, and throwing ſtones at him, for they eſteemed thoſe men worthy of hate, which had mangled or miſuſed the body of their friend: but thoſe which haue charge and ouerſight of the body, which they cal <hi>Salitores,</hi> they account worthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſtimation, this done they carry the dead corpes into the Temple before the Prieſts, who ſtanding by the dead body, on of them plucketh out of the hole, or wound in his ſide all the entralls, except the kidneyes and heart, al which an other waſheth away with red wine, compounded with odoriferous ſpices and perfumes, after that they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt the whole body, firſt with iuyce of Cedar tree, and other pretious oyntments for thirty daies ſpace and more, and then they rub it ouer with mirhe and cinamon and other like ſtuffe, wherby it is not only preſerued the longer but yeeldeth a ſweet ſauour alſo: the body being thus dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they deliuer it to the dead mans kinsfolke, euery part of him, yea the heaires of his browes and eie lidds, being ſo preſerued, as the forme of his body remaineth whole, as though he were not dead but a ſleepe: before the body be interred the funerall day is declared to the Iudges and the dead mans friends ſaying, that vpon that day the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is to paſſe ouer the fens: the Iudges being aboue forty in number aſſemble them ſelues together, and ſit vpon a round ſcaffold, beyond the poole, then is there a ſhippe prouided for that purpoſe, and brought thither by thoſe to whome the charge is committed, and before the body bee laid in the coffin, euery one hath liberty that will to accuſe the party deceaſed, and if hee bee proued to bee an euill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer, the iudges proceed to ſentence, wherby they adiudge
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:24800:27"/>
that his body ſhall bee depriued of Sepulture: and if any one accuſe him vniuſtly, hee ſhall bee ſeuerely puniſhed: but if no one accuſe him, or that it is euident that hee was accuſed falſely and of malice, his kindred leauing off their mourning, fall to prayſing him, yet ſpeaking nothing of his ſtock and parentage, as the Greekes are accuſtomed to doe, (for the Aegiptians account them-ſelues all noble alike,) but beginning at his child-hood, they recite his bringing vp and education, the beginning of his life and learning, and from that aſcending to his mans eſtate, they remember his religion and deuotion towards the gods, his Iuſtice, his Continency, and all his other vertues, and then inuocating the infernall gods, they beſeech them to place him amongſt the Saints, to which requeſt all the multitude make anſwer, extolling the dead-mans worth and renowne, as if he ſhould liue for euer below amongſt the bleſſed: which done, each one buryeth his friends in his owne proper ſepulcher, and thoſe which want ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, bury them in the ſtrongeſt walls of their houſe, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cheſt wherein the body lyeth on the one end. But thoſe which are forbidden buryall, eyther for vſury, or ſome other offence, are buryed at home without a coffin, whom his poſterity (growing of better ability, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying for his miſdeeds) doe afterwards bury very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly.</p>
               <p>The Aegyptians cuſtome is to giue the bodyes of their dead parents as pawnes to theyr creditors, and thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">The bodies of dead pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents giuen to their creditors.</note> that redeeme them not, ſhall bee diſgraced and want ſepulture them-ſelues: one may iuſtly maruell to ſee, how the authors of all theſe ordinances, did not onely prouide for things profitable for mans life, but alſo regarded thoſe things which appertained to the honour and buryall of

dead bodies, in ſo much that by this meanes, mens liues were diſpoſed as much as might be to good manners.</p>
               <p>The Greekes, which by their fained fables, and Poeticall fictions, farre exceeding truth, deliuered many things of the rewards of the godly, and puniſhment of the wicked, could not with all their writings draw men to vertue, but were rather derided and contemned themſelues: But with the Aegiptians, due puniſhment being rendred to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and commendation to the iuſt, not in ſhew, but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, they did euery day admoniſh both the good and the bad, what things were profitable for them, for they ſaw before their eyes, that to euery one, according to his deeds was giuen a remembrance of his merits or demerits, which was a cauſe that all men immitated the beſt courſe of life, and ſtroue to doe well: for thoſe are not to bee eſteemed the beſt lawes whereby men become rich, but whereby they prooue honeſt, and wiſe.

And yet the adulterer is puniſhed with death, and the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one of anothers kindred, is adultery, but all thoſe which be of one houſe or kindred, be termed legitimate.</p>
               <p>They celebrate their feaſts for almoſt thirty dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, wherein two of their kinſmen that be good Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, giue their attendance in turnes, firſt one, then an other. Theyr citties and townes liue peaceably and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together without walls, and fortreſſes for defence: they vſe oyle made of the graine Seſamina, &amp; are very rich and abounding with all other things. Theyr ſheepe bee of a white fleece, and theyr neate of a tall ſtature, but horſes <note place="margin">No horſes in Arabia.</note> they haue none, the want whereof is ſupplyed with great ſtore of Camels. Gold, ſiluer, and many ſorts of ſweete and odoriferous oyntments are peculiar to that country, Braſſe, Iron, Cloth, Purple, Saffron, Pepper, and all workes ingrauen in mettell or ſtone, are brought thether from other places: theyr dead bodyes they accompt more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and vile then dung, and the carcaſe of their King they bury in a dung-hill; they be very carefull to preſerue their reputations and promiſes with men, and they confirme theyr leagues of friendſhip in this manner following. When a peace and agreement is concluded betwixt two, a third man ſtanding in the middle betwixt them both, ſtriketh them vpon the palme of their hands, about the longeſt fingers, with a ſharpe ſtone till hee draw bloud, then taking a little flock from each of their garments, hee annoynteth with the blood ſeauen ſtones, which be laide before them for that purpoſe, in dooing whereof hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocateth the names of <hi>Dioniſyus</hi> and <hi>Vrania:</hi> this done, he which is the mediatour for the peace, and attonement, (the frendes of both parties being preſent) cauſeth the ſtranger (or the Cittizen (if the matter bee betwixt

               <p>Their onely fuell is the branches of Myrrhe, the ſmoke whereof is ſo noyſome and hurtfull, as it would breede in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſeaſes, if they preuented them not, by burning a ſweet incenſe or gumme called <hi>Storax:</hi> the ſmell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of allayeth the contagion of the ſmoke. The Prieſts firſt ſlay the beaſts they intend to ſacrifice, and then go to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cynamon, ſtrictly obſeruing, that they gather none before Sunne-riſing, nor after the Sun-ſetting: and when they haue appeaſed their gods with the ſacrifice, hee which is chiefeſt amongſt them, diuideth the heape of branches which they haue gathered that day, with a forke conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that vſe, then do they dedicate a part of thoſe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Sunne, which (if the diuiſion made were equal) will be inflamed with the beames of the Sunne, and take fire and burne of their owne accord. Some of thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which liue hardly, feed vpon ſnakes, and bee therefore called <hi>Ophiophagi:</hi> they be neither vexed with care, nor tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mind. The people called Nomades, haue great ſtore of Camels, which ſerue them both in their battels,, and to carry burthens. The people called Debae be ſome of them ſhepheards, &amp; ſome exerciſe themſelues in husbandry, the country abounds with gold, inſomuch as they find often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times amongſt the clods of earth, certaine round balles of gold as big as acorns, of which they make themſelues iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and brooches, very pleaſant to behold, and weare them about their necks and arms. They ſell gold to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring nations for three times the price of braſſe, &amp; twiſe the price of ſiluer: both for the ſmall account they make of gold, and for the great deſire they haue to trafficke with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people.</p>

Next vnto theſe be the Sabaei, which be rich in Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, Myrrhe, and Cynnamon: Some hold, that there be Balme trees growing in the confines of this countrey, it aboundeth with ſweet Canes, and odoriferous Dates: there is alſo a ſerpent bredde in that countrey, of an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth in length, whoſe ſting or biting is deadly, and hee lyeth altogether vnder the rootes of trees. The exceeding ſmell and ſweet ſauour of things growing there, breedeth a ſtupiditie and dulneſſe in their ſenſes; which they cure with the perfume of a certaine lyme or pitch, called <hi>Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and the beard of a bucke Goate. All matters in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie are there referred to the King. Many of the Sabaei are husbandmen, and ſome of them are wholy occupied in gathering ſpices, which grow vpon trees. They vſe traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke into Aethiopia with ſhippes couered with lether, their fuell is the barke or rind of Cynamon, which is of the nature of wood.</p>
               <p>The Metrapolitan and chiefe citie of this kingdome, is ſituated vpon an hill, and is called Saba: their Kings are of one kindred, and raigne by ſucceſſion, to whom the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude yeeld honours indifferently, as well to the bad, as to the good. They neuer dare venter out of their Court, or chiefe citie, fearing leſt they ſhould be ſtoned to death by the common people, by reaſon of an anſwer which they receiued long ſince from one of their Oracles. At Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, where the King keepeth his Court, be ſiluer iewels, and pots of gold of all ſorts, the beds and three-footed ſtooles haue ſiluer feete, and all the houſhold ſtuffe is ſumptuous and rich beyond credit. The porches and galleries alſo bee vnderpropped with great pillars, the heads whereof are ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and gold, the roofes and dores being ſet with golden boſſes, intermingled with pretious ſtones, do manifeſt the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:24800:38"/>
ſumptuous decking of the whole houſe: for here one place ſhineth with gold, another with ſiluer, another with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſtones, and Elephants tooth, and with many other ornaments beſides, of great woorth and eſtimation: theſe people haue for many ages flowed in perpetuall felicitie: for they bee vtterly voyde of ambition and deſire to poſſeſſe other mens goods, which bringeth many to ruine.</p>
               <p>The people called Garraei be no leſſe rich then theſe, <note place="margin">The Garraei.</note> for almoſt all their houſhold-ſtuffe is of gold and ſiluer, and of Iuorie, whereof they make the threſholds, roofes, and walles of their houſes.</p>
               <p>The people called Nabathaei, of all men be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, <note place="margin">The Nabathaei.</note> in getting riches they bee very induſtrious, but much more carefull in keeping them: for hee that dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth his priuate eſtate, hath publicke puniſhment.

               <p>The Arabians vſe in their warres, ſwords, bowes, laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſlings, and many times axes alſo. That accurſed ſtocke of the Sarraſins, which were the greateſt ſcourges that euer happened to mankind, had their beginning in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia, and (as it is very credibly thought) a great part of the Arabians, became followers of the Sarraſins ſect, and tooke their name. Yet now they haue betaken them to their old names againe. The Arabians that dwell about Aegypt, liue for the moſt part by ſtealing, truſting in the ſwiftneſſe of their Camels.</p>

It aboundeth with wine, and with frankinſence, of which there is ſo great ſtore, as is ſufficient to ſerue all the world for ſacrifices: it yeeldeth much myrrhe alſo, and other odoriferous ſpices of diuers kinds, which the Panchaians gather, and ſell to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Arabia, of whom others buy them, &amp; tranſport them into Phaenicia, Syria, and Egypt; from whence they are conveyed into all parts of the world.</p>
               <p>The Panchaians vſe Chariots in the warres; for ſo they haue bin alwaies accuſtomed: their common-wealth is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into three degrees of people: firſt, the Prieſts, who poſſeſſe the prime place, to whome the artificers are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: the husbandmen haue the ſecond, and ſouldiers the third, to whom the ſhepheards be annexed. The Prieſts be gouernours and rulers ouer all the reſt, to whom the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of controuerſies, and arbittement of all publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and iudiciall cauſes are committed, (puniſhment of death onely excepted.) The husbandmen imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues onely in tilling, and manuring the ground; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe whereof goeth in common to all. Out of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen there be ten elected by the Prieſts, which bee moſt expert and induſtrious in husbandrie, to bee
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:24800:39"/>
Iudges ouer the reſt, aſwell for the exhortation of others, in the art of husbandrie, as for the diſtribution of their fruites. The ſhepheards likewiſe bring all their increaſe, as well of ſuch things as appertaine to ſacrifices, as of all things elſe, to the publike vſe, ſome by number, and ſome by weight: in doing whereof they be maruellous preciſe: and no one there poſſeſſeth any thing in priuate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but only their houſes and gardens: for the Prieſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all the cuſtome and tribute-money, and all other things elſe whatſoeuer into their cuſtodie, making diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, as occaſion requireth: whereof two parts is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer due vnto themſelues. The Panchaians bee clothed in ſoft garments; for the ſheepe of that countrie differ much from others in ſoftneſſe and fineneſſe of wooll, both men and women weare ornaments of gold, adorning their neckes with chains, their hands with bracelets, their eares with eare-rings, like the Perſians, and their feet with new ſhooes of diuers colours. The ſouldiers are maintained onely to defend the countrie from forraine inuaſions: the Prieſts liue more ſumptuouſly, and in far greater delights then others, wearing for the moſt part fine lightlinnen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiments downe to the foot, and ſomtimes garments made of the beſt and pureſt wooll.</p>
               <p>Vpon their heads they haue myters wrought and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered with gold: and in ſtead of ſhooes, ſandals of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers colours, wrought very artificially. They weare orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of gold alſo (like women, excepting eare-rings) and be for the moſt part continually conuerſant about the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of their gods, reciting their worthy and memorable deeds, in laudes and hymnes. They deriue their pedegree from <hi>Iupiter Manaſſes,</hi> alledging, that when hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant <note place="margin">Iupiter was baniſhed into Panchaia.</note> with men, and gouerned the whole world, hee was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:24800:40"/>
baniſhed into Panchaia. The country abounds with gold, ſiluer, braſſe, tin, and iron, of which it is not lawfull to carry any out of the Iland: neither is it tollerable for the Prieſts to ſtir out of their holy Temples; for if any of them be found abroad, it is lawfull to kill them. Many oblations of gold and ſiluer, which were long ſince offered and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their gods, they preſerue in their temple, the doores whereof are of a very curious building, beſet with gold, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and yuorie. The bed for their god is all of gold, being ſixe cubits in length, and foure in bredth, and of a rare and wonderfull workmanſhip: In like maner, the table for their god (which is placed neare vnto his bed) is equall vnto it, both for ſtate, quantity and coſt. They haue one great and magnificent temple, which is all erected of white ſtone, <note place="margin">The great Tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple in Panchaia</note> vnderſet with great pillars, &amp; carued columnes, the length thereof is two acres, and the breadth anſwerable to the length: It is adorned with goodly Idols of their gods, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and framed with admirable art and cunning. The Prieſts that haue charge of the ſacrifices, haue their houſes about the temple: and all the ground round about the temple, for the ſpace of two hundred <hi>Stadia,</hi> is conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the gods, and the yearely reuenew thereof ſpent in ſacrifices.</p>

now called Syria, and hath vpon the Eaſt, India, and part of Media, vpon the Weſt the riuer Tygris, Suſiana vppon the South, and the hill Caucaſus on the North. They haue ſeldome any raine in Aſſyria, but what graine ſoeuer the countrey affordeth, is obtained by the waterings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowings of the riuers, which they do not naturally of their owne accords, as in Aegypt, but by the labour and induſtrie of the inhabitants: and yet by this ouerflowing the ground there is ſo exceeding fruitfull, as it yeeldeth two hundred, and in the moſt fertill ſoyle, three hundred-fold increaſe: the eares of their wheate and barley beeing foure fingers in breadth, and their pulſe and millet in height like trees. Theſe things though they bee certainely knowne vnto them to be true, yet <hi>Herodotus</hi> would haue them ſparingly reported, and with good deliberation, as beeing ſcarce credible, eſpecially if the relation bee made to thoſe which neuer ſaw them.</p>

Their ſhooes be ſuch, as the Thebans were wont to weare: they ſuffer their haires to grow long, and trimme them with head-tyres: when they go into publike places, they annoynt themſelues with oyntments: euery one weareth a ſignet-ring on his finger, and a ſcepter in his hand, in which is ſet an apple, a roſe, or lilly, or ſome ſuch like thing: for they hold it baſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, to carry it without ſuch a ſigne or cogniſance in it.</p>

Of all their lawes which were in force in that countrey, this ſeemeth moſt worthie to be remembred: That the maides, aſſoon as they were mariageable, were (once euery <note place="margin">Virgins that be mariageable be ſold to their husbands.</note> yeare) brought into a publike place, and there offered to be ſold to ſuch men, as had any diſpoſition to marry: and firſt, the faireſt and moſt beautiful virgins were ſet to ſale, and after them, thoſe which through defect of their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or their bodies, were not onely not vendible and marketable, but which no man would marrie <hi>gratis,</hi> were married away with that money, the faire ones were ſold for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith, that this cuſtome was heretofore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in Venice in the confines of Illiria (as hee heard it credibly reported by others.) And <hi>Antonius Sabellicus</hi> in like manner affirmeth, that whether this cuſtome bee yet obſerued in that countrey, he is not very certaine: But ſure I am (ſaith he) that in Venice (which at this day for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is the moſt flouriſhing ſtate of the world) amongſt other good orders of their cittie, it was ordained, that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard virgins that were gotten out of wedlocke, and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that were expoſed and laid abroad to the aduentures of the world, ſhould be brought vp in ſome cloſe place, at the common charge of the cittie, and there inſtructed in ſome hard diſcipline, vntill they were mariageable, and that then thoſe which were moſt beautifull, and well brought vp, ſhould be married without dowrie, either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as had eſcaped ſome great perill, or ſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſeaſe, or broken their vowes: and that ſome Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alſo regarding their modeſtie and beautie, would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie them without dower, and euer thoſe which were moſt beautifull, were married with leſſe portion then the foule ones, although they were as well brought vp as the other.</p>

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:24800:41"/>
An other law of the Babylonians being very profitable and worthy to be remembred was this, ſeeing they exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">A law exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Phiſitions and how they cured the ſick.</note> all Phiſitions from amongſt them, it was ordained, that he which began to bee ſicke, ſhould aske councel of thoſe concerning his diſeaſe, that had ſuffred the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity themſelues, and that had tried ſome medicine for the recouery of their healthes: ſome others write that their cuſtome was to bring the ſicke perſons into a publicke place, where the law commanded them, and that thoſe which once had been ſicke themſelues, and were recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhould goe and viſit the diſeaſed perſons, and teach them by what meanes they were cured.</p>
               <p>The Aſſyrians bewaile the dead, as the Aegiptians doe: and when one hath laine with his wife all night, neither of them toucheth any thing before they haue waſhed themſelues. The cuſtome heretofore amongſt the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians was, that the women wold once in their life times lie with ſtrangers, beſides their husbands: the maner wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was thus: They would come a great company of them togither very reuerently and ſolemnly vnto the temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> each one hauing her head bound, and wreathed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with garlands, and then the ſtranger with whom ſhee deſired to lie, laied vnder his knee, as he kneeled in the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuch a ſum of money as he thought fitting, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſecrated to <hi>Venus,</hi> he leaueth behind him, &amp; ryſing vp, taketh the woman into a place a little diſtant from the Church, and there lieth with her: There were ſome fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies among the Aſſyrians which liued only vpon fiſh, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſun, and bruiſed in a morter, which being moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and laid togither, &amp; ſprinckled with water, they made into lumps, like loaues, and drying them at the fire, vſed to eate them in ſteed of bread.</p>

They had three head officers amongſt them, one of <note place="margin">The officers amongst the Aſſyrians.</note> ſuch as had beene ſouldiours and were put to their penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: an other of the nobility and elders, and the King which was head ouer them all: They had their ſouth-ſaiers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which were called <hi>Chaldei,</hi> which were like vnto the Prieſts of Aegipt, and ſacrificed to their gods: Theſe Chaldei ſpent their whole liues in the ſtudie of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, they were great ſtarre-mungers, and ſometimes by their diuinations, ſometimes by their holy rimes, they would defend men from misfortunes. They could truly and faithfully interprete Augurations, Dreames and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, not learning their inſtructions in ſuch things of maiſters and tutors, as the Greekes did, but receiuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their parents as their inheritance. The children were taught and excerciſed in learning at home, that by the continuall care of their parents, they might better profit themſelues. They Chaldei were not variable and doubtful in their opinions of naturall cauſes, as the Greekes were, where euery man was of a ſeueral minde, and euery wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yeelded reaſons, repugning one an other, but they all by one general and vniforme aſſent, ſuppoſed the world to be eternal, and that it neither had beginning, nor ſhal haue end, and that the order and ornament of al things is eſtabliſhed by a diuine prouidence: That the Celeſtiall bodies be not moued of their owne accord, or by ſome accidentary motion, but by a certaine law and immutable decreee of ſome god-head: They marke by long obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the courſe of the ſtars, by whoſe ſpeculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of mens future fortunes: They imagined the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets to be of great power, and eſpecially Saturne, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſunne to be of moſt beauty, and of greateſt vertue, and that <hi>Mars, Venus, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> were to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:24800:42"/>
more then the reſt, for that they hauing each one his proper and peculiar motion, foreſhewed things to come, and were the true interpreters of the gods: And of this they were ſo fully perſwaded, as they called theſe foure ſtars al by the name of <hi>Mercury:</hi> They foretold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to come both hole-ſome and hurtful, by winds, ſhewers, heate, comets, eclipſe of Sunne &amp; Moone, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and by ſundry other ſignes and prodigies beſides: And they imagined that there were other ſtars ſubiect &amp; inferior to theſe planets, of which ſome wandred in our Hemiſphere, and ſome in that which is vnder vs: beſides this they held the like error that the Aegiptians did, and fained to themſelues twelue gods, attributing vnto each of them a month &amp; a ſigne in the <hi>Zodiake:</hi> They prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of many things that ſhould happen to their Kings, as foreſhewing to <hi>Alexander</hi> the victory he ſhould haue in the fight with <hi>Darius:</hi> to <hi>Hircanor, Seleucus</hi> and to other ſucceſſors of <hi>Alexander:</hi> and many things after that to the Romaine ſucceſſors, whoſe euents proued true. They write alſo of foure and twenty other ſtars, whereof twelue be beyond the Zodiake, towards the North, and the other twelue towards the South, of which, thoſe which appeare to our view, they ſuppoſe to haue dominion ouer the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and the other to pertaine to thoſe which be dead: Theſe things &amp; other circumſtances haue thoſe Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſet forth to mens ſight, as they haue noted by long obſeruation, alleaging that this their doctrine hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for the ſpace of three and forty thouſand yeers, from the firſt inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof to the reigne of <hi>Alexander:</hi> which allegation of theirs were a very groſſe &amp; impudent fable, vnleſſe we ſhould interprete, that the time of each yeere were but a month, as was amongſt the Aegiptians.</p>

With theſe inſtitutions and ordinances both for home and abroade did <hi>Morſes</hi> inſtruct the Iſraelites, not long before his death, adding more-ouer a ſolemne prayer for the good ſucceſſe of thoſe that obſerued and fulfilled his lawes and ordinances, rightly, and as they ought, and bitter execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and curſes againſt the tranſgreſſors and offenders thereof.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all, hee bound the people with an oath, that they ſhould for euer obſerue and keepe thoſe diuine, and humaine lawes which he had inſtituted and ordained,

and that if any one did violate them, they ſhould not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to goe vnpuniſhed: And now ſeeing it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that there was neuer any people more ceremonious and religious then the Iſraelites, I thinke it worth while, briefly to expreſſe the manner of their ſacrificing, as it was firſt ordained.</p>
               <p>The Iewes had two ſorts of ſacrificing from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <note place="margin">The manner of the Iewes oblations.</note> the one whereof was done by the better ſort of people, and that they called <hi>Holocauſtus</hi> (that is a ſacrifice layde whole on the Altar) and was done in this manner, hee which intended to doe ſacrifice eyther with Oxe or Lambe, or what thing elſe hee meant to offer (for the beaſt which hee ſacrificed muſt bee a male beaſt, and of one yeare old,) brought the beaſt to the Altar, and then the Prieſt powring forth and ſprinkling the bloud of the ſacrifice vppon the Altar, and cutting the oblation in peeces, burned it whole vpon the Altar.</p>
               <p>The other ſort of ſacrificing, was for the common people, wherein they offered beaſts of aboue a yeare old, the bloud whereof beeing ſhedde, and the kidnees, fatte and ſuet, ſet on fire on the Altar, the hearts and right legges were giuen to the Prieſts, and the reſidue, they, for whom the ſacrifice was ſolemnized, did eate within two dayes after. Thoſe which were poore might offer two Pigions, or two Turtle Doues, whereof the one ſerued for a whole burnt ſacrifice, and for the other, the Prieſts did caſt lottes. Hee which offended vnawares, did ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſatiſfaction of that ſinne a Yew Lambe of an yeare old, or elſe a Kidde, and thoſe which were guilty of any ſecret fault in them-ſelues, were (by the very letter of the law) to bee purged by offering vp a Ramme. The fleſh of which oblations, whether they were publicke or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:24800:46"/>
priuate, the Prieſts did eate in the Temple: one meaſure containing a peck of the fineſt flower, was allowed for the oblation of a Lambe, for a Ramme two, and for a Bull three: There was alſo allowed Oyle, which was powred vppon the ſacrifice: A Lambe was publickly ſacrificed euery morning and euening, and vppon euery ſeuenth day, which was called their Sabbaoth, and which (by their law) they held moſt holy, there were double ſacrifices of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vpon their Altars: In the beginning of the month were offered for reconciliation, two Oxen, ſeauen yearling Lambes, one Ramme, and one Kidde, to which were added two Kiddes more, the one whereof was ſent out of the bounds of the Citty, and there offered as a ſatiſfaction for the ſinnes of the multitude, and the other was burned skinne and all in the pureſt place of the ſuburbes of the Citty.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts gaue a Bull ſanctified for that purpoſe, and a Ramme for a whole burnt ſacrifice. There was alſo other ſacrifices mingled with ordinary ceremonies, and holy dayes, ſuch was the fifteenth day of the month (which the Macedons called <hi>Hyperueretheus:)</hi> and vppon the returne of Autumne, they fixed their Tents or Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and keeping that day holy, offered yearely whole burnt offerings, the dooers thereof vppon the moneth Xanthicus, which is Aprill, carryed in their hands the boughes of Myrrh, Willow, Palmes, and Peach tree; where-vppon the yeare tooke his beginning vppon the day of the full Moone, the ſunne then entring into the ſigne <hi>Aries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe at that time the people of Iſrael were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of the land of Egipt, they ſacrificed the miſticall

Lambe, and celebrated the feaſts of vnleuened bread, or ſweete bread, in the full Moone, ſome few dayes after: vpon which dayes were euer burned, for a whole burnt ſacrifice, two Bulls, one Ramme, and ſeauen Lambes, wherevnto was added one Kidde, for ſatiſfaction for their ſinnes: in the ſecond day of Sweete-bread, were offered the firſt parts of their fruites, and a meaſure of Oyle, and in the beginning or ſpringing of their fruites, a Lambe for a whole burnt ſacrifice.

               <p>They ordained circumciſion of their priuities, that by that difference they might bee diſcerned from others, and the firſt leſſon they learne is to contemne the gods: The ſoules of thoſe which were ſlaine in battell or by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſuppoſe to be eternall.</p>

They thought all things to bee done by GOD and by deſtiny, and that to doe or neglect things that were lawfull and iuſt, conſiſted in the will of man, but yet that in all things fate was a furtherer, whoſe effects they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed to proceed from the motion of the Heauenly bodies.</p>
               <p>They would neuer contradict their elders nor ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: They beleeued the general iudgement, that al ſoules were incorruptible, that onely the ſoules of the good did flitte and remoue into other bodies, vntill the reſurrection and laſt iudgement, and that the ſoules of the wicked were detained and impriſoned in euerlaſting dungeons: and theſe were called Phariſes, becauſe in their habits and liuings they differed from the common diſpoſition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Saduces</hi> denied fortune and deſtiny, ſaying that <note place="margin">The Saduces,</note> God ſaw all thinges, and that it was in the will of man to do either good or euill; they denied that the ſoules after this life ſuffered eyther puniſhment or pleaſure: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied alſo the reſurrection of the dead, ſuppoſing their ſoules and bodies to periſh together, nor did they hold that there were any Angels, and yet they receiued the fiue bookes of <hi>Moſes;</hi> they were ſeuere without meaſure and nothing ſociable amongſt themſelues, for which ſeuerity they named themſelues Saduces, that is to ſay iuſt.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:24800:49"/>
accounted a reproach, and eſteemed a deformity in their trimming, to bee an ornament vnto them, ſo as they were alwayes arrayed in white garments: they had no certaine citty, but dwellings in euery place: They ſpake no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane words before the ſunne riſing, but praied for his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and after that, workt vnto the fift houre, then waſhing their bodies in water, they eate together with few words: They accounted an oath as periury, and allowed none to be of their ſect vnder a yeares probation: and after the firſt yeares tryall, when they were admitted, they tryed their manners other two yeares alſo, in which time if they were found in any ſinne, they would driue them away from them, that eating graſſe like beaſts, they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent till their deaths. When ten of them ſat together no one would ſpeake if nine of them were vnwilling, they would not ſpit in the middle, nor on the right ſide: They obſerued their ſabboth ſo religiouſly, that vpon that day they would not ſo much as purge their bellyes: They carryed with them a wodden Pickax, where-with they digged a hoale in the earth in ſome ſecret place to eaſe them-ſelues in, and couered themſelues diligently with their long garments, leaſt they ſhould doe iniury to the diuine lights, for which cauſe alſo they filled the hole againe preſently. They were long of life, by reaſon of the ſimpleneſſe of their dyet, for they liued for the moſt part with Dates, they had no vſe of money, and they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged that death the beſt which happened to a man for Iuſtice ſake. They hold, that all ſoules were created from the beginning, and incorporated for a time in mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and that the good ſoules after they departed from the bodyes, liued beyond the Ocean, where ioy is reſerued for them, and that the euill ſoules are aſſigned boyſtrous

and ſtormie places towards the Eaſt: Some of them could foretell things to come, and ſome vſed the company of wiues, but very moderatly, for they ſuppoſed, that if they ſhould altogether abſtaine from women, the whole ſtocke of humaine kinde would periſh. There dwell in Syria at this day Greekes, which bee called Gryphoni, Iacobites, Neſtorians, and Saraſins, and two people of the Chriſtian Religion, which bee the Syriani and the Marouini; the Syrians ſacrifice as the Greekes doe, and were ſome times obedient to the Church of Rome, but the Marouini agree with the Iacobites, and vſe the ſame language and writing the Arabians doe.

and on the Eaſt with Hircania and Parthia. Their chiefeſt exerciſe, and which is almoſt peculiar to that nation, is ſhooting and riding: Their Kings in ancient time were of great authority, their head attires, their round caps, and their garments with ſleeues, remooued with the Empire and gouernment vnto the Perſians. It was proper to the Median Kings to haue many wiues, which cuſtome was ſhortly put in practiſe amongſt priuate men, in ſo much as it was not lawfull to haue leſſe then ſeuen wiues. In like manner it was thought fitting for women to haue many husbands, and to haue leſſe then fiue they deemed a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The Medes make leagues and confirme friendſhip after the maner of the Greekes, and alſo by ſtriking their armes about the ſhoulder blade, and then to lick vp each others bloud.

               <p>They haue a mixt language borrowed of the Medes and Scythians, and compounded of them both: at the firſt their habites were anſwerable to their abilitie, and after their owne country faſhion, but waxing richer, they were as curiouſlie clothed as the Medes, their weapons were after the cuſtome of theyr owne countrey, and like vnto the Scythians.</p>

borne, and no power of manumiſſion permitted them, yet bee they brought vp with as great care and induſtry as if they were free-men, and taught both to ride and ſhoote, and euery one, as hee is in riches, traineth vp and ſetteth forth with the King, when hee goeth into the warres a great company of horſe men according to his abilitie, in ſo much as when <hi>Antonius</hi> made warres vpon the Parthians, and the Parthians incountring him with fifty thouſand horſemen, there were not found in all that whole troupe aboue eight hundred free-men: They cannot indure the ſingle combate, nor to remooue the aſſault from Citties beſieged, but their chiefeſt fight is with their horſes running forward, or turning backward, and ſome-times alſo they faine them-ſelues to flye, that thereby they may wound thoſe which vnwarily purſue them: The ſigne of battell is not giuen them with a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, but with a Timbrill, or Drumme, neither can they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure long fight, for ſurely they were not to bee reſiſted, if their courage and continuance were anſwerable to the aſſault and firſt brunt of the battell, and often-times they will leaue the battaile in the very heate of the conflict, and ſhortly after returne againe and begin a freſh, ſo as when the enemy thinketh himſelfe moſt ſecure, he is oftentimes in greateſt danger: The munition for their horſe-men are Brigandines, or coates of maile imbrodered, and with ſuch bee their horſes harneſſed likewiſe. In times paſt they had no other vſe of ſiluer nor golde then in their weapons: All of them haue many wiues, being mooued therevnto with the pleaſure of the variety of women, nor is there a more greeuous puniſhment for any offence, then for adultery, and therefore they forbid their wiues not onely to banquet with other men, but euen the very

ſight of them alſo. There bee ſome of opinion, whereof <hi>Strabo</hi> is one, that if the Parthians cannot beget children of their wiues them-ſelues, they will giue them in mariage to their friends, thereby to raiſe them iſſue to ſucceed them. They eate no other fleſh but what they get by hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they be euer carryed on horſe-back, for they ride to their banquets, they buy and ſell, conferre together, and execute all publicke and priuate offices on horſ-back.

The Perſians neither waſh themſelues in water, nor piſſe, nor ſpitte into it, nor throw any dead carcaſſe into it, nor prophane it any other kinde of way, but worſhip it moſt religiouſly, and that in this manner. When they come to a lake, riuer, or brooke, they make a little ditch or pond, ſeuered from the other water, and there they kill the ſacrifice, hauing ſpeciall regarde that none of the other water bee touched with the bloud, leaſt all ſhould be polluted: this done, and the fleſh layde vpon a mirtell or lawrell tree, the Prieſts or <hi>Magi</hi> make a fire with little twiggs, and therewith burne the ſacrifice till it be conſumed, and then ſprinkling and infuſing it with oyle mingled with milke and hony, they pray for a long ſpace together, not to the fire, nor water, but to the earth, holding in their hands all the while a bundle of Mirtle rods.

for they haue no lawes to recouer a thing committed or left in an other mans keeping, neither do they need wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes or ſeales, but credit one an other ſimply without intent of fraud or guile.

to doe them any iniury or damage, by which means the husbandmen, liuing voide of feare, and tilling the land in ſecurity, their labors yeeld them great plenty of increaſe: they come not at all into the Cities, but liue altogether in fields with their wiues and children; They pay tribute vnto their Kings (for all India is gouerned by Kings) and it is not lawfull for any priuate perſon to poſſeſſe any grownds without tribute, and beſides this tribute they yeeld vnto their Kings the fift part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of all their fruites.</p>
               <p>The third order conſiſteth of ſhepheards of all ſortes, which liue neither in Cities nor villages, but in tents and <note place="margin">The third or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is of ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards.</note> tabernacles, and practiſe hunting and fowling, whereby the country is free and ſafe both from rauenous birds and wild beaſts, for by this excerciſe they make all India more ciuill, abounding otherwiſe with many and diuers ſorts both of birds and beaſts, which would be much hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the husbandman: Artificers ſupplie the forth <note place="margin">Artificers the fourth order.</note> place, whereof ſome are occupied in making weapons and armour, ſome in making inſtruments for husbandry, and ſome in prouiding things neceſſary for themſelues: theſe be not onely free from tribute, but haue all their bread corne allowed them by the King.</p>

In the ſeuenth rancke be thoſe which bee of the common <note place="margin">The common Councell the ſeuenth order.</note> Councell, they be the feweſt in number, but in Nobilitie and vnderſtanding they exceede all the other Orders: out of this Order be elected the Kings Councellors, which are to gouerne the common-wealth, and to diſcern and iudge in doubtfull matters: Princes moreouer, and captaines are choſen out of this company. The common-wealth of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia beeing thus diſtributed into theſe ſeuen Orders, it is not lawfull for a man of one Order, to marry a wife out of another Order: neither is it lawfull for any one to alter his function; as for a ſouldier to become a husbandman, or for an artificer to play the Philoſopher. There be alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Preſidents or head Officers appointed amongſt the Indians, to defend and protect aliens and ſtrangers from iniury, and oppreſſion: and theſe (if any ſtrangers be ſicke) are to procure Phiſitians to cure them, and if they dye, they muſt bury them, and giue their money and goods to their neareſt friends: The Iudges determine controuerſies, and puniſh offenders: there be none of the Indians of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile condition; for it is ordained by a law, that none of <note place="margin">No ſlaues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jndians.</note> them ſhall be ſeruants; and ſo all being free-men, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of equall right and honor, ſo long as they neither go about to excell others, nor to iniure any man, but ſettle themſelues to indure all chances of fortune alike.

               <p>But now becauſe there bee ſundrie ſorts of people in India, which by reaſon of the ſpatiouſneſſe and large extent of the Countrey, differ both in forme and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: all of them therefore do not liue in that ciuil man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as I haue here declared.</p>

but ſome are of a more barbarous and rude behauiour, of which ſort ſome be ſituated towards the Sun-riſing, and be much giuen to breeding cattell, or other ſuch like courſe of life: and ſome liue altogether in mooriſh grounds, and feede on raw fiſhes, which they take by going out in botes made of Canes or Reedes, that be ſo great, that a bote is made of the ſpace that is betwixt two ioynts of the reede. Theſe Indians weare garments made of flags or ſedge, that groweth in riuers, which they plat together, and make in faſhion of a matte, and weare them as an armour for their bodies.</p>
               <p>Next vnto theſe Eaſt-ward, be certaine Indians, which <note place="margin">The Padae kill their friends when they be ſicke.</note> be heardſ-men, or breeders of cattell, and be called Padae, they feed on raw fleſh, and are ſayd to liue in this manner: when any citizens, either man, or woman is ſick, their moſt neareſt and familiar friends kill him, alleaging, that his languiſhing in ſickneſſe would make his fleſh corrupted and vnwholeſome for thoſe which ſhould eate it: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he deny himſelf to be ſick, yet they wil not pardon him, but kill him foorth with, and feed vpon him: and in ſuch manner as men are vſed by men, be women that bee ſicke dealt withall by women, that be their neareſt friends: And ſuch alſo as liue in health till they be old, be then kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and eaten by their friends: and therefore, both for this cauſe, and for that they be killed when they be ſicke, there be very few of them that liue till they be old. Another ſort of Indians haue a cuſtome different from thoſe which I haue ſpoken of, for they kill no creature, they neither ſow nor plant, nor prouide houſes, but liue onely by herbes: They haue a certaine graine much like vnto millet, which naturally ſpringeth out of the earth in a huske or codde, which they gathering, cod and all, boyle them and eate

them: when any of them falls ſicke, hee goeth into ſome deſert place, and there lyeth downe, and whether he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh or die, no one regardeth him: and alſo theſe Indians which I haue ſpoken of, accompany with women in the ſight of all people, after the manner of beaſts.</p>
               <p>In India bee certaine Philoſophers called Gymnoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts, <note place="margin">The Cymnoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts.</note> which (as <hi>Petrarch</hi> writeth) inhabite the vttermoſt and ſhadie parts of the region, and going euer naked, which is the cauſe they be ſo named. And wandring all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the wilderneſſe, do there teach Philoſophie: abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in one place from the Sunne-riſing, till his going downe, euer fixing their eyes, and beholding the circle of the brighteſt ſtarre: ſeeking out ſome ſecrets in the fierie globe. They will ſtand vpon their feete all day long, vpon the hote ſands, without ſhew of any griefe at all, patiently induring both the cold of the ſnow, and the heate of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>Amongſt whom be people called Brachmans; who (as <hi>Didimus</hi> their king writ to <hi>Alexander</hi> king of Macedon, when he was minded to make warre vpon them) do liue very vprightly and ſimply. They be not allured with dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of any novelties, nor deſire any thing elſe, but what the law of nature inforceth them: their diet is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing daintie, not ſuch as to ſatisfie their luxurie, is ſought out in all places, but ſuch as the earth produceth without labour or toyle furniſheth their tables with wholeſome and vnhurtfull diet, by which meanes they be very health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and vnacquainted with the names and nature of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie diſeaſes. No one imploreth helpe of another, where no one liueth to himſelfe, but all in common. They haue no ſuperiour, but be all equals, and therefore voide of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and emulation: for the equality of pouerty maketh

The Sunne yeeldeth them heate, the deaw moiſture, the riuers aſſwage their thirſt, and the earth affoordeth them beddes; where carke and care approch not neare their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, nor be their minds wearied or vexed with vaine cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, but only this, that their bodies proſtrate themſelues to do ſeruice to their ſoules. They make neither lime nor bricke wherwith to build them houſes, but rather chuſe to inhabite in holes digged in the earth, or vnder the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of hils, where they neither feare force of winds, nor rage of tempeſt: but ſuppoſe that the couerings of houſes are not ſo ſure a defence againſt ſhowers, as their holes, whereof they haue a double vſe; for they ſerue them for houſes while they liue, and for buriall when they die. Coſtly apparell they haue none, but couer their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with ruſhes, or to ſpeake more truely, with ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe. Their women be not adorned to pleaſe others, neither do they affect more beautie then they bee borne with: the men accompany with women, not for luſt, but for loue of increaſe.</p>

They haue no war, but continuall peace, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed not by force, but by friendſhip: the father follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his ſonne to his ſepulchre, nor is there any monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made for the dead, nor the aſhes of their burned bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies incloſed in coſtly coffins, which things they account as a puniſhment, not as an honour vnto them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Brachmans (as is ſayd) bee not oppreſſed with any peſtilence or other diſeaſes, becauſe they defile not the ayre with their beaſt-like acts: but with them, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is euer agreeable to the ſeaſon, and the Elements hold on their courſe without offence: a ſparing and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate diet is their pureſt Phiſicke, which is a readie medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, not onely to cure, but to preuent all diſeaſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.

               <p>They be not delighted (as many of vs be) in old wiues tales, but in the goodly order of the frame of the world, and the diſpoſition of naturall things: they haue no traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke into other Countries, nor do they ſtudie the art of Elo quence and Rhetoricke, but haue one ſimple and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Dialect amongſt them, teaching them only to ſpeake the truth. They frequent neither Court nor Scholes, whoſe doctrine, beeing repugnant, defineth nothing certain and ſtable. Some of theſe people account honeſtie their <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum,</hi> and ſome pleaſure. They kill no harmeleſſe beaſt to performe their diuine Ceremonies, ſaying, that God accepteth not of ſacrifices made with the bloud of things polluted, but that he is rather delighted in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy ſacrifice, and appeaſed by prayer, for they hold that God is like men in this, to be delighted in his own likenes.</p>

It is ſayd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that there is another ſort of women, which bring forth children when they be fiue yeares of age, and liue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the age of eight yeares. There be ſome people that haue no neckes, and haue their eyes in their ſhoulders, and beſides thoſe which I haue alreadie ſpoken of, there be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wild people liuing in woods, with heads like dogges,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:24800:61"/>
and their bodies couered with rough haire like briſtles, and make a very hideous and terrible noyſe: but theſe things and others of like kind, which are ſpoken and written of India, and of the ſundrie ſorts of people therein, (becauſe he that ſhould giue credit vnto them, behooued to be of a very ſtrong beleefe) are to be reported more ſparingly, leſt thoſe which reade forraine writings, ſhould be more nice, vnleſſe they be mooued thereunto with great earneſtnes, to giue credit to thoſe things, which are in a manner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent before our eyes.</p>
               <p>The Cathaeians do now inhabit that part of India, which <note place="margin">The Cathaeians</note> lyeth betwixt Gedroſia, and the riuer Indus, which by them is now called Cathaia. The people be of the Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans race, in whom may be perceiued great alteration of manners, from that the Scythians were in the beginning, if all be true which <hi>Armenius Aitonus</hi> reported of them in his Hiſtorie: For (ſaith he) they be very wiſe, and report of themſelues, that of all men they onely ſee and diſcerne with two eyes, and that all other people bee altogether blind, or of one eye at the leaſt. The quickneſſe of their wittes is great indeede, but their boaſting and oſtentation is greater.</p>
               <p>They be generally perſwaded, that they excell all men in the ſubtiltie and knowledge of arts: they be naturally white and pale of complexion, with little eyes and no beards, they vſe letters in forme like vnto the Romain let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: ſome of them be blinded in the folly of one ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſome in another; but all be voide of the true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for ſome adore the Sunne, ſome the Moone, ſome I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols made of mettall, and many of them an oxe: through which diuerſitie of falſe worſhipping, monſtrous ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is diſperſed throughout the whole nation. They haue
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:24800:61"/>
no written lawes, nor know not what faith is, and though they ſhew great wit in their works, yet haue they no know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge thereby of diuine matters. They be a timerous kinde of people, and feare death greatly, yet they make warres, but it is with more policie then fortitude. They vſe darts in their warres, and other ſorts of weapons, which to people of many other nations be vnknowne. They haue paper money foure-ſquare, and ſtamped with the Kings Image, which when it waxeth old, they change with the king for coine that is new ſtamped: their houſhold ſtuffe is of gold, ſiluer, and other mettal. They haue very litle oyle, and with that the kings do onely vſe to annoynt themſelues. And thus much of the Indians, now will we ſpeake of the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, which be next vnto the Indians.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:24800:62"/>
their poſſeſſions: ſo as now they enioy all the vplandiſh, and hilly Countries, vnto Caucaſus, and all the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion ground vnto the Ocean, and Maeotis poole, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places euen to the riuer of Tanais; from whence Scythia ſtretcheth out in length towards the Eaſt, the hill Imaus lying in the middle, and diuiding it into two parts, maketh thereof as it were two Scythias, whereof one is called Scythia within the hill Imaus, the other, Scythia without Imaus.</p>
               <p>The Scythians were neuer inuaded, or at the leaſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vanquiſhed by any forraine gouernement: for they forced <hi>Darius</hi> king of Perſia moſt ſhamefully to retire and flie from Scythia: they killed <hi>Cyrus</hi> with all his hoaſt, they ouerthrew the Captaine of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, with all his Companie: and as for the Romanes, they might well heare of them, but they neuer felt their forces. The people be of great ſtrength of bodie, and very rude both in their wars and workes.</p>
               <p>The Scythians at the firſt were not diſtinguiſhed into Companies, nor ſeuered one from another, for that they neither poſſeſſed any grounds, nor had any ſeates or hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to dwell in, but wandered through wilderneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart places, driuing their flockes and heards of beaſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and carrying their wiues and children with them in carts. They were ſubiect to no lawe, but liued iuſtly one with another of their owne accords, and no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence throughout their whole nation was accounted more haynous then theft, becauſe their cattell lay abroad in all mens ſight, not incloſed with walles or hedges. They vſed neither gold nor ſiluer: milke and honie was their vſuall meate: they defended their bodies againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of cold with the skinnes of myce or rattes, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:24800:62"/>
other wilde beaſtes. And the vſe of wooll and woollen garments was vnknowne vnto them.</p>
               <p>This was the manner of liuing of moſt of the Scythians, but not of all: for many of them, as they bee farre diſtant from others in dwellings, ſo be they as different in their manner of liuing, as maintaining cuſtomes peculiar to themſelues; of which hereafter wee will relate in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: for as yet we ſhall ſpeake of ſuch cuſtomes as be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to them all.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the Scythians delight in humane ſlaughter, for <note place="margin">The Scythians delight in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſlaughter</note> the firſt man a Scythian taketh in the warres, his bloud he drinketh, and of all thoſe which he ſlayeth in battell, hee preſenteth the heades to the King: for the heades beeing cut off, how euer he tooke them, he ſhall be partaker of the prey, but not otherwiſe. And he cutteth off the head round like a circle about the eares, and then ſhaketh out al which is within the skull: after this he pulleth off the skinne from the bodie, and mollifying it with his hands, like the hyde of a beaſt, vſeth it as a mantle, and hangeth it at his bridle raines, triumphing and glorying of ſuch a prey. And hee which hath the moſt of thoſe mantles, is adiudged the worthieſt man. There be many alſo which ſow mens skins together, like beaſts skinnes, and thereof make them ſhort garments or cloakes, and weare them. Some others flea the right hands of their ſlaine enemies, and with the ſame make couerings for their quiuers: and many flea the whole bodies, and ſtretching out the skinnes vppon blockes of wood, carrie them about vpon their horſes: the heads being cut off in this manner, as I haue ſayd, they couer the vtmoſt ſide of them with Oxe leather, and thoſe which be rich, guild them within with gold, and ſo vſe them for pots to drinke in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:24800:63"/>
And ſuch men of eſtimation as giue intertainement to ſtrangers, will ſhew vnto them, that thoſe were the heades of ſuch men as they had vanquiſhed in the wars, bragging thereof as a point of great man-hood. Once euery yeare all the Princes and gouernors of the region, fill a pot full of wine, of which all the Scythians which haue ſlaughtered any of their enemies, do drinke, but they which haue done no notable exploit, taſt not thereof, but ſit by without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or regard, which among them is the greateſt ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that may be. And thoſe which haue committed the moſt ſlaughters, ſhall drinke of two pots which they haue there readie prouided for the purpoſe. Their gods which they worſhip and adore, are the virgin <hi>Veſta</hi> as principall: next vnto her, <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Tellus,</hi> (for <hi>Tellus</hi> they ſuppoſe <note place="margin">The Scythian gods.</note> to be the wife of <hi>Iupiter)</hi> after theſe they honor <hi>Apollo, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Hercules:</hi> but they thinke it not fit to make Idols, Altars, or Temples, to any of theſe gods or goddeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but onely to <hi>Mars,</hi> to whom they ſacrifice euery hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth captiue, to the reſt of their gods they ſacrifice beaſts, and eſpecially horſes. Hogges are in no account amongſt them, neither breed they any throughout the whole regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When the King puniſheth any man by death, hee ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth none of his male-children, but ſlayeth them all, but he hurteth no woman-kind.</p>
               <p>When the Scythians confirme friendſhip, or make a league or peace one with another, they put wine into a great earthen pot, and then cutting ſome part of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which make the peace, with a knife, or with a ſword, they mingle their bloud with the wine: after that, they dip their ſwords, arrowes, axes, and iauelins into the cuppe, which when they haue done, they vow friendſhip one to another with many proteſtations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:24800:63"/>
And then is the wine drunke vp, not onely by thoſe which make the league, but all their followers and partakers, which bee of moſt dignitie and eſtimation, drinke of it alſo. The maner of buriall of Kings which is vſed of the people, that inhabite about the riuer of Gerrus, where Boryſthenes is now nauigable, is in this maner: when their King is deceaſed, they digge a great foure-ſquare hole in the earth, and there lay him for a ſpace, after that they take the dead bodie and bowell it, and ceare it with waxe, and fill it full of ozier branches bruſed, a ſweet perfume called red Stirax, the ſeed of percely, ſmallage, and annis-ſeeds, and ſo ſow it vp againe, and then putting the carcaſe into a cart, they conuey it into another country, where it is vſed as before, and ſo interred.</p>
               <p>But the Scythians cut off their dead kings eares, clip his <note place="margin">How the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians bury their kings.</note> haire round, cut his armes about, wound him in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and noſe, ſtrike his left hand through with a dart, and then carry the carcaſe into another nation, which is vnder their gouernment, the people whereof attend vpon them vnto another country. And when they haue beheld all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the kings corps with them, they leaue it to bee buried of thoſe people that inhabite the vttermoſt parts of their kingdome; who when they haue put it into a coffin and laid it vpon a bed, they ſticke downe certaine ſpeares, and laying him vpon the ſpeares, couer him with a coat: then do they ſtrangle one of his ſtrumpets which he loued moſt dearely in his life time, one groome, one cooke, one horſe-keeper or muletor, one ſergeant; one butler, or cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, and one horſe, and bury them altogether, with gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cups, and the firſt fruites of all their increaſe in the ſpatiouſneſſe of the Tombe or Sepulchre And when hee hath lyen there a yeare, they take the moſt neere of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:24800:64"/>
kings houſhold ſeruants: (and all the Scythian ſeruants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on the king he free borne, and by him comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſerue: and no ſeruant bought with money doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the king.)</p>
               <p>And after they haue ſtrangled fiftie of theſe men-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and as many of the beſt horſes, the mens bowels beeing firſt taken out, and their garments ſtretched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, and ſowed together, they ſet vp, round about the circuit of the Kings tombe vppon arched worke, thoſe fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie horſes, and the ſeruants ſitting vppon their backes: ſo as they may ſeeme afarre off to the beholders, like a troupe of horſemen keeping their dead King. And this is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and cuſtome of interring and ſepulture of their Kings in Scythia.</p>
               <p>Priuate men alſo obſerue a certaine cuſtome in their burials: for when one dyeth, all his neighbours laying him in a cart, carrie him about to his friends, and each one of his friends receiuing him, maketh a banket, as well to his neighbours and kinsfolke, as to the reſt which accompany the coarſe. His bodie beeing thus carried from place to place, for the ſpace of fortie dayes, is then interred, his head beeing firſt emptied and cleane waſhed: aboue the bodie they ſet three ſtickes bending one towards another, vppon which they ſet wollen cappes, as many as they can, and then they put the carcaſe into a cheſt or coffin, made of one tree like a trough, and ſet it vnder the cappes, and ſo fill vp the coffin with bright ſtones.</p>
               <p>The men of Scythia do neuer waſh themſelues, but their wiues infuſing water vppon their bodies, rubbe them againſt a rough ſtone, with Cypreſſe, Cedar, or the wood of Frankinſence, and after their bodies are rubbed, and beginne to ſmell, they beſmeare their faces ouer
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:24800:64"/>
with medicines or oyntments; theſe oyntments make them to haue an odoriferous ſme<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> And the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they remooue thoſe medicines, and make their faces cleane and bright againe.</p>
               <p>Their manner of ſwearing and miniſtring an oath to others, is by the Kings throne, whereby if any one be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of periurie, (by the Deuinors which make triall thereof, with willow rods or wands) hee is put to death without delay, and forfeiteth all his goods to thoſe which prooued him periured.</p>
               <p>The Maſſagetae, a people of Scythia in Aſia beyond the <note place="margin">The Maſsagetae</note> Caſpian ſea, in apparell and liuing be very like vnto theſe Scythians, and therefore ſuppoſed of many to be Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans indeed: They fight both on foote and horſe-backe, and in both ſorts of fight be almoſt invincible. Their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons be darts and ſpeares, and a certaine ſword or weapon which they vſually weare about them, called a ſangar, they vſe gold in their belts, ſword-hangars, and head at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, and in guilding their pottes: they put vppon their horſes breaſts, breſt-plates of gold, their bridles and trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings be all of gold, and their ſpeeres be poynted and their quiuers trimmed with Braſſe, for of Iron and ſiluer they haue no vſe. Euery one hath his wife, and they accompany with women openly, which is vſed by no other Scythians, but onely they, if they be iuſtly accounted Scythians: for when any one there luſteth after another woman, he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his quiuer at his chariot, and lyeth with her without ſhame. The people haue no time prefixt them how long they ſhal liue, but when one waxeth old, his friends aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together, and ſacrifice him with certaine ſheepe, and boiling the fleſh together make a banket thereof. And this kind of death they account moſt bleſſed: but they eat none
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:24800:65"/>
which die by any diſeaſe, but bury them in the ground, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming them damn<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, becauſe they could not be ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. They neither ſow nor plant any thing, but liue of beaſts and of fiſhes, which the riuer Araxis affoords abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly: their vſuall drinke is milk. Of the gods they worſhip only the Sun, to whom they ſacrifice horſes, thinking it fit to ſacrifice a beaſt of the greateſt ſpeede, to a ſtarre of the ſwifteſt courſe. The people called Seres in Scythia, of all <note place="margin">The Seres in Scythia.</note> others liue moſt curteouſly and quietly among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, they auoid the company of all other men but themſelues, and deſpiſe the intercourſe of merchandize with other countries: for their merchants haue no communication for buying and ſelling with ſtrange Merchants, but onely ſet downe a price vpon their goods, and deliuer them by racke of eye, without buying any thing of others: with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is neither, whore, adulterer, nor theefe brought to triall: neither is any man there put to death at any time: but the feare of their lawes with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of more force, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their natiuities. They inhabit in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, and that they may the better liue chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they be neither afflicted with canker or corruption, nor with haile or peſtilence. When a woman is conceiued with child, no man requireth her company, nor till ſhe be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: no one eateth vncleane fleſh: they know no ſacrifices, and all men iudge of themſelues according to iuſtice and right: wherefore they be not chaſtiſed with ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as are inflicted vpon men for their offences, but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a long ſpace yeeld vp their breaths without ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Tauro-Scythians (ſo called of the hill Taurus about <note place="margin">The Tauro-Scythians.</note> which they dwel,) ſacrifice al thoſe which ſuffer ſhip wrack vnto a virgin which they worſhip as a goddeſſe: as alſo all the Greeks which be brought thither, in this manner.</p>

After they haue finiſhed their praiers, they cut off his head whom they meane to ſacrifice, and (as ſome ſay) throw his truncke head-long downe a Rocke (for their Temple is ſcituated vpon a ſteepe Rocke) which done they naile the head vpon a croſſe or gybbet. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing that their heads bee faſtned to a croſſe, as is ſaid, doe notwithſtanding deny that their bodies be throwne head-long down a Rocke, but affirme that they bury them in the grownd.</p>

               <p>There be no Cities or great townes in the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but onely one called Cracuris: and wood is ſo ſcarce in moſt places there, as the inhabitants be conſtrained to burne and boile their meate with horſdung &amp; beaſts dung. The weather there is very intemperate and moſt ſtrange,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:24800:67"/>
for in the Summer-time they haue ſuch horrible and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thunders and lightnings, as many men die for very feare: it is euen now maruellous hot and by and by there will be extreame cold and ſnowes: and the ſtormes and winds oftentimes bee ſo boyſterous, as people bee not able to ride againſt them, but that they blow men downe from their horſes, pull trees vp by the rootes, and doe the people many and great dammages: It neuer rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there in Winter, and but ſeldome times in Sommer, and then ſo ſmall a raine as it ſcarce moyſtneth the earth.</p>
               <p>The Country otherwiſe aboundeth with all kinds of <note place="margin">Tartaria a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth with cattaile.</note> beaſts as Camels, Oxen and ſuch like, and laboring beaſts and Horſes in ſuch aboundance, as it is thought that all the reſidue of the world hath ſcarce ſo many beſides. Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria was firſt inhabited of foure ſundry ſorts of people, <note place="margin">Foure ſorts of Tartarians.</note> one ſort whereof were called Iecchamongall, that is to ſay great Mongals, the ſecond Sumongall which is watry Mongals, and thoſe called themſelues alſo Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of the riuer Tartar, neere which they dwelled, the third were called Merchat, and the fouth Metrit, they had all like forme and lineaments of body, and ſpake all one language.</p>
               <p>The ancient Tartarians were of a rude behauiour, and liued without manners, lawes or other ornamentes of life, and beeing of an obſcure name, and very baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed of amongſt all the Scythians, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their cattaile, and paide tribute vnto them for their dwellings.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, this people being deuided as it were into certaine tribes or kindreds, were firſt ruled by captaines, who had the ſole gouernment ouer them, they paying
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:24800:68"/>
tribute notwithſtanding to their next bordering neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the Naymans: But when by a certaine Oracle they had elected and created <hi>Canguiſta</hi> their firſt King, hee tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Canguiſta <hi>firſt King of Tartaria.</hi>
                  </note> vpon him the Empire, did firſt aboliſh the worſhip of all euill ſpirits and falſe gods, and made an Edict that all the Nation ſhould worſhip the true God, by whoſe prouidence hee would haue all men thinke, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his Kingdome. Hee commanded likewiſe that all that by their age were able to beare armes, ſhould bee ready to attend the King at a certaine daie, where when they were aſſembled, the army was diſtributed in this manner. Firſt that the Decurions which were captaines ouer tenne ſouldiours, ſhould obey the centurions, which were captaines ouer an hundred foote-men, the centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions ſhould be obedient to thoſe which were Captaines and Coronels of a thouſand men, and thoſe againe ſhould be at the command, of thoſe which were gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of tenne thouſand: and then to trie the ſtrength of his Empire, and to haue experience of his ſubiects hearts, hee commaunded that ſeuen of thoſe Princes or Gouernours ſonnes, which ruled the people before hee was ordained King, ſhould bee ſlaine by the hands of their owne fathers.</p>
               <p>This command of the King the fathers fulfilled (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeemed very bitter and cruel) both for feare of the multitude, and alſo for religions ſake, for they verily beleeued that the God of Heauen was firſt author and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituor of their Kingdome, and that if they ſhould not performe his command, they ſhould not onely tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe and violate the law of a King, but the law of God alſo. <hi>Canguiſta</hi> being thus fortified, and putting confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his power, firſt ſubdued by battaile the Scythians,

which were next vnto him, and made them tributary, and with them, all thoſe to whom the Tartarians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before that time paide tribute: from thence going forward to people more remote, he had ſuch proſperous and happy ſucceſſe in the warres, as hee ſubdued with his forces all Kingdomes, Countries and Nations from Scythia to the Sunne ryſing, and from thence to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean ſea, and beyond, ſo as now he may iuſtly be ſaid, to bee Lord and Emperour of all the Eaſt: The Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians of all men be moſt deformed in body, they bee for the moſt part little men, hauing great eyes ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farre out of their heads, and ſo much couered with eye-lids, as the ſight or opening of the eye is maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous little: their faces be broad and without beards, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that they haue ſome few ſtragling haires vpon their vpper lips and chinnes, they be all of them commonly ſlender in the waſte, and ſhaue all the hinder partes of their heades from one eare to the other, and vppe to the crowne, they weare the reſt of their haires long like vnto our women, of which long haire they make two ſtrings or cords, bynding or winding them ouer both their eares, and in this manner be all Tartarians ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and all thoſe people alſo which liue amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer they be very nimble and actiue of bodie, good horſe-men, but bad footemen, and they neuer goe afoote, but the pooreſt of them, whither euer he hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to goe, rydeth either on horſe or oxe-backe; their women ride alſo vpon geldings, and ſuch as will not ſtrike or kicke: their bridles bee richly decked with gold, ſiluer and precious ſtones.</p>
               <p>They hold it a glorious thing to haue little belles
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:24800:69"/>
hanging about their horſe neckes, they haue a very ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured and clamerous kinde of ſpeech: for when they ſing they howle like Wolues, and when they drinke they ſhake their heades, and they drinke very often and for the moſt part vntill they bee drunke, for to bee drunke they account a great commendations vnto them.</p>
               <p>They neither dwell in Citties nor Townes, but in the fields vnder tents and Tabernacles, after the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtome of the Scythians. They bee (for the moſt part) all ſhepheards and heardſmen: In Winter they lie in the plaine and champion grounds, and dwel vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hilles in Sommer, liuing there vpon the profits of the paſtures; They make themſelues manſion pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in manner of tents or pauillions, either of little ſprouts or twigges, or elſe of cloath ſuſtained vp with ſmall timber, in the middle whereof they make a rounde window, which ſerueth both to giue light and to let out the ſmoke, and they make fires for all vſes, the men take great delight in ſhooting and wreſtling. They bee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull good huntſmen, and be armed from the toppe to the toe when they goe a hunting, and when they ſee any wilde beaſt, they preſently incloſe him in rounde about on euery ſide, and ſtopping and hindering him with dartes, kill him and ſo take him by that meanes: bread they haue none, and therefore they haue no vſe of bake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither doe they vſe any towelles, napkins nor table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes: They beleeue that there is one God, and that hee is the maker and author of all things viſible and inuiſible, yet doe they not worſhip him with any cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or religious rites, but rather making themſelues certaine Idoles, either of cloth or of ſilke in the forme
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:24800:69"/>
of men, and placing them vpon each part of their Paui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, pray vnto them to bee defenders of their Cattell, and giuing them great reuerence, offer vnto them of the milke of al their ſheepe and Cattel, and before they begin eyther to eate or drinke any thing, they ſet part thereof before thoſe Idoles: what beaſt ſoeuer they kill to eate, they lay his heart in a platter all night and in the morning boyle it and eate it, they worſhippe alſo and doe ſacrifice vnto the Sunne, the Moone, and the foure elements, and moſt religiouſly adore <hi>Cham</hi> their King and Lord, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him to bee the Sonne of God, and to him the doe ſacrifice and attribute ſo much honor, as they ſuppoſe him to be the worthieſt man in all the world, nor will the ſuffer any one els to bee compared vnto him: all other people they do ſo much contemne and deſpiſe, and thinke them-ſelues ſo farre excelling others in wiſdome and goodneſſe, as they ſcorne to ſpeake vnto them, but dryue them from them with rebukes and diſdaine.</p>
               <p>They call the Pope and all Chriſtian men dogges and Idolaters becauſe they worſhippe ſtockes and ſtones, they bee much giuen to Diuiliſh and Magike arts, and obſeruing dreames haue their wiſe men to expound and interpret them, who do aske and receiue anſweres of their Idols, for they perſwade them-ſelues that GOD hath conference with their Idolls, and therefore they doe all things by Oracles, they obſerue certayne tymes, and eſpecially when the change of the Moone is, yet they doe worſhipppe nor honour no one time beefore another, eyther by Feaſting or Faſting, but eſteeme of all alike.</p>
               <p>The Tartarians bee ſo much giuen to coueteouſneſſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:24800:70"/>
and auarice, as when any one of them ſeeth a thing, that hee hath a deſire to, if hee may not haue it by the good will of the owner, hee taketh it by force, ſo it bee not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to one of their owne country men, ſuppoſing it lawfull ſo to doe, by the commandement and ordinance of their Kings, for they haue this power giuen them by <hi>Canguiſta</hi> and <hi>Cham</hi> their firſt Kings, that what Tartarian ſoeuer, or Tartarian ſeruant, ſhall finde vpon the way any horſe, or meete any man or woman not hauing the Kings paſport, or letters of ſafe-conduct, hee may challenge them to him-ſelfe and euer after vſe them as his owne.</p>
               <p>They will lend no mony to thoſe that want, but for an exceſſiue and intollerable gayne, as taking a penny for tenne pence for euery monthes vſe, and vſury vpon v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury if the payment bee deferred, and they moleſt and greeue thoſe which bee tributary vnto them, with ſuch payments and exactions, as it was neuer reade of any nation that did the like, It is incredible to bee reported how they couet and extort, as if they were lords of all, but giue nothing, not ſo much as an almes to beggars, yet in this they are to bee commended, that they exclude and put backe noe gueſt that commeth to them to dinner or ſupper; but rather inuite them and giue them to eate ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry curteouſly and charitably.</p>
               <p>They bee of a very vncleane diet, for they haue neither table-clothes nor napkins as is ſayde, neither doe they waſh their hands, bodies nor apparell. They make no bread for they eate none, neither doe they eate hearbes or any kinde of graine but the fleſh of all beaſts, as dogges, cattes, horſes and rattes, and to ſhew their barbarous
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:24800:70"/>
cruelty and deſire of reuenge, they ſome-times roſt or broyle the bodies of their captiue enemies vpon the fire, and in their ſollemne bankets teare and deuour them with their teeth like wolues; and ſauing their bludds, power it into a potte and drinke it, and ſome-times alſo they drinke milke, the country yeeldeth noe wine, but what is brought to them from other places, and that they drinke moſt greedily, they eate the vermine from one anothers heads, or other places, in eating whereof they vſe to ſay theſe words <hi>ſic inimicis noſtris faciam,</hi> this wil I doe vnto our enemies.</p>
               <p>It is accounted a great offence, that eyther meate or drinke ſhould bee ſpoiled, and therefore they throw not their bones to dogges before they haue taken out the marrow, they be ſo ſparing and niggardly as they will eat no beaſt while he is whole and ſound, but when they bee lame or begin to languiſh, either through age or ſome other infirmity.</p>
               <p>They bee exceeding frugall and thrifty and content with a little, inſomuch as they will drinke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nig a bole or two of milke, and ſome-times neither eate nor drinke more of all the day after. The men and women bee almoſt apparelled alike, for the men weare <note place="margin">How the Tartarians are apparrelled.</note> ſhallow Miters vpon their heads, made blunt before, and a taile or labell hanging downe behind, of a hand bredth in length, and as much in bredth; and that they may ſtay vpon their heads, and not bee blowne of with the winde, they haue ſtrings ſowed to them about the eares; and thoſe they tie vnder their chins. The maried women weare vpon their heads a certaine round cappe, made like a bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of a foote and a halfe in length, and plaine vpon
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:24800:71"/>
the toppe like a barrell, wrought eyther of party-coule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſilke, or of Peacocks fethers, and adorned about with great ſtore of golde and precious ſtones, vpon the reſt of their bodyes they weare ſuch garments as their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties bee able to affoord them, the richer ſort of women goe in Purple and ſilke, and their husbands likewiſe: their coates bee of a very ſtrange faſhion, for the ſlitte or hole whereby they put them off and on is vppon the left ſide, and buttoned with foure or fiue buttons. In the Summer they weare black garments, and in Winter and rainy wether, white, and their clothes come downe no lower then their knees: they weare garments alſo made of skinnes, but not as wee doe with the hayrie ſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but with the fleſh ſides towards their bodyes, and the hayrie ſides outwards, ſhewing the hayre for comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and decencie: maides by their apparell can hardly bee diſcerned from marryed women, nor the marryed women, be diſtinguiſhed from the men, for there is no great difference betwixt them, eyther in habite or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, for all weare breeches alike. When they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelues to the warres, ſome of them couer their armes (which otherwiſe bee naked) with yron plates lincked together with Letherne thongs, and ſome with diuerſe foldes of Lether, with which alſo they make defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for their heads: ſhields they haue none, and but few of them eyther launces, or long ſwords: yet they haue ſwords, but not aboue the length of ones arme, and made with an edge vpon the one ſide like back-ſwords wherwith when they fight, they ſtrike with that ſide which is ſharpe, they be very light and perfect horſe-men, and maruelous good archers, and he is accounted of the greateſt courage
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:24800:71"/>
and valour which is moſt obedient vnto gouernment.</p>
               <p>They ſerue in the warres without wages, and bee very ſubtil and cunning both in the warres and other buſineſſes, and ready to take vpon them any charge, or to vndergoe any matter of importance whatſoeuer, the Captaines and gouernors enter not into the battell them-ſelues but ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aloofe incourrage &amp; exhort their ſouldiers diligently, foreſeeing and conſidering what is neceſſary to bee done, and to the end their army may ſeeme the greater, and more terrible to the enemy, they bring their wiues and children into the army with them, and ſometimes the images of men ſet faſt vpon horſes, nor do they thinke it a diſgrace for them to fly if it bee either behouefull, or neceſſary: when they ſhoote they diſarme their right armes, and then their darts fly with ſuch vehement forces, as they will perce any kind of armor: they begin the battell in order, and keepe their aray in retyring euen, then deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſlaying with their darts their enimies which purſue them, and if they perceiue the number of thoſe which purſue them to bee but ſmall, they ſodainly returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the battell, wounding with their darts both men and horſe, and euen then they get the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, when they were thought to haue beene conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: When they intend to inuade or make warre vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any country, they deuide their army into ſundry companies and giue the aſſaulte on euery ſide, ſo as they can hardly bee incountred or reſiſted, nor any of the inhabitants eſcape; and by this policie they haue alwaies the victory in their owne owne hands.</p>
               <p>And they vſe their victory very proudly and cruelly ſparing neither old men, women, nor children, but put all to the ſword without difference, artificers onely
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:24800:72"/>
excepted, which they reſerue to worke for them. They deuide them to bee ſlaine by the Centurions, aſſigning to euery ſeruant for his part of the ſlaughter, tenne, or more, or leſſe, as the number of the Captiues bee, which when they haue butchered with Axes, like Swine, for a greater terror to others, they take euery thouſand Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and turning his head downe-wards, hang him vp by the heeles vppon a ſtake made faſt in the ground, in the middle of thoſe which bee ſlaine, as if hee ſhould then admoniſh and aduiſe his friends, whilſt the moſt of thoſe murtherers, approching to the ſlaine bodyes, doe with their mouthes ſwill vp the bloud which ſpringeth from their greene wounds.</p>
               <p>They keepe their faith and promiſe with none, how euer they bee obliged vnto them, but rage towards their owne ſubiects in this manner, and farre more greeuouſly: It is lawfull for them to deflowre as many young Virgins as they will or can get, and thoſe which bee any thing beautifull, bee carryed away with them, and conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſerue continually in extreame penurie of all things. The Tartarians of all men be moſt incontinent, for although they may marry as many wiues as they will, or as they bee able to keepe, and that they bee not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden mariage with any degree of affinitie, or conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity (mothers, daughters, and ſiſters onely excepted) yet bee they exceedingly giuen to the ſinne of Sodome, accompanying both with their owne ſex and with beaſts, as vilely as the Sarraſins, without eyther difference or puniſhment: They account not the woman which they marry for their wife, nor yet receiue her dower before ſhee hath had a childe, and if ſhee bee barren it is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:24800:72"/>
lawfull for them to put her a way and to marry another. And this is ſtrange, that although many women haue but one husband, yet they neuer fall out for him amongſt them-ſelues, although one bee preferred before another, and hee ſleepeth now with one, and by and by with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and euery one of theſe wiues haue their abyding place by them-ſelues, and euery one keepeth her owne family. They liue moſt chaſt from other mens wiues, for as well the men as women which bee taken in adultery, ſuffer death by their lawe: thoſe men which bee not tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp in the warres, keepe Cattell in the fields, practiſe hunting and wreſtling, without doing any other domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call buſineſſe but commit all to women vpon whoſe care it reſteth to prouide all things neceſſary both for victualls and clothing.</p>
               <p>This nation obſerueth many ſuperſtitions, for to put a knife into the fire, or at the leaſt to let it touch the fire, or to pull fleſh out of a potte with a knife, is held a great offence, moreouer they cut nothing with a hatchet neere vnto the fire, leaſt they ſhould hurt it any manner of way, for they honour the fire moſt religiouſly, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them-ſelues that there-with all things ought to bee purified and clenſed.</p>
               <p>They greatly abhore to lay either their body or armes, when they ſleepe or take their reſt, vpon a whippe where-with they driue their horſes, (for ſpurres they vſe none) or to tuch their darts with a whip; and yong men doe not onely auoyd the killing of birds, but the taking of them alſo: they will not beate a horſe with his brydle nor breake one bone with an other, nor yet ſpend ether meate or drinke out of meaſure and eſpecially milke, noe one dare piſſe within his pauillion or manſion houſe, for if
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:24800:73"/>
any one doe it abſtinately, he is put to death without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but if neceſſity conſtraine one to doe it, as oftentimes it happeneth, then the tent or pauilion wherein it was done, and all things within it, ought to bee purged and clenſed, on this manner: Firſt they make two fires three paces diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant one from another, betwixt which they faſten two forkes or iauelins vpright in the ground, by each fire one, then drawing a cord from the one fire to the other, they carry forth through the middle of the iauelins, as it were through a gate, all things which are to be purified, two women (to whome the buſineſſe is committed) ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the other ſide, one ouer againſt an other, caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting water vpon the ſtuffe, and muttering out certaine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to themſelues.</p>
               <p>No ſtranger is admitted into the kings preſence, of what eſtate or dignity ſoeuer he be, and be his buſineſſe of neuer ſo much importance, vnleſſe he bee firſt purified: he that ſpurneth with his foote at the threſhould of the pauillion, wherein the Emperor, or any Prince dwelleth, is ſlaine in the very place: moreouer if any one bite a bit of any thing which he cannot ſwallow downe, but is forced to vomit it vp againe, all the people fall vpon him, and digging a hole vnder his pauillion drag him through it, and ſo kill him moſt cruelly, there bee many other ſuch friuolous things which they account as ſins that cannot bee purged, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, but to kill a man, to enter vpon another mans poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, to take other mens goods violently, without right or equity, and to neglect the commandements of God, they account as little or no offences.</p>
               <p>They beleeue that after this life they ſhall liue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in an other world, but what that world is they cannot deſcribe, and that they ſhall there
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:24800:73"/>
be rewarded according to their merits. When any one is ſick, and draweth neere vnto death, they ſet a ſpeare at the tent doore, wherein hee lyeth, with a black cloth at the end of it, to the end that thoſe which paſſe by, ſeeing it, may forbeare to enter in, and no one dare come in though hee be called, if he ſee the ſpeare: but when the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is dead, all his family meeting together carry the coarſe priuily out of the tent, into a place (choſen before for the purpoſe) where is made a great large pit, in which pit they build a little pauillion, and ſet in it a table furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with diuerſe diſhes of meate, then ſetting thereat the dead corps attired with rich and gorgious garments, they forthwith couer them altogether with earth, he hath alſo one labouring beaſt, and one trapped horſe buried with him: The great men chooſe out one ſeruant in their life time, vpon whom they ſet their owne marke, with a mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yron, to bee intombed with him when hee is dead, and this they doe, that they may make vſe of them in an other world. After all this, the mans friends that is dead take an other horſe, and killing him, and eating his fleſh, and then filling the hide full of haye, and ſowing it vp againe, they ſet it vpon foure ſtakes vpon the topp of the Sepulcher, to ſhew that there the dead man lyeth, which done, the women burne the horſes bones for the expiation of the dead mans ghoſt. But the richer ſort cut the horſe hide into ſlender thongs, and extending them in length, meaſure out there-with a circuite of ground round about their dead friends Sepulcher, beleeuing that the dead man ſhall obtaine ſo much ground in an other world, as by his friends ſhall bee meaſured out vnto him, with thoſe thongs: all theſe ceremonies performed, vpon the thirtith day they leaue of their mourning.</p>

Now with what pompe and iollity the Tartarians after the death of their King, elect and appoint another in his roome, becauſe it is ouer-troubleſome to be writ at large, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as tedious to be read, I will vnfold in few words: the Princes, Dukes, Barons, and all the people of the kingdom, <note place="margin">How the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarlans elect their Kings.</note> aſſembling themſelues together in a place in the open fields, fitte and accuſtomed for that purpoſe, place him to whom the kindome is due, (either by ſucceſſion or electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) in a throne of gold, and all of them proſtrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before him, cry out with a lowd voice, and with one conſent, in this maner.

as they miſconſter not his meaning in any point, for it is not lawfull for any to alter the Emperours words, nor in any ſort to contradict or gaine-ſay the ſentence hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth: hee neuer drinketh in any publick aſſembly, nor yet any other Tartarian Prince, vnleſſe ſome doe ſing and play vnto him vppon a harpe before hee drinke, and men of great worth when they ride, are ſhadowed with a certaine fanne or curtaine, faſtned to a long ſpeare and caried before them, which cuſtome is ſaid to be vſed alſo by the women: And theſe were the cuſtomes and maner of liuing of the people of Tartary, about two hundred yeares ſithence.</p>
               <p>The Georgiani (whom the Tartarians ouercame much about that time) were worſhippers of Chriſt; obſeruing <note place="margin">The Georgians a kinde of Chriſtians.</note> the cuſtome of the Greeke Church, they dwelt neere vnto the Perſians, and their dominion extended a length wayes, from Paleſtine to the Caſpian hilles: they had eighteene Biſhopricks, and one Catholicke or vniuerſall Biſhop, who was inſteed of a Patriarch: at the firſt they were ſubiect to the Patriarch of Antioch, the men be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry warlike, their Prieſts heads bee ſhauen round, and the lay-men foure ſquare; ſome of their women were trained vp in the warres, and ſerued on horſeback. The Georgians hauing diſpoſed their armies, and entering into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, were wonte to carouſe a gourd as bigge as ones fiſt, filled full of the beſt wine, and then to ſet vpon their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with greater courage: The Cleargie bee much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to vſury and ſymonie; there was mutuall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall enmity betwixt the Armenians and them.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:24800:75"/>
and approoued faſhion of the true Church: they knew not the day of our Lords natiuitie, for they obſerued no feaſts, nor no vigils, nor yet the foure Ember weekes, they feaſted not vpon Eaſter Eue, alledging that Chriſt roſe from the dead, about the euening of that day: they would eate fleſh vpon euery Friday, betwixt the feaſts of Eaſter and Penticoſt, yet they faſted much, beginning their faſt ſo ſtrictly and preciſely in Lent, as they would neither vſe oyle, wine, nor fiſh, vpon Fridayes and Wedneſdayes throughout the whole Lent, holding it a greater ſinne to drinke wine on thoſe dayes, then to lye with a ſtrumpet in a brothell houſe: Vpon Mondayes they abſtained wholy from all meates, vpon Tueſdayes and Thurſdayes they did eate once, and receiued no ſuſtenance at all vpon Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſdayes and Fridayes, but vpon Saterdayes and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes they would eate fleſh, and refreſh themſelues well. They would not celebrate the office of the Maſſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Lent but vpon Saterdaies and Sundaies, nor vpon Fridayes throughout the whole yeare, for thereby (as they were of opinion) they brake and violated their faſts: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants moreouer of the age of two months, and all others whatſoeuer were indifferently admitted to their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and they put no water into the Sacrifice. In the vſe of Hares, Beares, Choughes, and ſuch other like creatures, they imitated the Iewes, as well as the Greekes, they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated their Maſſes in glaſſe and wodden Chalices, and ſome hauing no paraments nor Prieſt-like veſtiments at all, ſome of them alſo wore Miters belonging to Deacons or Subdeacons: both Clergie and Lay-men, allowed of vſury and Symony, as well as the Georgians: the Prieſts exerciſed themſelues in Diuinations and Negromancie, they vſed more drinking then lay men, and all of them
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:24800:76"/>
had, or might haue wiues, but after the death of one wife, as well lay-men as the clergy men were prohibited to marry againe, the Biſhops gaue liberty to any to put away their wiues that were ſound in adultery, and to marry an other: they beleeued not that there is a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and obſtinately denyed that there was two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt.

man to haue many wiues, and hee allowed of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, although (ſaid he) it is faulty in many places: with theſe circumſtantiall tales, he couered an incredible allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith mens mindes bee ſoneſt intyſed, which was, the giuing to his people free liberty and power to purſue their luſtes and all other pleaſures, for by theſe meanes, this peſtilent religion hath crept into innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nations, ſo as now how few the number of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers is, in reſpect of the great multitude of misbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, may well bee gathered by this. That not all Europe profeſſe Chriſt, but the greateſt part thereof, together with all Aſia and Affricke, beleeue in <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed religion.</p>
               <p>The Sarraſins which firſt imbraced the impiety and madneſſe of that falſe prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> inhabited in that part of Arabia which is called Petrea, there where the land vpon the one ſide ioyneth to Iudaea and Aegipt, and they bee called Sarraſins of a place called Sarracus neere vnto the people called Nabathei, or (as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues would haue it) of <hi>Sara</hi> the wife of <hi>Abraham,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they yet perſwade themſelues, that of all men they bee the ligitimate and ſole ſucceſſors of the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Some of them were husbandmen, ſome followed their flockes, but the greateſt part were ſouldiors, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hired and retained by <hi>Heraclius</hi> to ſerue in the Perſian warres, and finding themſelues deceiued by him, after hee had obtained the victory, they (incenced with ire and ignominie) departed thence into Syria, hauing a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> for their captaine and councellor, where they won Damaſcus, and then, their army and prouiſion neceſſary for the warres increaſing more and more, they made warres vpon Aegipt and brought it to ſubiection, after
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:24800:78"/>
that they ſubdued Perſis, Antioch and Ieruſalem, and ſo augmenting and increaſing euery day both in fame and force, voide of all feare of any that could reſiſt them, the Turkes, a cruell and barbarous nation of Scythia, beeing by their neighbours expulſed from the Caſpian hilles, deſcending by the narrow paſſages of the hil Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſus, firſt into Aſia the leſſe, and after that into Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Media and Perſis, by their force and armes brought all thoſe people vnder their ſubiection and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Sarraſins to defend the confins of their Country, went forth to meete the Turkes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to make their partie good and to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, they were in very ſhort time brought to ſuch deſperations, as they were contented the Turkes ſhould raigne with them in Perſia, ſo as the would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the faith of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> ſo as whether nation had the greater loſſe can hardly bee iudged, either they that departed from ſuch a Kingdome, or thoſe which for deſire of rule were forced to receiue ſo peſtilent a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>And both Nations beeing thus bound with the bonds of one religion, were for a ſpace ſo confounded in name, as there was no difference betwixt Turkes and Sarraſins, yet now the name of Turkes is onely knowne and the other vtterly aboliſhed and forgotten: There bee diuers ſorts of horſemen that ſerue in the warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Turkes: As firſt the Thimarcini, which bee ſuch <note place="margin">The manner of the Turkes warfare.</note> as dwell in Citties and pay tribute, and are to the number of foureſcore thouſand: and theſe by the Kings leaue and permiſſion poſſeſſe (in the nature of pay or wages) townes, villages and caſtles, each one as hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth, and bee euer readie at the call of the Senſachus
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:24800:78"/>
(that is hee, that is captaine of that Prouince to whom they pay tribute:) they bee now deuided into two armies, one in Aſia, the other in Europe, vnder the conduct of two great captaines, whereof one gouerneth in Aſia and the other in Europe: Which captaines in their Countries ſpeech bee called <hi>Baſſaes:</hi> the other ſort of ſouldiers bee naturall, and are called <hi>Aconiziae:</hi> Theſe ſerue in the warres without wages, and alwaies goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the company of footmen for prey, yeelding the fifth part of their prey vnto the King, in the name of the chiefe captaines or generalls part of the bootie, and of theſe there be about the number of ſome fortie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
               <p>The third ſort bee the Charrippi, the Spahiglani and the Soluphtari, the beſt of which bee they Charippi, and the moſt famos ſouldiors in dignity; theſe continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon the King, and be about eight hundred in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, all elected out of the Scythians and Perſians, and of no other nation elſe, and theſe are to fight venterouſly, in the preſence of the King when need requireth.</p>
               <p>The Spahi and Soluphtari, are ſuch as at the firſt when they were children attended vpon the King to doe ſome vile and diſhonourable buſineſſe, but when they once become to bee of mans eſtate, the King giueth them power to marry wiues, ſo as they growing greater by their wiues dower and by their wages, doe for the moſt part execute the Office of Orators, garding and attending vpon each ſide of the King, when hee goeth abroade, and of theſe there bee a thouſand and three hundred: out of this order be elected, for the moſt part, all the chiefe Gouernours, and men of great authority and dignity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:24800:79"/>
There bee three orders of footemen, firſt the Ianizaries, <note place="margin">Three ſorts of footmen.</note> who while they be young vnder the age of twelue yeeres, bee elected out of the whole Empire by the Serchers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors or Muſter-maiſters, and for a ſpace trained vp in military diſcipline in publicke places of excerciſe, and then ſent into the warres cloathed in ſhort garments, and round cappes, turning vpwards, and armed with ſhields, ſwords and bowes, theſe defend the camps and beſiege Citties, and are more in number then twentie thouſand.</p>
               <p>The Aſappi be of the ſecond order, which be footmen armed with a light armor, they vſe ſwords, ſhields &amp; long ſpeares, and weare red caps to diſtinguiſh them from the Ianizaries, theſe gal the enemies horſes in battaile, and the number of them is anſwerable to the greatneſſe of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and at the leaſt 4000. of them goe with the King, and it is decreed that their wages ſhall ſurceaſe, when the wars are ended. The regall army conſiſteth of two hundred thouſand fighting men, but the company of footmen, which be either voluntaries, or ſuch as haue bin diſmiſſed from the wars, and bee ſommoned to ſerue againe, ſerue without wages, &amp; with theſe be mixed ſlaues, pages, skul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and drudges, carpenters, pioners and victuallers of the campe. Theſe make waies euen and plaine in rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and rough places, build bridges ouer riuers &amp; pooles, erect Rampires and Bulwarkes againſt the enemie, and make all others things ready, which be profitable for the aſſaulting and conquering of Citties: Vſurers, Bankers, Exchangers and Brokers that ſell garments for ſouldiors, and an infinite rabble of ſuch like people, follow the campe alſo, leaſt any thing ſhould bee wanting that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſouldiors.</p>

                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:24800:79"/>
But their is no one thing ſo much to bee admired and wondred at in that people, as their celerity in action, their conſtancy and perſeuerance in dangers, and their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of gouernment: for they looſe their liues for the leaſt offence that is: they wil ſwim deepe riuers and whitlepits, clime the ſteepeſt hils, and when they be commanded run head-long through thicke or thin, rough or ſmooth, not ſo much regarding their liues as the will of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: they moſt patiently endure both watching and want, their is no ſedition, no tumult, no clamors or outcries ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their armies, and in the night time there is ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and huſht ſilence in their campes, as they wil rather ſuffer captiues to eſcape, then to haue any tumults or hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burly raiſed amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Of all men now liuing the Turkes make warres moſt orderly, ſo that it needs not ſeeme ſtrange to any, what the cauſe ſhould bee that hath raiſed them to this height at this day, that about two hundred yeeres ſince there was no nation like them. For it may bee truely ſaid of them that they bee an inuincible Nation, vnleſſe they bee vanquiſhed by ſome great plague or peſtilence, or elſe by ciuill deſſention amongſt themſelues.</p>
               <p>The ſouldiours bee attired verie comely, wearing nothing that is vndecent or vnhoneſt: in their ſaddles and bridles is neither curioſitie nor ſuperfluity, and none of them goe armed but when they be in fight, and at other times they haue their armour carried after them in cariages. They vſe no Standards or Enſigns, but Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, vpon the tops whereof hang downe certaine threeds of diuers ſundrie collours, by which each captaine is knowne of his company, yet they vſe drummes and phyſes to ſummon and incite them to fight: the battaile

finiſhed, all the army is ſet in readineſſe, and viewed by the Regiſter (who is one of the noble men) that they may know, who and how many were ſlaine in the fight, and for the ordaining of others in their places.</p>
               <p>In all their aſſemblies and banquets they pray for the ſouldiours, but more deuoutly for ſuch as were ſlaine in defence of their country, eſteeming thoſe happy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that died not at home, amidſt the ſorrow and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of their wiues and children, but abroad amongſt the out-cries of their enemies, clattering of armour, and ſhattering of ſpeares.</p>
               <p>They deſcribe, extoll and chaunt out the victories of their anceſtors, thinking thereby to make their ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours more forward and couragious: Their buildings and dwelling houſes bee made for the moſt part of timber and morter, and very few of ſtone, vnleſſe the houſes of great men, Bathes and Temples, which be commonly builded of ſtone, &amp; yet there be ſome of the Plebeians, or common people, of ſuch exceeding wealth, as ſome one alone is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of himſelfe to furniſh and ſet forth a whole army, but beeing (as indeed they are) very frugal, and ſhunning all ſumptuouſneſſe, they cheriſh humility, and patiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this voluntary pouerty. And for this cauſe they vtterly renounce all pictures, and ſo much abhorre and deteſt the caruing of Images, as they terme Chriſtians Idolaters, becauſe they bee delighted in theſe things, contending that they affirme the truth in ſaying ſo: They vſe no ſeales at all to their letters, neither the King nor no man elſe, but giue credit ſo ſoone as they heare the name of him that ſent it, or view the ſtile of the writer, neither is there any vſe of belles, no not ſo much as any of the Chriſtians that dwelleth amongſt

               <p>In euery Cittie is one principall Church, into which vpon that day in the after-noone, all people aſſemble themſelues to praier, and praier beeing ſolemnly ended, they haue a ſermon, wherein they acknowledge one God and that there is none like or equall vnto him, and that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is his faithfull Prophet.</p>
               <p>All the Sarraſins or Turkes ought to pray euery daie fiue times, with their faces towardes the Sunne ryſing, and before they goe to praier to haue their bodies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cleere, and decently to waſh both fundament, yarde, hands, armes, mouth, eares, noſtrils, eyes and the haires of their heads, and laſt of all their feete, and this they ought to do more ſtrictly &amp; preciſely, after their companying with women, and purging their bodies, vnleſſe they bee either ſicke or traueling, but if at any time water bee wanting to waſh in, which happeneth but verie ſeldome, or neuer (for that in euerie Cittie

               <p>The Turkes ought once euery yeare alſo to go to the Temple which is in Mecha, both for the profeſſion of their religion, as alſo to yeeld the annuall honors due vnto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> whoſe ſepulchre is there kept and worſhipped.</p>
               <p>The Sarraſins force no man to forſake their faith, and Religion, neither will they perſwade any one to theirs, although their <hi>Alcoran</hi> command them, to afflict, and by all meanes to proſecute their aduerſaries in Religion and their Prophets. Whereof it commeth to paſſe, that in Turkie dwell people of all Sects and Religions, and euery Sect doth ſacrifice vnto his God, according to their owne cuſtomes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer; there is no great difference betwixt the Prieſtes, and the lay-people, betwixt their Temples, and their ordinarie habitations and dwelling houſes: for it is ſufficient for the Prieſtes to know the <hi>Alchoran,</hi>

and what things appertaine to prayer, and the worſhip of their law, without ſpending any time in meditations, or obtaining of learning, neither do they take vpon them the cure of ſoules, or care of churches: Sacraments they haue none, they make no obſeruation of Relickes, ſacred Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels or Altars, but poſſeſſing wiues, children and families, apply their time like lay-men, in husbandrie, merchandize, buying and ſelling, hunting, and ſuch like labours and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, to get their liuing: there is nothing vnlawfull for them to do, nor any thing prohibited: they be freed from ſeruitude and exactions, and be reuerenced and honoured of all men, as thoſe that vnderſtand the ceremonies of their law, gouern their churches, and be able to inſtruct others. They haue many and great ſcholes, wherein, be great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes inſtructed in the ciuil lawes ordained by their kings for the gouernement and defence of their kingdome, of whome ſome be afterwards made rulers of Churches, and ſome of other ſecular offices.</p>
               <p>In that ſect be diuers ſorts alſo of religious perſons, of which, ſome liuing in woods and deſerts, flie the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and conuerſation of all men: ſome other liuing in cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, practiſe hoſpitalitie towards poore trauellers, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them houſe-room and lodging at the leaſt, if they haue not meate to refreſh them, for they themſelues liue by begging. There be ſome others likewiſe, that wandring through the citties, carrie wholeſome and freſh water in certaine bottles, giuing thereof to drinke to euery one that demandeth. For which religious act, if any one giue them any thing, they will receiue it, though they deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, carrying ſuch boaſt and oſtentation of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and religion, both in their words and deeds, manners and behauior, as they may rather be thought Angels then

men, and euery one carieth a certain badge or ſigne, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be diſcerned of what profeſſion hee is of. The Sarraſins or Turkes be very ſtrict obſeruers and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Iuſtice: for he that ſheddeth another mans bloud, ſhall haue the like puniſhment himſelfe: he that is found in adulterie, ſhall (together with the adultereſſe) be ſtoned to death without mercie or delay: there is an expreſſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo for fornicators; for hee that is found guiltie of fornication, ſhall ſuffer eight hundred ſtripes with a whip: A theefe for the firſt and ſecond offence ſhall ſuffer the like puniſhment; for the third fault he ſhall haue his hand cut off, and his foote for the fourth: he which iniureth another ſhall make him ſatisfaction according to the quantitie of the wrong done. In caſe of extortion of goods and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it is ordained by a law, that the thing required ſhall be prooued by witneſſes, and that the defendant ſhall purge himſelfe by his oath. They admit no witneſſes, but ſuch as be honeſt and fit perſons, and whoſe teſtimonie may be taken without oath. There bee throughout the whole nation diuers Inquiſitors or ſearchers, who finding out thoſe that neglect the forme of prayer, to which they are all inioyned, afflict and puniſh them, by hanging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their neckes, a table or paper with many foxe tayles, and ſo leading them throughout the citie, diſmiſſe them not, vntill they haue payd a certaine ſumme of money for ther libertie. And this ignominie and reproch is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an extreame puniſhment: no one that is of full age, may liue vnmarried, and euery one may haue foure law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wiues, and (mothers and ſiſters onely excepted) may marry whom they liſt, without reſpect of kindred, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the foure lawfull wiues, they may haue as many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines as they pleaſe, or be able to maintaine: and as wel
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:24800:83"/>
the children that be borne of their concubines, as of their lawfull wiues, ſhall equally inherit their fathers goods, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is obſerued, that one ſonne ſhall haue as much as two daughters: no one may keepe two or more wiues in one houſe, nor yet in one cittie, for auoyding of ſcolding, contention, and vnquietneſſe that would bee amongſt them: but in euery city they may keepe one, and the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands háue liberty to be diuorced from their wiues three ſundrie times, and ſo oft to take them againe: and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man diuorced may ſtay with her husband that receiueth her againe, if ſhe pleaſe. The Turkiſh women be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in their apparell, vpon their heades they weare my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſet vpon the top of their veiles, wherwith their heads beeing bound in a comely faſhion, one ſide or edge of the veile hangeth downe vpon the right or left ſide of their heades, wherewith if they go from home, or come into their husbands preſence at home, they may foorth-with couer or maske their whole faces, but their eyes: for the wife of a Turke dare neuer come where a company of men be gathered together: neither is it lawfull for them to go to markets to buy and ſell. Likewiſe in their great Temple, the women haue a place farre remote from men, and ſhut vp ſo cloſe, as no one can come to them, nor hardly ſee them. Which cloſet is not allowed for all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but onely for the wiues of noble men or heade Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and that onely vpon Friday, at their noone-tide prayer, which they obſerue with great ſolemnitie (as is ſaid) and at no times elſe. There is ſeldome any ſpeech or conference betwixt men and women, in any publike place, it beeing ſo out of cuſtome, as if you ſhould ſtay with them a whole yeare, you ſhold hardly ſee it once, but for a man to ſit or ride with a woman, is accounted
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:24800:83"/>
monſtrous: married couples do neuer dally or chide in the preſence of others, for the husbands do neuer remitte the leaſt iot of their authoritie ouer their wiues, neither will the wiues omit their obedience towards their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. The great Lords that cannot alwaies tarry with their wiues themſelues, depute and ſet Eunuchs to be kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ouer them, which obſerue and watch them ſo warily, as it is vnpoſſible for them to talke with any man but their husbands, or to play falſe play with their husbands.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the Sarrafins yeeld ſo much credit to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> and his lawes, as they promiſe aſſured happines and ſaluation to the keepers thereof: to wit, a paradiſe aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with all pleaſures, a garden ſituated in a pure and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Climate, watered on all parts with moſt ſweete and delectable waters, where they ſhall enioy all things at pleaſure; dainties of all ſorts to feede them, ſilkes and purple to cloath them, beautifull damfels euer readie at a call to attend them with ſiluer and golden veſſels, and that Angels ſhall bee their cuppe-bearers; and miniſter vnto them milke in golden cuppes, and red wines in ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, they threaten hell, and eternall damnation to the tranſgreſſors of his lawes. And this alſo they firmely beleeue, that though a man haue beene neuer ſo great a ſinner, yet if at his death, he onely beleeue in God and in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he ſhall be ſaued.</p>

This chiefe Chaire of the Church beeing afterwards tranſlated from Antioch to Rome, he and his ſucceſſours were very carefull and vigilant to reduce the Chriſtian religion (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet indigeſted, vnpoliſhed, and little practiſed) and the profeſſors thereof into better order &amp; vniformity Out of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (which Chriſt came not to aboliſh, but to fulfill) out of the ciuill and politick gouernment of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Greeks, and Aegyptians, and out of both ſacred and prophane rites, lawes, &amp; ceremonies of other nations, but moſt eſpecially by the wholeſome doctrine and direction of Chriſt Ieſus, and the inſpiration of the holy Spirit: when they had vndertaken this buſines, and ſaw that not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Hebrewes, but in al other nations elſe, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be diuided into religious and laitie, and that all of them by an excellent ſubordination, are in dignity and degrees different one from another: as that the Emperor of Rome was Monarch of the whole world, and that next vnto him were Conſuls, Patricians, &amp; Senators, by whoſe direction and aduice, the ſtate and common-wealth was well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

               <p>The crownes of their heades muſt bee ſhauen round like the Nazareans, and they ought neither to weare lockes, nor long beards: they are bound to perpetuall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, and they haue the command and preheminence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer other prieſts: their liuings and maintenance ought to be onely of firſt firuites, tythes, &amp; oblations: nor may they meddle or buſie themſelues in worldly matters, their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and conuerſation ſhould be decent, comely, &amp; honeſt, and they are tyed onely to ſerue God and the Church, and to occupy and employ themſelues ſeriouſly in reading the holy Scriptures, that thereby they may perfectly know al things which belong to Chriſtian Religion, wherin they are bound to inſtruct others.</p>

               <p>Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> (at the inſtance of Pope <hi>Damaſus)</hi> diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted and digeſted the Pſalmes by the dayes, aſſigning to euery houre his proper Pſalmes and their number, as nine at nocturns vpon holy dayes, and 12. vpon working daies, for the laudes at Mattins fiue, fiue at euen-ſong, and at all other houres three: and it was chiefly he, that diſpoſed and ſet in order the Goſpels, Epiſtles, &amp; all other things which as yet be read out of the old &amp; new Teſtament, ſauing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hymnes. <hi>Damaſus</hi> diuiding the Quire of ſinging men into two parts, appointed them to ſing in courſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themes written by S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Biſhop of Millaine, &amp; added <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> to the end of euery Antheme.

But this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament beeing aboue all the reſt moſt neceſſarie vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and leaſt any one ſhould depart out of this life, without the benefit thereof, it was ordained, that as ſoon as an infant was borne, he ſhould haue God-fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for him, to be his witneſſes or ſureties, and that then the child, beeing brought by his God-fathers before the church doore, the Prieſt, (ſtanding there for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) ſhould demand of the child, before he dippe him in the holy Font, whether he will forſake the Diuell and all his pompes, and whether he ſtedfaſtly beleeue all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian faith, and the God-fathers affirming on his behalfe, the Prieſt bloweth three times in the

ſigning euery one of their foreheads with the ſigne of the croſſe, <hi>In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and for their better remembrance, and to the end they ſhould not require this Sacrament againe, he giueth euery one a blow vpon his right cheeke, and then the Godfathers (for feare leaſt the moiſt vnction ſhould runne off or be wiped away through negligence or careleſſeneſſe) bind their foreheads with a linnen cloth, (which they bring with them for that purpoſe) and that cloth they may not put off vntill the ſeuenth day after.

               <p n="3">3. The third Sacrament is the Sacrament of holy orders, which in the primitiue Church was likewiſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by the Eiſhop, and that only in the month of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, but now it is miniſtred at ſix times in the yeer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpoſe, that is to ſay vpon the Saterdaies of al thoſe 4. feaſts called Ember weekes, which were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for that end, vpon the Saterday called <hi>(Sitientes)</hi> which is the Saterday before paſſion Sunday, &amp; vpon the eue of the bleſſed Paſſouer: and then to men only, and to ſuch whoſe condition of life, bability of body, &amp; quality of minde is ſufficiently knowne and approued: There be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen orders of Prieſts or (according to ſome) nine, all of which (as the holy fathers haue euer bin of opinion) haue imprinted in their hearts, by their holy orders, ſuch ſpecial caracters of grace, as they be euer after held holy &amp; ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: which be ſinging men or organiſts, doorekeepers, readers; Exorciſts, Prieſts, Miniſters or Acolits, Subdeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Deacons, Prieſts &amp; Biſhops, &amp; yet it is held to be but one
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:24800:90"/>
Sacrament, not many, by reaſon of the finall office, which is to conſecrate the Lords body: Euery one of theſe nine orders of Prieſts hath his peculiar office in the Church, &amp; ornaments allowed him by the Toletan councel, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh him from the reſt, for the doore keepers, or ſextons are to defend and keepe the Churches, and to open &amp; ſhut them, and therefore a key is giuen vnto them when they be ordained: to the readers that haue power to read the old Teſtament, and holy hiſtories, is giuen a booke; the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Exorciſts is to diſpoſſeſſe ſuch as bee poſſeſſed with euil ſpirits, and haue a booke giuen vnto them, wherein be contained thoſe exorciſmes for a marke to ſignifie that office. The office of the Acolites is to ſet the candleſticks vpon the Altar, and to light the tapers, as alſo to ſet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe the vyoles or pots of water, &amp; to carry them away when maſſe is done, and therefore be they manifeſted by carrying a candleſticke with a taper in it, and an empty vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or cruet. The Subdeacons are to take the oblations to handle the chalice and patin, and make them ready for the ſacrifice, and to adminiſter wine and water to the Deacons in the vials, and therefore the Biſhop giueth them a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and a patin, and the Archdeacon, cruets ful of wine &amp; water, and a towel. The Deacons proper function is to preach the word of God to the people, and to be aſſiſtant to the prieſts in the holy miſteries of the Church, and to them is giuen the booke of the New-Teſtament &amp; a ſtole caſt croſſe ouer one ſhoulder like a yoake. The power of the prieſts is to conſecrate the Lords body, to pray for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and (by enioyning them penance) to reconcile them againe vnto God, and therefore is he honored with a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice ful of wine, a patin with the hoaſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, a ſtole hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on both ſhoulders, and the linnen garment called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula.

What is giuen to Biſhops at their conſecrations, you haue heard before, and they be euer ordained &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, about three of the clocke on the Lords day at the celebration of the office of the maſſe, before the reading of the Goſpel, by three other Biſhops whereof the Metra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan to be one, who doe it by laying there hands, and a booke vpon his head: In the primitiue Church there was little difference betwixt Biſhops and other prieſts, for al of them by common conſent did ioyne together in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Church, til ſuch diſſentions grew among them, as euery one would call himſelfe not of Chriſt, but rather of him by whom he was baptiſed, as one of <hi>Paule,</hi> an other of <hi>Apollo,</hi> a third of <hi>Cephas.</hi> And therefore for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding of ſchiſmes, &amp; maintayning an vniformity in the Church, the holy fathers though it neceſſary to eſtabliſh a decree that al which ſhould euer after be baptiſed ſhold he called by one general appellation Chriſtians, of Chriſt, and that euery Prouince ſhould bee gouerned by one Prieſt, or more, according to the quantity &amp; bigneſſe, who for their grauity and reuerence ſhould be called Biſhops, and they ſhould gouerne and inſtruct both lay people &amp; clergy that were vnder their charge, not after their owne wils and pleaſures as was vſed before, but according to the preſcript rules, canons and ordinances of the Church of Rome and holy Councels, and then by the permiſſion &amp; furtherance of good and holy Princes, all Kingdomes throughout the Chriſtian world were deuided into Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, the Dioceſſe into Shires and Counties, and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into ſeueral parriſhes, which good and godly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance both for clergy and laytie, is yet of that validity &amp; eſtimation as the people of euery village yeeld there o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their pariſh Prieſt, the pariſh Prieſt to the

               <p n="4">4 The fourth Sacrament is the moſt holſome Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the body &amp; bloud of our Lord &amp; Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; euery prieſt that is duly called &amp; ordained according to the rules of the Church, and intendeth to conſecrate, may (by obſeruing the vſual forme of words vſed in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration) make the true body of Chriſt of a peece of whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bread, and of wine his right and perfect bloud. And this Sacrament the ſame Lord Ieſus Chriſt in the night before he ſuffered his bitter paſſion, did celebrate with his diſciples, conſecrating it, and ordaining that it ſhould euer after be celebrated and eaten in remembrance of him. It behoueth euery one that receiueth this Sacrament to bee ſtrong in faith, that he may beleeue and credit theſe thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene things following: Firſt that he beleeue the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation or tranſubſtantiation of the bread and wine into the body and bloud of Chriſt: Secondly that though this be done euery day, yet is not the body of Chriſt thereby augmented: Thirdly that the body of Chriſt is not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, though it be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery day: Fourthly that though this Sacrament be deuided into many parts, that yet the whole and intire body of Chriſt remaineth in euery little particle: Fiftly, that though it be eaten of wicked &amp; malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, yet is not the Sacrament thereby defiled: Sixtly, that to thoſe which receiue it worthily, &amp; as they ought, it bringeth ſaluation, &amp; eternal damnation to thoſe which receiue it vnworthily: Seuenthly, that when it is eaten it conuerteth not into the nature &amp; property of him that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:24800:91"/>
eateth it, as other meate doth, but rather conuerteth the eater into the nature of the Sacrament rightly, that being eaten it is taken vp into heauen without hurt: Ninthly that in euery little forme of bread and wine is comprehended the great and incomprehenſible God and Man Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: Tenthly that one and the ſame body of Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and taken at one moment in diuers places of diuers men, and vnder a diuers forme: Eleuenthly, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bread being turned into the true body of Chriſt, and the ſubſtance of the wine into his bloud, the natural accidents of bread and wine doe yet remaine, and that they are not receiued in forme of fleſh and bloud: Twelfthly, that vnto thoſe that eate it worthily, it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth twelue great commodities, which are expreſſed in theſe verſes following.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, that it is wonderfull good and profitable for all thoſe for whom the prieſt ſpecially offereth it as a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, be they liuing or dead, and that therefore it is called the communion or Sacrament of the Euchariſt: In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Chriſtian religion, &amp; yet in ſome places, there was conſecrated at one time ſuch a loafe of bread, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards cut into ſmall mamocks by the prieſt, and laid vpon a ſawcer, or plate, might well ſerue all the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:24800:92"/>
communicants that were preſent at the ſacrifice, and at that time did Chriſtians communicate thereof dayly. And afterwards they were limitted to receiue it only vpon ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, but when the Church perceiued that this ſacrament was not taken euery ſunday ſo worthily and with ſuch due obſeruation as was ſitting, it was ordained that euery Chriſtian man of perfect reaſon &amp; vnderſtanding, ſhould with all diligence he could, and with his beſt preparation both of body and ſoule, receiue the ſame thrice a yeere, or at the leaſt euery yeere once at Eaſter, as alſo when hee found himſelfe in any danger of death, as a ready prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue againſt al perils, by which name it is often called.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Matrimony (which is a lawfull coniunction of man and wife, inſtituted and ordained by the law of God, the law of nature, &amp; the law of nations) is the fift Sacrament: and the holy fathers in Chriſtian piety haue commanded, that but one marriage ſhall be ſolemnized at one time, and that it ſhal not be done in ſecret, but publikely, either in the Church or Church-porch, but moſt commonly in the Church-porch, where the prieſt meeting the parties that are to be married, firſt asketh of the man, and then of the woman whether they be willing to be contracted, who anſwering that they are content and agreed (which is a thing moſt neceſſary in that Sacrament) he taketh them by the right hands, &amp; ioyning them togither in the name of the bleſſed and indeuided trinity in vnity, the Father Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, hee admoniſheth and exhorteth them, that being euer mindefull of this vnion and holy communion they neuer after forſake one an other, but to liue in mutual loue, honor and obedience one to an other, that they ſhould not deſire one an others company for luſt, but for procreation of children, and that they ſhould
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:24800:92"/>
bring vp their children honeſtly, carefully, and in the feare of God, this done he marrieth them with the ring, and ſprinkleth holy water on them, and then putting on his ſtole which is thither brought him, he leadeth them into the church, and cauſing them to kneele humbly before the Altar, there bleſſeth them (if they were not bleſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the woman when ſhe is married hath her haire tied vp with a red fillet or headband, and a white veile ouer it, without which veile or head couer, it is neuer lawful for her after that time to goe abroad, or to be in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men: There be twelue impediments that hinder marriage before it be ſolemnized, and diſſolue it after it is contracted, that is to ſay, the error or miſtaking of either party, the breach of ſome condition, kindred, a manifeſt offence, diſparity of religion, violence or forcible rauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their parents, holy orders, breach of reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, publike defamation, affinity, and diſſability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the act of matrimony.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The ſixt Sacrament of the church is penance, which is giuen by Chriſt as a ſecond repaire of our ſhipwrake, and euery Chriſtian man is bound vndoubtedly to belceue, that this Sacrament conſiſteth of theſe foure things, to wit, repentance for ſins paſt, cannonical confeſſion, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and ſatisfaction: for he that will be partaker of this Sacrament muſt firſt of al repent &amp; be ſorrowful in his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoule, that through his grieuous and heinous ſins hee hath loſt that purity and innocency which he once had, either by the Sacrament of Baptiſme, or by this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t formerly receiued, &amp; his griefe muſt be ſo hearty &amp; effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, as he muſt thereby aſſuredly hope to bee reconciled againe vnto God, then muſt he humbly acknowledge, and make verball recitall vnto ſome reuerent prieſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor

               <p>The Altars are alwayes to bee decently couered with two linnen clothes, hauing a croſſe ſet vpon them, or a ſhrine, containing the Relicks of Saints, two Candleſticks on each end, and a booke.

               <p>Of this <hi>Cecrops</hi> it was called Secropia, and after <hi>Mopſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> of <hi>Mopſus.</hi> And of <hi>Ian</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Xutus,</hi> or (as <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> writeth) of <hi>Ianus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> it was called Ionia: and laſtly Athens of <hi>Minerua,</hi> for the Greekes call <hi>Minerua</hi> Athenae: <hi>Draco</hi> was the firſt that made lawes <note place="margin">Dracoes lawes to the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nians.</note> for the Athenians, many of which lawes were afterwards abrogated by <hi>Solon</hi> of Salamin, for the too ſeuere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted vpon offenders: for by all the laws which <hi>Draco</hi> ordained, death was due for euery little offence, in ſuch ſort as if one were conuicted but of ſloth or Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hee ſhould die for it, and he which gathered rootes or fruits out of an others mans grounds, was as deepely puniſhed as thoſe which had murdered their parents. <hi>Solon</hi> deuided the citty into ſocieties, trybes or wards, according <note place="margin">The citty of Athens diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by Solon.</note> to the eſtimation and valuation of euery ones ſubſtance and reueneus, In the firſt rancke were thoſe whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was ſuppoſed to conſiſt of five hundred medimni: thoſe which were worth three hundred medimni, and were able to breed and keepe horſes, were counted in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond order, and thoſe of the third degree were equall in ſubſtance to the ſecond, the charge of keeping horſes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:24800:100"/>
onely excepted: And of theſe orders were all magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates and high officers (for the moſt part) ordained, and, thoſe which were vnder theſe degrees were in the fourth rancke, and were called mercenary, and were excluded from all offices, ſauing that they might haue the charge of pleading and decyding cauſes: This inſtitution of ciuill gouernment, <hi>Seruius Tullius</hi> is ſuppoſed to haue followed and imitated at Rome.</p>
               <p>Moreouer <hi>Solon</hi> appointed a Senate or Councell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of yearely Magiſtrates, in Areopagus: (though <note place="margin">The councellin Areopagus.</note> ſome haue reported that <hi>Draco</hi> was the founder of that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly) And to the end that hee might take away all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ciuill diſſention, that might happen at any time afterwards, and that the inconſiderate multitude ſhould not trouble the iudiciall ſentences, by their doubtfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, (as vſually they did,) out of thoſe foure trybes that were then in Athens, hee made choyſe of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, an hundred out of euery trybe, giuing them power to approue the acts and decrees of the Arreopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gites, if they were agreeable to equity, if other-wiſe to councell them and annihilate their doings: by which meanes the ſtate of the citty (ſtayde as it were by two ſure anchors) ſeemed ſecure, vnmoueable and of likelyhood to continue: if any were condemned for parricide, or for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and vſurping the cheefe gouernment, they were excluded (by <hi>Solons</hi> lawe) from bearing rule, and not there onely, but all thoſe alſo were barred and prohibited to beare offices, that if any ſedition were ſet a foote in the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtood neuter, and tooke nether part: for hee thought it an argument of a bad Cittyzen, not to bee carefull of the common good and peace of others, when hee him-ſelfe hath ſetled his owne eſtate and deſignes in ſafety:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:24800:100"/>
Amongſt the reſt of <hi>Solons</hi> acts this is moſt admirable, whereby he graunted liberty that if any woman had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <note place="margin">A ſtrange law for women.</note> a man vnable to beeget children, ſhee might lawfully, and without controulement, depart from him and take vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her any one of her husbands kindred whome ſhee liked beſt.</p>

               <p>If any man ſlaundered his neighbour, ether at the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of their diuine ceremonies, or at their ſeſſions and publike aſſemblies, hee was fined at foure drachmas: <note place="margin">Againſt ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.</note> Hee graunted power and authority vnto Teſtators, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and bequeath legacies of mony, and goods amongſt whome they pleaſed: whereas before (by the cuſtome of the country) they were not to bequeath any thing from their owne families, and by this meanes friendſhippe was preferred before kindred, and fauour before allyances: Neuertheleſſe this was done with ſuch caution and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that noe one could graunt ſuch legacies, beeing mooued there-vnto either through their owne franticke madneſſe, or by the ſubtill and vndermyning perſwaſions of other, but meerely of his owne accord and good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
               <p>Hee forbad all mournings and lamentations at other mens funeralls, and enacted that the ſonne ſhould not bee bound to releeue his father, if his father had not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:24800:101"/>
brought him vp in ſome arte, or profitable occupation: nor that baſtards ſhould nouriſh or releeue their parents, and his reaſon was this, that hee which forbeareth not to couple with a ſtrumpet, giueth euident demonſtration, that he hath more care of his owne ſenſuall pleaſures then of the procreation of children, and thereby hee becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnworthy of reward or releefe of ſuch children, if the fall into pouerty.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, <hi>Solon</hi> iudged it meete, that the adulterer <note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for adultery.</note> apprehended in the deed doing, might lawfully be ſlaine: and that he that forced and rauiſhed a free-borne Virgin, ſhould be fined at ten Drachmas. He abrogated and tooke away their ancient cuſtome of ſelling their daughters and ſiſters, vnleſſe they were conuinced of whoredome: and amongſt others of his acts and decrees, theſe are likewiſe to be found: that whoſoeuer was victor in the games of <hi>Iſtmos,</hi> was rewarded with an hundred Drachmas: and he that got the beſt in the games of Olimpus, had fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: He that killed a Dogge-wolfe, had fiue Drachmas out of the common treaſury: but hee that killed a Bitch-wolfe had but one: for the rewarde due for ſlaying the Dogge-wolfe was the worth of an Oxe, and the price of a ſheepe for killing the ſhee-Wolfe: and their ancient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was to perſecute theſe kinde of beaſts, as enimies to their cattell and grounds.</p>
               <p>He ordained that the children of ſuch as were ſlaine in the warres, ſhould be brought vp at the common charge, <note place="margin">A law for the maintenance of ſouldiers children.</note> (that men by that meanes, beeing aſſured that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould bee cared for, though themſelues miſcarry, might bee more throughly incouraged to fight, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themſelues valiantly and venterouſly:) commanding alſo, that thoſe which loſt their eyes in the warres, ſhould

Furthermore he forbad all Iewellers to reſerue in their cuſtody the ſtampe or ſeale of any ring, after they had ſold it. And that hee which putteth out an others eye ſhould looſe both his owne eyes: adiudging it alſo a capitall offence for any one to take vp that which is none of his owne and keepe it to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore hee eſtabliſhed that Princes or rulers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found drunke, ſhould be puniſhed with preſent death: aduiſing the Athenians likewiſe, to reckon and account their daies according to the courſe of the Moone.</p>
               <p>Of all fruites and commodities, he only permitted wax and honey to bee tranſported out of Attica into other countries: and he eſteemed no man meete or worthy to be made free of the Cittie, vnleſſe he were an artificer and would with his whole familie come dwell at Athens, or ſuch as were doomed from their natiue ſoile to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exile and baniſhment: Theſe lawes being ingrauen and recorded in woodden tables, were by <hi>Solon</hi> eſtabliſhed to continue for a hundred yeeres, preſuming that if the City were ſo long inured with them, they would euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remaine without alteration: but <hi>Herodotus</hi> is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that theſe lawes which <hi>Solon</hi> made for the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, were enacted but for ten yeeres continuance.</p>

               <p>The Athenians were not ſtrangers at the beginning, <note place="margin">The original of the Athenians.</note> nor was their City firſt inhabited by any rabble of wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring people, but in the ſame ſoile they now inhabite, their were they borne, and the ſelfe ſame place which is now their ſeat and habitation, was alſo their original and foundation.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:24800:103"/>
to be Arbitrators and indifferent vmpires betwixt the power of the Kings, and the force of the multitude, to the end that neither the one ſhould rebel through contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and ſtubborneſſe, nor the other oppreſſe by reaſon of their gouerment and greatneſſe: of theſe Seniors or elders (according to <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> there were eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who were euer aſſiſting and aiding the Kings, carefully prouiding that neither the gouernment of the people ſhould be of two great force, nor that the Kings ſhould tyrannize ouer the commons, and that all the reſt of the multitude ſhould be made acquainted with whatſoeuer was decreed by this order.</p>
               <p>Many yeeres after this, vnto the gouernment of the <note place="margin">Olygarchia or gouernment of the Tribunes,</note> people was added the power and authority of the Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, or Tribunes (which were Protectors of the liberties and benefits of the commons againſt the power of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) which kinde of gouernment in the Greeke tongue is called <hi>Oligarchia,</hi> that is the gouernment of a few: and this manner of gouernment was purpoſely ordained as a bridle, or reſtrainte vnto the adminiſtration of the Kings and Elders when they ſeemed ouer violent and outragious towards the commons, and was annexed vnto the other, in the hundreth yeere after the death of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> when <hi>Theopompus</hi> raigned in Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia.</p>
               <p>One inſtitution ordained by the Olygarchia, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, was the diuiſion of their grounds, for thoſe Protectors perſwaded the multitude of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that euery one ſhould yeeld vp al the grounds they formerly had in their poſſeſſion &amp; occupation, &amp; that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to each one ſhold be diſtributed an euen &amp; equal portion. For their opinion was that euery Citizen ſhould contend
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:24800:104"/>
to excell others in vertue and vnderſtanding, and not in riches and ryoting. The whole land was therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into nine and thirty thouſand parts, the fields ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning <note place="margin">The diuiſion of their land by the Olygar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</note> to the City and belonging to the Citty into nine thouſand, and the reſt of the land which lay in the country, and was occupied by farmers, was three times as much &amp; more: ſo that euery portion was ſuch as would yeeld ſeuenty meaſures of corne caled <hi>Medimni</hi> yeerely to a man, and to a woman twelue. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was once in a minde to make like diuiſion of all moueable goods, but fearing the enuy that for that cauſe might inſue (for many ſeemed to take it diſcontentedly) hee forbore to doe it, <note place="margin">The vſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney prohibited and iron mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney made.</note> yet he vtterly tooke away all vſe both of ſiluer and gold from amongſt them, and brought in iron money, and ſtamping it croſſe wiſe like the letter X commanded that it ſhould be of little value, whereby all occaſion of ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was auoided: and to the end that the iron, whereof that money was coyned, ſhould not be deſired for other purpoſes, he cauſed it when it was burning and glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hote, to be quenched with vineger, that being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mollified and ſoftned, it might ſerue to no other vſe: This done he reiected all arts, as things meere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and friuolous, which were then eaſie to be reiected, for the vſe of ſiluer and gold being once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, the artificers departed thence of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, conſidering that iron coyne would ſtand them in no ſteed in other places.</p>
               <p>After this (that he might vtterly extirpate and roote out of the City all ryotting and exceſſe) he inſtituted publike feaſts, wherein he commanded that both poore and rich ſhould ſit and eate together in one place, and at one table, without difference or exception of perſons:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:24800:104"/>
And if any came to that diet, in that publike place, ſo gallant and gorgeous that his queaſie ſtomake would not ſerue him to eate with ſuch companions, or that he would not be pleaſant at his meate, hee was chidden and reuiled of all thoſe that ſat at the Table with him, as an vnthrift, and a waſter, by which ordinance all pompe and ſumptuouſneſſe was vtterly auoided: at this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution the great and welthy men beganne to grudge and repine, and were ſo much incenſed againſt him, as in a rage they violently ruſhed vpon him and ſtrooke out one of his eyes with a ſtaffe, wherevpon hee ordained that no Spartane whatſoeuer, ſhould euer after that time come to meate with any ſtaffe or other weapon. This their manner of dyeting together, they called <hi>(Philias)</hi> which is as much to ſay as friendſhip, for doubtleſſe it was an argument of publike friendſhip and great humanity, and might well be tearmed <hi>(Phiditia)</hi> that is fellowſhip, or fraternitie: beſides that by this their dyeting together, they were very much giuen to ſparingneſſe and parſimony.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which by reaſon of their ſacrifycing, or hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were abſent from their meales, were permitted to dine and ſup at home, but all others ought to bee there preſent, all excuſes ſet apart, and euery one allowed for the vpholding and maintaining of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diet, yeerely, a certaine meaſure full of fine meale or flower called <hi>Medimnum,</hi> eight meaſures called <hi>(Corus)</hi> full of wine, fiue pounds of cheeſe and two pound and a halfe of figs.</p>
               <p>Children alſo frequented this common banquetting place, as the ſchoole or vniuerſity of temperature and all

               <p>The Spartans in their wiuing, and accompanying with women (by reaſon of their continuall warres) regarded not chaſtitie, ſo much as procreation and increaſe of iſſue, and the husbands were ſo louing and <note place="margin">Men called their wiues their miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> obſequious to their wiues, as they would call them their miſtreſſes.</p>

               <p>The marriageable virgins were maried, or rather ſtolne away perforce, and the bride being conducted into her

The care and regard of their children and iſſue was committed to worthie men, and it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any old man (for cauſe of increaſe and procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <note place="margin">Old men that had young wiues permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted young men to lye with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> to bring ſome young man that was honeſt and well thought of, to lye with his wife, and if ſhe conceiued with child by the ſtranger, he would repute it as his owne child, and bring it vp as his owne, nor was it accounted a ſhame for any to perſwade ſuch old men that had chaſt wiues, and fit to bring foorth children, that they might bee with them to bring foorth ſeed out of ſo good a ſoyle: for they laughed at the folly of ſome people, that would put their mares and bitches to couple with the beſt makes they could get, (of their kind) ſometimes for hire, and ſomtimes for loue and fauour, and to keepe their wiues ſo warily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der watch and ward, that none might lie with them but themſelues: whereby their iſſue be either mad and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or otherwiſe very weake and feeble, vnfit for any exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Parents might not bee allowed to educate and bring vp their owne children themſelues; but ſo ſoone as they were borne, they were brought into the ſtreetes amongſt the people, vnto a certaine place there called <hi>(Ieſchen)</hi> where they were nouriſhed, vntill they were of ſome ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then the formes and lincaments of their bodies, were peruſed by certaine ouer-ſeers, and whoſoeuer was allowed by theſe ouer-ſeers, had aſſigned vnto him one of thoſe 9000. portions of ground, into which the ſoile belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the city was diuided: but thoſe which were weake
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:24800:106"/>
and deformed, weare brought vnto a ſteepe rocke not far from Taygetum, called Apotheca, where they were throwne down headlong as vnprofitable for the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. The women vſed not to waſh their children with water, but with wine, by the application of which liquour, it is moſt certaine, that their bodies would be weakned and made feeble, if they were any wiſe ſubiect to the falling e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, nor would they apply any thing to them, to ſtrengthen and keepe their naturall heate, nor wrap them in ſwathing clothes, or vſe them to whittles, or rattles, but brought them vp in ſolitarie and darke places, and therfore (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this ſeuere education) many people of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would haue their children nouriſhed and brought vp by Lacedemonian nurſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe children when they accompliſhed the age of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares, began to exerciſe themſelues in the companie of their equals, and to get ſuch learning as was neceſſarie for them, attaining to all other diſciplines by their owne induſtrie and indeauor, they were ſhorne and ſhauen to the skin, and went bare-footed, and bare legged, and when they were twelue yeares of age, they allowed them one cote, but they were prohibited bathes, and all things elſe that might nouriſh their naturall heate: the beds whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon they tooke their reſt, were made of reedes, wherein (in the winter time) they accuſtomed to put a kind of thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles which they called Licophona's. There was one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ordained to be gouernor and tutor ouer the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom they called <hi>Iren:</hi> this <hi>Iren</hi> taught them of the bigger ſort, to get and prouide wood and fuell, and the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort to ſteale and carry it away, to intrude themſelues into the company of their betters, when they were at their bankets, and from thence to filtch and purloine what they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:24800:106"/>
could get, and thoſe which were apprehended and taken in the deed doing were whipt and driuen away, not for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was an offence to ſteale, but for that they did it not warily and aduiſedly. Some he would command to ſing, ſome other to propoſe ſubtill and witty queſtions, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers whereof muſt be both ſharpe and ſudden, and if any were found negligent in performing their exerciſe, the <hi>Iren</hi> would bite them hard by the thombe in the way of correction. Moreouer, they were taught to vſe graue ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but ſuch as were mixed with ſome mirth: and in few words to comprehend whole ſentences, in ſuch manner as it was an vſuall prouerb to ſay, That it is more eaſie to play the Philoſopher, then to imitate the conciſe manner of ſpeaking of the Lacedemonians.</p>
               <p>It is worth the labour to expreſſe and ſet downe the exerciſes of each ſeuerall age, and what contention and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation was amongſt them, who ſhould moſt excell in vertue. The whole people were diſtinguiſhed into three companies or quires, according to their ages, and firſt, the troupe or aſſembly of old men, (when in their ſolemne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices they began to ſing) pronounced with a ſhrill voice theſe words following, We were once young and luſtie, to whom the young men following after, make this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, And we now are young and luſtie, and thereof you ſhall make trial if you pleaſe.

                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, that a certaine modulation and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in muſicke, which was obſerued and practiſed by the Laconians, continued vntill his time, and which they were accuſtomed to ſing to their fluites or pipes, when they ſet vpon their enemies. <hi>Thucidides</hi> alſo (the reporter of this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:24800:107"/>
Laconian inſtitution) hath written, that thoſe muſicall ſongs, and harmonie ſet vnto their flutes, were vſed in the wars, but hee denyeth, that they were vſed in any ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Religion, or for the performance of diuine ſeruice, nor yet thereby to encourage mens minds, or to incite and prouoke them to fight, (as the hornes and trumpets were wont to do amongſt the Romaines) but that at their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, they might enter into the battell by little and little, as it were, with equall and meaſured paces, and not to ſuffer their orders and ranckes to be broken or ſcattered.</p>
               <p>There is a verſe extant of the Lacedemonian Poet, whereby it appeareth, that the Spartans vſed not onely the fluite and pipe in the on ſet of their battels, but the muſicall ſound and conſent of the harpe alſo. Which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome may ſeeme to be deriued from the Cretans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, that <hi>Haliattes</hi> King of Lydia, in the warres hee made againſt the Mileſians, had not onely pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and minſtrels in his campe, to delight his eare, but (a thing vnfit to be reported, becauſe it ſeemes ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous) the daintieſt fare that could be gotten by any poſſible meanes whatſoeuer. The Romaines (beſides the noyſe of hornes and trumpets) beganne their battell with exceeding great clamor and ſhowting of ſouldiers, which is farre different from that which <hi>Homer</hi> writeth of the people of Achaia: For they (ſaith hee) guarding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their forces, enter into the battell with quietneſſe and ſilence.</p>
               <p>The French-men (as <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Liuie</hi> report) vſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, tripping of the toe, and ſhaking their ſheelds ouer their heades: and there be ſome barbarous people that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into battell with howling and crying: by which variety
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:24800:107"/>
of cuſtomes wee may gather, that but few other nations follow and imitate the Spartans in their conſorts and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phony in muſicke, which they vſe in their wars.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Spartans faſhion was to keepe their haire and beards long from their youth, according to that memorable and worthie ſaying of the Law-giuer himſelf, which was, That mens bodies bee much more beautifull and comely, when their heades bee thicke growne with haires, and ſmoothly combed, then otherwiſe they would bee, if their haire were ſhaggie, rugged, vncombed, and neglected.</p>
               <p>The King when he beginneth battaile, ſacrifiſeth a ſhee-goate to the Muſes: They vſe one certaine and ſtrict kind of liuing, both at home, and in the warres: For they held, that they were not borne onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but for the good of their Countrie: They practiſed no gainefull and commodious arts, but were wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſtudie of matters belonging to martiall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; ſpending their ſpare time in ſollemne banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, by which meanes it came to paſſe, that (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath very well noted) the Spartans neuer would; or if they would, yet they knew not how to liue priuately, with a ſelfe-regard, but were wholly deuoted to the common good of their countrie.</p>
               <p>The Spartanes as they differed from all other nations <note place="margin">The manner of electing offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> in many other things, ſo did they in giuing their voyces for electing of Officers: For there were a few picked out from the reſt to vndergo this buſineſſe, who were incloſed in a Chamber next adioyning to the Councel-houſe, where they ſhould neither ſee nor bee ſeene of any, and then as the names of the Competitors were particularly drawne out one after another, and at happe-hazard
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:24800:108"/>
they did diligently marke and obſerue the applauſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people vnto euery name, aduiſedly noting and ſetting downe in a table, who had the greateſt applauſe, and who the leaſt, which beeing afterwards openly reade, it was thereby knowne which of the competitors had the moſt voyces.</p>
               <p>Furthermore <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was the firſt that (remoouing all ſuperſtition) permitted the Cittizens to bury the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the cittie, allowing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plots of ground about the Temples, wherein to erect their monuments: but it was not lawfull for any one to engraue or imprint the name of either man or woman vpon their ſepulcher, but the names of thoſe onely which were manfully ſlaine in the wars: nor to lament for thoſe which were dead aboue the ſpace of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuen dayes.</p>
               <p>The citizens moreouer were reſtrained from trauelling into other countries, leſt they ſhould bring into their cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſtrange cuſtomes and manners: and all ſtrangers and trauellers which arriued there, were bar'd and excluded from out their citty, (vnleſſe their preſence were profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the common-wealth;) leſt (as <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſaith) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine nations ſhould learne, and be partakers of the Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian diſcipline, which may iuſtly be tearmed a very inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane part; or elſe (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth) leſt by the mutuall concourſe and paſſage too and fro of ſtrangers, new ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and languages might creepe into the cittie, from whence might proceed new iudgements, and diſſonant deſires, which to the common-wealth would bee matters moſt pernitious and dangerous. Young men hee allowed to weare but one coate throughout the whole yeare, nor might any one go finer, or fare more daintily then others did. He commanded, that nothing ſhould be bought with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:24800:108"/>
readie money, but by exchange of wares and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: &amp; that children (when they were of the age of twelue or fourteene yeares) ſhould not be ſuffered to come into the market-place or chiefe part of the cittie, but were brought into the fields, to the end they ſhould not ſpend the prime of their youth in luxurie and wantonneſſe, but in labour and painfulneſſe, ordaining that they ſhold haue nothing layd vnder them to ſleepe vpon, and that they ſhould eate no pottage nor gruell, nor once returne into the cittie before they were men.</p>
               <p>He ordained alſo, that maydes ſhould be married with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out portions, to the end that none ſhould couet wiues for their wealth, and that husbands might carrie the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie ouer their wiues, when they could not vpbraide them with the greatneſſe of their portions, and how much they were aduanced by them: that men ſhold be eſteemed honourable, not for their riches and greatnes, but for their age and grauitie; for old age was held in more reuerence and reputation amongſt the Spartans, then in any other countrie beſides.</p>
               <p>To the Kings he granted power ouer the wars: to the Magiſtrates, iudgements and yearely ſucceſſions: the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and cuſtodie of the lawes to the Senate, and to the people, power and authoritie both to elect the Senat, and to create Magiſtrates whom they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Now for becauſe theſe new lawes and inſtitutions (all former cuſtomes beeing diſſolued and abrogated) ſeemed very harſh and difficult, he fained, that <hi>Apollo</hi> of Delphos was the author and inuentor of them, and that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence (at the commandement of that god) hee brought them to Sparta, thinking thereby, that the feare and reuerence of religion, would vanquiſh all rediouſneſſe and irkeſomneſſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:24800:109"/>
of vſing them. And finally, (to the end his lawes might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and continue to all eternitie) he bound and obliged the cittizens by an oath, that they ſhould alter none of thoſe lawes which he had made and eſtabliſhed for them, vntill he himſelfe returned back vnto them; alledging, that he intended to go to Delphos, to aske counſell of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle there, what he ſhold alter or adde to his lawes, which done, he tooke his iourney to Creete, and there liued in perpetuall exile, commanding, when he lay vppon his <note place="margin">Lycurgus exild himſelf volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily.</note> death-bed, that as ſoone as he was dead, his bones ſhould be caſt into the ſea, leſt by any chance they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed to Lacedemon: whereby the Spartans might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues abſolued and releaſed from that oath which they had taken, not to alter thoſe lawes before his returne vnto them.</p>
               <p>It is not amiſſe in this place to deſcribe, and ſet foorth, what honors and dignities the Spartans were wont to giue to their Kings. And firſt, they had two Orders or Eſtates of Prieſts, attending vppon them to do ſacrifices, one of the Lacedemonian <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and the other of the celeſtiall <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and their law of armes was, that vpon what peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or country the Kings intended to make warres, it reſted not in the power of any of the Spartans, to prohibite or gaine-ſay it: for if they did, they offended ſo haynouſly, as they would hardly purge themſelues: that in their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and ſetting forward to the warres, the kings ſhould go foremoſt, and be laſt in the retraite. And that they ſhould haue an hundred choice and ſelect men to be their guard: that in their expeditions and ſetting forward on their voyages, they might haue what beaſt they would for ſacrifice, and that they might take to themſelues the hides and skins of the beaſts that were offered. And theſe were
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:24800:109"/>
their priuiledges in the warres. And the honors and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties attributed vnto them in time of peace, were theſe, when in their Common-wealth, any banquets were made for the death of any great man, the Kings ſhould ſit downe firſt, and be firſt ſerued, and that they two alone ſhould haue betwixt them twice as much meate, as all thoſe that ſate with them, beſides the skinnes of all beaſts ſacrificed. Moreouer, in the Kalends of euery moneth, they had each of them a beaſt giuen them from out the reuenues of the cittie, to be ſacrificed to <hi>Apollo,</hi> a meaſure of fine wheate flower called <hi>Medimnum,</hi> containing ſixe <hi>Modia,</hi> and a meaſure of wine, called a Laconian quart.</p>
               <p>In the beholding of ſingle combats, the Kings prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and gouerned certaine places, hauing for their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants what Cittizens they pleaſed: And each king might chooſe two Pitheans, which were ſuch as were wont to be ſent to Delphos to aske counſell of the Oracle, and theſe did commonly diet with the Kings. The Kings allowance when they came not to meales in the vſuall place, was, two meaſures full of fine flower called <hi>Chaenices,</hi> or <hi>Chaeniae,</hi> (which is much about halfe one of our peckes) and a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure full of wine called <hi>Cotyla,</hi> that is as much as <hi>Sextarius,</hi> (which is about a pinte and an halfe Engliſh:) but when they were preſent, they had double in quantitie as much of euery thing as all the reſt that ſate with them.</p>
               <p>The Kings were to determine who ſhould be husbands of orphane maydes, whoſe parents were deceaſed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he to whome the father bequeathed her, or hee on whome the mother beſtowed her: they had power alſo ouer common wayes, and ouer ſuch as made adopted ſons againſt the kings minds: they had ſeates in the Councell or Senate-houſe, (which conſiſted of 28. Senatours,)
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:24800:110"/>
wherein they might ſit at their pleaſures: but if they would not come thither, then two of the Senatours which were moſt neere and deare vnto them, repreſented their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and had power to pronounce to voyces or ſuffrages for the Kings, and two other for themſelues. And ſuch were the honors and dignities giuen to the Kings, by the Common-wealth of Sparta, while they liued, and when they were dead, theſe following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, certaine horſ-men proclaimed and divulged the Kings death, throughout all Laconia: the like was done alſo by certaine women which walked vppe and downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the cittie, ſtriking and beating vpon pots or kettles: which done, there muſt of euery houſe two, (one man and one woman, and both free-borne) be ſtayned, ſoyled, and defiled with weeping and lamenting, which if they refuſed to do, they were ſeuerally puniſhed.</p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians vſed the ſame orders in their Kings Funeralles, as the barbarous people of Aſia did: for in this manner did moſt of thoſe barbarous people bury their Kings.</p>
               <p>The death of the King beeing thus divulged, the citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Sparta ſummoned all their friends and kinsfolkes out of all the Countrey of Lacedemonia to the funerall. And after many thouſands both of them and of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as alſo of the Spartans themſelues, were there aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, (both men and women mingled together:) they lamented and wept, beating and ſtriking vppon their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, and roaring, and howling moſt bitterly, concluded their lamentation with this ſaying: That this laſt deceaſed king was the beſt of all their kings. And if any of their kings were ſlaine in the wars, they faſhioned and pourtrayed an image like vnto him, and (laying it vpon a bed very richly
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:24800:110"/>
furniſhed) ſpent ſome ten dayes in the interring thereof, during which time there was continual vacation and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from proſecuting lawes, and exerciſing iuſtice in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces iudiciall, nor was there any Seſſions of Magiſtrates or Officers in all that time, but continuall lamentation and bewayling. And in this the Lacedemonians agreed with the Perſians: for when the Lacedemonian King was dead, he which ſucceeded him, pardoned and releaſed euery Spartane of all his debt, what euer it was, that he owed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the King or Common-wealth. And ſo likewiſe in Perſia, he which was newly created king, remitted and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue vnto all the Cittizens their tribute which they owed.</p>
               <p>In this alſo the Lacedemonians imitated the Aegipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: for in Lacedemonia, as wel as in Aegipt, both Cryers, Minſtrels and Cookes ſucceeded their fathers in their arts and occupations,; ſo as a Cooke was begott by a Cooke, a Trumpetter by a Trumpetter, and a Cryer by a Cryer. Nor did any intrude themſelues into another mans fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or calling, but perſeuered and continued in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers trade and vocation.</p>

dancing in armour and weapons, inuented by <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and therefore called the Pyrrichan dancing or vaulting, in which dancing they vſed to bow and bend their bodies, the better to ſhunne and auoide weapons and wounds: Their garments were ſhort Clokes or Caſſockes, and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhooes; and they eſteemed of weapons and armour, as moſt rare and pretious gifts.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, they were ſo skilfull and expert in ſea-faring matters, as that it was an vſuall Prouerbe, if one diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that hee knew not that which hee knew right well, to ſay, No more is a man of Creete acquainted with the Sea.</p>
               <p>All Marriages were made and ſolemnized betwixt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals: and it was lawfull and tolerable for Virgins to chuſe and elect them husbands out of that troupe of young men: But the cuſtome was, that their husbands ſhould not take them from their fathers houſes, before they were fit to gouerne an houſe, and play the good houſ-wiues at home: And their dower was, (if they had any brother) the one halfe of the patrimonie.</p>
               <p>Children by their law were inſtructed in learning, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and muſicke, and brought to the Feaſtes called <hi>(Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitia)</hi> where men were aſſembled, and there made to ſitte downe vppon the ground, apparelled in baſe attire, and to fall out and brawle amongſt themſelues; and the boy of the beſt courage was made captaine ouer the whole companie: And euery one as hee was of power, got the moſt companions vppon his ſide. Then would they go a hunting, and practiſe running. And vppon certaine dayes, the whole companie of children were put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and taught to ſing to the pipe and harpe, as is vſed in warres.</p>

The chiefeſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers are Hebrus, Neſſus, and Strymon, and the greateſt and higheſt hilles, Haemus, Rhodope, and Orbelus.</p>
               <p>The countrey is very populous, and the people very fierce and barbarous, in ſuch manner as if they were all ſubiect vnto the gouernement of one man, or that they were all of one mind, they were then (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> the father of Hiſtories, is of opinion) a people inuincible, and the moſt valiant of al Nations: but becauſe this is too hard a matter to bee hoped for, and too vnpoſſible to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, therefore be they weake and of little force.</p>
               <p>In Thrace be many and diuers Regions, diſtinguiſhed by ſeuerall names, but all of them indued with like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and opinions: the Getae and Tranſi onely excepted, and the people that dwell aboue Creſtonae: of which three ſorts of people, the Getae are of opinion, that they ſhall neuer die, but that (after their departure out of this lyfe) they goe inſtantly vnto <hi>Zamolxis</hi> their god: This <hi>Zamolxis</hi> was once the Diſciple of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who (vppon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into Thrace) perceiuing how rudely, vnciuilly, and ſottiſhly the Thracians liued, (hee himſelfe beeing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly inſtructed of the manner of gouernement in Ionia) taught and furniſhed them with manners, lawes, and ciuill inſtitutions, and after perſwaded them, that thoſe which kept and obſerued his lawes and ordinances iuſtly, and as they ought, ſhould after their deaths come vnto him into a place, where he would ſtay for them, and that there they

ſhould euer liue and enioy his preſence &amp; all other things that good were, by which meanes (hauing ſetled in them a conceit of his god-head) he withdrew himſelfe from their ſight, and (vaniſhing away they knew not whether) left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a great deſire and longing after him. And vnto this <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molxis</hi> their god do the people as yet ſend meſſengers, the manner of which ſuperſtition is thus, firſt they elect by lot one to vndergoe that buſineſſe, and (putting him into a ſhip furniſhed with fiue watermen or owers) they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him in thoſe things which they cheefly want, and which he ſhall deſire of their God &amp; ſo ſend him away: Then doe they giue charge vnto the mariners, that ſome of them ſhal hold three darts or iauelins vpright, and the reſt to take the meſſenger that is ſent to <hi>Zamolxis</hi> by the legges and armes, and to hoiſe and toſſe him vp vpon their pikes or iauelin points, &amp; then if he die ſodenly they imagine that their god is appeaſed and well pleaſed with them, but if he die not inſtantly, but languiſh and linger long, then they accuſe the meſſenger as a wicked and lewde fellow.

               <p>The Trauſi agree with the Thracians in all other things, ſauing onelie concerning their birthes and deathes: wherein this is their order. As ſoone as a child is borne into the world, preſently all his kinsfolke

and friends flocke about him, bewayling greatly his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity, and ſaying, that ſeeing he is borne, he muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſuffer and indure all humaine and worldly calamities, and againe, when one is departed out of this life, they commit him to the ground with great ioy and exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhewing what and how many euills he hath eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to liue for euer in eternal happineſſe.</p>
               <p>But thoſe which dwell beyond the Creſtonae haue many wiues a yeere, and when a man dieth, there is great controuerſie amongſt his wiues (all their friends being accited to giue their iudgements of the matter) which of thoſe wiues was beſt beloued of her husband, and ſhe that is adiudged to haue beene deereſt vnto him in his life time (which ſhee eſteemeth a great honour vnto her) is both by the men and women, adorned and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly decked vp and ſo brought vnto her husbands tombe, and there killed by one of her own deereſt friends, and interred with her dead husband, all the other wiues lamenting, and accounting that a great croſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace vnto them.</p>
               <p>All other Thracians in generall ſell their children o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, nor be virgins there reſtrained from accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their neereſt kin, no not with their owne fathers, but may lie with whom they pleaſe, and yet husbands be very chary of their wiues chaſtity, for they buy them of their parents with great ſummes of money, and the ſigne them in the forheads with certaine markes, which kind of marking is held a very generous and worthy thing: but to be without thoſe markes is an argument of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and baſeneſſe: where diuers maides are to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, thoſe which be moſt beautifull be firſt taxed and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and beeing once prized their parents will not by any

               <p>The Daci afterwardes poſſeſſed this Countrie, of whom for a certaine ſpace it was called <hi>Dacia,</hi> but now it is enioyed by the Almaines, the Siculi, and the Valachians.</p>
               <p>The Almaines or Teutones were a verie valiant and hardie people, ſent thether out of Saxonie, by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who in their owne naturall language and dialect were called Seibemburges, of the ſeuen Cities which they inhabited.

               <p>None but onely the wife, lamenteth and bewaileth the death of her husband, and then is her head couered with a white linnen cloath, hanging downe to her elbowes: the richer ſort of people haue a banket made them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the forteeth daie after the funeralls, in remembrance of him that is dead, but the poorer ſorte bee feaſted fiue times within the fortie daies: the daies of their deathes be likewiſe obſerued, wherein they celebrate yeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feaſtes. And thoſe which ſuruiue keepe a regiſter of all their friends which bee dead, to the end they may know vpon what daies the obites and Annuall feaſts are to bee celebrated, for euery one that is departed: the dead bodies bee buried and interred with weeping and lamentation.</p>
               <p>The women vſually hange at their eares pearles and precious ſtones, which in men is not ſo commendable but onelie while they bee children, and then it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent inough: a woman that hath had two husbands may bee thought chaſte, but ſhee that hath beene thrice married, is condemned as lewde and laſciuious, and yet it is no impeachment to mens credits though they haue had three wiues.</p>
               <p>Maides before mariage ſuffer there haire to hange down behinde them, but when they bee married they couer it carefully, and men cut theirs ſhort, rounde about their eares, eſteeming all trimming of there haires to be a reproach vnto them.</p>

This Nation is generally addicted to venery and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe, for to bee drunke they hold a glory vnto them, and eſteeme of luſt and laſciuiouſneſſe as of a thing law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and commendable, ſo as the marriage bed be not defiled. Vſury alſo is there very common and vſuall, and not held to bee deceite in any one, not ſo much as in the Clergie.</p>
               <p>A great part of the Ruſſians be bond-men and ſeruile, <note place="margin">Many Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans make themſelues bondmen.</note> and that willingly, for many of them, and thoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the better ſort, ſet to ſale themſelues, their wiues and children, other, for becauſe they may thereby liue more idlely, or enioy greater pleaſure.</p>

               <p>The Ruſſians haue a ſpeech peculiar to themſelues, but whether it bee the Scythian tongue or no I am not able for to Iudge, their letters are not much vnlike the Greeke caracters: they doe for the moſt part learne muſicke and gammer after the Greeke manner, and haue all other arts in contempt.</p>
               <p>Touching matters of faith, they beleeue as the Greekes doe, vſe like ceremonies in their ſeruice, and like honour to the Saints. There bee twelue men choſen and elected for to doe Iuſtice and determine controuerſies, whereof

               <p>They bee very much giuen to husbandry, they plow with horſes, and their ſoile is very fruitfull of all things but wine, there drinke is a kinde of beere or ale made of millet and barley boyled together, which kinde of liquor is moſt commonly drunke in all the Northerne partes. They make oyle of hempe-ſeed, poppie and nuts: oliue trees they haue none, nor is the iuſe or liquor thereof brought thither from other countries, Ruſſia breedeth many ſorts of wilde beaſts, whereof diuers bee of rich furres, and highly commended of ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: there is great ſtore of fiſh, amongſt which, is a moſt excellent one called Seldis, which is taken in a lake cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Pareſlacus, and is very like the fiſhes that bee caught in the lake Benacus (which is a lake neere Betrona in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie.)</p>

This land (if <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> report a truth) is waſhed with the famous Riuer Viſtula, from the Cittie Tornum to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum, where it falleth into the Baltean ſea, it lyeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Germany, and reacheth from the riuer Viſtula, to the Sarmaticke Ocean.</p>

               <p>The people bee much inclined to diuination and witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft: the god in whome they repoſe moſt confidence and truſt, and which they eſpecially honour and adore, is the Fire, which they perſwade themſelues to be moſt holy, and euerlaſting, becauſe it is fedde with continuall fuell,

               <p>Nor did they worſhippe and reuerence the fire and woods onely, but euery other thing likewiſe, which vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remained and abidde in the woods, as birds, and wilde beaſts: and if any one violated and contemned their witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts and Inuocation of diuels, their heads and feete would incontinently cloſe and ſhrinke together, by the deceipt and illuſion of their euill ſpirits. Within the woods each family had a place or hearth, wherein they kept a fire for all that family; in which fire their cuſtome was, to burne their dead bodies, with their horſes, ſaddles, and beſt gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: firmely beleeuing, that in that place thoſe which be dead and burned, meet together in the night, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made them ſettles or benches to ſit vppon of Corcke tree, and placed them in readines, the beſt meath, and a kind of meate made of paſte like vnto a cheeſe, for them to eate.</p>
               <p>Euery yeare vppon the firſt day of October all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the whole countrey aſſembled and mette together in thoſe woods, and there (vſing all kind of deuotion) cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated a ſollemne Feaſt, each family feeding in his owne cottage, vppon the daintieſt fare, and moſt delicious

               <p>Their language is all one with the Lithuanians, and the Polonians, for the Prieſts preach vnto the people in the Polonian tongue: they obſerue the Cuſtomes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, although there be ſome Ruthens towards the South, and Muſcouites which dwell farre north, which obſerue the Ceremonies of the Greeke Church, yeelding their obedience to the Biſhoppe of Conſtantinople, and not to the Biſhop of Rome. Vppon the North ſide of this Countrey lyeth Muſcovia, it is fiue hundred miles in compaſſe, rich in ſiluer, and vppon all ſides ſo garded, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed, and defended with ſuch ſtrong holds, as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrangers, but their owne natiue countrey-men, be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and prohibited to paſſe in and out at their pleaſures without the Dukes letters of ſafe-conduct.

               <p>The Metrapolitane and chiefe Cittie of the Region, is Moſcua, it is twiſe as bigge within the compaſſe of it, as Prague in Bohemia, the building is of timber as all their other Citties bee, it hath many ſtreetes and lanes, but they ſtand ſtraggling with broad fieldes betwixt them,

the riuer Moſca runneth through the middle of it, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth it into two parts, and in the middeſt of the Cittie ſtandeth a caſtell or tower, builded vppon leuell ground, wherein be ſeuenteene turrets, and three bul-warkes or Blocke-houſes, ſo ſtrong and ſo ſtately, as there be but few ſuch to bee found: within this Caſtell bee ſeuenteene Churches, whereof thoſe three which be dedicated to our bleſſed Ladie, Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> and Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> bee wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about with ſtone, but the reſt be made of timber: there is alſo in it three large and ſpatious Courts, for Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Courtiers to ſpend their time in, a ſtately and beautifull pallace alſo for the Duke to dwell in, builded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Italian faſhion, but not very large.</p>
               <p>The Countrey containeth many famous Dukedoms, out of which, vppon any occaſion, in the ſpace of three or foure dayes, they will get together in a readineſſe two hundred thouſand able men: Their vſuall drinke is water and meath, and a certaine leauened or ſowre liquor, which they call <hi>Quaſſatz:</hi> they plow with woodden ploughes, and harow their ground with branches of trees, or thorns. Their corne (by reaſon of continuall cold) ripeneth but ſlowly, and therefore they drie it in hote houſes, and ſo threſh it.</p>
               <p>Againſt the extremitie of cold, they vſe diuers ſpices, and make a kind of water to drinke of oates, hony and milke; ſo ſtrong, that they will ſometimes be drunke with it: Wine and oyle they haue none; and to auoide drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Gouernour of the countrey forbiddeth the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of all ſtrong drinkes, vppon paine of death, except twiſe or thrice in a yeare, and then it is tolerable for them to be drunke.</p>
               <p>They haue ſiluer coyne of two ſortes, a bigger, and a

But ſurely <hi>Cornelius</hi> was either much deceyued, or elſe the country is much altered from what it then was, for Germany at this day, is ſo pleaſant and ſo plentifull of all things, ſo beautified, ſtrengthened and addorned, with famous Citties, ſtrong Caſtels and ſtately buildings, as it is nothing inferior either to France Spaine or Italy, for the heauens ſmyle vpon them, the fields affords them ſtore of fruites, the Sunne ſolaceth him ſelfe amongſt her hills, ſhee hath whole mountaines of vynes, woods at wil, and all kinde of graine in abundance, being watred on all ſides with Rhene, Danubius, Moga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Albis, Neccharus, Sala, Odera, and with many other great and famous riuers and brookes: there be fountaines like-wife of ſweete waters, hot bathes and mines of Salte, and it is equall to any other country for all ſorts of mettals yea all Italy, France, and Spaine, ſtore them-ſelues with ſiluer and other mettalls out of Germany: and there is ſome gold gotten, ſo as if thoſe old writers were now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and beheld the preſent eſtate of Germany, as now it is, they would doubtleſſe thinke it ſtrange and wonder to ſee ſuch alteration, to perceiue each place ſo holſome and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:24800:131"/>
conuenient to dwell in, the ayre ſo temperate, the ſoyle ſo fertile, ſuch aboundance of wine, and all kinde of graine, ſuch planting of trees, ſuch beautifull buildings of Citties, Temples and Sanctuaries, ſuch aduancement of religion, ſuch ciuility amongſt cittizens, decencie in apparell, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in feates of armes, ſuch furniture and prouiſion for warres, and ſuch ſtore of all manner of ornaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the extraordinary ſincerity and perfection of the Peeres and Nobility, if (I ſay) they beheld and marked all theſe things well, I am of opinion they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the ground as barren, rude, ill fauoured, or little beholding to the heauens, yea they ſhould ſee how true that ſaying is; That good things are ſpoiled for want of workemanſhip and well husbanding: the ayre is there more calme and temperate in winter, then in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and therefore it produceth more excellent fruites, yet be their ſummers more intemperate, through which intemperature many of thoſe fruites be often-times cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and ſpoiled, beſides there bee many venemous beaſts, and other, creatures pernitious and hurtfull to the inhabitants, and yet for all this, is it hardly to bee iudged, what Prouince may be compared vnto it, much leſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before it.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why this country aſſumeth the name of Germany, is, for that there is ſuch a ſympathy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance <note place="margin">Germany why ſo called.</note> amongſt all the people, both in the diſpoſition of their bodies, their manners and courſes of life, as all of them agree and liue together like brothers and equalls. It was firſt called Teutonia of <hi>Tuiſco</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Noe,</hi> and <hi>Alemanin,</hi> of <hi>Mannus</hi> his ſonne, who were ſaid to be the firſt authors and originall of that nation: though ſome be of a contrary opinion, and affirme, that Germany was

firſt inhabited by ſuch as were there bred and borne, and not by ſuch as were brought from other places; of which opinion is one which hath written thus.</p>

               <p>The Germaines before they began their battels, vſed to chaunt forth a ſong or holy hymne, in honor of <hi>Hercules,</hi> holding opinion that he was once in that country: when they ioyned battell they would crie out with a moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and clamourous noyſe, not ſo confuſed and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as terrible to their enemie. Their eyes bee (for the moſt part) blew, their lookes ſterne, and their hayre red or yellow, they be tall of ſtature, and naturally very ſodaine and head-long in all their enterpriſes, but they cannot away with much labour and toyle, nor can they indure heate and thirſt, ſo well as the Frenchmen can, but cold they can indure paſſing well. Of gold and ſiluer they made no account, for the plate and Iewels of ſiluer which were ſent them from forraine Princes, they eſteemed as baſe and vile as earthen veſſels: But ſince by trafficke and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with other countries, the vſe thereof hath crept in amongſt them. And there bee ſome hold opinion, that there is neither ſiluer nor gold gotten there as yet, and but ſmall ſtore of Yron, which was the cauſe that they vſed no ſwords in the warres, but long Speares or Iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins with ſhort Yron pikes, being a very fit and handſome weapon to fight withall both aloofe and neere at hand.</p>

Their horſemen fought with ſhields and thoſe ſhort ſpeares, and footmen with ſtones and darts, and both of them naked, or in little ſhort gabberdines or caſſacks: the ſouldiers were diſtinguiſhed and knowne one from an other by the coulour of their ſhields, which were painted with ſelect and curious coulours, and but few of them wore either priuie coates, helmets, or head-peeces. Their horſes were neither well ſhapt nor ſpeedie paced, nor could they runne the ring, or career like Italian horſes, but onely ſtraight forward: hee that loſt his ſhield in fight was ſeuerely puniſhed, for hee was vtterly excluded from their ſacrifices, and not admitted to come into the Senate or Councell houſe, and many were ſo deeply tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with that indignitie, as they would violently procure their owne deaths, rather then indure ſuch diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Their Kings were elected for their worth and Nobility, and their power and authority was not altogether free, but limitted and reſtrained: the worthieſt ſouldiers, and men of greateſt valour, and ſuch as could effect more by their good examples, then by all their force and authority, were ordained leaders and conductors of their armies. There was none had power to chaſtice, beat, or puniſh an other, but the Prieſts only, for they held that reuengment belonged only vnto the gods, whoſe miniſters the Prieſts were. They would pourtray the Images of their gods, and carry them with them into the warres, as a ſpeciall incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to fight. And their friends and kinsfolke like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were placed neere vnto the battell, that in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence they might either atchieue a glorious victory, or end their dayes with honor: and their parents, wiues and children were eye-witneſſes of their valor and proweſſe, and euer as any of them that fought were wounded, they
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:24800:133"/>
were brought vnto their mothers and wiues, and other friends that were lookers on, who were euer readie and willing to heale and cure them, and to ſupply the ſoldiers with victualles, exciting and encouraging them to fight manfully: through which exhortations (as ſome haue written) the battell hath renewed and begunne a freſh, when the ſouldiers were almoſt ſpent and wearied out: for they eſteemed their women to be of great ſanctitie and prouidence, and therefore their Councels were not to be contemned, nor their aduiſes deſpiſed. Vppon certaine dayes they vſed to ſacrifice men vnto <hi>Mercurie,</hi> and beaſts to <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> and they were generally giuen to ſorcerie and witch-craft.</p>
               <p>Trifling and pettie cauſes were managed and decided by the Rulers and Magiſtrates of the citties; but all great buſineſſes and difficult affaires, were handled by the whole body of the city in generall. They would neuer begin any buſines, but when the Moone was either in the change or in the full, and they reckened their computation not by the dayes, but by the nights.</p>
               <p>They came armed into the Councell-houſe to decide controuerſies, and to maintaine the right of cauſes, and hee vppon whoſe ſide the ſentence paſſed, and was con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mended, had a Iaueling ſhaken and brandiſhed againſt him; which manner of ſentence giuing, they accounted to be moſt honorable, and againe thoſe whoſe cauſes were nought, were condemned by the Iudges frownes and ſterne lookes.</p>

No Magiſtrate would execute any publike or priuate buſineſſe, but when he was armed: there was great emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt them about their diet, and they were incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly giuen to affectation, for he carried the greateſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and eſtimation amongſt his friends and neighbours, that was beſt attended and accompanied with young gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, when hee went abroad about any buſineſſe. If the Prince that was Generall or Leader of the armie, departed out of the field without victorie, he liued in diſcredite and infamie all his life time after, for the Prince fighteth only for victorie, and the other Noblemen for the ſafetie of the Prince.</p>
               <p>They would oftentimes take occaſion to make warres without cauſe giuen, onely becauſe they could not indure to liue quietly and peaceably. For they held it a point of ſloth and ſluggiſhneſſe, to get their liuing by their labors, if they might get it by warres, though it coſt them their liues: if they had no warres, the valianteſt men of them all, ſpent their times wholy in eating, drinking, and ſleeping; committing both houſes and husbandrie to the care and guidance of old men and women.</p>
               <p>So as it ſeemeth ſtrange to ſee two ſuch contrarie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in one people, to be both louers of idleneſſe, and yet enemies to peace and quietneſſe. Their dwellings were in villages, and euery one in ſeuerall houſes, their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, ſhort caſſockes, or ſouldiers coates, buttoned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with claſpes, or pinned with thornes, and the richer ſort were knowne and diſtinguiſhed from others by their clothes: for they wore their coates ſo cloſe to their skins, as you might plainely perceiue the perfect proportion of each lim and member, and the ſelfe ſame faſhion of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell which ſerued men, was worne by women likewiſe.</p>

Moſt part of the Germaines which dwelt towards the Eaſt and North ſide of the countrie, contented themſelues with one wife a peece, ſome few excepted which had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and the wife was not indowed by the husband, but the husband by the wife; nor was their dowers of ſuch dainties as were onely fit to make them fine and gay, but of ſuch things as they had moſt vſe of, as yokes of oxen, horſes, with their furniture, ſhields, ſwords, Iauelings and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The women were wonderful chaſt and modeſt, and their lookes nothing want on to procure allurements: they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented no banquets nor common feaſts, ſo as (though the nation were very populous) there was few women found offending in adulterie; but if any were thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted, her owne husband would pull her headlong out of his houſe ſtarke naked, before her neighbours and friends, and whip her round about the towne, nor was there any place for pardon for ſuch laſciuious ſtrumpets, no not their youth, beautie, nor riches could any whit priuiledge them, or reconcile them to their husbands. It was not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable for any one to ſcoffe at vice, for thereby they thought they both corrupted others, and were corrupted themſelues. And as euery woman had but one bodie and one life, ſo ſhould ſhe haue but one husband, nor ought ſhe to haue any idle cogitation or wanton deſire, as if ſhee more regarded the act of matrimonie, then her husbands loue: ſo as more good was done by their manners and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, then in other places by wholeſome &amp; ſtrict lawes. Yong men were not very prone to luſt, &amp; eſpecially when their youthfull dayes drew to an end, and maides were not married til they were of good yeares, that they might bee more ſtrong and able to beare children.</p>

Murder was puniſhed with a certaine number of cattell, <note place="margin">The puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for murder.</note> which the murtherer muſt giue to al the dead mans friends as a ſatisfaction for his death: They were very deſirous to diet together, and to keepe good hoſpitalitie, accounting it an vnhoneſt and vndecent part to forbid any one their houſes or tables. Rewards were willingly taken and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, nor would they vpbraide any one with that they had giuen, nor thinke themſelues in any matter beholding for what they receiued.</p>
               <p>They would ſpend whole nights and dayes in drinking <note place="margin">Drunkenneſſe a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst the Germaines</note> and carowſing, eſteeming and accounting it a credit to be drunken: and oftentimes after their gluttonie and gorman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, they would brall and fall out one with another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing ill words, and ſometimes blowes, whereof of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes inſued mayming and murder. They conſulted of all ſerious matters, touching both warre and peace, amidſt their banquets, deeming their iudgements more acute, and themſelues more carefull at that time, then at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and more fit to vndergo any notable enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>The people were plaine and ſimple, without craft, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation or cunning, and eaſily drawne to lay open and diſcouer the very ſecrets of their hearts: They would call to mind the day after, what they had done before, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the matter more deliberatly, when they knew not how to alter it, ſhewing then what their intent was, when they could not be deceiued.</p>
               <p>They drunke a corrupt drinke made of barly, in ſtead of wine, but thoſe which dwelt nere vnto great riuers had wine brought them out of other countries: their meat was ſimple and groſſe, as wild apples, new dow, thicke milke, or clottered Creame: but their drinke was much more immoderate: They delighted to behold and ſee young

men naked, amongſt ſwords and ſpeares, and other mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie weapons belonging to warre, and to ſee how finely and nimbly they could deliuer themſelues out of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them, the often practiſe whereof made them skilful, and their agilitie and skill was a great ornament vnto them. They were ſo exceedingly giuen to dicing, as when they had loſt all that euer they had, they would aduenture their owne liberties vppon one chance at dice; and if they <note place="margin">The Germains were great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> loſt, they would willingly become ſlaues, and ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (though neuer ſo ſtrong and luſtie) to be bound and ſold like beaſts. They diuided the yeare into Winter, Spring, and Sommer, making no recknning of Autumne, by reaſon of their ſcarcitie of wine and fruites.</p>
               <p>In their Funerals they made little ſhew of ſorrow, by weeping and outward lamentations, but the dolor and griefe of their hearts continued long, and women onely bewayled the dead, it being enough for men to remember them. And theſe in times paſt were the cuſtomes of the Germaines, and their manner of liuing.</p>
               <p>But how much they bee altered from what they then <note place="margin">The later man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Germanes.</note> were, (as well as other nations) may bee gathered by this their preſent eſtate: for now the whole ſtate and condition of the Germaines, conſiſteth of foure ſortes of people: the firſt ſort or Order is the Clergie, which be of two ſorts likewiſe: that is to ſay, ſecular Prieſts, and religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; <note place="margin">The Germains diuided into foure ſorts of people whereof the firſt is the Clergie.</note> both of them beeing indowed with great and large rents, reuenues, and riches, and held in great honour and eſtimation wirh the people, both for that they offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto God, extoll the prayſes of the Saynts, and haue cure of ſoules; as alſo for that they vnderſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and holy Writ, bee able to interpret and expound them, and leade a ſingle life; for thoſe which haue not all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:24800:136"/>
theſe good parts in them, are deſpiſed and contemned of the vulgar ſort of people: And euery order of religious perſons, haue their garments made of their owne faſhion, very decent and comely: The ſecular, or lay-Prieſtes weare looſe Coates, for the moſt part black, or ruſſet, and linnen myters on their heads, not very high crowned, but ſticking cloſe about their eares. And when they go abroad, they caſt about their neckes, for decencies ſake, a broade lace, either of ſilk or linnen, which hangeth downe on each ſide their ſhoulders: Vpon their ſhooes are pumps: they weare Pantofles or Sandals, putting them off euer when they come home.</p>
               <p>Moſt of them liue very idlely, beſtowing little time in obtaining learning, but ſpending all the after-noones in gaming and drinking. The inferiour Prieſts, if any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure them, complaine vnto their Biſhoppe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Court of Rome: whereby they worke their owne ſecurity, and condigne puniſhment is inflicted vpon the offenders.</p>
               <p>The ſecond eſtate or condition is of the Nobilitie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">The ſecond or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is of the Nobilitie.</note> there bee many degrees; as Princes, Earles, Barons, and Knights, which is the loweſt degree of that Order: the Princes excell all the other degrees, as well in dignitie and bloud, as in power and ſtrength, as hauing very large lands and ample poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>The Earles, Barons, and other Nobles liue diſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade in the countrie, ſome in one place, ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, flowriſhing like ſo many flowers in a greene field. But that which is very ſtrange &amp; worthy to be obſerued in the Nobilitie, is this, that both Princes &amp; Earls acknowledge a ſoueraignty: &amp; yeeld their obedience vnto the Emperor; ſo oft as neceſſitie, or the Emperour himſelfe requireth it: and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:24800:136"/>
yet the Knights ſay, that they be exempted, and that they will not ſerue any one, nor ſuffer thoſe which be vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſerue, but for wages and ſtipend, yet notwithſtanding they acknowledge and ſay, that the Romaine Emperour is their Soueraigne Lord and Gouernor. The Nobilitie in generall, thinke it a great diſcredit vnto them, and a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh vnto their kindred and houſe, to exerciſe merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, or any mechanicall art, or to take a wife from among the common people, or that is their inferiour, or to liue in a ſtrange citty like townſ-men: for they (skorning all company and commerce with cittizens) liue freely with their wiues and families, in ſtately caſtels, ſtrong holdes, and beautifull pallaces, ſituated ſome vppon mountaines, ſome in woods, and ſome in champion countries. Some of the Nobles frequent the Courts of Kings and great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and follow the warres, and ſome others liue at their owne houſes vppon their Rents and reuenues.</p>
               <p>They be much giuen to hunting, affirming, that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall cuſtome, and their auncient libertie, they only are allowed to hunt, and all other interdicted and depriued of that pleaſure; for, for a priuate man to hunt either hares, ro-buckes, kids, hynd-calues, or ſtagges, in ſome place is puniſhed with the loſſe of his eyes; and in ſome other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the loſſe of his head: but it is lawfull for euery one that can, to take ſuch wild beaſts that be noyſome and hurtfull.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, they fare daintily, and be ſumptuouſly cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, as well men as women, both at home and abroade, beeing decked and adorned with gold, ſiluer, and ſilkes of ſundry colours: When they walke abroad they are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a troupe of their friends and familiars, and they may eaſily be knowne and diſcerned from the common-people,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:24800:137"/>
onely by their gate, it is ſo graue and demure: They neuer go farre from home but on horſe-backe, for to take a iourney on foot they account a great diſhonor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and a plaine demonſtration of pouertie: but if they ſtand in want of any thing, they will ſtraine courteſie to take it from others, either priuily or by force. They ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome go to law with any one for iniuries done vnto them, but rather gather a troupe of their friends together, and reuenge themſelues, either by fire, ſword, or rapine: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by compelling the wrong-doers to make what ſatisfaction they thinke good.</p>
               <p>They be proude, turbulent, and couetous, practiſing how to get Church-mens goods by deceit, and wracking their ſlaues and clownes of the country, with an vnrelen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting authoritie. It is almoſt incredible to be ſpoken, how they vexe, pill and poll thoſe miſerable and vnfortunate caytiues, &amp; ſurely Germany were an hundred times more happie, if thoſe Centaures, worſe then <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris,</hi> were either vtterly expelled the land, or at the leaſt, their tyranny and power ſo reſtrained &amp; abridged, as they might be inforced to liue priuate like vnto the Nobility in Heluetia. The 3. eſtate or order of the Germaines, is of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens and townſ-men: and of theſe, ſome be onely ſubiect <note place="margin">The third or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is of citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</note> to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſome to other Princes and Prelates of the church. Thoſe which yeld obedience to the Emperor, haue many priuiledges, lawes, and cuſtomes common to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and euery yeare (by the voyces of the cittizens) is one chiefe magiſtrate elected; who for his yeare hath a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraign authority ouer them all, and hee of himſelfe hath power to puniſh any one of the ſame order with death.</p>
               <p>When an offence is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, the offendor is brought before the magiſtrates elected, where beeing ſette in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:24800:137"/>
councel, the accuſer is called for, who hauing ſet downe his accuſation, the defendant hath free liberty to plead for himſelfe; and when both parties be heard, at large, the Iudges proceed to ſentence, which is not by any courſe of law (for that theſe manner of magiſtrates be ignorant of the lawes) but as they be induced by reaſon, and as the cuſtome hath beene afore-time in like caſes: the like forme of Iudgement is vſed in ciuill cauſes likewiſe, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that in ciuill and criminall cauſes, the party accuſed may appeale vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which offenders in other cauſes may not doe.</p>
               <p>In euery Imperiall Citty bee two ſorts of Citizens, the <note place="margin">Citizens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into two ſects.</note> one of Gentlemen, the other of Plebeians: the Plebeians or comminalty of the city, be occupied in trading and keeping ſhops, but the Gentlemen (which bee alſo called Patritians) liue only vpon their patrimony &amp; reuenewes, in as good faſhion as the Nobility or Knights of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try do, if any of the comminalty wax ſo rich, that he (either by cuſtome or commerce) will intrude himſelfe into the ſociety of Gentlemen, he is (notwithſtanding his wealth) diſcarded their companies, whereof it proceedeth that each of theſe orders of Citizens, haue for many yeeres, continued in there owne eſtate without alteration. And yet for all this the adminiſtration and gouernment of their commonwealth, is commune and permitted as well vnto the Plebeians as Patritians, ſo as the communalty is no way in ſubiection to the gentility, but euery one hath his owne ſubſtance in ſafety, with free liberty (not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing their lawes) to liue as they liſt: and Iuſtice is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred (for the moſt part) throughout al the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by men which haue little learning or none at al, for in euery City (and in many townes likewiſe) bee elected 12.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:24800:138"/>
Iudges, which be ſuch as be moſt notorious for vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and integrity of life, not reſpecting whether they be learned or no, which twelue muſt of neceſſity take vpon them the office of Iuſtice and Iudgement, for which they expect no other wages nor reward, but onely honour, and they be ſo diligent in performing their duties therein, that (for the common good) they will not ſticke to neglect al priuate affaires and buſineſſe whatſoeuer (be they neuer ſo vrgent) to obſerue the times appointed for Iudgment and hearing of cauſes. And they bee all of them ſworne to miniſter Iuſtice vnto euery one, according to right and equity, from whoſe ſentences in times paſt, they would neuer appeale, eſteming it a great indignity vnto them, to contradict the decrees of ſuch men as executed their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>gratis,</hi> but now adaies appeales be vſuall, which were the more tollerable a great deale, if the Iudges to whom the appeales be made, would in their Iudgements obſerue the cuſtomes of the former Iudges, but their doinges are ſo little regarded, that their ſentences, though neuer ſo iuſt and vpright, be retracted and wholy altered, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeeme to repugne their written lawes, whereby the Iudges of the former rancke, are vndeſeruedly taxed of ignorance, their good indeuours reprooued, and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, and the parties to bee releeued oftentimes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: which kinde of Iudgement, how corrupt it is, themſelues may eaſily perceiue.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the Citizens liue and accord together very familiarly and friendly, meeting and aſſembling themſelues, ſometimes in publicke places, ſometimes in priuate houſes, where they ſpend their time, ſome in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling, ſome in conferrence one with an other, ſome in feaſting and banquetting, and ſome in gaming
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:24800:138"/>
and diſporting, in all which ſundry actions can hardly be diſcouered any deceite or contention.</p>
               <p>They be very curteous and affable, for at all times and in all places, bee they men or women, ſo often as they meete together, ſo often doe they ſalute one an other. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on working daies they be very frugall and ſparing, both in their diet and apparell, but vpon feſtiuall daies they will goe more gallantly and far more daintily. Thoſe which labour eate foure times a day, and playmen but twiſe; the mens apparell for the moſt part is wollen, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens linnen, and each of them ſo much differrent one from an other, both in collour and faſhion, as you ſhall hardly finde one man or one woman apparelled like an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for they be ſo new fangled as they will fall into eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry new faſhion, imitating the Italians, but more vſually the French men, from whom now of late yeeres, the men haue gotten their broad noſed ſhooes, their coates with wide hanging ſleeues cut, and wouen cappes (which they call Pyrethia) And not long ſince, they wore ſhooes with ſharpe ſnoutes, ſhort coates clooſe to their bodies, and hoods with tayles or flappes behinde: This ſparingneſſe in apparel heretofore vſed by men, is now deſcended vnto women and by them practiſed, for whereas they were wonte to weare many kerchers vpon their heads, which made their heads ſeeme great, by reaſon of their many folds of linnen, they now weare but one onely: They bee alſo more modeſt in all their other clothes then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they haue beene in a manner vtterly reiecting gold, ſiluer and pearles, and all ſumptuous garding of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with rich furres and ſilkes.</p>
               <p>I need not ſpeake of their long traines carried vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, which (though they were common) bee now

onely worne of the Nobility, and the women be now ſo decent and comely cloathed, as they cannot iuſtly bee reprehended for any thing they weare, ſauing that ſome womens gownes bee ouer wide and to much hollowed about the necke.</p>
               <p>In their funerals and celebration of their friends o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, they be attired in blacke, and their time of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is thirty daies, within which ſpace they doe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for them three times, the firſt day, the ſeuenth day and the thirtith day.</p>
               <p>They be ſo deuout and religious a people, that euery artificer before he begin his worke, wil goe to the Church and heare maſſe, yea both men and maide ſeruants be by their maſters compelled therunto, for they hold it a beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hatefull thing, for any one to neglect his ſeruice to God, either for idleneſſe, or for any buſineſſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. In giuing almes they be very charitable, for there is almoſt no City but it hath in it a couent of Mendicant Friers, and a common houſe to releeue and harbor poore Pilgrimes and ſtrangers. There bee alſo ſoſtred and brought vp many yong youths that haue left their owne countries and fathers houſes, to attaine learning in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, of which ſort of ſtriplings and yong ſtudents, you ſhal ſee ſo many in one City as you will thinke it ſtrange how they ſhould be maintained; And theſe bee onely nouriſhed and brought vp, by the almes and charity of the Citizens, and goe ſinging from houſe to houſe for victuals, whereof they haue inough giuen them, for becauſe they frequent the Church daily, and helpe the Prieſts to ſinge maſſe, and bee afterwards made prieſts themſelues.</p>
               <p>In euery pariſh is one publike houſe or free ſchoole,

wherein as well theſe, as the Cittizens ſonnes, be brought vp in learning, their maiſters and tutors be ſuch as bee both learned and vertuous, who chaſtice thoſe which be ſhrewde, or neglect their learning, ſometimes with words and ſometimes with ſtripes.</p>
               <p>Their dwelling houſes for the moſt part be ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and builded according to euery mans ability, ſome high, ſome low, but al aptly and conueniently diſpoſed for their trading, the rich mens houſes be builded ſtately with lime and ſtone, and poore mens with timber and morter, and all of them couered either with tile or ſlate, which whether it be done for ſtate, or to preuent danger of fire I am not able to ſay.</p>
               <p>In Saxony and diuerſe other places beſides, they couer their houſes with ſmooth ſhingles, which maketh their building ſeeme more baſe and more ſubiect to burning: The ſtreets (for the moſt part throughout all the Cities of Germany) be paued with flint ſtone, and vpon the gates of euery City ſtand high turrets or watch-towers, wherein (in the day time) be placed certaine skouts, to giue notice vnto the warders below, by the ſound of a trumpet, of all horſemen they perceiue comming towards them, to the end, that hauing warning afore-hand, they may bee more prouident to prouide for the ſafety of the city: Their cities (for the moſt part) be defended both naturaly &amp; artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being ſcituated either vpon the tops of hils, or by wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riuers, ſuch as be ſcituated vpon the plaine ground, be compaſſed and immured with ſtrong wals and trenches, &amp; defended with innumerable towers and bulwarkes: the fields alſo about many of their cities be ſo incloſed on all ſides with deepe and large ditches, as they ſerue for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient defence againſt the inuaſion of forraine enemies.</p>

Some others affirme that they were wandring Britans, and ſuch as had no certaine habitations, and that they forſooke their natiue ſoile to ſeeke them better ſeates, and getting ſhipping and arry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Germany, expelled thence the Thuringij and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed their land. For at the firſt the people of Saxony were turbulent and troubleſome, il and ouerthwart neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours vnto all thoſe which dwelled neere vnto them, yet were they at home peaceable and quiet, and maruellous vigilant and induſtrious for the good of their country and common-wealth, beſides that they had a very proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care and extraordinary regard, for doing any thing that ſhould be a touch or debaſement to their ſtockes, or againſt their honours, holding it a ſtaine and pollution to their bloud to marry with women of other nations, or with any inferior to themſelues, and indeuouring their vttermoſt to make themſelues a people proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall without mixture of other nations, and onely like vnto themſelues; whereof inſued that though the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them were great, yet in their externall habites, in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:24800:141"/>
the ſtature and proportion of their bodies, and collour of their haire, they were almoſt all alike.</p>
               <p>The Saxons were deuided into foure ſorts or differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">The Saxons deuided into noble-men free-men, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines and ſlaues.</note> of people, which were noble men, freemen, libertines (that is ſuch as had beene ſlaues, and obtained their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and manumiſſion) and bound-men or ſlaues, and to the end that each of theſe orders might remaine in his owne Eſtate, it was eſtabliſhed by a law, that no man of one eſtate, ſhould marry or take to wife a woman of an other, but that the Nobility ſhould match with nobility, the free-men with free-men, the manumitted with thoſe which were manumitted and the ſlaues with ſlaues: the penalty for the tranſgreſſing of which law was preſent death. They had many good and holeſome lawes for the puniſhment of malefactors.</p>
               <p>They were vpright in condition, ſincere in life, and of vncorrupted and irreprehenſible manners, doing nothing but what was profitable, honeſt and agreeable to the lawes of nature: all which had beene ſufficient for their ſaluations, if withall they had knowne and beleeued in the true and euerliuing God. But they were great Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, worſhipping trees, and fountaines of water, but more eſpecially a huge ſtock of wood ſet vp an end, which they accounted for a god, calling it in their language <hi>(Irminſaul)</hi> that is to ſay a vniuerſall and generall piller or colume, whereby all other things are ſuſtained &amp; held vp: <hi>Mercury</hi> alſo they obſerued and honoured as a god of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring vnto him vpon certain daies humaine ſacrifices, nor <note place="margin">Merccury <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued as a god by the Saxons,</hi>
                  </note> did they hold it fit or lowable (by reaſon of the great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and diuinity of their gods) to include them in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Churches, nor to figure them in the proportion of men, but they conſecrated vnto them, woods &amp; groues,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:24800:142"/>
calling them after their names, and they neuer peruſed thoſe ſecret and miſticall places, but with great deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reuerence: Witchcraft and ſocery was much in practice amongſt them. Their manner of taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe whether a thing were to bee done or not done, was thus, firſt they would cut from a fruite tree, diuers little ſprigs or young ſprouts, marking and diſtinguiſhing them each from other, with certaine notes or differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo caſt them ſodainely and at aduentures vpon a white garment.</p>
               <p>And then (if the conſultation were general for them al) the prieſt, if priuate, the goodman of the houſe-hold, lifting vp his eyes towards heauen, and praying to their gods, taketh vp thoſe branches one by one, and layeth them downe againe three ſundrie times, and euer as hee taketh them vp, he expoundeth and interpreteth what is to be done, according to the note or impreſe written vpon them; and then if the prieſt or good men of the houſe forbid it to bee done, they aduiſe no more of the matter that day, but if they allow it, the people were ſo ſtronge of beleefe as they would put the proiect in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe what euer they euent proued: they gathered and coniectured of many things by the chirping and flying of birds, and oftentimes made experiment of forewarnings and admonitions of horſes, which (to preſage of things to come) were nouriſhed and kept in thoſe woods and groues dedicated to their gods.</p>
               <p>Theſe horſes were white and neuer did any manner of worke, and (beeing coupled together and ſet before the holy Chariot) they were attended and followed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the prieſt, the King or chiefe ruler of the city, who diligently marcked and obſerued their neying,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:24800:142"/>
whynying and ſtoming, and this manner of prediction or foreſhewing of things to come, was of all others in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt credit and eſtimation, both by the Princes, prieſts and people, for they held them to bee the miniſters of the gods, and partakers of their diuine councels.</p>
               <p>They vſed alſo an other ſort of ſooth-ſaying or witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, whereby to know aforehand what ſucceſſe they ſhould haue in the warres, which was in this manner: when they tooke a captiue of any nation againſt whom the waged battaile, they compelled him to fight with one of their owne people, and as the victory went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them two ſo would they iudge of the inſuing warres. The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was the firſt, that by continuall warres, compelled this impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people to admit the Chriſtian religion, which both they and all other Germaines doe now moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly adore.</p>
               <p>In Saxonie be many ſumptuous and Princely palaces, and magnificent and ſtately Temples, Churches and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, as one in Alberſtandium conſecrated to our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ladie, whereinto neuer entreth any prophane or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed perſon, but onely ſuch as bee profeſſed in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <note place="margin">A Temple in Alberſtade de dicated to our Lady.</note> and to the ſeruice of God, except vpon Aſhwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dneſday, and then is there one of the people brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, who muſt euer bee ſuch a one, as in the eye of the world is of moſt wicked and abhominable life and conuerſation, this man beeing brought into the Church all in blacke, and his head couered, is placed where hee may heare maſſe, which beeing duely ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed, hee is caſt out of the Temple, and inforced to wander vp and downe the citie bare-footed, all the time of Lent, viſiting all the Churches one after an other,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:24800:143"/>
during which time, he is maintained by the prieſts, and by them brought againe into the Church vpon Eaſter-day, where (hauing firſt an almes giuen him which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth with great deuotion to the Church) after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the oyle, he is expiated and hallowed by the whole Clergie, and ſo diſmiſſed. This man they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Adam,</hi> comparing him for his innocency, vnto <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt father and founder, who was voide of all ſinne, and by him they ſuppoſe their city to be purged and purified.</p>
               <p>The ſoile of Saxony is very fruitfull of all things but wine, and hath diuers mines of ſiluer and baſſe: toward Goſleria, and in many places beſides be brine-pits, and fountaines of ſalt water, whereof they make a fine white and moſt delicate ſault, which yeeldeth them a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity yeerely.</p>
               <p>They haue great ſtore of barley and wheate, whereof they make very fine white bread, and a kinde of ale or <note place="margin">The Saxons immoderate drinkers.</note> beere to ſupply the want of wine, which they drinke ſo immoderatly and out of meaſure, as when they bee at their feaſts and bankettings, and that their ordinary cups and drinking glaſſes will not hold ſufficient for them to carouſe at one draught, thoſe which doe giue atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at the table, will ſet before them a great paile full of that drinke with a diſh in it, wiſhing euery one to bee their owne skinkers and ſo to drinke what they pleaſe, and it is almoſt incredible to report how much of that liquor thoſe immodeſt and druken people will deuoure and ſwallow vppe at one ſitting, vtging and inforcing one an other to drinke, till they bee worſe then bruitiſh ſwine, not thinking they haue enough, when they are ſo drunke as they lie wallowing in their
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:24800:143"/>
owne vomit, but euen then they will ſticke cloſe to it night and day, vntill they be ſober againe, and he which drinketh moſt, and out ſitteth them all, is not onely highly extolled and commended of the reſt, for that notable exploite, but alſo in ſigne of victory and triumph, hath giuen him a garland or noſegay made of roſes and ſweete flowers, or elſe ſome other reward for which they contended.</p>
               <p>This their wicked and beaſtly cuſtome of drinking, is now (the more pity) diſperced ouer all Germany, ſo as all of them in generall, doe now drinke ſtronge wines as liberally, as the Saxons doe their ale, to their inſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hindrance and hazard of their healthes, in ſuch ſorte, as (not content to doe ill themſelues) if any ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or other come into the roome where they bee drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they will riſe vp and reach him their cuppes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him very earneſtly for to ſit downe and to beare them company, accounting him their enemy if hee looke for much bidding or inuiting, or refuſe to drinke, without ſhewing iuſt cauſe, which hatefull diſorder is oftentimes the cauſe of bloud-ſhed and murther.</p>
               <p>Theſe quaffing Saxons fare very hardly and ſluttiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, for their vſuall meate is ſmall guttes or chitterlings dried, rawe onyons, fat bacon and ſalte butter, and they ſeeth their meate vpon ſunday to ſerue them all the weeke after.</p>
               <p>They feed not their young children as we do, with pap or pottadge made of milke and flowre, but with more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide and ſtronger meates, which is firſt champed or chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the nurſes mouth, and ſo giuen the children to ſwallow downe, which kinde of diet when they be young maketh them more ſtronge and luſty, and better able to indure extremities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:24800:144"/>
The Saxons haue a peculiar language to themſelues, but in their apparel and other things, there is no difference betwixt them and the Germaines.</p>

               <p>But with what ioy and exultation, the birth-day of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt is ſolemnized in their churches, both by Prieſts and lay-people, may be vnderſtood by this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie following: for then they place vppon the Altar the image of a young child, in repreſentation of the new birth of the babe Ieſus; which done, the young men and maydes daunce and hoppe round about the Altar, and thoſe which be married, and old folkes ſing a ſong or hymne: which kind of ceremonie is not much vnlike to the triumph and exultation, which (as Poets faine) was vſed by the Coribants in a caue in the mountaine Ida, about the image of their god <hi>Iupiter.</hi> In the Kalends of Ianuarie (which by their computation is the beginning of the yere)
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:24800:147"/>
is a ſollemne meeting of friends and kinsfolkes together, who ioyning their hands, and lifting them vp to heauen, with one heart and conſent, pray for a proſperous and happie new yeare, ſpending all that day in pleaſant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation, meriments, and drinking. Which done they ſend new yeares gifts to their friends which bee abſent, which gifts, the Romaines in their Feaſtes dedicated to <hi>Saturne,</hi> (which were ſolemnized about that time) called <hi>Saturnalitia,</hi> and by the Greekes, they be called <hi>Apophore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> that is to ſay, preſents or things giuen to gueſts to bee carried away with them.</p>

Vpon the Feaſt day of the Epiphany of our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Twelfte-day, euery family maketh a cake of flower, hony, ginger, and pepper, and therewith they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and chooſe them a King, in this maner following: the good-wife of the houſe kneadeth and maketh the cake, and in the moulding ſhee putteth a penny into it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration into what place of the cake ſhe putteth it, but euen at aduentures, then doth ſhe rake away the fire
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:24800:148"/>
and bake it vppon the harth, and when it is baked, ſhee breaketh it into as many peeces, as there be men in the whole houſhold, and ſo diſtributeth vnto euery one apart, aſſigning one part thereof vnto Chriſt, another to our bleſſed Ladie, and three portions more to the three Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for, and in the name of an almes. And in whoſe part ſoeuer the penny is found, him doe the reſt ſet in a chaire, and lifting him vp on high three times, with great iollity and mirth, they ſalute him as their king: and all the while hee is lifted vppe, hee hath in his right hand a peece of chalke, with which he maketh a great many croſſes vppon the roofes of their chambers and parlours; and theſe croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they haue in great eſtimation, thinking, that by them they eſcape many dangers.</p>
               <p>And there is no houſe throughout the whole countrey of Franconia, eſpecially if it be a dwelling houſe, but in ſome one of theſe twelue nights which bee betwixt the Natiuitie of our Lord, and the Epiphany, it is perfumed either with Frankinſence, or ſome other ſweet ſmelling perfume, againſt the deceits and illuſions of Diuels and Sorcerers.</p>
               <p>It were in vaine to mention in particular, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Epicuriſme, the Franconians ſpend the three daies next before Lent, if you knew what generall and wilfull madneſſe poſſeſſed all the reſt of Germanie at that time, (wherein the Franconians do equall them,) and in what licentious manner all of them then liue, for all thoſe three dayes the Germaines practiſe nothing elſe, but eating, drinking, and playing, plying it ſo luſtily, as though they ſhould neuer eate or drinke more, or, as if (with the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure) they ſhould ſay, I will take my pleaſure, I will eat and drinke my belly full to day, for to morow I ſhall die.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:24800:148"/>
Euery one will inuent ſome new deuice or other to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light their minds and ſenſes withall, and to hold them in admiration, and to the end they ſhould not bluſh, nor be daſhed out of countenance, in acting their apiſh toyes and interludes, they maske their faces, and change their habites, the men wearing womens apparell, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men mens, ſome repreſent Satyres, and ſome play the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels part, beeing made blacke with woade or inke, and cloathed in loathſome apparell like Diuels indeed. Some others go ſtarke naked, imitating the Prieſts of <hi>Pan,</hi> of whome (I thinke) the Germanes haue learned that yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cuſtome of doting and vnnaturall madneſſe. This their manner of reuelling differeth not much from the Feaſtes called <hi>Lupercalia,</hi> which the noble young Romane gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants were wont to celebrate in the moneth of Februarie, in honor of the Licaean <hi>Pan.</hi> For as thoſe Romane youths went round about the Cittie naked, and their faces beſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with bloud, laſhing all they met with cords and whips, in rude and barbarous manner moſt loathſom to behold, euen ſo the Germaines ſtrike thoſe they meete, with bags ſtuft full of ſand or aſhes.</p>
               <p>There is a ſtrange cuſtome vſed in many places of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many vppon Aſh-wedneſday: for then the young youth get all the maides together, which haue practiſed daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all the yeare before, and carrying them in a cart or tumbrell, (which they draw themſelues in ſtead of horſes,) and a minſtrell ſtanding a top of it playing all the way, they draw them into ſome lake or riuer, and there waſh them well fauouredly.</p>
               <p>What the reaſon of this ceremonie is, I cannot perceiue but as I coniecture, they imagine the doing of this, to be a purgation and ſatisfaction to God, for practiſing ſuch
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:24800:149"/>
light and wanton behauiour, vppon Sundayes and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, directly againſt the Canons and precepts of the Church.</p>
               <p>In the middle of Lent, at which time they be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Church to reioyce, the youth of Germany where the Authour of this preſent Worke was borne, make an Image of ſtraw, reſembling the picture of Death; and hanging it vppon aſpeare, carry it vp and downe the ſtreetes, with great ſhowting and exclamations, and many giue them good intertainment, offering them ſuch things as they vſually eate, as peaſon, milke, and mellow peares; and when they be wel refreſhed, they returne home again: but ſome others on the contrarie part, giue them <hi>Iohn Drums</hi> intertainment, reuiling and beating them away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their houſes, deeming the picture of death to bee ominous and a foretelling of their deaths indeed. The like cuſtome to this, is vſed by the Franconians, and at the ſame time: for there the young men take an old cart wheele, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it all ouer with ſtraw, and then (being a great troupe of them together) they cary it to the top of a high hil, where, after they haue ſported themſelues moſt part of the day, vnleſſe the cold driue them ſoone home, in the euening they ſet it on fire, and ſet it going downe the hil burning, beeing a ſight able to aſtoniſh the beholders, that know not what it meanes: for it tumbleth into the valley all of a flaming fire, with ſuch a pudder, as if the Sunne or Moon ſhould tumble downe from heauen.</p>
               <p>Vppon Eaſter day, ſome one of the wealthieſt amongſt them, cauſeth certaine cakes to be made, and giueth one or two of them to the young men, and as many to the maydes, and when they be all mette together a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night, in a plaine medow, in the preſence of an infinit
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:24800:149"/>
number of ſpectators, thoſe which bee moſt nimble of footmanſhip, runne for thoſe cakes, the yong men againſt yong men, and the maides againſt maides.</p>
               <p>Then haue they their ſolemne ceremonies at the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their pariſh Churches, which (by the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church) ought to be ſolemnized by all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, once euery yeare, with great ioy and banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: to which ſolemnization come many yong men out of other pariſhes, not for any deuotion they beare vnto the Churches, but onely to dance, drinke, and reuell, for their manner of comming argueth little deuotion, but rather an intention to brawle and quarrell, for they come all well weaponed, and Minſtrils playing before them, and often-times they fall out and goe together by the cares, and part with crackt crownes. The like kinde of meetings and aſſemblies we haue in many places of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which we call wakes.</p>
               <p>Vpon Munday, Tueſday, and Wedneſday in Rogation weeke, or croſſe weeke, (when as generall Letanies and Proceſſions are vſed to bee ſaid ouer all the Chriſtian world) there meete together at one Church in moſt parts of Franconia, many croſſes (for by that name bee the whole company of pariſhioners called that goe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulation with the Proceſſion, and haue a banner with the ſigne of the croſſe caried before them) &amp; when many ſeuerall croſſes or companies be mette together in one Church, they ſing not altogether, but each ſeuerall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hath a ſeuerall quire, and a ſeuerall place to ſing by themſelues.</p>
               <p>The yong men and maides bee arrayed in their holy day apparell, with wreaths or garlands of flowers about their heads, and willow ſtaues in their hands: The Prieſts
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:24800:150"/>
and Miniſters of the Church ſtand by giuing diligent eare to their ſinging, and which of the Quiers they thinke haue ſong ſweeteſt, and made the beſt melodie, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge that the other Quiers ſhall giue vnto them certaine bowles of Wine.</p>
               <p>And vpon Whitſunday this is their order: euery one which hath either a horſe of his owne, or can borrow one, doe meete in one place, and ride together, to view the bounds, and limits of their fields, hauing with them a Prieſt, with the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt put in a purſſe, and hanging at his neck, and all the way as they ride they ſing and pray, beſeeching God of his great mercy, to defend and preſerue their corne, and to ſend ſuch tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſeaſonable wether, as they may receiue the fruits of the earth to their comfort and ſuſtentation.</p>
               <p>Vpon Saint <hi>Vrbins</hi> day, all the Vintners and maiſters of Vineyards, ſet a table either in the market ſteed, or in ſome other open and publick place, and couering it with fine napery, and ſtrawing vpon it greene leaues and ſweete flowers, doe place vpon the table the Image of that holy Biſhop: And then if the day bee cleare and faire, they crowne the Image with great ſtore of Wine, but if the wether prooue rugged and rainie, they caſt filth, mire, and puddle water vpon it, perſwading themſelues that if that day be faire and calme, their grapes (which then begin to floriſh) will prooue good that yeare, but if it bee ſtormie and tempeſtious, they ſhall haue a bad vintage.</p>
               <p>Vpon Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> day at night, in euery village and ſtreete in Germany be common fires, (or as wee call them heere in England bone-fires) about which all the people gather together, both men, women and children, dancing and ſinging, and vſing many other ſuperſtitions,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:24800:150"/>
as wearing vpon their heads garlands made of Mugwort and Veruin, and flowers in their hands wreathed and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in faſhion of a ſpurre, (which wreathes they call military ſpurres) and they dare not looke vpon the fire, vnleſſe they looke through thoſe ſpurres, firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that by that meanes their eyes be preſerued all the yeare after from all paines and diſeaſes, and euery one as he goeth away, throweth the garland hee wore about his head into the fire, vſing this coniuration, <hi>Goe thy way and burne, and all my ill luck periſh and burne with thee.</hi> The like faſhion is vſed by the Biſhop of Herbipolis ſeruants and courtiers, for they cauſe a great fire to bee made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tower, which ſtandeth vpon a hill aboue the citty of Herbipolis, and throw into the fire many wodden hoopes bored full of holes, which when they bee all of them on a red fire, they put crooked ſtickes into the holes of the hoopes, and cunningly and forceably hoyſe them vp into the ayre a great height, ſo as they flying from the top of the hill ouer the riuer of Moganus, which runneth vnder the hill, ſeeme to bee firie Dragons, to thoſe which neuer ſaw the like before.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time of the yeare their manner is to make earthen potts, with ſo many holes in them as they will hardly hold together, and theſe potts doe the maides buy and couer them round about with red Roſe leaues, and then put Candles into them, and hang them vpon the toppes of the houſes, inſteed of Lanthornes: the yong men at that time bring into their villages each one a Pine tree, with all the little ſhootes and vndermoſt branches lopped off, and garniſhing and triming the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt boughes with little hoopes, garlands, glaſſes and glittering rayes or plates of golde or copper
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:24800:151"/>
they ſet their trees faſt in the ground, where they muſt ſtand all ſummer, reſembling many poles in England.</p>
               <p>In Autumne when their Grapes wax ripe, they gather not their Grapes one, one day, and an other an other day, but all the owners of a Vineyard are appointed to pull their Grapes all at one time, to continue pulling till they haue all done that Vineyarde, for they haue not power to pluck them when they pleaſe them-ſelues, but when they be allowed by thoſe to whom the tithe is due: And theſe tithe-maiſters appoint ſuch a hill of Grapes to bee got ſuch a day, and ſuch a Vineyard ſuch a day, and their tithes be euer brought by the owners of the Vines, into the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley at the hill foote; but thoſe which neglect to gather their Grapes at the time appointed, ought and are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, whether they will or no, to carry the tithe into the Lords Wine-preſſe, at their owne coſt and charge: But about the citty of Herbipolis, the owners of tithes bee more preciſe, for they (diſtruſting that the Vine maiſters will not tithe truly) ſet a boy ouer euery one of them, to marke their manner of tithing, and to ſee that their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter haue his due, and when harueſt is done, and all the Grapes gathered, all thoſe boyes meete together in the field, and euery one beeing couered all ouer with ſtrawe, and a Torche or two in his hand, they kindle their Torches a little before night, and ſo come ſinging with their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches burning into the citty. And in this ſort they ſay they burne and make cleane Autumne.</p>
               <p>The Franconians celebrate the feaſt dayes of the two pillers of the Church Saint <hi>Martin</hi> and Saint <hi>Nicholas,</hi> with great ioy and triumph, but after a diuerſe maner, for the one is ſolemnized in Churches and Altars, the other in victualing houſes and tauernes: and there is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

throughout all the whole country be hee neuer ſo needy, or neuer ſo niggard, but vpon Saint <hi>Martins</hi> day hee will haue ſome roſte meate, or boild meat, and it be but Hogs intrailes, or Calues intrailes, &amp; glut themſelues with wine, for then they taſt of their new wines, from which till that time they haue abſtained; and all their houſholds drinke wine with them: and vpon this day in Herbipolis and in diuerſe other places beſides, is much wine giuen to the poore for charity: then haue they their publike ſhewes and paſtimes, as to haue two or three Boares put into a place together, and to behold them fight and teare one another with their tuskes, till their guttes traile about their heeles, deuiding the fleſh when the Boares bee dead, ſome to the common people, and ſome to the Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>But vpon Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> day, all the yong fry and Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, chooſe out three amongſt them, one to repreſent the perſon of a Biſhop, and the other two Deacons, he which is elected in the place of a Biſhop, is ſolemnly vpon that day conducted into the Church by all his Schoole-fellowes, decked and trimmed with a Biſhops Miter, and all his other ornaments, and ſo ſitteth in place of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as Lord and Protector ouer them all the while Maſſe is in ſaying, and when the ſacrifice is finiſhed, hee chooſeth out a few of them from amongſt the reſt, and hee and they goe ſinging vp and downe the towne from houſe to houſe, collecting and gathering money, and alleadging that the money they gotte by this meanes, is not taken as an almes or beneuolence, but giuen franckly for the maintenance of the Biſhop.</p>

Sueuia is the vtmoſt part of all Germany, and is watered with two notable riuers Rheine and Danubius, whereof the one running ſlowly falleth into the ſea Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the other running a contrary courſe, paſſeth by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regions, and falleth at length into the ſea called <hi>Pontus.</hi>

The country is ſome part of it plaine and euen, and ſome part cragged and mountanous, and all of it fertile and fruitfull, ſauing lakes, mountaines and woods. There be great ſtore of woods, and therefore very good hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and eſpeciall good fowling, by reaſon of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of riuers and lakes: Of cattell there bee great abon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and plenty of all kinde of graine, it is alſo full of gallant and flouriſhing valleis, watered and manured with brookes, riuers and running waters, ſome running one way, ſome an other, ouer-flowing and fatting the ſoyle: all which disburthen themſelues either into Rhine or Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius. The land is very wholſome and healthfull, and well repleniſhed with ſtately cities, townes and caſtels, aſpiring towers likewiſe, walled and fortified both by arte and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and for the aduancement of Chriſtian religion, it is ſufficiently furniſhed with beautifull and rich temples, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches and Chappels, Biſhops Pallaces, Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and monaſteries, containing ſundry orders of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, both men and women: vpon the hills bee mines of Siluer, Yron, and diuerſe other mettals: it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry populus, and the people very hardy, ſtrong &amp; valerous; they be tall of ſtature, yellow haird, faire and welfauoured, and marueilous ingenious, ſo as <hi>Plutarch</hi> concludeth them in a word, for the moſt famous people of all Germany.</p>
               <p>The glory and fame of this people grew once to that height, as they obtained the Empire and gouernment of the world, and in that honour and renowne continued for one age, but afterwards beeing deſtitute and depriued of their Princes, I know not how it came to paſſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the fickleneſſe and variety of fortune, or by their owne folly and ſloth, but their gouernment ceaſed, and their power and ſtrength in ſhort time became ſo

               <p>
                  <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in the fourth booke of his commentaries, writeth of this people thus. The Sueuians (ſayth hee) the worthieſt and warlikſt people of all Germany, are ſayd to haue a hundred Citties, great Burrowes or townes, out of euery of which hundred citties &amp; townes yearely is furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſet forth to the warres a hundred thouſand armed men, well appoynted, Theſe hundred thouſand men wage warrs abroad, and be maintayned by thoſe which remaine at home, and at the yeares end returne home againe to husbandry, and ſend forth as many more of thoſe which were at home, ſo as going to the warres and remayning at home in courſe, they bee all well excerciſed is husbandry and skilfull in feats of armes, and hauing noe grounds nor poſſeſſions priuat to them-ſelues, they yeeld reciprocall Maintaynance one to another, for it is not lawfull for them to remayne and abyde in one place longer than one yeare.</p>
               <p>Their vſuall foode is bread, milke and fleſh, they bee much giuen to hunting, as well for their dayly excerciſe and liberty of life, which they much regard, (for they bee neuer from their infancy vnder the rule and correction of any or conſtrayned to doe any thing againſt their wills,) the practiſe of hunting alſo maketh them more feerce and couragious, and their bodies more ſtrong &amp; able to indure all extremities, as (although they dwell in a very cold cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate) they will waſh and bath them-ſelues in cold riuers,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:24800:153"/>
and weare no other garments but skins, and thoſe ſo little, as the moſt part of there bodies bee ſtarke naked, if any marchants trafficke thether, it is more to buy ſuch things of them as they haue got by the warres, than for any great deſire the Sueuians haue of their commodities: beſides they haue great ſtore of laboring beaſts, more than they haue vſe for, which the French men much deſire, and pay deere for them, and thoſe beaſts which with them bee naturally froward, ilfauored and almoſt good for nothing, by much vſe and handling bee made fit and able both to draw and carry, or to be imployed in the warres: for their horſes be ſo well mand and taught, as when the skirmiſh is at the hotteſt, their riders for their better adrantage, will oftentimes skippe of their backes and fight on foote, and finde their horſes againe in the very ſame place they were left, when they haue occaſion to vſe them: nor doe they eſteeme any one thing more ilde or more ilbeſeeming them, than to ride vpon horſes that bee harneſſed, or haue ſaddles on their backes, by continuall vſe whereof (though they bee but few) they dare and boldly will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to incounter with a troope of armed men and harneſſed horſes, though the number of them bee very great.</p>
               <p>The Sueuians will ſuffer no wines to bee brought vnto them, ſuppoſing that the drinking of wine maketh men more effeminate, and leſſe able to indure labour: they hold it a generall commendations to them, to haue their <note place="margin">There may no, wines bee brought into Suevia,</note> feelds and territories of their citties large and wide, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thereby that their forces bee not able to maintaine ſuch a multitude of citties, for which cauſe in Sueuia the feelds be ſaid to extend a thouſand and ſix hundred paces from their citties on euery ſide.</p>

                  <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> writing the ſcituation of Germany, and the manners of the people, ſpeaketh thus of the Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uians, The Germaines (ſaith hee) haue diſtinguiſhed the greateſt part of Germany, by ſundry names and nations, although they be al called by one general name, Sueuians, and the property of that people is to plat their lockes, and then to knitt and bind them vp on a knot, by which marke and token the Sueuians be diſcerned and knowne from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Germaines, and the Freemen from ſlaues: There vſe is to turne vp their curled lockes, vntill they waxe ſo old that their haire grow white, and oftentimes they will bynde it on a knot vpon the crowne of their heads, in doing whereof the better ſort of people bee moſt curyous.</p>
               <p>They obſerue a certaine time by tradition from their fathers, (which ceremony they eſteeme ſo reuerent as they dare not omit it) that all the people of one ſtocke or kindred, aſſemble themſelues and meete together, in a certayne woode (conſecrated and made holy after their faſhion) there to doe ſacrifice, which (as a moſt barbarous and horible ceremonie and deteſtable ſacrifice) is euer ſolemnized by killing of a man: This woode, or holy groue they reuerence another way alſo, for there is none of them will aduenture to goe into it, vnleſſe he bee bound hand and foote with a corde, that they may perceiue the power of their Gods, and if any of them happen to fall, it is not lawfull for him to be taken vp, or to re-enfore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to riſe againe, but hee muſt bee rowled or tumbled thither vpon the ground: And all this their ſuperſtition tendeth to no other ende, but to know thereby the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of their nation, where God the gouernor of all things is, and of all inferior things that are in ſubiection, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:24800:154"/>
yeeld obedience vnto that God. Some of the Sueuians as <hi>Cornelius</hi> alſo reporteth doe ſacrifice vnto <hi>Iſis:</hi> And as for all their other cuſtomes, though heretofore neuer ſo peculiar, they bee now common to all the reſt of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes: But ſo it is, that at this day, not onely the manners of the Sueuians, but almoſt of all other nations elſe, bee changed and turned cleane topſie turuy, and (that which is moſt to bee lamented) alterred from better to worſe, for now moſt of the welthieſt men of all Sueuia bee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and a great company of them compact and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate them-ſelues together, euery one disburſing a ſumme of mony to bee imployed in Marchandize, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they doe not onely buy vp and get into their hands ſpices, ſilkes and other things of great value, which bee brought thither by ſea from forren countries, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo they will deale with things of ſmall worth, as ſpoones, needles, ſpectacles, and puppets, and many ſuch like tryfles and trinkets, ingroſſing vp much wine and graine likewiſe, which manner of trafficke is not to bee commended, for it is not onely greeuous and hurtfull to crafts men and husband men (who bee conſtrayned to ſell their wares and commodities to theſe grypers, (as I may terme them rather than Marchants,) before they can make the beſt profit of them, when neede ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inforce them to buy the ſame of them againe for dubble the price,) but preiudiciall alſo to all the whole country in generall.</p>
               <p>For whereas the people were wont to make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of ſuch things as they wanted, from their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes, at the cheapeſt rate, they haue ſo fed and bribed thoſe corrupt Princes and gouernors of the contry,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:24800:155"/>
that nothing ſhall be bought but of themſelues, either in Stutgardia, or in other places where they keepe Marts and faires. And yet thoſe rich men doe not traffick them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues but by their ſeruants and common factors, who gathering in the moneys disburſed with the increaſe, yeeld an account thereof, at ſuch time as they bee called therevnto, rendring vnto euery man truly and faithfully his owne money, and his part of the gaine.</p>
               <p>The common people of Sueuia doe moſt of them pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe dreſſing of Toe and ſpinning, which maner of worke <note place="margin">Much cloth made in Sueuia.</note> they apply ſo buſily, and vſe ſo generally, as in the winter time in ſome parts of Sueuia, you ſhall not only ſee maids and women, but men and boyes alſo with Spindles and Diſtaffes in their hands: They make a kinde of cloth, the warpe whereof is linnen, and the oofe ſilke, which they call <hi>(Pargath)</hi> and an other manner of cloth which they call <hi>(Golſch)</hi> and that is all linnen, of theſe manner of clothes they make great aboundance, for it is knowne to bee true, that the Vlmenſes onely doe make euery yeare a hundred thouſand of theſe clothes, and if ſo many bee made in one part of the country, which is but a handfull in reſpect of the whole, one may eaſily coniecture that the number which is made in the whole land is almoſt infinite. Theſe clothes bee carryed to nations farre from them, and eſpecially twiſe a yeare to Franckford Marte, from whence the people of Sueueland receiue great cuſtome and tribute. Moreouer (as euill things bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-times mingled with good, and no one thing is perfect in all points) the Sueuians be meruailous lecherous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the women as willing to yeeld as the men to aske, yea both ſides bee apt to ſlide, but ſlow to repent; and ſurely I thinke, that this vice is generally fauoured,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:24800:155"/>
both in Sueuia and throughout all Germany, for neither there nor in any other part of Germany, is any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted, nor any one excommunicated by the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cenſure, either for open fornication, adultery, nor yet for rauiſhing of women: And thereof ariſeth this Prouerbe, that Sueuia onely is able to yeeld whores in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough for all Germany, as well as Franconia affendeth good ſtore of theeues and beggars, Boemia hereticks, Bauaria pilferers and ſlaues, Heluetia Butchers and Bawdes, Drunkards in Saxonie, periurers in Friſia and Weſtphalia, and gluttons about the Rheine.</p>

               <p>Bauaria is deuided into foure Biſhoppes ſeas, that is to ſay, Saltzburga, Patauia, Phriſinberge and Ratisbon, it hath in it more famous Citties than are in any one prouince of Germany beſides, the Metropolitan wherof is Saltzburge heretofore (as is ſurmiſed) called Iuuania: Schiren was once the Dukes ſeate, but now it is tranſlated to <note place="margin">Bauaria here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Kings but now by Dukes.</note> Monachium.</p>
               <p>This land before it was reduced into a Prouince, was gouerned by Kings of their owne nation, vntill the raigne of <hi>Arnolphus</hi> the Emperor: And as all the Kings of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia were named <hi>Arſaces,</hi> and the Aegiptian Kings <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> ſo was euery king of Bauaria called <hi>Cacannus</hi> but after it was ſubued by <hi>Arnolphus</hi> and annexed to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire the gouernment was committed to Dukes, which manner of gouernment remayneth ſtill: and all the Dukes for many ſucceſſions together, haue beene elected out of that moſt worthy and renowned family of the <hi>Agilolphingij.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manners and cuſtomes of that people may bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <note place="margin">The lawes vſed in Bauaria which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued when they receiued Chriſtianity.</note> by the lawes which were giuen them when they firſt receiued the right faith of Chriſt, wich were theſe following: firſt that if a freeman borne would beſtow any thing towards the maintenance of the Church, whether it were lands mony or goods, hee ſhould make a deed thereof in writing, and ſeale and ſubſcribe it with his owne
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:24800:156"/>
hand and ſeale, and put to the names of ſixe witneſſes to confirme it, and then deliuer it as his deede in the preſence of the Biſhoppe, by which act both hee him-ſelfe, and all his poſterity were vtterly bard for euer after to inioy or repoſſeſſe the ſame againe but by permiſſion of the Church: And whatſoeuer was ſo giuen to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Gods holy Church, was committed to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes cuſtody, and by him defended and protected: If any one wronged the Church or any thing there-vnto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, hee incurred the iudgement of God, the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of holy Church, and was conſtrayned (ether by the King or Prince for the time being) to render reſtitution, and forfeted three ounces of gold beſides, but if he denied the fact, he was brought before the Altar and there in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Preeſt and people, ſwore and depoſed what wronge hee had done and of what value: He that perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another mans ſeruant to runne away from his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, (were he man-ſeruant or maid ſeruant) was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fetch him againe, and to put an other into his place as a pledge till he came, and was fined at fifteene ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings beſides.</p>
               <p>If a ſeruant did priuily burne any Church goods, hee had his hand cut off, and his eyes puld out, that he might neuer after ſee to commit the like villanie, and the maiſter of ſuch ſeruant made good the value of that which was burnt: But if a Freeman commited ſuch a fault, he reſtored againe the full value of the loſſe, and forfeted for his folly three pound; and if hee denyed the fact, hee was to purge him-ſelfe by the othes of twenty foure men; who ſtanding by the Altar before the defendor of the Church, layed their hands vpon the holy Euangeliſt, and ſwore whether they thought him faulty or noe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:24800:157"/>
If an offendor tooke ſanctuary for refuge he was ſecure, nor was it lawfull for a Maiſter to fetch his ſeruant thence, otherwiſe to hurt him, for if hee did, the Iudge would compell him to pay forty ſhillings to the Church, as a recompence for infringing his priuiledges: Hee that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured any one that was in any inferiour order in the Church, made ſatiſfaction with twiſe the value of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury done, which was paide ouer vnto his parents or nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friends: But if the wrong were to one of an higher order, he paide three times the value.</p>
               <p>Hee that killed a Prieſt, forſeited and paid forthwith to the Church where he was Miniſter, three hundred peeces of gold, and he that killed a Deacon, two hundred; and if he were not able to pay ſuch a ſumme of money; hee was deliuered both himſelfe, his wife, and children into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſeruitude, and detained in ſlauery, vntill he could make ſhift to pay the money. No one might offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to a Biſhop although hee did him wrong, but might make his complaint, and commence his ſuite before the King, Duke, or commons, whether it were for homicide, fornication, or conſenting to the enemy; and if it was prooued that he would haue brought in enemies to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade the country, or ſought the ſpoyle of thoſe he ought to preſerue, he was either depoſed or baniſhed.</p>
               <p>Hee that contrary to the lawes of the Church, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a recluſe or Nun out of her Cloyſter, was compelled to reſtore her thither againe, and to leaue her where hee found her: and the Biſhop (by the Dukes aſſiſtants) would thruſt her into the Nunry againe whether ſhee would or no, and the man (if there were no hope of his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) was baniſhed the country.</p>
               <p>It was not lawfull for either Prieſt or Deacon to keepe
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:24800:157"/>
in his houſe any ſtrange woman, leſt by often companie and familiaritie with her, he might happe to be polluted, and ſo offer an vnworthie ſacrifice vnto God, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be plagued for his offences. If any difference or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie aroſe betwixt Prieſts, Deacons, or other Clergie men, the Cannon law committed the deciding thereof to the Biſhops: farmers, husbandmen and ſeruants payd tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and tyth to the Church, euery one according to his abilitie, as euery tenth buſhel of graine, euery tenth perch of land, euery tenth faggot, the tenth part of their honey, and for euery foure pullets fifteene egs. They were bound alſo to bring ſtone, timber, and lyme for the reparations of the Churches, but yet with this ſpeciall care, that no man ſhold be taxed more then he was wel able to indure.</p>
               <p>If any one were falſe vnto his Duke, and by treaſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured enemies into the Prouince, or betrayed any Cittie, and was thereof conuicted by three witneſſes, all his goods were confiſcate to the Duke, and the Duke had power to vſe him at his pleaſure: but to the end that no one ſhould be ouerthrowne or ſpoiled by anothers enuie or malice without cauſe, there was this prouiſion made, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed might challenge the ſingle combat with one of his accuſérs; and if he ouercame the other he ſcaped free, and forfeited nothing. He that killed his Duke, was killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and all his goods confiſcate for euer without redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: and he that ſtirred vp ſedition againſt him, forfeited to the Duke 600. ſhillings. When an armie was conducted into the enemies land, the ſouldiers had no cauſe to fall out amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for prouiſion; for euery one might take what would ſerue his turn: but he which wrangled without cauſe, was forced either to yeeld himſelfe to the law of armes, in that caſe prouided, or ſuffer fifty ſtripes with
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:24800:158"/>
a truncheon before his Lieutenant. And the Lieutenants and Gouernors were to haue a ſpecial care euery one with in his limits or county, that the ſouldiers did not ſpoile &amp; prey vppon the enemie, before they were commanded by the Duke: for if any fault were committed through their negligence, they were to make it good. If a free-man dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, or wronged another, he was conſtrained to make good as much as the party was hindred, and was amerced beſides at 40. ſhil. but ſuch offences were death in ſeruants, and their maſter made reſtitution for them, becauſe they forbad them not the committing of ſuch crimes. If a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant ſtole or purloyned any thing from the ſoldiers in the campe, and was therof conuicted, he loſt his hand for that offence, and his maſter notwithſtanding reſtored the value of the goods ſtolne: and a free-man for ſuch a fault, was mulcted at forty ſhillings ouer and aboue the due reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing ſtolne.</p>
               <p>If any one were commanded by the king or duke to kill another, and he did it, the king or duke which commanded him, ought for euer after to defend and protect him from danger: &amp; if the king or duke which was his protector died his next ſucceſſor did take vpon him the like warrantie and protection of that man. If the Duke were ſo ſtubborn and rebellious as to contemne and deſpiſe the decrees of the king, he was depriued of his Duke-dome, and was vtterly void of all hope euer to recouer his former eſtate and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. If the Duke had a ſon ſo froward, fooliſh, or arrogant, as (through the counſell and abetting of lewd and euil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) he went about to depoſe his father from his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that his father were yet well able to gouerne, to conduct an armie, to get vp vpon his horſe, and to carry armes, and was neither deafe nor blind, &amp; well able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:24800:158"/>
the kings command, he was diſ-inherited, and for euer after vncapable of the Dukedome; or, (if his father pleaſed) he was baniſhed to perpetuall euile for offending his father in ſo high a degree againſt the law.</p>
               <p>He that by raſhneſſe, indiſcretion, or drunkenneſſe bred a ſcandall in the Dukes Court, forfeited forty ſhillings, and was for euer after lyable to make good the value of the inconuenience that aroſe of that ill example: but a ſeruant for ſuch a fault loſt his hand.</p>
               <p>If any thing were found in the Dukes Court, and taken vp, and concealed one night vnreuealed, it was accounted theft, and ſuch an offendor forfeited into the Dukes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer fifteene ſhillings, becauſe the Dukes houſe was accounted a publike houſe.</p>
               <p>He that detracted, or by his ill ſpeeches depraued the Dukes gouernement, was puniſhed at fifteen ſhillings: and forced to finiſh and make perfect all that he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do, that all pleas or ſuites might be diſpatched and ended euery fifteenth day, in each ſeuerall Countie of the countrie; for the doing wherof, all the free-men aſſembled together, and they which neglected the meeting, forfeited fifteene ſhillings: the Iudge (to the end hee might do iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and iudge vprightly) had a booke of the law lying open before him, which ſerued as a rule and pattern wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to iudge of all controuerſies.</p>
               <p>And if the inditement were without partialitie, and that he iudged vprightly without reſpect of perſons, or rewards, hee then had, and enioyed to himſelfe the ninth part of the compoſition, but if the iudgement were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, or ſmelled of briberie; he forfeited the double value of that which by his falſe ſentence and corruption, was payed, and was fined moreouer at forty ſhillings.</p>

He which killed the Duke, payd either vnto his friends or vnto the king for compoſition, 1460. ſhillings, whereof his friends had ſix hundred. And it was euer obſerued, that the compoſition for the death of the Duke, was three times as much as for the death of any of his friends.</p>
               <p>The Agilolſingi (out of which family the Dukes be euer created) had the fourth part of the compoſition, and then the Huoſi, the Trozzi, the Sagavi, the Hahilingi, and the Aennonni had the one halfe of that which remained. Hee that killed a free-man, payd (either vnto the Duke or vnto his parents that was ſlaine) 8. pounds, hee that put out a free-mans eye, or cut off his hand or foot, payed 40. ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: he that lamed him payd 12. ſhillings, and for a maim 20. ſhillings, for a wound 3. ſhillings, for ſtriking out a cheeke tooth, or grinding tooth 12. ſhillings, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery other tooth 6. ſhillings. They were very ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to moleſt or hurt ſtrangers, in ſo much as he which iniured any of them, payd vnto the party grieued the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value of the wrong ſuſtained, and beſides forſeited 8. pounds into the Dukes Exchequer: &amp; he that ſlue a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, forfeted an hundred pounds in gold.

Libertines which had bin manumit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; made free, had more eaſie compoſitions by the one halfe, then thoſe which were free-born. All inceſtuous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were there vtterly prohibited, ſo as it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any man to marry his firſt wiues mother, his ſonnes wife, his daughter-in-law, his ſtep mother, his brothers or ſiſters daughter, his brothers wife, or wiues ſiſter: and thoſe which offended in any of theſe points, all his goods were confiſcate by the Iudge.</p>

If any one lay with another mans wife that was a free-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he payed vnto her husband 7. pounds for amends, and if he were taken in the deed doing and ſlaine, his death was not to be reuenged.</p>
               <p>He that committed fornication with a free-woman by her conſent, and refuſed to take her to his wife, payed 12. ſhillings. If a ſeruant offered violence to a free-woman, his maſter deliuered him to the womans father to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who might iuſtly kill him if he pleaſed. He that rauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſtoale away a free-woman, without her parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and her owne, forfeited 11. ſhillings, and if ſhee that was ſtoln away were manumitted, he forfeited 8-ſhillings, but if ſhe were a ſeruant, the forfeiture was but 4. ſhillings. If a free-man put away his wife being a free-woman with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſt cauſe, he paid vnto her parents 40. ſhillings, and duly repayed vnto the woman her dower and full portion, ſhe brought with her, according to the family out of which ſhe came. If a freeman were troth-plight to a freewoman,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:24800:160"/>
and afterwards forſooke her and married another, he paid vnto the wenches parents 24. ſhillings, &amp; brought twelue men to ſweare with him, that he forſooke her not for any fault of hers, nor for any malice he bore to his parents, but onely for the great loue and affection he bore vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He which ſtole away another mans wife, reſtored her againe, and payed eight pounds vnto her husband for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends. If a bond-woman gaue a potion to a woman that was with child, to procure an abortiue, ſhee had two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred laſhes with a whippe; and if ſhe were a free-woman that tempered the poyſon, ſhee loſt her freedome, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſlaue for euer. If a woman with child were ſtrucken and brought forth an abortiue, and died her ſelfe of the blow, he or ſhe that ſtrucke her, was reputed and taken as an homicide, and if the woman liued, and the abortiue not liuing at the time of the ſtroke giuen, the partie that gaue the blow, payd her twenty ſhillings: but if the abortiue had life, the forfeiture then was fiftie Weregelds, three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and a Tremiſſis. If a Free-man ſtole any thing out of the Dukes Court, Churches, ſhoppes, worke-houſes or Mils, which be publike places of reſort, he was conſtrained to ſweare what the value of that was which he ſtole, and was forced to reſtore nine times the worth, or elſe to fight hand to hand with the party grieued, or his champion. If a theefe were taken ſtealing in the night and ſlaine, his death was not reuenged: and hee that allured, perſwaded, or inticed another mans ſeruant to ſteale from his maſter, or otherwiſe to wrong him, and was thereof detected, was condemned as a theefe, and paid nine times as much as the maſter was damnified: the ſeruant alſo reſtored what he tooke away, and was openly whipped beſides, with two hundred ſtripes, but the maſter ſuffered no preiudice.</p>

And all felons for all thefts whatſoeuer, were brought before the Iudge, and ſuffered ſuch puniſhment as the law ordained in ſuch caſes: but they firſt made compoſition and ſatisfaction out of their owne goods, vnto thoſe they had wronged ſundry times, before they were adiudged to die for ſtealing. He that bought any thing in the Prouince, was firſt diligently to enquire, whether it was ſtolen or no: for he which bought ſtolne goods was bound to reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and forfeited twelue ſhillings into the Dukes Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. The ſame penaltie was inflicted vppon him that took any ſtolne goods committed to the charge or cuſtodie of another. And no man could make compoſition with a theefe, but before the Iudge: for he which did it in hugger mugger of purpoſe to conceale the theft from the Iudge, was accounted and puniſhed as a theef himſelfe. As oft as any contention aroſe amongſt them, about the bounds or limits of their grounds, there were certaine ſurveiors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to view and find out the auncient meares and markes betwixt land and land; againſt which preſcription, or long continuance of poſſeſſion was of no force: and if no markes could be found, then he that ſold the land, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the meare-ſtones to the Surveyors: but if the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie were ſuch, as it could not otherwiſe be decided, and the parties appeaſed, they then fought it out hand to hand: And no one partie might ſet downe a new meare ſtone or marke, without the conſent of the other, and that in the preſence of the Surveior: for if a free-man offended herin, he was fined at ſixe ſhillings, and a ſlaue was openly whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with two hundred laſhes. If one free-man pulled down the wall or ditch of another free-man, he forfeited 3. ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and vnto the party grieued, as much as he was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and he which pulled downe either poſt, pillar, beam,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:24800:161"/>
or rafter, forfeited 3. ſhillings likewiſe, and 12. pence for either ſhingle or tyle, or any other part of the houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides reſtitution for the loſſe ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>It was not lawfull for any one to take a pledge or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe without the Dukes permiſſion: for hee which did, was forced ſafely to reſtore the pledge or morgage ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the owner, and payd vnto the Duke 40. ſhillings for a fine: and if the thing ſo morgaged or diſtrained, happned to miſcarrie in his hands, hee then made ſatisfaction to the owner, at the diſcretion of the Iudge. He which cut downe another mans ſtanding corne that was ripe, paid for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſixe ſhillings; and if he denied the fact, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelfe, and produced ſixe men to bee ſworne with him, that hee tooke a true oath. Hee which deſtroyed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans corne or graine by inchantment or ſorcery, and was thereof conuicted, forfeited 12 ſhillings, and was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to prouide food for his whole family, that had his corn ſo deſtroyed, for all the yeare following, and reſtored vnto him ouer &amp; aboue, the value of that which was deſtroyed: but if he denied the fact, he then either purged himſelfe by the oath of 12. men, or by battell. If any man either by his meanes or abetment, inticed another mans ſeruant to run away from his maſter, he was inforced to bring him again, and forfeited for a man ſeruant 12. ſhillings, and ſix ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for a maid: but if he denied it, he purged himſelfe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the oath of a full Iury, or by combat.</p>
               <p>No one might either kill or hurt another mans cattell, though he found them in his owne grounds dammagefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, but he might impound and detaine them, vntil he had made it knowne vnto the owner, or vnto his neighbours, what loſſe he had ſuſtained, and then the owner of the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell was to ſet him foorth as much other ground, as that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:24800:161"/>
which was eaten. In gathering in of their harueſt, euery one that was damnified by an others cattaile, was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced by the owner of the cattaile, who ought not to make the offence greater then it was, but he which killed an other mans cattaile in breach of this law, tooke the dead carkaſſe himſelfe, and gaue vnto the owner an other beaſt as good as his was. If hee ſtrooke out his eye, he paide vnto the owner the third part of the price, that the beaſt was worth, and if he cut off either taile or eare, hee paide twelue pence &amp; a tremiſſis for euery horne. But hee which committed any of theſe outrages, either for hatred, contempt, or deſpite, his penalty was doubled, hee which tooke an other mans horſe or oxe to keepe for hire, and loſt him by his owne default, paide the full price for him, and had no hire, but if hee purged himſelfe by his oth, that the beaſt was not loſt by his neglect, then hee had the hide allowed him.</p>
               <p>Hee which receiued into his houſe an other mans goods (were it gold, ſiluer apparell or any thing elſe) either to ſell or to keepe, and that his houſe, together with thoſe goods were burned by miſfortune, if hee would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that his owne goods were burned with them, and that hee had no profit nor commodity by thoſe goods ſo committed vnto him, hee made no reſtitution for them.</p>
               <p>If a houſe were on fire, and one making ſhew to quench the fire, did ſteale and purloine any thing thence, he paide fouretimes the value of that which he ſtole, and made compoſition beſides according to the Statutes.</p>
               <p>If a thing was in contention betwixt two to whom the propertie belonged, it was not lawfull for any one whatſoeuer either to giue it or ſell it, vntill it was decided
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:24800:162"/>
to whom the right property did appertaine. If a woman buried her husband and remained a widdow afterwards, ſhe had an equall portion with one of his children, both of the goods and of the yeerely profit of the liuing, but if ſhee married an other husband, ſhe then tooke ſuch goods onely as ſhe had of her owne, and her dower, and departed the houſe the ſame day ſhee married, and that portion which was allotted vnto her, after the death of her husband, during her widdow-hood, was equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided amongſt her children.</p>
               <p>If a man had children by diuers wiues, they all of them equally inherited, but the mothers children inherited ſuch goods onely as belonged vnto her, and the ſonne of a bond-woman might not inherit with the ſonne of a free-woman. If a man died without iſſue and made no will, his wife ſo long as ſhee kept her ſelfe widdow, enioyed the one halfe of all her husbands goods, and the other halfe remained to his kinsfolke: But if ſhe died, or marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againe, ſhee then preſently departed, and carried with her ſuch goods onely as were her owne, and due vnto her by the law, and that part which ſhe had was diſtributed to her husbands kinsfolkes likewiſe. If either man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man died and neither deuiſed their goods by teſtament, nor gaue them away in their life time, and had no kindred liuing within ſeuen degrees, then were all their goods confiſcate and eſcheated into the Dukes Exchecker. He which ſold any thing and tooke money for it, was to confirme the ſale either by writing, or in the preſence of two witneſſes at the leaſt, and no ſale was firme and good, vnleſſe hee which ſold it did it voluntarily and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrained. Hee which ſold an other mans goods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the owners conſent or priuity, reſtored the ſame
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:24800:162"/>
againe, and an other as good as that was beſides, but if the thing ſo ſold could not be gotten againe, then he paide two other things as good as that was which he ſold. Hee which bought any thing and gaue earneſt for it, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtand to his bargaine, vnleſſe the other party were willing to releaſe him, or elſe he loſt the thing hee gaue earneſt for, and paide the full price agreed vpon, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: If a man ſold a thing which was nought, hee was conſtrained to take it againe at any time within three daies, or elſe hee was depoſed and brought one other to ſweare with him, that hee knew not of the fault, and ſo the bargaine ſtood currant.</p>
               <p>If a bond-man purchaſed his free-dome by his owne purſe, and not with his maiſters money, and the deceite were diſcerned, hee was reſtored againe to his maiſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his maiſter receiued no other thing for him, but that which was his ſeruants, which hee knew not of. And the ſame law that was in buying and ſelling, was likewiſe in exchanging.</p>
               <p>If any one entred into an other mans ground, and claimed it for his owne, hee paide for his raſhneſſe ſixe ſhillings, and reſtored the ground to the owner againe: A witneſſe produced to giue teſtimony, neither could nor ought to bee reſiſted, vnleſſe in caſe of one that is dead, in which caſe hee was to make good his euidence by bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and if he hap to get the victory, hee was then credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teds, and no longer impugned. If there were many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then one was elected by lot to ſweare, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his oth was thus: I am elected as a witneſſe, and I offer my ſelfe to be depoſed, and as God ſhall helpe mee and him whoſe hand I hold, I am produced as a witneſſe to ſpeake the truth, touching this matter now in queſtion,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:24800:163"/>
and then ioyning all their hands together to ſweare and proteſt the truth, hee alone holding in his other hand one other that ſweareth with him, depoſed as ſeemeth him good, and if hee ſwore falſe and was conuicted of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, hee reſtored and made good vnto the partie damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his falſe oth, as much as hee was hindred thereby, and paide twelue ſhillings more for compoſition, or elſe defended his innocency by battaile.</p>
               <p>If one champion killed the other in battaile, if he were a free-man, then the party that vniuſtly procured him to vndertake the combate, paide twelu ſhillings for compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but no more. He which ſolde any thing from a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was dead and buried, paide vnto his parents or friends forty ſhillings, and reſtored that which hee ſtole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. He that murthered a freeman ſecretly, caſting his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy either into a riuer or other baſe place, whereby hee was depriued of due ſunerals and exequies, did firſt pay forty ſhillings, and afterwards a were-geld. If a freeman was ſlaine and caſt into a riuer, or into the ſea, and after his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hapt to be caſt vpon ſhore, if any one tumbled him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water againe, hee forfeted forty ſhillings. And if a ſeruant or bond-man were ſo ſlaine and caſt vp, then hee which aduentured to throw him in againe forfeted nine pounds. Hee which ſlue a man and tooke his apparell from him, paide twiſe the worth of his apparell, and hee which cut or mangled the carcaſſe of a dead man paide twelue ſhillings for euery member hee ſo cut or mangled. Hee which found the body of a dead man, and out of his compaſſion affoorded it buriall, leſt it ſhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by beaſts or birds, the friends or maiſter of the dead man gaue him twelue pence for his paine. He which remoued an other mans ſhip or boate out of his place,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:24800:163"/>
reſtored vnto the owner either the ſame againe in as good plight as it was, or an other as good. But if he tooke it out of the water, and concealed and denied it being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, it was accounted as theft, and he then paide for it as if he had ſtole it: He which ſtole a hound reſtored him backe againe, or an other as good and paide ſixe ſhillings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and three ſhillings for a ſheap-heards cur: And theſe were the lawes that the Bauarians liued vnder not many ages ſince, and diuers of them be yet in force at this day.</p>

               <p>In a word, it was not without the diuine prouidence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that where that moſt wiſe and omnipotent God had reiected all other nations, it pleaſed him to make that the chiefe Empire, fortreſſe and defence of all people, that ſhould afterwards bee the ſeate, throne and chaire of the head of Gods Church, and the Chriſtian religion: The <note place="margin">The ſtature and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, and how they differ.</note> Italians differ much amongſt themſelues both in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſtature, for in Ciſalpine France, and about the gulfe of Venice, the people be of a pale complexion, neat in their apparell, and curious in their ſpeach: but the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Hetruria, Latium, Campania, Lucania and the Brutij be of a more browne and ſwartie complexion, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:24800:168"/>
their haire black, in ſtature they be lower and withall very leane, and in apparell and ſpeech more plaine and ſimple. The Piceni and thoſe which dwell on the skirts of the Adriatticke ſea, vntill you come to great Greece, haue much reſemblance to the former, but in Apulia, Calabria, and in the vppermoſt parts of Italy towards Greece, their ſpeach and behauiour doth little differ from the Greekes.</p>
               <p>Throughout all Italy, and in a manner throughout all Europe, it is not lawfull for any man to haue more wiues than one, and all diuorſes betwixt man and wife, had their originall from the Citty of Rome, for there it was that <hi>Spurius Carbillus,</hi> complaining of his wiues barrenneſſe, was the firſt that euer was diuorſed from his wife. The Cittizens heretofore conſiſted of three ſorts of people, <note place="margin">Three ſorts of Cittizens.</note> that is to ſay, ſlaues, libertines (which were ſuch as were once ſlaues, and were manumitted and made free) &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The freemen were likewiſe deuided into three orders <note place="margin">Three orders of Free-men.</note> or ranks, to wit, the Plebeians, the Equeſtri, and the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tij; the ſolemnizing of their ſacrifices and ſacred rites was committed to Prieſts and Flamins, beſides whom they had diuerſe colleges and ſocieties of religious perſons, wherof ſome did ſacrifice to one God, and ſome to an other. The Dictator was moſt honored of all other officers, and bore <note place="margin">The Dictator their chiefest officer.</note> the greateſt ſway amongſt them, from whom no appeale was ſufferable, for he bearing a Kinglike gouernment, they had no higher officer to whom they might appeale: the dignity of the Dictator continued but halfe a yeare, &amp; for the moſt part they came to that high office by degrees, as being firſt Queſtors or Treaſurers, then Aediles, or ouer-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp; after that Praetors or chiefe Iuſtices, then were they made Conſuls, then Cenſors, &amp; then they attained to the higheſt office of all, which was Dictatorſhip. But yet it did not alwaies neceſſarily follow, that the Dictator had born
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:24800:168"/>
all thoſe offices before recited, for he was oftentimes elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of ſome inferior office for his valor &amp; worthineſſe, yet he had chiefeſt power and authority ouer all thoſe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill gouernors, as likwiſe ouer all officers that bore rule in the warres, for in military affaires they had their degrees of gouernors, aſwell as in domeſticall buſineſſes, for there the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſoldiors yeelded obedience to the Centurions, the Centurions to the Tribunes, the Tribunes to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, the Lieutenants or deputies to the Conſuls, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Vice-preſidents by them aſſigned to rule in their ſteeds, and all theſe together with the Captaines and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors of horſmen, were ſubiect to the authority of the Dictator. In warres that were lawfully begun, ſouldiors might continue for the ſpace of ten yeares, if in all that time they neuer skirmiſhed with the enimy, nor were ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned away to wage wars in other countries. Beſides this lawfull making of wars, whereof I now ſpeake, there was an other ſort of warfare called <hi>Cauſaria,</hi> which was when the army for ſome reaſonable cauſe was diſmiſſed, and the campe remooued. This latter maner of warfare as it was not ſo honorable as the firſt, yet did it carry with it no touch of ignominy nor diſgrace, becauſe they were called thence for ſome ſpeciall cauſe; <hi>Seruius Tullius</hi> ordained, that none ſhould be ſoldiors but ſuch as were betwixt the age of ſeuenteene yeares, and eight and forty: thoſe which were men of peace went alwaies in gownes, and the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors in ſhort caſſocks and coate armors. When they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make battell againſt any country, they would firſt ſend an herald or officer at armes to denounce warrs, and being once entred into it, they might not leaue it but for ſome lawfull cauſe.</p>
               <p>All the citties of Italy were either confederats with Rome, or ſuch as were newly inhabited by thoſe that came out
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:24800:169"/>
of Rome, and were called Colonia, or Municipia, which were ſuch Citties as had liberties and priuiledges proper <note place="margin">Three ſorts of Citties.</note> and peculiar to themſelues: of which ſort ſome were made by plurality of voyces, and ſome otherwiſe, and thoſe Citties called Municipia, were euer gouerned by their owne decrees, but the Citties called Coloniae were accounted as members of Rome, and liued vnder the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine law. In the citties or corporations called Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, where there were Burgeſſes and Free denizens toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their chiefeſt officers were called Decurions, which were the ſame that Senators were at Rome. The order of the Patritij were diſtinguiſhed from the Equeſtri by their purple robes, and the Equeſtri were knowne from the Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians, by their gilden garments, if he which had the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt authority, and bore the prerogatiue royall amongſt them, had miſdemeaned himſelfe, his cauſe was diſcerned by the whole body of the citty, and the hearing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of all other capitall offences, was committed to certaine Iudges elected by lots to that dignity, out of that band of ſouldiers which were aſſiſtants to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in matters of life and death for that yeare: The deciding of all ciuill contentions, belonged to the Praetor of the Centumuiri, and ſo in like ſort other crimes were committed to the conſideration of other Magiſtrates: And ſuch generally were the manners and cuſtomes of all the people and citties of Italy, which inſtitutions and forme of gouernment, they receiued from <hi>Romulus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Romulus</hi> (after he had finiſhed and perfected the walls, ditches, forts of defence, and all other neceſſary buildings of the Citty of Rome:) ordered and diſpoſed the ſtate of the citty in manner following. Firſt hee deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the whole multitude of people into three parts or
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:24800:169"/>
ranckes, ſelecting out of euery of thoſe orders or degrees, <note place="margin">How Romulus diſpoſed the cittizens of Rome into ſundry orders and degrees.</note> the chiefeſt and worthieſt men to gouerne and rule the reſt. After this he made a ſubdiuiſion, diſtributing each of thoſe three ſeuerall parts into ten equall and indifferent portions, and ſetting as gouernours ouer euery portion the beſt and moſt ſubſtantialeſt men amongſt them; hee called the three greater parts Tribes, and the leſſer Curiae or wardes: the gouernors of the Tribes hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called Tribunes, and the Preſidents of the wardes, Centurions: The Curiae or wardes were laſtly deuided into leſſer bands, called Decuriae, and their wardens or leaders he named Decurions.</p>
               <p>All the people beeing thus deuided into Tribes and <note place="margin">The ground deuided into thirty equall parts.</note> wardes, he then made like partition of the land, deuiding it into thirty equall parts or portions, and allotting vnto euery ward their part thereof, he reſerued onely ſo much for himſelfe, as was ſufficient for him wherein to build Temples and places for ſacrifices, leauing alſo ſome little in common to them all: And thus this firſt partition both of the people and ground, wrought a common equalitie amongſt them. This done, he made a ſecond diuiſion of the people onely, giuing vnto euery one ſtipends and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, according to the worthineſſe and dignity of their perſons, and ſeuerring thoſe which were honorably deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and of approued vertues, and that were wealthy withall, and had iſſue to inherit after them, from thoſe which were poore, needy and ignoble, hee named thoſe men of baſeſt and meaneſt condition Plebeians, and the Nobility he called <hi>Patres</hi> or fathers, whereof inſued, that the whole diſcent and poſterity of the <hi>Patres,</hi> were euer after them called Patritians.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Romulus</hi> had thus ſeperated the better ſort of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:24800:170"/>
people from the worſe, the rich from the poore, the noble from the ignoble, he then ordained them lawes to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, allotting vnto euery of them their proper offices and functions, according to their degrees and calling. To the Patritij he gaue power to doe ſacrifice, to beare offices, to <note place="margin">The office of the Patritij.</note> decide controuerſies, and to ſee that euery one had his right, to participate with him in the gouernment of the common-weale, and to haue a vigilant regard and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reſpect of the ſafty of the citty: the Plebeians or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalty (both for that they were poore and wanted expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) were eaſed from bearing offices, and onely imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome in husbandry, ſome in feeding of cattell, and ſome in handy-crafts, or other profitable trades. And to the end that all theſe ſeuerall ſorts of people ſhould liue peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and free from contention one with an other, and neither the poore iniured by the rich, nor the rich enuied by the poore, hee committed the Plebeians to the care of the Patritians, permitting euery one of the comminalty to chooſe one of the Patritij whom hee pleaſed, for his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate and defendor, calling that a Patronage or protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <note place="margin">How the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritians and Plebeians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</note> And thus the poore being taken into the protection of the Patritians, he inſtituted for them both, their proper duties one towards an other, which was that the Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould reuerence their patrons, and the patrons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their clients whom they had taken into protection, and ſo he vnited them together in friendly affection and ciuill coniunction, making it vnhoneſt and vtterly vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for either of them to accuſe the other, or for the one to giue teſtimony againſt the other, or that there ſhould be any hatred or enmity betwixt them; by which meanes, vnity and mutuall concord was moſt firmly ſetled and eſtabliſhed amongſt the Romaines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:24800:170"/>
After this hee elected an hundred Councellors, out of the Patritians, the maner of their election was this; Firſt hee himſelfe aſſigned and nominated one to bee his vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, <note place="margin">The Centum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri elected, which were after called Senators of Rome.</note> or Lieutenant in the gouernment of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, when he went to the warres, out of the confines of his owne country: then hee commanded the Tribes to chooſe out of euery Tribe three, of the beſt eſteeme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, for grauity, wealth and honor: after which nine ſo elected by the tribes, he likewiſe commanded the Curiae or wards, that euery warde ſhould chooſe three of the Patritians, whom they thought moſt fit for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which done, adding to the ninety elected by the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wards, the nine that were choſen by the three Tribes, and that one chiefe Captaine or Commander aſſigned by himſelfe, they all of them made vp the compleat number of a hundred Councellors, which number of Councellors were by the Romaines in ſhort time after their inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on called the Senate of Rome, and they themſelues for their reuerence and authority called Fathers, and for theit age and grauity Senators: Moreouer after all this, hee elected out of the moſt generous and renowned fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, three hundred yong men, of the choyſeſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <note place="margin">The election of three hundred yong men cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Celeres.</note> amongſt them, which were firſt prickt and nominated by the ſuffrages of the Curiae or wards, euery warde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating ten as in the former election of the Senators, and this their election was afterwards by him confirmed: And thoſe three hundred young men ſtood euer in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe about him as a Court of garde to defend his perſon, and were all of them called by this generall name <hi>Celeres,</hi> for their ſpeedineſſe and readineſſe at all aſſayes to execute the Kings command.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:24800:171"/>
Furthermore, the offices and duty of the King were preſcribed as followeth; Firſt by his authority regall hee <note place="margin">The office of the King.</note> was chiefe head and principall gouernor of ſacrifices, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers and temples conſecrated to diuine ſeruice, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ought not doe any thing that redounded not to the glory of their gods: next hee was in duty bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and keepe the lawes and cuſtomes of his country, he had alſo power to ſommon a Senate, to aſſemble the commons, and in military affaires, hee had chiefe Empire and command ouer all: To the Senate was giuen power <note place="margin">The office of Senators.</note> and commiſſion to heare and determine all complaints and controuerſies that were brought before them, which was done by voyces of the Senators, and the ſentence was euer giuen on his ſide that had the moſt voyces.</p>
               <p>The Plebeians or cominalty had alſo theſe three priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, <note place="margin">The priuileges of the Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> to create Magiſtrates, to make lawes, and determine of warres when the King was ſo pleaſed, nor was this power abſolute in themſelues, but it muſt euer bee appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and allowed by the Senate, neither yet had euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his perticular voyce, but euery warde was called ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and that which was agreed vpon by the maior part of the words, was referred to the conſideration of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. But now this manner of giuing voyces is changed and altered in moſt places, for neither hath the Senate power to diſcerne and giue allowance of the ordinances and decrees of the commons, but rather the commons haue authority to alter or allow the ſtatutes eſtabliſhed by the Senate.</p>
               <p>By this diuiſion of <hi>Romulus</hi> the three hundred yong men of his garde called <hi>Celeres,</hi> did not onely accompliſh <note place="margin">The office of Celeres.</note> his commands in matters concerning the ciuill eſtate and gouernement of the Citty, but they had alſo the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:24800:171"/>
managing of military affaires, ſo as when the King inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to rayſe an army, it was needeleſſe for him to create Tribunes oner the Tribes, decurions ouer the wards, or gouernors and praefects of his horſe men: but it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough for him to commande the Tribunes, and they the centurions, and then the Decurious by their inſtructions were to bring forth ſuch ſouldiors as they thought fitteſt for that purpoſe, by which meanes they would be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in redineſſe at an inſtant: He elected alſo a thouſand fighting-men which (as ſome write) he called <hi>Milites,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were a thouſand in number.</p>
               <p>And then the more to ſhew his Maieſty, and to bee <note place="margin">The Milites elected.</note> thought more honorable in the eyes of his people, hee aſcribed and tooke vnto him-ſelfe tytles, markes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of Empire and honour, as to goe in ſumpteous attyre, and to haue euer going before him twelue Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants or Miniſters of execution, which hee called <hi>Lictores,</hi>

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:24800:172"/>
firſt hee made a law concerning Matrimony, that the wife ſhould haue equall power with her husband ouer all their mony and goods, and as much authority in their ſacrifices, <note place="margin">VViues made equall to their husbands.</note> and that ſhee ſhould liue in as good ſort as her husband and be called Miſtris ouer the houſe, as well as he Maiſter, and that if hee dyed without Iſſue his wife ſhould ſucceed him, and inherite all his goods and poſſeſſions, and if hee left children behinde him, yet ſhee ſhould haue an equall ſhare with them: That if ſhee were conuicted of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it ſhould bee lawfull for her husband or his kinſfolke to kill her, and that if ſhe drinke any wine at her owne houſe, ſhee ſhould bee puniſhed as an adultreſſe: by meanes of which inſtitution, aroſe this cuſtome amongſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, that the husbands when they had beene a broade <note place="margin">Jt was Death for a woman to drincke wine</note> and came home to their houſes, ſhould imbrace and kiſſe their wiues and daughters, of purpoſe (as <hi>Fortius Cato</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth it) to ſmell whether they had drunke any wine, thereby approuing, that as corruption is the beginning of madneſſe, and frenzie, ſo is drunkenneſſe the forerunner of rottenneſſe and corruption.</p>
               <p>Then hee ordayned that parents ſhould haue full power ouer their children, to diſpoſe of them as they pleaſed, to reſtrayne and keepe them vnder, to beate them and bynde them and ſet them to all drudgery, yea it was lawfull for <note place="margin">VVhat power parents had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> them to ſlay them, or ſell them for ſlaues, and if any were ſold by his father, and of him ſelfe regained his liberty, his father might ſell him againe, and againe after that, if hee were ſo diſpoſed; The contents of this law was three hundred yeares after the inſtitution thereof written in twelue tables, but yet the rigor and authority was firſt mitigated and abridged by <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> next King
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:24800:173"/>
to <hi>Romulus,</hi> for he ordained, that if the ſonne did marry by his fathers conſent, all the authority his father had ouer him before, was then extinct; from this ſeuere law <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> proceeded to other ordinances, eſtabliſhing that no free-man ſhould exerciſe any arte or occupation, wherein his worke was done ſitting, as Taylers, Shoomakers, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueners, &amp;c. and that the Cittizens ſhould practiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in husbandry, as well as in martiall diſcipline, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in after-times it was a great commendation for one to be accounted both a good ſouldier and a good husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for the King thought it a point of great imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in any man, to be ignorant in either of theſe exerciſes, but that to be skilfull in manuring and tilling the ground, and expert in feats of armes, ſhould inſeperably go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the law of the Lacedemonians, and in time of peace his will was that they ſhould wholy giue themſelues to husbandry, permitting them notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to buy and make prouiſion of ſuch things they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when neceſſity conſtrained them therevnto. And in argument that hee was not vnmindfull of matters of religion, hee ordained and made Temples, Altars, and Images of the gods; adding there-vnto feſtiuall dayes, and times of ſolemnity, oblations, ſacrifices, holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, fayres and martes, wherein as well to buy any thing they wanted, as alſo to vnderſtand their lawes and many other things, pertaining to the honor of their gods, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding notwithſtanding out of the cittie all forraine and out-landiſh ſacrifices, and eſpecially thoſe which were ſolemnized after the ceremonies of the Greekes, thoſe onely excepted which were dedicated and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in honour of <hi>Heroules,</hi> and were long ſince inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the dayes of <hi>Euander.</hi>

                  <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus,</hi> following the opinion of <hi>Varro</hi> herein, ſaith that <hi>Romulus</hi> ordained three ſcore prieſts to make publike ſacrifices, through euery tribe and euery ward, annexing vnto them as their aſſiſtants, the diuiners and ſouthſaiers: euery ward likewiſe had his proper Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, or ſpirit, which they ſuppoſed did defend them, and their proper miniſters to doe ſacrifice vnto them: but the goddeſſe <hi>Veſta</hi> was generally worſhipped of all.</p>
               <p>And laſtly hee deuided and digeſted the yeere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tenne monthes, by all which ordinances and decrees it may eaſily bee gathered and plainely perceiued that <hi>Romulus</hi> was moſt skilfull and expert in all matters both diuine and humaine, and that they detract much from his glory and wiſdome, which report that the people of Rome liued without morality amongſt themſelues, or religion towards their gods, vntill the raigne of <hi>Numa Pompilius.</hi> And theſe were the ciuil inſtitutions ordained by <hi>Romulus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> that afterwards ſucceeded him in the Kingdome, in ſome part altered and in ſome part <note place="margin">Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius <hi>and his lawes.</hi>
                  </note> added vnto his Statutes, and firſt in following the courſe of the Moone, hee diſpoſed the yeere into twelue monthes, whereas before <hi>Romulus</hi> made it to conſiſt but of tenne, and altering the order of the monethes, hee ſet Ianuary and February before March (whereas till that time March was the firſt month and the beginning of the yeere) and ſo hee made March for to bee the third in order and ranke: Next hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſome daies to bee feſtiuall and holy, and ſome other as diſmal, ominous and vnluckie, wherein he would not any way meddle with the people or beginne any buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:24800:174"/>
After this hee created one chiefe Flamin or Prieſt to doe ſacrifice to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whom he called <hi>(Dialis)</hi> and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with a roabe of dignity and chaire of ſtate, hee then created two other prieſts, one to ſacrifice to <hi>Mars</hi> and the other to <hi>Romulus,</hi> and theſe were alſo called Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, for the caps of honour which they wore vpon their heads: moreouer he elected the Virgine <hi>Veſtals</hi> which for the firſt ten yeeres did nothing but learne the rites and manner of ſacrifiſing, the next ten yeeres they ſpent in doing ſacrifice themſelues, and the third ten yeeres they taught and inſtructed nouiſſes and freſh commers into that profeſſion, and then at the thirtith yeeres end it was in their choiſe, whether they would mary or continue ſtill in that courſe of life.</p>
               <p>And thoſe Virgin Veſtals were maintained at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon coſt of the City, and reuerenced with titles of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual virginity, and other ceremonies, but if any of them were conuicted of inceſt, her ſentence was ſorrowfully pronounced by the Cittizens, that ſhee ſhould bee ſet quicke in the ground, at the gate called Collina, which is in the hill Quirinalis and there couered with earth till ſhee were dead. Hee dedicated alſo vnto <hi>Mars</hi> twelue other prieſts which hee called Salij, whoſe office was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certaine daies in the month of March (which tooke his name of the god <hi>Mars)</hi> to lead a ſolemne dance in ſome of the principall places of the City, they were cloathed with coates of diuers collours, and their vppermoſt gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were red and changeable, they had ſwords by their ſides hanging in brazen belts, in their right hand they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried launces and rods, and brazen bucklers in their left, and vpon their heads they wore high hats waxing ſharpe towards the crowne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:24800:174"/>
Theſe prieſts which for their ſolemne dancing the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines called Sallij (according to the opinion of <hi>Dionyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us)</hi> did little differ from the Coribantes or Sibilles prieſts, which the Greekes called Curetes: finally he created a Biſhop or high prieſt, to whom he gaue ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ouer all infreior prieſts, and in him it lay to appoint what oblations ſhould bee offred, vpon what daies and in what Temples. Beſides all theſe holy orders of prieſts and religious perſons, hee ordained the Feciales or her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds <note place="margin">The Feciales ordained.</note> to denounce warre or peace, and they were to haue a ſpeciall regard that the Romanes ſhould not make warres againſt any vniuſtly, and if the Romaines were iniured or robbed by any others, theſe Feciales were to require reſtitution of the goods wrongfully taken and detained, but if they denied to make reſtitution, then were they to denounce open war againſt them.</p>
               <p>Their power was likewiſe to deliuer offenders to bee puniſhed, to thoſe whoſe goods they had iniuriouſly taken, if wronge were offered to Legats or Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, they were to correct it, and if the cauſes were honeſt and iuſt, they might conclude a peace, and breake it againe if it appeared that the League was vnlawfully eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>And if either the captaine, or chiefe conductor of the army, or the whole army in generall, had done any thing contrary to their oths and alleagance, in them it reſted wholy to puniſh the offence.</p>
               <p>This done he limitted their times of mourning, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that the death of infants vnder three yeeres old, ſhould not bee lamented at all, and that for elder children they ſhould bewaile them as many monthes as they were yeeres old, ſo as it exceeded not ten monthes,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:24800:175"/>
which was the vttermoſt time preſcribed for mourning for any ones death.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> had eſtabliſhed theſe lawes, for the gouernment of the common-wealth, he then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and diſtributed the people into ſundry companies and ſocieties, according to their arts and profeſſion, as minſtrels, crafts-men, head-carpenters, dyers, ſhooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, tanners, maſons, potters, &amp;c. making of diuers of thoſe arts one fraternitie or bodie politicke. <hi>Seruius Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into ſunday bands called Claſſes, and centuries.</note> deuided the whole multitude of citizens into ſundry orders, ranckes or armies, which he called Claſſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to centuries or bands conſiſting of a hundred men, the manner of his diſpoſition of them was thus.</p>
               <p>In the firſt order or degree he inroled thoſe who were <note place="margin">The firſt Claſſis.</note> taxed in their ſubſidie bookes at a hundred thouſand Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and of this order there was foureſcore centuries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting indifferently of young men and old, ſo as the old men ſhould euer remaine at home to ſaue and defend the city, and the youth were to try the fortune of warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; he then commanded them both, to weare armor and weapons both of defence &amp; of offence, as helmets, ſhields, priuie-coates and bootes to defend themſelues, and ſpeares and ſwords to offend the enemy: to this firſt ranke or degree hee added two centuries of worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or pioners, which were to caſt trenches, build ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers, and to make all their engines and inſtruments of warre, and they euer went vnarmed, to bee alwaies in redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for any labor.</p>
               <p>The ſecond order or degree conſiſted of twentie cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, and were ſuch as were taxed betwixt ſeuentie <note place="margin">The ſecond Claſſis.</note> fiue and a hundred thouſand Aſſes, they were deuided into young and old as the former order, and tollerated
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:24800:175"/>
to weare the ſame armor and weapons the other did, ſaue onely the coate of fence which they might not weare.</p>
               <p>The third order was of ſuch as were taxed at fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <note place="margin">The third or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Claſſis.</note> Aſſes, &amp; they conſiſted of as many centuries as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and did nothing differ from them in their weapons, ſauing that they wore no bootes.</p>
               <p>The fourth order was taxed at fiue and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <note place="margin">The fourth Claſſis.</note> aſſes, and they wore no other weapons but little Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelins or darts. And the fift and laſt degree conſiſted of thirty centuries, their warlike weapons were ſlings and <note place="margin">The fift and laſt degree.</note> ſtones, and they were valued at forty thouſand, and with theſe were ceſſed and taxed the cornetters and trumper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were three centuries in number, the reſt whoſe ſubſtance was but ſmall, hee both ſpared from the wars, by reaſon of their pouerty, and remitted their tribute.</p>
               <p>After this diuiſion he miniſtred an oth to the Citizens, that they ſhould make a iuſt eſtimation of their goods, and declare out of what family &amp; ſtocke they were deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, what children they had, and of what age and by what names they were called, and whether any of them had wiues, and where euery of them dwelt: and if any of them dealt doubly with him, and falſifyed their othes and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, all their goods were <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> confiſcate and taken from them, and they themſelues firſt whipped and then ſold for ſlaues.</p>
               <p>The companies of footmen being thus diſtributed, hee elected out of the chiefeſt of the Citizens, nine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of horſmen, ſo as the whole number of horſeme rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning thoſe that were ordained by <hi>Romulus,</hi> and thoſe which were afterwards added by <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> were now two and twenty centuries: to euery centuary hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ten thouſand peeces of money out of the common
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:24800:176"/>
treaſury, to buy them horſes, and two thouſand peeces a yeere to keepe them, beſides, all the widdowes of the city paide vnto the horſemen yeerely penſions towards their better maintainance, euery one according to her ability: And ſo all the whole number of horſmen and footemen were a hundred ninty and three centuries, and euery cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury kept their place and dignity in giuing their voices, &amp; they that were beſt able bore the greateſt charge in the warres, and gaue their voices firſt. For <hi>Seruius</hi> thought it fitter that the centuries ſhould pay tribute according as they were valued, and not perticularly by the pole, as they did before.</p>
               <p>The centuries of horſemen were to mingle their voices, amongſt the centuries of the firſt ranke of footemen, which were foureſcore centuries as is ſaide before, and ſo <hi>Dionyſius</hi> reckoneth, that there were foureſcore and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene centuries, that had the firſt place in giuing their voices, which were more then all the centuries of the other orders, whereof inſues, that what euer was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſuffrages of the firſt order, was immutable, but if the voices of the firſt degree were deuided, which happened but ſeldome, then the centuries of the ſecond order were called, and if they could not agree, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers after them in their courſe, but it was very rare that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it ſhould come to the centuries of the laſt order.</p>
               <p>And thus by the wiſdome of King <hi>Tullius,</hi> all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſeemed to haue an equality of voices, but yet the priority was granted to thoſe which were at greateſt charge, and though none were excluded, yet was all in a manner done by the centuries of the firſt order, and the <hi>equites</hi> or horſmen: For they created magiſtrates whom they pleaſed, they eſtabliſhed lawes and denounced wars,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:24800:176"/>
which three priuiledges and prerogatiues were before by <hi>Romulus</hi> giuen to the Plebeians or communalty.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Taquin</hi> the laſt Romaine King, was depoſed and baniſhed Rome, the forme of this gouernment was cleane altered and changed: for in ſteed of Kings they created Conſuls, who had all the types and ornaments of honour giuen vnto them, that the Kings had before, ſauing onely the crowne, and the gowne wrought with palmes, which the Kings vſed to weare after they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiued any conqueſt: And when <hi>Brutus,</hi> the defender of their liberties, was by the voices of the centuries made <note place="margin">The Kings put downe and Senators or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</note> fellow Conſul with <hi>Collatinus,</hi> hee bound the Citizens by an oth, that they ſhould neuer after that ſuffer any one man to raigne ouer them as their King: Then hee ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned three hundred Senators, and one chiefe ruler ouer the ſacrifices, whoſe office was to performe all things belonging to ſacrifices, that the King before was wont to doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valerius</hi> (who was the third Conſul) permitted it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to appeale from the Conſuls to the comminalty, forbidding vnder paine of death that no one ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any office, without the conſent of the commons, and that the Citizens ſhould bee eaſed of tribute, which made men more willing to fall to trading and other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; adding therevnto an other law, whereby it was preſent death for any one to affect any kinde of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his owne priuate profit: Hee then appointed the Temple of Saturne to bee the common treaſury, wherein to keepe the reuenewes of the City, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the people to create two Treaſurers, or Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes, to ſee the diſpoſing thereof: Not longe after this they agreed to haue ſuch a magiſtrate, as from whom
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:24800:177"/>
they might not appeale, and him they called a Dictator, <hi>(a dictando)</hi> by reaſon of the authority hee had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <note place="margin">The Dictator elected.</note> or rather <hi>(a dicende)</hi> becauſe he was not elected by the voices of the people, but by him onely that bore the chiefeſt ſway in the city.</p>
               <p>In ordayning this high office of Dictatorſhip, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes may ſeeme to haue imitated the Greekes, who (as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> writeth in his booke <hi>Deregno)</hi> were wont to make certaine chiefe officers whom they called <hi>Eſimne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> to rule ouer them for a time limited. For the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Rome continued in his place and dignity but halfe a yeere, and was neuer created but in time of warre, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imminent danger of the Citie, and then hee had power to elect new magiſtrates and officers vnder him, as the maiſter or captaine of the horſmen, who in authority was next vnto him, eſpecially ouer the horſemen and beſt ſouldiors, and was aſſiſtant to the Dictator as the Tribune was to the King: And when <hi>Spurius Caſſius,</hi> and <hi>Poſthumius Cominius</hi> were Conſuls, they gaue the people commiſſion, to chooſe them magiſtrates of great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and authority, to bee their protectors againſt the violence of the Conſuls, expreſly forbidding that no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritian <note place="margin">Tribunes of the people or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</note> ſhould take that office vpon him, and theſe high officers were called the Tribunes of the people.</p>
               <p>Theſe Tribunes grew in ſhort time ſo proude and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as they would caſſire and make voide the decrees of the Conſuls and Senate at their pleaſure, vnleſſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with their humors, and of them at the firſt (whether it were by general conſent, or foreſhewed by diuination, or whether religion mooued them) were but two in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber created, ſhortly after there was an other added to them, and in the end they came to bee fiue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:24800:177"/>
There was in Rome three ſorts of Parliaments, or ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of people to chuſe officers: the firſt called <hi>Curiata,</hi> or aſſembly of the wards, which was euer ſummoned by the Lictors or Sergeants: the ſecond <hi>Centuriata,</hi> which was of ſuch as were diuided into ſundry Centuries or degrees, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their age and abilitie, as is ſaid before: and to this they were called by a trumpeter or cornetter. And the third was of ſuch as dwelt in diuers parts of the country, &amp; payd tribute vnto the cittie. By the Parliament or conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation-houſe of the Centuries, where the Conſuls put downe, and the <hi>Decemviri</hi> created, to whom all the power <note place="margin">The Decemviri created, and Conſuls put downe.</note> and Empirie of the Senate deſcended, euen as the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Conſuls was firſt deriued from the Kings: nor was it lawfull in any caſe, to appeale from them. Theſe <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri</hi> when they went about to make any new lawes, would do it in this manner: firſt, one of them had a whole day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to conſider what was fitting to be don; in which day he bore the greateſt authority, and when hee had ſet downe his opinion in writing, the next day was allowed for another, and to haue the like prime place in gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and ſo likewiſe the reſt euery one his ſeuerall day: and when euery one had had his day, and their opinions, and doings written in ſeuerall tables, and layd before them altogether, they then collected and confirmed what they thought good out of euery ones ſentence, and ſo calling them the lawes of the ten tables, they publiſhed them to the people.</p>
               <p>And there went euer before him, that had the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Iuriſdiction, twelue men carrying bundels of roddes, and the other nine had euery one his Vſher going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>But this kind of gouernement continued not long,

for euen as the power and authority of the Tribunes was vtterly baniſhed out of the citie by the Decemviri, ſo (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon mature conſideration) it ſeemed good to the Patrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the Tribunes in requitall ſhould extinguiſh and put downe theirs. And then was there a law ordained, that whatſoeuer was decreed by the Plebeians, ſhould go cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant through all the people: and if any one hindred or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached the Tribunes or Aediles in their iudgements, his head ſhould be ſacrificed to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and his whole family that were free, ſhould be ſold for ſlaues at the Temple of <hi>Ceres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this there was another Councell created out of the Plebeians, and then was it made lawfull and tolerable for the Plebeians to marry, and enter into conſanguinitie with the Patricians.

               <p>This pettie office beeing but meane at the firſt inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, grew in proceſſe of time to an incredible height, in ſo much as the whole raines of correction and ciuill diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, were in concluſion let looſe into their hands: for the gouernement of the Senate, the Equites and Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, were ſo curbed and reſtrained, as they had power on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to decide controuerſies touching honour and reproch: and in the Cenſors conſiſted the chiefeſt ſoueraignty, as to view and ouerſee publike places, to giue penſions to the people, and againe to taxe them with exactions and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute: to conſecrate ſacrifices euery fift yeare for the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cittie, to diſplace and thruſt the Senators out of the cittie, or to defame them: and theſe continued in
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:24800:178"/>
their office for fiue yeares, and then new were created in their roomes. Then was there another Magiſtrate created to heare and determine matters, whom they called a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and to him was committed power and authoritie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">A Praetor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</note> all publike and priuate dealings, and to conſtitute and ordaine new lawes and ſtatutes, and to abrogate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale the old: Of theſe Praetors there was firſt but one cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and he was called <hi>Vrbanus Praetor,</hi> becauſe he had the gouernement of the cittizens, to whome (he alone beeing not able to vndergo ſo great a burthen, by reaſon of the great acceſſe of ſtrangers that daily reſorted thither to dwell) there was afterwards another Praetor added, and him they called <hi>Praetor peregrinus,</hi> as hauing the charge ouer aliens and ſtrangers, and this kind of gouernement was called <hi>Ius honorarium,</hi> for the great honour and dignitie that belonged to the Magiſtrates: for they had all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and ornaments attributed vnto them, that before belonged to the Kings, and their apparel and furniture was almoſt equall to the Conſuls.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate did the cittie of Rome continue vntil <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> time, who reduced the gouernement into a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie againe, by taking vppon him the name of <hi>Imperator,</hi> which kind of gouernement by Emperors did long after continue, and then began to be celebrated at Rome the <note place="margin">

dead Emperors vnto the <hi>Forum,</hi> and there placing it in the pulpit, wherein they vſed to pleade and make orations, a great ſort of boyes and girles of the order of the <hi>Patricii,</hi> (the whole company being orderly placed on each ſide of the pulpit) did ſing in a mournefull and lamentable Ditty certaine hymnes in commendation of the dead Emperor. Then did they carry the Iuorie bed with the Image on it from the <hi>forum,</hi> to <hi>campus Martius,</hi> (which is a field nere Rome, wherin they vſed all manner of exerciſes) and there placed it vppon a high throne of eſtate made of wood, and foure ſquare, and riſing higher by degrees, and narrower towards the top, in manner of a watch-tower, all the troup being decked in gold and purple, and adorned with images and enſigns of iuorie, and diuers other pictures: within the hollowneſſe of which throne was ſet a great pile of dry wood: then was the image placed vpon the ſecond ſtep or degree of the throne, with all ſorts of odors and ſweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, which were brought thither from all parts of the cittie, and the nobleſt young men of the Order of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtri,</hi> clothed and attired in linnen garments, rode round about the throne with a Pyrrhichian motion, and ſolemne gate, and with them all the Nobility in chariots and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and laſt of all the ſucceſſor of the deceaſed Emperor brought a torch readie light, and deliuered it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſet the pile on fire at the bottome of the throne. And when the fire began to burne, they had a deuiſe, that an Eagle ſhould fly out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top of the building, which wilfully and fooliſhly they ſuppoſed to bee the ſoule of the Emperor, flying and aſcending into heauen, &amp; all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperors that were conſecrated by theſe abſurd ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, they euer after ſuperſtitiouſly honored as gods: And thus much of the ſtate of the citty. All parts of Italy
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:24800:181"/>
be now perfect and religious Chriſtians, and obſeruers of the ceremonies of the Romane Church, ſome few excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which dwell in the vttermoſt part towards Greece, which indeed be more then halfe Grecians: no man may haue more wiues then one, from whom they may not bee diuorced, but by the permiſſion of the biſhop of Rome. The eldeſt ſons of Princes and Noble-men inherit their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers poſſeſſions, but amongſt priuate men all the iſſue male do equally inherit, ſo as they be legitimate, (like our gauelkind in Kent:) The law of Italy is of three ſorts: firſt, the ſpirituall law, wherof the Biſhop is head, then the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors law, which is generall ouer all, and the particular lawes and orders of each ſeuerall city which particular cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes do much differ one from another, &amp; yet all concur for the good gouernment of their cities. In ſome cities the examination of all ciuill matters, is committed vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Iudges, and in ſome againe to the Magiſtrates of the ſame citty, for euery cittie hath not one &amp; the ſame forme of gouernement. The chiefeſt of the Nobility of Italy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelues vnto the wars, and the meaner ſort vnto learning: &amp; to be a prieſt is a more venerable title, then to be a Nobleman: for of al learned men, the Diuines be beſt eſteemed, and next vnto them the Lawyers: the Phiſitions liue in greater wealth then admiration: &amp; Mathematicians Logicians, Aſtronomers, and Poets, bee more famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues, then amongſt the people, but Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians of all others be leſſe eſteemed, who only liue and dye among children. Merchants liue now in as great fame as euer they did, and painters, caruers of images, and bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founders be better eſteemed then husbandmen; although husbandry in times paſt was preferred before al trades. The Romans of all the Italians be moſt giuen to breeding cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:24800:181"/>
and yet they buſie not themſelues therewithall, but haue them looked to and kept by ſtrangers and hirelings.</p>
               <p>Their faſhions in apparell are not euery where alike, for <note place="margin">The apparel of the Italians.</note> the Venetians go ſumptuouſly in long looſe garments, and the cittizens of Venice more rich then other citties of that ſtate. The Florentines and Hetrurians bee very neate and ciuill in their attire, but not ſo coſtly as the Venetians, but about Millain, and in Aemilia and Liguria, they go ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gallant, but their garments be ſhorter then in Venice. And the Courtiers of Rome excell them all in length of their garments and variety of colours, but the cittizens of Rome be more ſparing and frugall, yet fine enough, and eſpecially the women: and in the Realme of Naples, they go neate but not ſo gorgeous, and ſtrange faſhions bee there in more requeſt then their owne. In all other partes of Italy their apparell is more ſimple and plaine, but of ſundry faſhions and altering euery day: In Aemilia and al Ciſalpine France the better ſort of women imitate the Spaniards in their apparel, and the Noblemen the French. The women of Rome of late do much affect the Tuſcane faſhion, and the Venetian Ladies were wont to lay open their breſts, armes, and ſhoulders, but now degenerating from their owne cuſtomes, and following the Spaniards, they couer all with looſe ſleeues: The auncient Romane coyne and images of mettall, do argue, that the Italians were wont to go euer bare headed, and bare legged, al but ſouldiers, and that in time of wars only, but now they vſe both hats and ſtockings, &amp; the cuſtome of couering their heads may ſeeme to be deriued from ſome other country.</p>
               <p>In times paſt they vſed no placards, nor ſtomachers, as as by the proportions of their old ſtatutes and pictures may be gathered, but now that attire is much taken vppe
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:24800:182"/>
by the Romaine youth. The language now vſed in Italy is not the ſame it was heretofore, nor altogether differing from it, but growne more barbarous, and compoſed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers languages, according to the ſundry ſorts of people, that haue poſſeſſed the Prouinces: for they which dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſhore of Hiſtria, ſpeak the Venetian toung, which is very eloquent and graue, but compounded of ſundrie tongs (and ſo is euery ſeuerall ſpeech in Italy) yet hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was more ſimple, and not ſo pleaſant to the eare, as now it is. In Corinth they haue a mixt language, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different from the Italian toung: but it is not ſo harſh in ſound, as the ſpeech vſed in Taruiſium, Patauium, Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Vicentia, Mantua, and Ferrara, and in all of them the citizens vſe finer termes than the country-men: but in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalpine France they be almoſt meere ſtrangers to the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian tong, though otherwiſe there is no gallanter a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in all Italy. Their ſpeech in Rauenna, Ariminum, Piſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Fauentia, Bononia, Flaminia, and throughout all Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia, is very Rhetoricall, and the Tuſcans ſpeech is very conciſe, like as it is in Laconia, and ſoundeth better in ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers mouths then their owne: moreouer, at Rome by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great concourie of people, that flock thither dai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly from all parts, their language is well improued. The Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceni, the Sabines, and Marſi ſpeak thick &amp; ſhort, &amp; in Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria, Apulia, and Lucania, together with the Brutii and Samnites, and the reſt of Italy their ſpeech is more barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and but little borrowing of ſtrange languages, ſauing that in the Realm of Naples they much affect the Spaniſh tong. And to conclude with the opinion of <hi>Antonius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellicus</hi> herein, in his 11. Aenead, and firſt booke: <hi>Search</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>throughout all Italy, and you ſhal find no one people, citty, nor Prouince, but they ſomewhat differ in language one from another.</hi>

The firſt inhabitants of this countrie (as <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſuppoſeth) were people called Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi, who once inhabited a great part of Italy, and beeing thence expelled by thoſe people of Italy, called the Oeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians, they ſeated themſelues in the ile of Sicily: The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Country liue very painefully and hardly, for their grounds be ouer-grown with thicke woods, the trees whereof be maruellous good timber for ſhippes, and of ſuch a thickneſſe, as they be eight foote ſquare at the leaſt, for which cauſe many be employed in felling of woods, and breaking of timber, and many others in ridding their grounds from ſtones, whereof they haue ſuch ſtore, as they can hardly plough or dig for them, by which meanes although they take great paines, yet receiue they but ſmal profit of their great labour, whereof it proceedeth, and from their ſparing diet, that their bodies be generally very leane, but ſtrong withall, and the women as well able, and as much accuſtomed to vndergo any labour, as the man: They be much giuen to hunting of wild beaſts, the fleſh whereof ſupplieth their wants of fruites and graine, &amp; by
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:24800:183"/>
reaſon of their continuall ſnowes, and often hunting and running ouer craggie and ſteepe mountaines, they be both nimble and ſtrong: their chiefe diet is either the fleſh of wild beaſts, or home-bred cattell, and their drinke is for the moſt part water: many of them alſo liue vppon ſuch herbes and rootes as their country affords, being in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſtitute both of bread and wine, the moſt neceſſarie nouriſhments, &amp; profitableſt prouiſion for mankind: their beds for the moſt part is the bare ground, without couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of either houſe or coate, vnles they repoſe themſelues in ſuch hollow caues, as nature hath prouided for them: &amp; this is their maner of life which they haue euer vſed. Their women moreouer, be as ſtrong as other countrie men, &amp; the ſtrength of their men is almoſt equall vnto beaſts.

Theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Tyrrhenia were of an exceeding ſtrength, &amp; of large dominions, and erected many ſtately and rich citties: they were alſo very ſtrong by ſea, inſomuch as they were lords thereof ſo long, till the Italian ſea had loſt his name, and was by them called the Tyrrhen ſea. They be able likewiſe to make an infinit army of footmen fit for the warres, and they were the firſt that inuented the trumpet, which is ſo neceſſarie an inſtrument for the wars, and by them is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tyrrhenum.</hi> They giue and aſcribe many honors and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of dignity vnto their Captains, &amp; conductors of their armies, as Lictors, or Sergeants to go before them, to do execution vpon offendors, litle drayes or carts made like chariots, with chaires of eſtate, which they called <hi>Praetex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae,</hi> and Officers called <hi>Faſces,</hi> that carry bundels of rods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, an Iuorie ſcepter; and many other things: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they may haue porches or galleries annexed to their horſes, for their ſeruants and attendants to ſit and repoſe themſelues in, which kind of building was afterwards imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the Romanes, and by them bettered, &amp; tranſlated

into they Common-wealth. The Tuſcans be great ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and much giuen to diuinity, but more to the ſtudie of naturall Philoſophie; wherein, and in the interpretation of the thunder and lightning, and in the art of Southſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they excell all others ſo farre, as at this day they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired throughout all the world, and their wiſe-men much ſought vnto. Moreouer, they be very expert in their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, inſomuch as the Romaines which haue euer beene very ſtudious and carefull, not onely to maintaine and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, but to increaſe and augment the true and ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, did ſend yearely (by the decree of the Senate) vnto the Tuſcanes, ten of their chiefe Princes and Magiſtrates ſons, there to be inſtructed in their manner of ſacrificing.</p>
               <p>From thence came vnto the Romanes that vaine and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle talke of euill ſpirits: And from thence likewiſe came the celebration of the Feaſts of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which by the conſent of all good men, &amp; due puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inflicted vpon the firſt authors and inuentors, is now vtterly rooted out of Italy, as a thing moſt pernitious and hurtfull. The ground in this countrie is ſufficient fruitfull, yet by their ſtudie or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie it is much amended. They eate vſually twiſe a day, and then they fare very daintily, and feed liberally, vſing to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their tables with curious carpets, and fine table cloths, diſtinguiſhed and ſet with flowers, cups of gold of ſundrie faſhions to drinke in, and great ſtore of miniſters and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to attend vppon them, which are not all ſlaues, but many of them free-men and cittizens: This people is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more ſuperſtitious then warlike.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ALATIA, a ſpatious countrie in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, lyeth (as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> writeth) beyond that part of France called Celti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and extendeth South-ward to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, and the ſhore adioyning, and to the hil of Hircinia in Germany, and from the bounds of Iſter or Danubius, vp vnto Scythia: It was ſo called of <hi>Galatis</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and of a certaine woman of Celtica, it is inhabited of many ſorts of people, <note place="margin">Galatia why ſo called.</note> and lyeth very farre Northward, and therefore ſo cold in the winter, as all their waters be frozen ouer, and the ice ſo exceeding thicke, as whole armies with horſes, chariots, and munition may ſafely paſſe ouer the riuers without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill: Galatia hath many great riuers running through it, ſome taking their beginning from deepe ſtanding pooles, and ſome from ſprings iſſuing out of rockes and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, whereof ſome disburthen themſelues into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, as the Rhene, and ſome into the ſea called Pontus, as Danubius, and ſome others into the Adriaticke ſea, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridanus, which is alſo called Padus or Po, and all theſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers be ſo congealed and frozen ouer all winter, as all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers may ſecurely go ouer them, eſpecially if chaffe or ſtraw be throwne vpon the ice for ſlipping.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of this violent coldneſſe, the countrey is vtterly and altogether deſtitute both of oyle and wine, in ſtead whereof they make a certaine drinke of barley,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:24800:185"/>
which they call Zitum, they vſe alſo to drinke a certaine water or meath wherein they waſh or ſteepe their honey combes.</p>
               <p>They take great delight in drinking wines, buying it of merchants, and drinking it without putting any water to it, and they be ſo weake brainde, that a little of it will ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and make them drunke, and then they be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lion drunke and fall a raging, or ſwine drunke and goe to ſleeping: This their inordinate deſire of wine maketh many Italians, in hope of gaine, to bring it vnto them both by water and by land, and they bee ſo greedie of it as for a meaſure of wine called Amphora, they will ſell one of there owne ſonnes to make a page or wayting boy of.</p>
               <p>Siluer there is none in Galatia, but gold in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, and that ſo naturally, as when the riuers that flow out of hils exceed their bankes, and ouer-flow the meadowes, they leaue behinde them vpon the graſſe, a golden ſand, or grauell, which beeing afterwardes tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forged, and the pure gold ſeuered from the droſſe, both men and women vſe it to addorne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues withall, making thereof bracelets, ringes and chaines all of maſſie gold, whereof they weare great ſtore, guilding their breſt-plates, curets, and armor with gold alſo.</p>
               <p>The richer ſort obſerue a ceremony peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, &amp; withal very ſtrang, which is to skatter gold vpon the flowers and pauements of their Churches, which they offer as an oblation vnto their gods, and it is ſtrang to ſee, how that the common people (notwithſtanding they bee couetous and greedie of gold) bee ſo zealous and religious, as they will not once offer for to take
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:24800:186"/>
vp one peece of that gold ſo careleſly diſperced abroad, or ſo much as touch it.</p>
               <p>The people of Galatia be tall of ſtature, ſoft skind and pale of complexion, and though their haire be naturally red, yet will they ſeeke out meanes by art, to bring that naturall collour to a deeper die: they curle and friſzell their haire with a curling pin or criſping wire, caſting the lockes of their fore-heads behind them on their ſhoulders, ſo as at the firſt ſight, they looke like boies, Satires or wood gods, vſing ſuch art in making their lockes buſhy and thicke, as they differ but little from horſe-manes: ſome of them ſhaue their beards, and ſome ſuffer them to grow long, and eſpecially the nobility, who doe not ſo much as cut the haire of their eye-lids, and for their beards they ſuffer them to grow in ſuch a length and breadth, as the will almoſt couer their bodies, ſo as they can neither eate nor drinke, but that the meate will ſticke in their beards, and the drinke trickle downe as from a conduit pipe.</p>
               <p>They eate their meate ſitting, but not vpon ſtooles and formes, but vpon wolues skinnes, and dogges skinnes caſt on the ground, and they bee attended by little boies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their fiers made cloſe by them, wherewith they boile and roſt their meate, and euer the beſt men eate the beſt meate, as the Poet writeth, that the greateſt honor was by the nobles attributed to <hi>Aiax,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ouercame <hi>Hector</hi> in ſingle combat. Such meate as they haue, they wil giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their gueſts, but they will firſt know the cauſe of their comming. And their manner is when they haue filled bellies to fall a brabling, and oftentimes vpon light occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations they will fight very deſperatly, for ſo naturall is their inclination to wrangling, as it is growne into a habit. This opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is crept in amongſt them, and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:24800:186"/>
by moſt of them plainely maintained, that the ſoule is immortall, and that after a certaine time that it is departed out of the body, it goeth into an other, and therefore ſome of them will write letters, and caſt them into the pile of wood prepared to burne the dead body, as though they ſhould read them when they bee dead: When they trauell, and when they fight they bee carried in Chariots drawne with two horſes, hauing one to ſit before the waggon to guide the horſes, and an other to goe by to driue them; and when the battaile is begunne, they firſt incounter their enemies, by caſting darts from their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, and when their darts be ſpent they alight from their Chariots and fight on foote: And ſome of them be ſo deſperate and careleſſe of death, as they will fight naked: Their watch-men and gard for their bodies be the poreſt ſort of freemen, which they vſe alſo for waggonners and to carry their ſhields, and their place is to goe in the fore-front of the battaile, prouoking and challenging the hardieſt and ſtouteſt of their enemies to fight with them hand to hand, euer ſhaking and brandiſhing their naked blades, the more to terrifie and daunt their foes: and when any captaine or common ſouldior behaueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe valiantly, and atchieueth any notable victory, they ceaſe not to extoll and commend both him and all his anceſtors, giuing vnto euery ſouldior commendations due for his valour and merits, and detracting from the acts of their enemies, as baſe and contemptible, though neuer ſo worthy of honour.</p>
               <p>They cut off the heads of their vanquiſhed enemies, and hange them about their horſe-neckes, beſprinckling and goring with bloud their ſpoiles, armor and furniture; and then giuing them to their ſeruants, who ſet them as
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:24800:187"/>
ſignes of conqueſt ouer their maiſters gates, with as much exultation and triumph, as many doe the skinnes and heads of wilde beaſts they haue taken in hunting: but if they happe to vanquiſh any noble men, they cut off their heads, and ſpice and ſeaſon them with ſweete ſpices, diligently preſeruing and keeping them in bags and caſes, to ſhew them for a vante to their gueſts and ſtrangers, and after ſell them for a trifle to their parents, children or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friends to keepe as a memorall.</p>
               <p>The Galatians garments (to make them ſeeme terrible) be of skins with the haire on &amp; vnſhorne, theſe garments bee of ſundry collours, and by them called (Braccas) they weare alſo caſſockes or ſhort clokes, ſtripped or rayed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with gold, or ſome other thing and well lined, and thicke for winter, but againſt ſummer they haue them ſlender and thinne, they vſe alſo thicke earthen veſſels diſtinguiſhed with flowers.</p>
               <p>Their warlike weapons and armor be long ſhields, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the ſtature of their bodies, and trimmed according to euery ones ſeueral deuice, for ſome haue the ſhapes of beaſts figured in braſſe, and ſet on the tops of their ſhields, which is both an ornament to the ſhield and a defence for the bodie: their helmets bee all of braſſe decked with more brauery then their ſhields, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creſt whereof ſtandeth either ſome hornes, or elſe the picture of ſome birde or beaſt: they haue trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets in like manner, but very ill fauoured ones, and ſuch as yeeld a rude, harſh and vntuneable ſound: ſome of them weare iron breſt-plates, and ſome other againe no other armour but what nature affoordeth them, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked and wearing long two-handed ſwords guirded to their right ſides with chaines or girdles of braſſe,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:24800:187"/>
ſome weare ſhort coates trimmed with gold and ſome ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer girdles, and their dartes which they vſe in the wars and cal lances, haue iron pikes aboue a cubit long and two handful broad, and their ſwords bee almoſt as long and as big as hunting ſtaues, or bore-ſpeares, whereof ſome be ſtreight and ſome crooked, beeing very fit both to anoy their enemies, as alſo to dig &amp; make holes in the ground. In countenance they bee terrible and auſtere, in ſpeech graue and ſeuere, their language is breefe and obſcure, and for the moſt part carrying a double ſence and doubtfull vnderſtanding: they be great boaſters of themſelues and diſpiſers of others, menacers, braggarts and detractors, proud and puft vp in their owne opinions, ſharpe-witted and learned withall: They haue a certaine manner of Poets or Muſitions which they call <hi>(Bardi)</hi> that ſing vnto Organs and winde Inſtruments, as others doe to the Harp or Lute, prayſing ſome in their ſongs and ſonnets and diſprayſing others: but thoſe that bee of greateſt eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and honour amongſt them, bee the Philoſophers, which they call <hi>Saronidae:</hi> Diuyners and South-ſaiers bee alſo there in great requeſt, and highly honored and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the common people; theſe (by their ſorceries and ſacrifices) foretel things to come, vſing (when they conſult of any weighty affaires) a ceremony moſt horrible and execrable, and almoſt incredible, for they cut a mans throate with a ſword, and when he fainteth, they iudge of future euents, both by his falling and ſincking downe, as alſo by ripping vp his members, and opening his intrals and bowels, and by the effuſion of his bloud.</p>
               <p>And they will neuer offer ſacrifice without ſome one of theſe Philoſophers, ſuppoſing that no ſacrifice can bee acceptable, vnleſſe it bee offred by ſome of thoſe nature
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:24800:188"/>
ſerchers, beeing (in their opinions) men moſt neere to the Gods. And their Poets be of ſuch reuerence and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as when the battaile is ſet in aray, their ſwords drawne, and their darts throwne, if any of theſe Poets aproach neere vnto the battaile, the whole hoaſt, yea and the enemy himſelfe, will at his comming abſtaine from fight: ſo as euen amongſt theſe rude and barbarous people, anger will yeeld to wiſdome, and <hi>Mars</hi> giue place to the Muſes.</p>
               <p>The Galatian women be equall vnto the men both in ſtrength and bigneſſe of body: there boies be for the moſt part white, and old men carry a very graue and fatherly aſpect: The Galatae that dwell vnder the North-pole and be neereſt vnto Scythia, and therefore more barbarous then the other, are ſaid to feed on mans fleſh; like vnto thoſe that inhabited that part of Britany called Iris. Theſe Northerne Galatians, through their courage and cruelty, are reported to be thoſe people, that once ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run almoſt all Aſia, and were called Cimmerij, and are thought to be the very ſame that afterwards by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the name, for Cimmerij were called Cimbri: they liue after their old accuſtomed manner by rapine and ſtealth, little regarding ſuch things as they haue of their owne, for the great deſire they haue to ſteale and filch from others.</p>
               <p>And theſe Galatae be they, who (after they had ſacked Rome and ſpoiled the Temple of <hi>Appollo</hi> at Delphos) ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and made tributary vnto them a great part both of Europ and Aſia, vtterly ruinating many Kingdomes, and poſſeſſing their lands: for thoſe that came into Greece, called that part of the country they inioyde there, Gallo-Gretia, or the Region of Galatia in Aſia the leſſe: It is
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:24800:188"/>

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:24800:189"/>
beautifull and goodly women, ſo were they maruelous luxurious and wanton: There beds were beaſts skinnes laide vpon the bare ground, vpon which when they ſlept, they would haue vpon each ſide of them, an excubitor or watchman: there carts alſo when they had any warres were couered with skinnes, whereon they would labour and ſtrike ſo hard, as they would make a horrible and ill fauored noyſe and clankering: But their impudency was of all things moſt admirable and odious, for they ſo far exceeded the bounds of modeſtic, as they would offer their naked bodies to men in the open ſtreetes, eſteeming it no fault, but rather condeming thoſe for daſtards and fainte-hearted cowards, that ſhould refuſe their offered fauours: <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> reporteth, that the Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri and Celtiberi would exult and reioyce when they were in the warres, becauſe if they died there their ends were honourable and happie, but if they languiſhed in any diſeaſe, they would lament and bee ſorrowfull, accounting that kinde of death as baſe and reprochfull.</p>

at one time of the yeere at Lyons, which is about the middle of France, and there they kept their Seſſions for the hearing and determining of all controuerſies that were brought before them from al parts of the Country, which kinde of Iudgement, and eſtabliſhing of lawes and ſtatutes was afterwards receiued amongſt al the nobles &amp; commons of France (the ſuperſtition beeing firſt brought out of Britany) and by them called the Parliament, of which I will ſpeake more hereafter. The Druides were exempted from the warres, and had immunity from tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and whoſoeuer addicted himſelfe to that kinde of profeſſion muſt learne by heart thouſands of verſes, yea ſo many as ſome of them ſpent twenty yeeres in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning verſes without booke, nor was it lawfull for them to commit any thing to writing, that belonged to the knowledge of that ſcience, for that they auoided all meanes that might either bee a helpe vnto their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or anywiſe concerne the authority of that diſcipline, and alſo that their idle ſuperſtitious rites might not bee laide open to the common people: and yet all other ſorts of Gaules and themſelues in all other matters, both publike &amp; priuate, vſed at that time the Greeke character: The Druides beleeued and preached the immortality of the ſoule, &amp; that after her departure out of one body, ſhee remooued into an other, by which means al feare of death being taken away, they were more hardy and venturous to vndergo al dangers.</p>
               <p>They would reaſon and diſpute much of the ſtars and of their motion, of the magnitude the worlde and ſytuation of the earth, and of the naturall cauſes of things, and power of their prophane gods, they held a poſition likewiſe that the world was eternall

and that the elements of fire and water preuailed one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">The Equites, an other ſort of people.</note> an other by turnes: An other ſort of religious perſons and which were moſt deuoute of all others, were thoſe they called Equites, and they, when they fell into any dangerous diſeaſe, or any other perill of their liues, would offer for the recouery of their health, or auoiding of imminent danger, a humaine ſacrifice, which ſacrifice muſt euer bee ſolemnized by the aſſiſtance of ſome one of the Druides: Some others of that ſect had great huge Images made hallow and couered with twigges, into the concauity whereof they would put men aliue, and then ſet fire about the Image vntill all were conſumed away.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment inflicted vpon theeues and offenders, they eſteemed moſt gratefull and acceptable to their gods, and all thoſe ancient Gaules held the god <hi>Mercury</hi> in great veneration, as firſt founder and inuentor of all arts and miſteries, the chiefe guide and conductor in all their trauels, and very propitions vnto them in trafficke and trading. All the ſpoiles they tooke in the warres, they vowed and conſecrated vnto <hi>Mars</hi> for their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obtained, ſo as in many Cities you might ſee great heapes of warlike ſpoiles laide together, and if any one ſtole any part of the prey to his owne purſe, hee was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely puniſhed.</p>
               <p>The Gaules perſwaded themſelues that they were the of ſpring of <hi>Pluto</hi> the god of riches, and therefore they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the beginning of their feaſts the night before the feaſt day, ſuppoſing that night to bee conſecrated vnto <hi>Dis:</hi> The men ſuffered not their children once to come into their ſights, before they were growne to mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, that they were able to manage armes, holding it

vnfitting and abſurde, that the ſonne while hee is a childe ſhould approach neere the preſence of his father: The husbands looke how much money they receiued with their wiues in portion, ſo much did they adde vnto it out of their owne ſtocke, and all the increaſe that came of that coyne, was reſerued and kept for him or her that was ſuruiuer.</p>
               <p>The husbands had power and authority of life and death, as well ouer their wiues as ouer their children: and <note place="margin">Husbands had power to kil their wiues.</note> if any mans wife were conuicted of witch-craft or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, ſhe was put to death by her husbands neighbours and friends, either by fire, or by ſome other greeuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: In their funerals, all thoſe things which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed perſon held deere vnto him in his life time, yea the beaſts he loued beſt, were burned with him: and not much before the Country was conquered by <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> their ſeruants and retainers were burned with their Maiſters dead bodies.</p>
               <p>In their Cities (which were maruellous wel gouerned) a few of the moſt worthy and ſubſtantialeſt men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, ruled the reſt, hauing at the firſt one chiefe ruler ouer them, who continued his office for a yeere, and in warres they vſed likewiſe to appoint one to take the charge and command vpon him of al matters belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the warres.</p>
               <p>If any priuate perſon heard any thing ſpoken by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers touching the common-wealth, they were to make report thereof to the Magiſtrates, though ſome things they might conceale without danger. It was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any one to mutter any thing in ſecret of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth but in publike places, and hee that came laſt into the councel-houſe was put to death. If any factious
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:24800:192"/>
fellow raiſed any tumult or mutiny, there was ſent vnto him an officer with a ſword in his hand ready drawne, to proclaime ſilence, and if hee deſiſted not at the ſecond or third proclamation, the officer would curtaile ſo much of his cloake or caſſocke (thereby to put him to diſgrace) as the remnant that was left would ſerue him to no purpoſe. The chiefe Magiſtrates had golden maces carried before them, they wore chaines about their neckes and brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets on their armes. The common people wore ſhort cloakes, and in ſteed of coates a looſe garment ſlit on the one ſide, that would ſcarce couer halfe their buttocks: their wool is very rough, long and ſhaggy, ſo as their caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſockes they called <hi>(Lenae)</hi> were maruellous rugged and hairy.</p>
               <p>They tooke great delight in trimming &amp; dreſſing their haire; They be tal of ſtature and for the moſt part pale of complexion, and their armor and weapons are anſweara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the proportion of their bodies, for they wore long ſwords hanging at their right ſides, and long ſhields pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their ſpeares, wherewith they might couer their thighes, ſome of them alſo had bowes and were very good archers, but yet they vſed ſhooting more in fowling and birding, then in the warres, and few of them would goe into the field either with ſlings or clubs.</p>
               <p>They lay vpon the ground and eate their meate ſitting vpon ſtraw, the ſubſtance of their meate was either milke or fleſh, and eſpecially hogs-fleſh, for they haue ſuch ſtore of ſwine feeding in their fields, and ſo large, ſo ſtrong, and ſo ſwift, that ſtrangers that know not their nature, are as fearefull of them, and in as much daunger as if they were wolues. They haue ſheepe in as great aboundance as ſwine, whereof when they bee fed and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:24800:193"/>
powdred they ſend many to Rome and diuers other parts of Italy and there ſell them.</p>
               <p>Their buildings &amp; dwelling houſes were made of wood in proportion of ſhels, beeing very large with many ſpars or rafters. They bee naturally cruell and ſimple with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and in the warres more valiant then politike, and much more addicted to follow the warres then husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry: The French women be exceeding fruitful, in ſo much as <hi>Gallia Belgica</hi> alone, ſent vnto the warres at one voyage, aboue three hundred thouſand fighting men: when they haue had any victory they bee wonderfull ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and as much amazed after an ouerthrow: Their cuſtome was when the battaile was ended and the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors departed the field, to cut off the heads of their van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed foes, and to hange them at there horſe neckes, and ſo to carry them home, and there to ſticke them vpon poles, for a ſpectacle vnto others. But the heads of worthy and renowned ſouldiors (if any ſuch were ſlaine) they would ſeaſon with odors of Cedar-tree, and keepe them for ſtrangers to looke vpon, not ſuffering them to bee ranſommed for their weight in gold: The ancient Country guiſe was to weare chaines of gold, bracelets and garments ſpangled with gold.</p>
               <p>In their Diuinations their manner was to ſtrike a man (ordained for that purpoſe) vpon the backe, and then by his impatience and manner of affliction in his death to Iudge of future euents. They had other ſorts of humaine ſacrifices alſo, for ſome they would ſhoot to death and then hang them vpon gibbets within their Temples, and ſome of them would make a great huge Image, and put therein men, wood, ſheepe and diuers other ſorts of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and ſo ſacrifice them altogether.</p>

The Frenchmen by reaſon of their continuall labour, and exerciſe, were wont to bee very macilent, leane and lanck bellyed, for they were ſo carefull to auoyde all pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering and exceſſe, that if any young mans belly did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow his girdle, he was openly puniſhed.</p>
               <p>But at this day the French-men by reaſon of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, <note place="margin">The latter cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the French.</note> conuerſation, and continuall acquaintance with the Romaines, are greatly altered from what they were, and their manners much bettered: for they bee now moſt ardent profeſſors of the true Religion, and all vnder the gouernement of one King. Their marriages be ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed after the Italian rites: they be very ſtudious in all the liberall arts, and in diuinity eſpecially, which is well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by the great multitude of Students in the citty of Paris, which is now the moſt famous and renownedſt Vniuerſitie in all Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>The lawes in France be executed by Magiſtrates, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the kings: their horſmen in time of warres go al in compleat armor, and their footmen in light harneſſe: they haue many good archers that ſhoote well in long bowes, and their bowes be not made of Cornell trees like vnto their bowes in Scythia, and in all the Eaſt countrey, but of Yew, or ſome other hard wood: their Ordinance is caried along with their armies in carts, &amp; they fight more rather in order, one ſeconding another, then in troupes, &amp; with more courage &amp; cruelty, then skil or policy, although their cunning be ſufficient to manage their military buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Their Embaſſadors to denounce wars, or treate of peace, they call Heralds, who bee loyall ſubiects to their Soueraign. The French-men be very religious, their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of mighty power and dignitie, and all the Clergie in general of high reuerence &amp; veneration: in their diuine
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:24800:194"/>
ceremonies they vſe much ſinging, by reaſon whereof the ſtudie of muſicke is in a manner peculiar to that nation: Their faſhions in their apparell and ſhooes be much alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our age: for (ſayth <hi>Sabellicus)</hi> when I was a boy, all the Courtiers and Gentlemen of France (the Clergie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted) wore ſhort cloakes with ſleeues, that would hardly reach to their mid thighes, pleated from the top to the bottome, and ſtuffed or quilted about the ſhoulders. Their ſhooes were tipped on the ſnoutes with thin horns, halfe a foote long, ſuch as are pictured in arras and tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie: and their bonnets which they called <hi>(Bireta)</hi> were high and ſharpe towards the Crowne: but all theſe auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions be now laid away, and new fangles inuented: for the ſhooes they now weare be broad-noſed, (like a Beares foot) and narrow heeled, and their garments bee much more looſe &amp; long then before they were, reaching down to the calues of their legges, with looſe ſleeues ſlit on one ſide, and laced all ouer with lace of diuers colours, ſet on lattiſe-wiſe: their hats bee for the moſt part redde and very large, but their bonnets called <hi>(Bireta)</hi> bee much bigger then their ordinary hats, and very vnfitting for their heads; butotherwiſe, were it not for theſe vnhandſome hats, no nation could compare with them for neatneſſe and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantneſſe in apparell. And now of late yeares their maner of attire is much imitated by the Italians, who do wholly follow the French faſhion, manifeſtly preſaging thereby what afterwards came to paſſe. The women be not ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable &amp; fickle in following euery new faſhion, as the men be, but keepe their old faſhion ſtill. <hi>Baptista Mantuanus</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> maketh a deſcription of France to this effect:

               <p>They aſſembled thither fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> each ſeueral city of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, all ſuch as were skilfull in their lawes and cuſtoms, (beeing thereto choſen aforehand) to do equitie and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice vnto all that would bring their cauſes before them by way of appeale: but becauſe this inſtitution was at the firſt vncertaine, and not well ſetled: the ſeate of this Court of Parlament was afterwards tranſlated from Lyons, and is now eſtabliſhed at Paris, and certaine Iudges appointed to heare, and finally to determine all appeales whatſoeuer: of theſe Iudges there be foure-ſcore which haue annuall ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends out of the Kings Exchequer, for their better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. They be diuided into foure Courts, and euery Court aboue other, and each hath his proper Preſidents, or chiefe Iuſtices.</p>

                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:24800:195"/>
In the firſt Court or Chamber (as they call it) ſit ſoure chiefe Iudges or Preſidents, and thirtie Councellors or Aſſiſtants, and theſe heare all complaints, controuerſies, and delayes, and ſet downe what is Law in euery caſe: and if the matters be light, or lately begun, they end and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them.

If in handling controuerſies any great difficulty ariſe, it muſt be decided by the aſſembly of all the Iudges and Councellors of euery Court together, which happeneth oftentimes in matters propoſed by the King, touching the gouernment of the Commonwealth: for no law can be throughly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed without the conſent of this Senate or Parlament-houſe.</p>
               <p>In this Parlament the Peeres of France, and other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Requeſts that be the kings fauorites, may ſit as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants vnto the Iudges, and their places be next vnto the Preſidents of the firſt Court or Chamber: but all matters touching the king, or any of the Peeres be defined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Peeres themſelues, and the Iudges of the firſt Court.</p>

If you require gold, ſiluer, or pretious ſtones there they are in aboundance, if mynes of Iron, and ſundry other mettals, you ſhall find no defect; if wines, it giueth place to none; and as for oyles, it excelleth all other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Europe: beſides that, they haue ſuch ſtore of ſalt, as they neuer boyle it, but dig it out of the earth in full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Yea there is no part of their ground (be it neuer ſo barren) but it yeeldeth increaſe of one thing or other the heate of the Sunne is not there ſo violent as in Affricke, nor be they toſſed with ſuch continuall ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous winds, as France is, but there is an equall tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the heauens, and wholeſomnes of the ayre ouer
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:24800:197"/>
all the Region, it beeing greatly waſted with marine winds, without ſuch foggie miſts and infectious exhalations as proceed from fennes and mooriſh grounds. There is great plenty of hempe, flaxe and broome, the pill or skin wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſerueth to tye vp their vines: and it affordeth more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion then any other countrie beſides. The currents of their riuers be not ſo ſwift and violent, as they thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hurtfull, but gentle and mild to water and manure their fields and medowes, and the armes of the Ocean ſea which adioyne vnto them, affoord great ſtore of fiſh: and yet for no one thing was Spaine more commended in times paſt, then for the ſwiftneſſe of their horſes, whereof grew this fiction, That the Spaniſh horſes were conceiued of the winds.</p>
               <p>Spaine taketh her beginning at the Pyrenaean hilles, and winding by <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars, extendeth to the Northerne Ocean, ſo as all places contained within that compaſſe, may iuſtly be ſaid to be of Spaine. The breadth of Spaine, (as <hi>Appianus</hi> writeth) is ten thouſand <hi>ſtadia,</hi> &amp; the length much anſwerable to the breadth: it ioyneth vnto France only at the Pyrenaean hils, and on al other ſides it is inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſea: it is diſtinguiſhed and knowne by three names, Tarragon, Bethica, and Luſitania: Tarragon (the chiefe citties whereof were called Pallantia, and Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, now called Soria) at the one end ioyneth vnto France, and vnto Bethica and Luſitania at the other: The Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean ſea runneth by the South-ſide thereof, and vpon the North it lyeth oppoſite to the Ocean: the other two prouinces be diuided by the riuer Anas, ſo as Bethica (the chiefe citties whereof were Hiſpalis and Corduba) looketh Weſt-ward into the Atlanticke ſea, and into the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean vpon the South: Luſitania lyeth oppoſite onely to
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:24800:197"/>
the Ocean, the ſide of it vnto the Northerne Ocean, and vnto the Weſtern at the end: the city Emerita being once the chiefe Cittie of that Prouince.</p>
               <p>Spaine was firſt called Iberia, of the riuer Iberus, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Spaine why ſo called.</note> that Heſperia, of <hi>Heſperus</hi> the brother of <hi>Atlas,</hi> and laſtly, it was named Hiſpania, of Hiſpalis now called Sibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia. Their bodies bee very apt to indure both hunger and labour, and their minds euer prepared for death: they bee very ſparing and ſtrict both in their diet and euery thing elſe, and they be much more deſirous of warres then of peace. So much, as if warres be wanting abroade, they wil grow to ciuill diſſention and home-bred garboiles among themſelues: They will ſuffer torments euen vnto death, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than reueile a thing committed to their ſecrecie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more care of their credits, and truſt repoſed in them, then of their liues. They be maruellous nimble and ſwift of pace, and of an vnquiet and turbulent diſpoſition: their horſes be both ſpeedie and warlike, and their armes more deare vnto them then their bloud.</p>
               <p>They furniſh not their tables with daintie and delicate meates, vnleſſe vppon feſtiuall dayes, and they learned of the Romanes (after the ſecond Carthaginian warres) to waſh themſelues in cold water: but for all this in ſo many ages as haue paſſed ſince their firſt originall, they neuer had any notable or famous Captaine, that euer atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any great Conqueſt, but <hi>Viriatus</hi> onely, and hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed held the Romaines in play ſome ten yeares with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſucceſſe of fortune.</p>
               <p>The women diſpatch all buſineſſe both within dores and without, &amp; the men imploy themſelues either in wars, or to purloyning &amp; ſtealing from others: they weare ſhort black garments made of rough woll like goats haire: their ſhields
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:24800:198"/>
or bucklers which they vſe for their defence in the warres, be little ones made of nerues and ſinewes, which they will weeld with ſuch agilitie, as they auoid all dangers both of darts, arrowes, and hand-blowes. Their darts bee all of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and crooked, their helmets of braſſe and creſted, and their ſwords of Iron, and as broade as the palme of ones hand; wherewith in a troupe or croude, they will make great ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>They haue a deuiſe to make Iron very tough and ſtrong for weapons, which is, to beate and hammer it into thinne plates or ſheetes, and then to lay thoſe ſheetes in the ground ſo long, till the weakeſt of the Iron bee ruſted away, and none left but what is maruellous pure &amp; ſtrong, and of this they make their ſwords, and other weapons for the warres, which be ſo ſubſtantiall and good, as neither ſhield nor helmet can withſtand them, but that they kill all before them: and of theſe ſwords euery one commonly carrieth two. Thoſe which haue any regiment in the camp, after they haue eſcaped the conflict on horſebacke, forſake their horſes, and helpe the footmen, they will fling their darts a great way from them, &amp; that with great skil, &amp; they will indure the fight a long time, &amp; their bodies be ſo nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quicke, as they can eaſily fly from their foes, and ſet vpon them againe as occaſion is offered They be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of wars, that for the leaſt cauſe that is, they will ſwarme together by troupes, and ſing for ioy when they incounter their foes.</p>
               <p>In peaceable times they practiſe ſinging and dancing; for which exerciſe they be very light and actiue: towards their enemies and euil perſons they practiſe great cruelty, but to ſtrangers much bounty and humanity: for they bee ſo forward to intertaine ſtrangers and trauellers, as they
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:24800:198"/>
will euery one ſtriue to exceed other in courteſie, with a kind of emulation, eſteeming thoſe moſt worthy of honor and in greateſt fauour with God, that haue moſt ſtrangers to accompany them: The women weare yron chaines or iewels about their neckes, with crooked or bending creſts, that compaſſe the head from the necke behind ouer the crowne, and ſo hang downe vpon their fore-heads, vnto which they faſten their veiles when they pleaſe to maske their faces, which they account a great ornament vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>In like manner in ſome part a little ſtrake of a wheele co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth their heads, and is bound to the ſinewes in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the head, and reacheth downe to the lappes of their eares, waxing, by little and litle, ſharper and narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er towards the top. Some ſhaue off all the haire of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of their heades, and ſome others haue a pillar of a foot long, ſtanding vpright vpon their foreheads, to which they faſten their haire, and then couer it with a blacke cap or bonnet. They feed of diuers ſorts of fleſh, and make drinke of hony, whereof the country hath ſufficient ſtore, and ſuch wines as are wanting in their owne, are brought vnto them out of other countries: and although they bee very neate and cleanly in their diet, yet is it ſtrange to ſee, what a beaſtly and filthy cuſtome they generally obſerue, which is, to waſh their whole bodies, yea and to rub their teeth with vrine, accounting it very good and wholeſome for their bodies. But (to omit nothing that may bring vs to a perfect knowledge and vnderſtanding of the country) all the Region now called Spaine, was heretofore diuided into the further and nearer Spaine; the nearer Spaine is that which is now called Tarragon, extending to the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaean hils: &amp; the further Spaine by reaſon of the length, is diuided into two Prouinces, Bethica, and Luſitania:

It was firſt called Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania, (according to <hi>Pliny)</hi> of <hi>Luſus</hi> the father of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Lyſa</hi> his luxurious and diſſolute companion.</p>
               <p>Of all Spaniards, the Portugals bee moſt valiant, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, actiue and nimble, and through their extraordinarie skill in nauigation haue found out more ſtrange and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne lands, than any people in the world againe: Their ſhields which they vſe in the warres be two foote broade, and made crooked towards the vpper end where they hold their hands, (for other handle they haue none) and theſe will they vſe with ſuch agility, as they will thereby eaſily auoide both arrowes, darts, and hand-blowes: They haue alſo ſhort ſwords or poynards hanging by their ſides, and ſome haue breſt-plates made of linnen cloth, and yet but few weare other priuie coats or creſted helmets, but onely ſuch as be made of nerues or ſinewes.</p>
               <p>They be very skilfull in darting, &amp; can caſt them a great way from them, they continue the battell long, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their nimblenes, quicke agility, and lightneſſe,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:24800:199"/>
they will eaſily flie from their enemie, and againe purſue him, as makes moſt for their aduantage: foot-men haue their legs harneſſed, and euery one a bundle of darts, and ſome carrie Iauelins pointed or headed with braſſe. There be ſome Portingals dwelling neere the riuer Durius, which are ſaid to liue like vnto the Spartanes: theſe vſe two kind of oyntments, and ſulphury or fierie ſtones to warm them withall, and all cold things are waſhed. They eate all one kind of meate, which is wholeſome, though it be homely: when they ſacrifice, they cut not the beaſt in peeces, but opening his belly, they looke into the bowels or garbage of the oblation, as alſo into the veines of his ſide, and by handling of them coniecture of things to come. Another kind of diuination they haue by mens intrals, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly captiues; in doing whereof they firſt couer the man or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for that purpoſe, with a caſſocke, and then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur or Southſayer maketh an inciſion in the bottome of his belly, and by his fall propheſieth of future euents, which done, they cutte off the right hands, and offer them to their gods.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Portingals which inhabite on hils fare but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they drinke water, and lye vpon the bare ground: They ſuffer their haire to grow long, and to hang downe about their ſhoulders dangling like women, and they fight with Myters vpon their heades, in ſtead of helmets. Their dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt meate is bucke goates, which they alſo ſacrifice to <hi>Mars,</hi> as they do captiues and horſes.</p>
               <p>They haue alſo (in imitation of the Greekes) their Hecatombes, which are ſacrifices made with an hundred beaſts of all ſorts, and (as <hi>Pindarus</hi> is of opinion) they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and offer euery hundreth thing likewiſe. They haue their Gymnick playes, (which are ſo called, for that they be
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:24800:200"/>
done by naked men) and theſe playes are exerciſed with weapons, horſes, plummets of Leade, called the Whirle-about, running and diſordered fighting: and ſometimes they diuide themſelues into parts, and fight one ſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another.</p>
               <p>Theſe mountainous Luſitanians feede two parts of the yeare vppon Acornes, which when they haue dried and ground into meale, they make bread thereof and ſo eat it. In ſtead of wine (wherof thoſe parts are barren) they haue drinke made of barley, and that they euer drinke new, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as it is brewed.</p>
               <p>When kinsfolke and friends are aſſembled together to banquet, in ſtead of oyle they vſe butter, and haue ſeates made in the walles for them to ſit in; where euery one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his ſeate according to his worth or grauitie, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in their drinking, they vſe to ſing and dance after mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke; leaping and capering for ioy, as the women in Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica do, when they ioyne all their hands together, and ſo fall a dauncing: Their apparell (for the moſt part) is black caſſockes, which they will wrap about them, and ſo lye themſelues downe to ſleepe vppon ſtraw or litter: They eate their meate in earthen platters, as the French men do, and women weare for the moſt part red garments.</p>
               <p>In ſteade of money they vſe thinne plates of ſiluer, or elſe exchange and barter one commoditie for another. Thoſe which are condemned to dye, are ſtoned to death, and Parricides are carried from out the confines of their hilles, or beyond ſome riuer, and there couered and ouer-whelmed with ſtones. They contract matrimonie after the manner of the Greekes, and (according to the cuſtome of the Aegyptians) bring thoſe which are ſick into the ſtreets, to the end that thoſe which haue beene troubled with the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:24800:200"/>
like griefes themſelues, may ſhew them how they were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And theſe be the cuſtoms vſed in thoſe mountainous and northerne countries of Spaine.</p>
               <p>It is reported, that thoſe Spaniards which inhabite the vtmoſt parts of Portingall, when they be taken priſoners by their enemies, and readie to bee hanged, they will ſing for ioy: That the men there giue dowers to their wiues, and make their ſiſters their heires, who do alſo marrv their own brothers. And that they be ſo barbarous and bloudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, that mothers will murther their owne children, and children their parents, rather then that they ſhould fall into the hands of their enemies. They do ſacrifice to a god, whoſe name is vnknowne: when the Moone is in the full, they will watch all night euery one at his owne dore, dancing and skipping all the night long. The women haue as good part of all profits and increaſe as men haue, for they practiſe husbandry, and be obedient and ſeruiceable to men, when they themſelues are with child.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards make poyſon of a kind of herbe much like vnto Perſley, which offendeth not vppon a ſodaine, but by litle and litle, and this they alwaies haue in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for any one that wrongs them, in ſo much as it is ſayd to be proper to the Spaniards to be great poyſoners, and that their cuſtome is alſo to offer themſelues to bee ſlaine and ſacrificed for thoſe to whome they are newly reconciled.</p>

                  <p>And to the firſt part, I may ſay vnto you, that from my yeeres of vnderſtanding, ſith I firſt had conſideration of my ſelfe, to bee borne a ſeruitor of almighty God, I happily choſe this kinde of life, in the which I yet liue, which I aſſure you, for my owne part, hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto beſt contented my ſelfe, and, I truſt, hath beene moſt acceptable to God. From the which, if either ambition of high eſtate offered to mee in marriage by the pleaſure and appointment of my Prince, whereof I haue ſome records in this preſence (as you our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer well knew) or if the eſchewing the danger of

mine enemies, or the avoyding of the perrill of death, whoſe meſſinger, or rather a continuall watch-man, the Princes indignation was no little time daily before mine eyes, by whoſe meanes, although I know, or iuſtly may ſuſpect, yet I will not now vtter, or if the whole cauſe were in my ſiſter her ſelfe, I will not now burthen her therewith, becauſe I will not charge the dead: if any of theſe, I ſay, could haue drawne, or diſwaded mee from this kinde of life, I had not now remained in this eſtate wherein you ſee mee, but ſo conſtant haue I alwaies continued in this determination, although my youth and wordes may ſeeme to ſome hardly to agree together, yet is it moſt certaine and true, that at this day I doe ſtand free from any other meaning, that either I haue had in times paſt, or haue at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with which trade of life I am ſo throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that I truſt in God, who hath hitherto therein preſerued, and led mee by the hand, will not of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſuffer mee to goe alone.</p>

neuer agree together.

And albeit it might pleaſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie GOD to continue mee ſtill in this minde, to liue out of the eſtate of marriage, yet is it not to bee feared, but hee will ſo worke in my heart, and in your wiſdomes, as good prouiſion by his helpe may bee made in conuenient, whereby the Realme ſhall not remaine and ſtand deſtitute of an heire to ſucceed mee, that may bee a fit Gouernour, and peraduenture more beneficiall to the Realme and generality, then ſuch off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring as may come of mee.</p>

                  <hi>Iames</hi> the ſixth King of Scotland, and of great Britan France and Ireland the firſt.</p>
               <p>To omit Ireland an Iſland vnder our Kings dominion, the people wherof of late yeeres haue growne to more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uility, by conuerſing with other nations, and to ſpeake ſomething more in perticular of this Iſland as now it is, wee may deuide the whole Iſland of Britanny into three partes, that is to ſay England, Wales and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>Scotland the North of this Iſland, hauing for a long time beene a Kingdome of it ſelfe ſeuered and diſtinct from England, is now by this happy vnion (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) made one againe with England, and both of them gouerned by one King and Monarch.</p>
               <p>This Country in reſpect of England is very barren and mountanous, and the Inhabitants, eſpecially the vulgar ſort, farre more rude and barbarous: their language in effect is all one with the Engliſh, the Northerne Scots excepted, which ſpeake and liue after the Iriſh faſhion, nor is their any difference in their religion, but all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and controuerſies bee there determined by the ciuill law, as in moſt other Countries, for with our common lawes of England they are little acquainted.</p>
               <p>Wales an other part of this Iſland, and the proper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the Britans, expelled thither out of England by the Engliſhmen, was gouerned by Princes of their owne bloud vntil the raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who ſlue <hi>Lhewellen ap Griffith,</hi> the laſt Prince of the Britiſh race, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited that Prouince vnto the Kingdome of England, and forced the Inhabitants to ſweare fealty and alleagiance vnto <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Carnaruan</hi> his eldeſt ſonne, whom hee made Prince of Wales: After the deceaſe of <hi>Edward</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:24800:208"/>
the firſt, this title of Prince of Wales lay dormant du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the raigne of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and was againe reuiued by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, who created his ſonne <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Blacke Prince,</hi> Duke of Cornwall, Earle of Cheſter and Prince of Wales, and euer ſince hath this title beene duely conferred vnto the eldeſt ſons of the Kings of England, for the time being, and now laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and but lately by our dread ſoueraigne Lord King <hi>Iames,</hi> vnto <hi>Henry Fredericke</hi> his eldeſt ſon, the hopefull iſſue of a happie father, borne certes (as euidently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his minority) to bee a perfect mirror of chiualry, for the aduancement of our country and common wealth, and the ſubuerſion of his enemies.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of Wales, though they bee much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, yet do they not equall the Engliſh in ciuility, nor their ſoile in fertility: Their whole Country conſiſteth of twelue ſhires (that is to ſay) Angleſea, Brecknocke, Cardigan, Carmarden, Carnaruon, Denbigh, Flint, Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan, Merionneth, Mongomerry, Pembroke, and Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor-ſhire, and foure biſhops Seas (to wit) the Biſhopricke of Saint Dauids, the Biſhoppricke of Landaffe, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopprick of Bangor, and the Biſhoppricke of Saint A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphe. They haue a language peculiar to themſelues, yet do they liue vnder the ſelf ſame lawes the Engliſhmen do, but for becauſe that part of the Iſland is far remote from London, the Kings ſeat and chiefe tribunal of Iudgement, where the lawes are executed and pleas heard for all the Realme, and by reaſon of their different language, the King by his commiſſion maketh one of his nobles his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty or lieutenant vnder him, to rule in thoſe parts and to ſee the peace maintained, and Iuſtice miniſtred indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently vnto all. This gouernor is called the Lord preſident

of Wales, who for the eaſe and good of the country, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate with one Iudge and diuers Iuſtices, holdeth there his Tearmes and Seſſions for the hearing and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of cauſes within VVales and the Marches.

               <p>Now hauing thus farre ſpoken of the Country in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, it reſteth to ſay ſomething with like breuity of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ſorts of people that inhabite the ſame, their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in courſes of law, as well ſpirituall as temporall, and their ſeuerall Courts. The whole number of Engliſh men may therefore be diuided into theſe foure ranckes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of people, that is to ſay, Gentlemen or Noblemen, Cittizens, Yeomen, and artificers or labourers.</p>
               <p>Of Gentlemen or Nobility there be two ſorts, to wit, the king himſelfe, the Prince, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Vicounts and Barons. And this ſort of Gentlemen are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nobilitas maior,</hi> and the ſecond ſort of Gentlemen or Nobility, which are alſo called <hi>nobilitas minor,</hi> conſiſteth of Knights, Eſquires, and priuat Gentlemen, into which ranke of gentry are added Students of the lawes and ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the Vniuerſities: next vnto the Gentry are cittizens whoſe fame and authority (for the moſt part) extendeth no
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:24800:214"/>
further than their owne citties and boroughes wherin they liue, and beare rule, ſauing that ſome few of them haue voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in our high Senate of Parlament: The third order or degree are the Yeomanrie, which are men that liue in the country vppon competent liuings of their owne, haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to do their buſineſſe for them, ſerue vpon Iuries and Inqueſts, and haue generally more employment in the gouernement of the common-wealth, then citizens haue. And the laſt and loweſt ſort of our people are artificers or labourers, which though they be rude and baſe in reſpect of our gentry, yet are they much improoued and bettered by conuerſing with Gentlemen, cittizens, and yeomen: ſo as if thoſe authors were now liuing, that haue written ſo contemptuouſly of all eſtates of our people vnder the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of gentry, and ſaw the ciuilitie now generally pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed amongſt moſt of vs, they would not for ſome few of the raſcalitie, cenſure and condemne all as baſe and ignoble.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſeuerall ſorts and degrees of people in our kingdome, may more briefly bee deuided into two Orders or ranckes, that is to ſay, the Nobilitie and the Commons: vnder the title of Nobilitie are comprehended all the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitas maior,</hi> together with the Biſhops that haue place in the vpper houſe of Parlament: and by the commons are meant the <hi>nobilitas minor,</hi> cittizens, yeomen, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who by common conſent elect from amongſt them Knights and Burgeſſes to poſſeſſe the lower houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, who haue their voices there in the name of the whole multitude of commons, for the making and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of lawes, ordonances, and ſtatutes.</p>
               <p>The Parlament therfore is the higheſt &amp; moſt abſolute Seſſions or iudiciall Senate in the whole kingdome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:24800:214"/>
of the King himſelfe: and the Lords ſpirituall and temporall in their own perſons, which is the higher houſe, and the whole body of the commons repreſented by the Knights and Burgeſſes lawfully elected, and thoſe are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the lower houſe.</p>
               <p>In this high Court of Parlament are ſuch new lawes made and ordained, and ſuch old ſtatutes abrogated and annihilated in part or in all, as are agre<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> vppon by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both houſes, and confirmed by the King, ſo as whatſoeuer is there decreed and conſtituted, is inuiolably to be obſerued, as eſtabliſhed by the generall aſſembly of the whole kingdome.</p>
               <p>There be three manner of wayes by one cuſtome of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, whereby definitiue iudgements are giuen, by act of Parlament, by battell, and by great aſſiſe. The manner of giuing Iudgement in the Parlament in matters depending betwixt Prince and ſubiect, or partie and party, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lands and inheritances, is by preferring of billes into the houſes of Parlament, and by the allowance or diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance thereof: but ſuch billes are ſeldome receiued, for that the Parlament is chiefly ſummoned and aſſembled, for the ſetling and eſtabliſhing of matters for the good of the King and common-wealth, &amp; not to buſie themſelues in priuate quarrels.</p>
               <p>The triall by battell likewiſe, though it bee not vtterly abrogated, and altogether annihilated, yet is it quite growne out of vſe at this day.</p>
               <p>So as the moſt vſuall manner of Iudgement, is by the verdict of twelue men, lawfully impaneled and ſworne to giue a true verdict concerning the matter in queſtion, be it for life or land, or any thing tending to the hurt or good of any ſubiect whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:24800:215"/>
Theſe twelue men ought to be <hi>Legales homines,</hi> as wee terme them, that is, men of good quality, fame, and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and they are to giue their verdict according to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, before a lawfull Iudge, in their Seſſions, at termes and times vſually appointed for thoſe purpoſes. And for that there be many ſuites of diuers natures, therefore bee the trials therof in diuers courts and before diuers Iudges, whereof the chiefeſt bench or tribunall ſeate of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the Kings bench; ſo called, for that the Kings of England haue ſat there the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in perſon, and this Court is chiefly for pleas of the Crowne, the Iudges whereof bee called Iuſtices of the Kings bench, and they be commonly foure or fiue in number, whereof one is head, and therfore called the Lord chiefe Iuſtice of the Kings bench, and by that place he is alſo Lord Chiefe Iuſtice of England.</p>
               <p>Next vnto the Kings bench, is the Court of Common pleas, which is for all matters touching lands and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts betwixt partie and partie: and of this Court be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe foure or fiue Iudges, the chiefeſt whereof is called the Lord chiefe Iuſtice of the Common-pleas, and this court may well be called the Common-pleas, as being the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt place for the exerciſe of the Common law. And there may none plead at the Common pleas barre, but Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants at the law onely; wheras in all other Courts, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors that be called to the barre may plead their Clyents cauſes, as well as Sergeants.</p>
               <p>The third Court for practiſe of the common law, is the Exchequer, where all cauſes are heard that belong to the Kings Treaſury. The Iudges of this Court are the Lord high Treaſurer of England, the Chancelor of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, the Lord chiefe Baron, and three or foure other Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, which be called Barons of the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:24800:215"/>
Beſides theſe three Courts of the common law, and the court of the Councell for the Marches of Wales, whereof I haue ſpoken before, there is a Court for the North part of England, which is likewiſe called the Councell, hauing a Preſident, Iuſtices and aſſiſtants, as in the Councell of Wales, and the ſame forme of proceeding. And for the more eaſe and quiet of the ſubiect, the King by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſendeth the Iudges and Barons of the Exchequer, twiſe a yeare into euery ſeuerall County of the countrie, as well to ſee the lawes executed againſt malefactors, as for the triall and determining of cauſes depending betwixt partie and party.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Seſſions are vſually called the Aſſiſes or Goale deliuery, and their manner of proceedings, is by Iurors who are to giue their verdicts according to euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
               <p>And for becauſe the time of theſe Iudges commiſſion, is ouer ſhort to determine all matters, that may ariſe in halfe a yeare, the Iuſtices of peace in their ſeuerall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, haue their Seſſions likewiſe, which be kept foure times in the yeare, and be therefore called the quarter Seſſions; in which Seſſions are heard and determined all pettie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for the more eaſe of the Iudges in their circuits.</p>
               <p>And for the better maintenance of peace in euery part of the Realm, there be diuers other petty Courts, as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Courts, hundred Courts, towne Courts, Leets, Court Barons, and ſuch like: all which hold plea according to the courſe of the common law.</p>
               <p>Next vnto theſe Courts of common law is the Court of Star-chamber, which is the court of the kings Councell: &amp; therin ſit as Iudges the L. Chancelor as chiefe, the L. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, and the reſt of the priuy Councel both ſpirituall and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall, to gether with the chiefe Iuſtices of both benches.
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:24800:216"/>
And in this court be cenſured all criminall cauſes, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, forgerie, couſenage, ryots, maintenance, and ſuch like. The court of Wards and Liueries is next, which is a court of no long continuance, being firſt ordained by <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 8. the matters that are determinable in that court, are as touching wards and wardſhips: and the Iudges are the Maſter of the wards and liueries, the Atturney of the court of wards, and other officers and aſſiſtants.</p>
               <p>Then is there the Admirals court, which is only for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of miſdemeanors done at ſea, the Iudges of which court be the Lord high Admirall of England, and a Iudge, with other officers.</p>
               <p>The Duchie court, which is a court for the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of matters depending within the Duchy of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, wherein be Iudges, the Chancelor of the Duchie, and the Atturney.</p>
               <p>And a late erected court called the court of the Queens reuenues, for the deciding of controuerſies amongſt the Queenes tenants.</p>
               <p>Next vnto theſe, are the courts of Equity, which are, the Chancery, and the court of Requeſts. The court of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, which is commonly called the court of conſcience, is chiefly for the mitigation of the rigor of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawe, wherein the Lord high Chancelor of England is chiefeſt Iudge and moderator, to whom are ioyned as aſſiſtants, the M. of the Rolles, and certaine graue Doctors of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill law, which are vſually called Maſters of the Chancery.</p>
               <p>The court of Requeſts is much like to the Chancery, and is chiefly for the kings ſeruants: the Iudges wherof, are the Maſters of Requeſts, which bee alwaies reuerent men, and well ſeen in the ciuill law: and one of them is euer atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on the King to receiue ſupplications, and to anſwer
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:24800:216"/>
them according to the Kings pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus paſſed ouer the ſeueral courts of common law, the courts of Equity, and thoſe which are of a mixt nature, betwixt the common &amp; ciuill law, I wil only name the ſpirituall courts, the chiefeſt wherof are theſe:</p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt principal, is the conuocation of the Clergy, which is a Synod of the chiefeſt of the Clergie of the whole Realme, held only in Parlament time, in a place called the Conuocation houſe, where cannons are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for church-gouernment. And this court may be called a generall Councell: next vnto which are the particular Synods of both Prouinces, Canterbury and York, and are called prouinciall Synods. Then is there the Archb. of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburies court, called the Arches: the court of Audience: the Prerogatiue court: the court of Faculties: &amp; the court of Peculiars; with many other courts in each ſeuerall Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

There bee other Iſlands alſo in the Mediterranean ſea towards the Weſt, which of the Greekes bee called Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſiae, becauſe the people thereof goe naked, but of the <note place="margin">The Gymneſiae or Baleares.</note> Romans, and by the Inhabitants themſelues, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Baleares, of ſlinging or caſting of ſtones, becauſe they bee more expert in that excerciſe, then any other people.

Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there are in farre more eſtimation then men, in ſo much as if a woman bee taken priſoner, they will ranſome her with three or foure men.</p>
                  <p>Their dwellings are in hollow caues, made in ſteepe rockes, which are their onely couering and defence for their bodies: And they are ſo farre out of loue with gold and ſiluer, as they forbid it to bee brought into their Iſland, ſuppoſing that by wanting money, they are in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from all plots of treaſon: And therefore at ſuch time as they ſerued in the Carthaginian warres, they brought home nothing with them, but wine and women, which they bought with the money they receiued for pay.

                  <p>This done and the boate lanched out, thoſe maritine Aethiopians are ſaid to keepe that day holy, and to doe ſacrifice to the ſeas, praying for their good ſucceſſe, and that their expiation, may take good effect: When <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus</hi> and his companion were thus committed to the

mercy of the ſea, and had beene long toſſed in ſtormes and tempeſts, after foure monthes ſayling, they arriued into an Iſland in forme round, and in compaſſe about fiue thouſand ſtadia, into which when they were entred, ſome of the Inhabitants came to meete them, and ſome others runing towards them (being greatly amazed, and wondering at the comming of ſtrangers into their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland) receiued them very curteouſly, and bountifully of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them ſuch things as their country afforded.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of that Iſland, are nothing like to vs, either in ſtature or manners, for though they carry the ſame proportion of body and members, yet bee they farre taller then wee are, the moſt of them being aboue foure cubits hie, and notwithſtanding their exceeding height, their bones bee not ſolid like ours, but flexible like nerues or ſinewes, by which meanes they exceed vs in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility and nimbleneſſe of body, and they are ſo ſtrong with al, as what euer they graſp with their hands can hardly bee wreſted from them. They be a very beautiful, comely and well featured people, and their skinnes ſo ſmooth and ſo ſlike, as you can hardly perceiue any wrinkle or haire vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any part of their bodies.</p>
                  <p>The hollowneſſe of their eares is much wider then ours, and their tongues as farre different, for nature (aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their ingenious wits and diſpoſitions) hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them with this extraordinary priuiledge, that their tongues are naturally ſo cleft and deuided from the roote to the tip, as they ſeeme to haue euery one two tongues, by which meanes they doe not onely ſpeake a humaine and intelligible voice, but they can truely imitate the chirping and ſinging of diuers birdes likewiſe, and that which is more ſtrange, they will talke and

conferre with two ſeuerall perſons, of ſeuerall matters, at one and the ſelfe ſame time, the one part of the tongue ſpeaking and giuing anſwere vnto one, and the other part to the other: The ayre is there very pure and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome all the yeere long (according to the ſaying of the poet, that apples, peares and grapes will rotte and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt vpon the trees and vines) and the daies and nights are euer of an equall length, and when the Sunne is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouer their heads, there is no ſhadow of any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South.</p>
                  <p>All the people of one ſtocke or kindred liue together, ſo as they exceed not the number of foure hundred: their chiefeſt abode is in the fields, for the earth naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth great ſtore of fruits, without tillage or trauell, in ſo much as through the vertue and quality of the Iſland, and temperature of the aire, they haue more then they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpend.</p>
                  <p>There be a kinde of reeds growing in that Iſland, which beare great ſtore of fruite like vnto white vetches, the fruite of theſe reedes they gather and ſprinkle with warme water, and then euery graine will bee as bigge as a Doues egge, which they afterwards grinde or beate into meale, and make thereof a kinde of bread, which in taſte is moſt pleaſant and delicious.</p>
                  <p>There bee many great ſprings, and fountaines of water, whereof ſome bee hot and ſerue for bathes, and to cure diſeaſes, and ſome cold, and withall maruelous ſweete and very phiſicall likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>They be a people very induſtrious and greedy of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and eſpecially of Aſtrology: Their letters which they vſe in ſence and ſignification, are eight and twentie, but their carecters are but ſeuen in number; for euery
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:24800:220"/>
caractar hath foure ſeuerall ſignifications or interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and they write not from the left hand towards the right, as wee doe, but beginne at the top and write downewards.</p>
                  <p>They be very long of life, the moſt of them liuing the full age of a hundred and fifty yeeres, and (for the moſt <note place="margin">They haue a time prefixed how long to liue.</note> part) without any ſickneſſe at all: and if any hap to fall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into an ague or any other infirmity of body, they are compelled by their law to die forth-with: They are alſo appointed how long they ſhall liue, which age when they haue accompliſhed, they willingly procure their owne deathes, ſome by one meanes and ſome by an other: There is an herbe in that countrie, vpon which if any one lay his body, hee falleth into a ſweete and delectable <note place="margin">An admirable herbe.</note> ſlumber, and in that ſheepe departeth his life without paine.</p>
                  <p>Mariages they haue none, but women bee there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, &amp; children equally loued of al and brought vp in common amongſt al, ſo as no man can ſay, this is my wife, or this is my child: yet oftentimes they take the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from their nurſes, leaſt mothers ſhould afterwards reknowledge their owne ſonnes: through which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it happeneth that (being voide of ambition and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, or curious deſire of that which nature denieth them) they liue quietly, and peaceably without ſedition or diſſention.

foure eyes, and yet haue but one belly or paunch that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth their meate, and round about their body grow many feete, with which they can goe backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at their pleaſure, the bloud of this beaſt is ſaid to be of a maruelous ſtrange efficacy, for if a body bee cut and mangled into peeces (ſo as it appeare to haue life in it): &amp; be anointed with the bloud of this beaſt, euery part wil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly grow to other, and the body will bee whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                  <p>Euery family or company that liue together, doe likewiſe breed and noriſh vp great birds of a diuerſe nature, and by thoſe birds they make triall how their children will prooue afterwards, for they ſet them when they bee very young vpon the backes of the birds, and if they ſit faſt when the birds biginne to flutter and flie, without feare of falling, thoſe children they bring vp, but if they ſhew themſelues daſtardly and timerous, they are reiected and thruſt away, and ſuffered to liue no longer, as beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for any excerciſe of the minde: And the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of euery kindred or company that ſo liue together is Lord, and commander ouer the reſt, to whom they yeeld obedience, as to their King, and when he accompliſheth the age of an hundred and fifty yeers, he depriueth himſelf of life (for ſo their law commands) and hee that is next vnto him in age taketh the gouernment vpon him: The ſea that incloſeth the Iſland is very boyſterous &amp; rugged, yet is the water moſt pleaſant &amp; delightſome in taſte, the North pole and many other ſtarres which are ſeene in our Horiſon appeare not in theirs.</p>

Ilands vſe the fruites of the earth (which ſhee bountifully affordeth of her owne accord) very ſparingly, for their dyet is ſimple, and they couet for nothing but to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice nature, they eate fleſh ſome-times boylde and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times broyld, and dreſſe their meate them-ſelues, reiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Arte of Cookery, and all ſeaſoning of their meates with ſalte or ſpices, as friuolous and vnneceſſary. They worſhip the Firmament, the Sunne, and the reſt of the celeſtiall bodyes, they catch diuerſe ſorts of fiſhes and birds, and they haue great ſtore of Olyue trees and Vines, which naturally hold their increaſe, ſo as they haue Oliues and Grapes in aboundance, without trauell or coſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Ilands alſo produce ſerpents that bee great ones, but nothing hurtfull, the fleſh whereof is marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſweete and delicious. Their garments are of a ſine white Cotton or Downe, which groweth in the middle of Reedes, which being dyed with the Iuyſe of theſe ſea fiſhes that coloureth purple: they make themſelues pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple garments thereof.

                  <p>They bee addicted to diuerſe exerciſes, for ſome ſerue and are ſerued in courſe, ſome are imployed in fiſhing, ſome in fowling, ſome in ſundry Artes and manuall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, and all of them in generall are buſied in ſome
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:24800:222"/>
one thing or other that redoundeth to their common good.</p>
                  <p>In their ſacred ceremonies, and vpon holy dayes, they ſing lawdes and himnes in honor of their gods, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Sunne, to whome they dedicate themſelues and their Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>They bury their dead bodyes vpon the ſea coaſt, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the carcaſſe with ſand, that by the flowing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of the waters, there may bee a great heape of ſand in the place where the corpes are buryed.</p>
                  <p>The canes whereof they eate the fruite (as they ſay) doe increaſe and decreaſe according to the diſpoſition of the Moone: The water of their fountaines is both ſweet and holſome, alwayes hotte, vnleſſe it bee mingled either with wine or cold water.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Iambolus</hi> and his companion had liued in that Iland ſeauen yeares, they were forced to depart, for the Ilanders held them to bee euill liuers, and of bad beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and conuerſation, and therefore prouiding their ſhippe ready, and victualling her, they ſet forward on their iourney, though fore againſt their wills, and at the foure months end they came to the King of India, by whome they were afterwards ſafely conducted through Perſia, and brought into Greece.</p>

<pb n="484" facs="tcp:24800:231"/>
ſomewhat ſwarthy, like vnto the Spaniards: Both men, women and children goe altogether naked without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering any part of their bodies, as beeing aſhamed of <note place="margin">All Barbarians go naked.</note> their nakedneſſe, nor bee their bodies full of heares (as ſome are of opinion) but euen as any heares appeare vpon their bodies they plucke them off, either with their nailes, or elſe with certaine little pincers or nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which they haue from the Chriſtians, their beards and the haires that doe grow vpon their eye liddes and eye-browes, they pull vppe by the rootes, the which is the cauſe that many of them bee purblinde and ſquint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed, which ſame faſhion is vſed of the Peruerſes in the Iſle of Cumana.</p>
            <p>The haire of the hinder partes of their heads they let growe, and ſhaue all the fore part of the heades of their male children when they bee young, beginning at the crowne like vnto the religious order of Munkes, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to grow long behinde downe to their neckes like old men.</p>
            <p>In that ſame country there bee certaine herbes of the breadth of two fingers, and ſome-what crooked, which doe grow vp long and rounde, like the reede that couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the eare of that great millet, which the French men call Arabian wheate, and with two leaues of this herbe, ſtitched together with a cotton threede, ſome old men (but neither young men nor children, nor yet all old men neither) doe couer their priuy partes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo they hide them with little rags or clouts; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in at the firſt ſight, may ſeeme to appeare ſome little ſparke of natural ſhamefaſtneſſe, if the did it for that cauſe, but it is more probable they doe it to hide ſome diſeaſe
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:24800:231"/>
or infirmity, where-with thoſe parts bee moleſted and greeued in their old age: Moreouer their cuſtome in that country, is to make a hole in the neither lip of euery child when hee is young, and to put into the hole a certaine bone, poliſhed and made ſmooth and as white as Iuory, in faſhion bigge and ſquare at the one end, and ſharpe at the other, this bone is placed in good and exact order, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the broder part of the grinding teeth, and there-with a deuiſe they haue, skrewed in and ſet faſt hauing the ſharpe end ſtanding an inch or two fingers breadth out of the lippe, and is ſo artificially faſtned to their goomes, as they will take it out and put it in againe at their pleaſure: And this ſharpe and white bone they weare onely when they be young, for when they grow in yeeres, that they bee called in their language <hi>(Coromi Ovaſſau)</hi> that is to ſay tall and well growne ſtripling, then in ſteed of this bone they put into the hole a certaine greene ſtone, beeing a kinde of counterfeit Emerald.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tououpinambaultij</hi> will often times for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light take theſe ſtones out of their lippes, and put their tongues through the holes, ſo as they may ſeeme to thoſe that behold them to haue two mouthes, but whether this ſtrang ſpectacle bee pleaſing, or whether it doth make them more deformed, it is eaſie for to bee iudged: Some of them alſo, not contented to carry theſe greene ſtones in their lips, make holes through both their cheekes, and put ſtones into them for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>As for their noſes, whereas the mid-wiues with vs, vſe when a child is new borne to ſtretch forth his noſe with their fingers, to make it more comely and ſharpe, the cuſtome of the people of America is cleane contrary,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:24800:232"/>
for they account thoſe children moſt comely that haue the flatteſt noſes, and therefore as ſoone as an infant is borne, they preſſe his noſe downe flat to his face, with their thombes (much like as they vſe to doe, to certaine whelpes in France:) in this point thoſe people diſagree very much, from the Americans that dwell in a certaine country of the Kingdome of Paruania, who are ſaid to haue ſuch great noſes, as they vſe to hange at them, in gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den threeds, Emeralds, Saphires, and other little ſtones both white and red.</p>
            <p>Theſe Braſilians die and varniſh their bodies with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers paintings and collours, ſtayning their legges and theighes ſo blacke, with the iuiſe of a certaine fruite, which they call <hi>Genipat,</hi> as they ſeeme to ſuch as behold them a farre off, to weare blacke breeches like Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ſloppes: and that iuiſe which is ſtrained or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of that blacke fruite called <hi>Genipat,</hi> entreth ſo deepe into their skinnes, as it will hardly be got out in ten or fifteene daies, though they waſh them neuer ſo often in that time.</p>
            <p>They weare alſo about their neckes a Iewell made of a kinde of bone that is very ſmooth and ſlike, and as white as Alablaſter, this bone they call <hi>Yaci</hi> (borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that name of the moone, which in their language is ſo called) it is aboue two handfull long, and is tied about their neckes with a cotten threed, and ſo hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe vpon their breaſts.</p>
            <p>In like manner they poliſh and make ſmooth and euen with a ſtone they haue, diuers little peeces of ſhelles workeing them till they bee thinne and round like vnto a penny, and then boring a hole in the middle of them, they put a great many together vpon a cotton threede,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:24800:232"/>
and weare them about their neckes like a chaine, theſe chaines in their language bee called <hi>(Bou-re)</hi> and they weare them in imitation of the little chaines of gold, which are vſually worne amongſt Chriſtians, and that which of many is called <hi>Buccinum,</hi> may very well bee the ſame, whereof wee ſee many women to weare girdles with vs. Theſe barbarous people likewiſe make theſe chaines, they call <hi>Bou re</hi> of a certaine kinde of wood that is blacke and harde, and namely, as <hi>Matheolus</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the tree called Sicomorus, which is much like vnto a wilde figge tree, and this tree is much vſed in thoſe chaines, becauſe in weight and brightneſſe it is very like vnto Iette.</p>
            <p>Furthermore the Americanes haue great ſtore of hennes, the breede whereof they firſt had from the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingals, from theſe hennes they plucke all the white fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and with their inſtruments of iron (which now they haue) and before when they had none of thoſe inſtruments, then with ſharpe ſtones, they hacke and chappe into very ſmall peeces the ſofteſt of thoſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and putting them, when they bee chopped ſmall into hot and ſeething water, die them with a certaine red collour of Braſile, this being done they annoint their bodies with a clammie gum, for to make the fethers ſticke on, and then couer and decke themſelues all ouer both bodie, armes and legges with thoſe fethers, painting them alſo with diuers collours, ſo as they ſeeme to bee couered with a downe, or ſoft wooll like vnto young pigions, and other birds new hatched.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon it is verie likely, that when diuers of our Countrimen came firſt into thoſe coaſtes, and ſawe them ſo attired, and not ſearching out the reaſon
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:24800:233"/>
thereof, ſpread abroade this rumor, that the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Americans were hairy all ouer their bodies, though the matter bee farre otherwiſe, for they bee not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſo, but this rumor aroſe by the ignorance of the cauſe, and beeing once ſpred abroade was eaſily beleeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee true.</p>
            <p>There is one hath written that the Cumani vſe to annoint themſelues, with a certaine gumme or clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ointment, and then trimme themſelues with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of diuers collours, like theſe Americans.</p>
            <p>The manner how the <hi>Tovovpinamkij</hi> (for ſo they bee alſo called) attire their heads is thus, beſides the ſhauing of the fore-part of their heads, in manner of a Monkes crowne, and the haires of the hinder partes, hanging downe long to their neckes (as is ſayd) their manner is to weare frontlets or ornaments for their fore-heads of fethers of ſundry collours, orderly diſpoſed and ſet together, theſe frontlets doe much reſemble the Periwigs, vſed to bee worne, by noble women, who may iuſtly bee ſaid to receiue that kinde of attire from the Barbarians: they be called in their language <hi>Yempenambi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They weare earings alſo made of very white bones, not much vnlike vnto thoſe bones which (as wee haue ſayd before) yong men put into the holes of their lips: In that country is a birde which they call <hi>Toucan,</hi> all her body is as blacke as a rauen, and about her gorge ſhe hath a ring of downy fethers that be yellow, and vnder that an other ring of vermillion collour, from this part of the birde that is yellow, they pull of the skinne (the birde beeing neuer the worſe) and drie it, and ſo lay a round peece thereof vpon each of their cheekes, making them for to ſticke on with a kinde of waxe that they had which they
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:24800:233"/>
call <hi>Trayetic:</hi> which beeing faſtened and made fit, one would thinke they had bridles in their mouthes, and that the yellow rounds were boſſes guilded with gold.</p>
            <p>Theſe people, if they either prepare themſelues to the warres, or (according to their cuſtome and ſollemne pompe) to kill any captiue, to be deuoured, to the end that nothing may bee wanting, to make them fine and braue, they put on their garments, ſettle on their cappes, put bracelets vpon their armes, of diuers coloured fethers, as greene, red, yellow, blew, and ſuch like, ſo artificially and cunningly compacted and ioyned together, with ſlender Canes, and cotton threedes, as I thinke there is ſcarce any imbroderer in all France, that can ſet in order, and make fit thoſe fethers, with more induſtrie and curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then they do: in ſo much as the garments wouen and trimmed in this preciſe manner, may be thought to bee made of a hairie kind of ſilke: the ſame kind of trimming do they likewiſe beſtow vppon their woodden clubbes.</p>
            <p>The laſt kind of their garments are made of Eſtridge fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which in colour bee browne or ruſſet, and which they get from their borderers, (wherby we may gueſſe, that thoſe great birds be bred in thoſe parts) the garments be made in this manner:</p>
            <p>They ſow all the quilles of the fethers together in ranke one by another, diſpoſing of them ſo orderly, as no one fether ſtand out longer than another, which done, they put the one ſide to the other, and make it round like a roſe or canopie: and this ſtrange garment in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is called <hi>Araroye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bundell they put vppon their backes, binding it faſt with a cotton threede, and the ſtalkes neareſt vnto their skinnes, wherewith when they be decked &amp; arrayed,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:24800:234"/>
they ſeeme as though they carried vpon their backs, a cage or coupe to put young chickins in.</p>
            <p>Thoſe which would be accounted moſt warlike, (that they may better manifeſt their ſtrength, &amp; ſhew that they haue ſlaine many enemies, and alſo for a vaunt how many captiues they haue killed, to be deuoured) cutte and gaſh their breaſts, armes, and thighes, and then ſtaine and color the wounds and gaſhes with a certaine blacke duſt, the prints of which gaſhes remain in their fleſh to their deaths, repreſenting to thoſe which behold them, breſt-plates and ſloppes cut after the Heluetian manner: When they giue themſelues to banquetting, carrouſing, and dauncing, (wherin they ſpend much time) the more to ſtirre vp their minds thereunto, beſides their horrible clamors, outcries, and houlings, they haue a certaine fruite that hath a hard ſhell, in forme and bigneſſe like vnto a Cheſnut: out of this ſhell they take the kernell, and put litle ſtones into the place where the kernell was, ſo tying a great many of them vpon a threed, put them vppon their legges, like vnto bels vſed here in England by morris dancers: no leſſe noiſe would they make in their hopping and skipping, if the ſhels of ſnayles were vſed in the ſame manner, which do not much differ from thoſe ratling inſtruments they vſe in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing And in theſe things the barbarous people exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delight, and take ſurpaſſing pleaſure in them when they be brought vnto them.</p>
            <p>In that Countrey alſo groweth a certaine kind of tree, the fruite whereof in faſhion and thickeneſſe is like vnto an Eſtridge egge, through which they bore a hole, in ſuch manner and faſhion as boyes with vs bore holes in nuttes to make Whirligigges, and put therein little ſtones, or the bigger cornes or graines of millet, or any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:24800:234"/>
thing, and then putting through the hole a ſticke of a foote and a halfe long, make thereof an inſtrument which they call <hi>Maraca,</hi> which will make a huge noyſe and rattle lowder than a ſwines bladder with peas in it: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe barbarous people carry them euer about with them in their hands.</p>
            <p>And thus farre haue I ſpoken in briefe, of the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, manners, cuſtomes, apparell, and behauior vſed by the <hi>Tovovpinambaltii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is brought vnto them from the Chriſtians a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or wrinkled cloth, ſome red, ſome greene, and ſome yellow, whereof they make them all manner of garments, theſe the Chriſtians do giue vnto theſe barbarous people, and haue for them in exchange, victuals, marmoſets, mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, Parrats, Braſile wood, cotton, Indian pepper, and many ſuch like things which are very good merchandize: And moſt of them weare looſe and flaggring breeches, &amp; all the parts of their bodies elſe bare, ſome of them againe will weare no breeches, but a cote reaching downe to their buttockes, where with when they be clothed and readie to go abroade, they will behold themſelues oftentimes, and inſtantly put it off againe, and leaue it at home, vntill it be their humour to weare it again, which maketh all our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that behold them to laugh at them, and in like manner do they with their ſhirts and caps.</p>
            <p>But for as much as can be ſaid of the externall habit of their bodies, both of men and children, I ſuppoſe I haue ſpoken ſufficiently, and therefore if out of this my deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any one deſire to repreſent vnto his mind one of theſe barbarous men, let him firſt imagine, that he beholds the ſhadow and reſemblance of a naked man, with all his members and lineamentall proportion fitly framed and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:24800:235"/>
ſet together, the haires of his bodie plucked off with pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, all the fore-part of his head ſhauen, with holes in his lippes and cheekes, in which be put either ſharpe bones or greene ſtones, eare rings thruſt through his eares, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die dyed with diuers colours, his thighes and legges ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and coloured with that blacke painting called by them <hi>Genipat,</hi> and about his necke a chaine made of the ſhell which they call <hi>Vygnoll,</hi> and then you ſhall ſee and eaſily diſcerne the perfect picture of thoſe that liue in that countrey.</p>
            <p>The Tovovpinambaltian women do vſually carry their little children in their armes, wrapped and ſwadled in a Cotton ſcarffe, who imbrace and wind about their mothers ſides with both their legges: They haue beddes alſo made of Cotton like nettes, and hanged vppe from the ground: Their beſt fruite is that which they call <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now if you will imagine in your mind, a barbarous man in another faſhion, he ſhall be diſrobed of that ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous attire and anticke habite, and his whole bodie daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with a glewiſh and ſlimie gumme, and their fethers chopped ſmall, ſhall be caſt vppon his bodie: and when he is attired with this artificiall Wooll, or Feather-downe, how fine a fellow hee will ſeeme vnto you, I neede not to ſhew.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, whether he retaine his naturall colour, or be diſguiſed in diuers colours, or in fethers: yet let him haue thoſe garments, cappe, and fether bracelets, which wee haue deſcribed, and then certainely he is arrayed in the beſt manner he can be: but if you pleaſe to giue him his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of that curled cloth, and (as we haue ſaid their cuſtome is) to cloath him with his cote, all the other parts
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:24800:235"/>
of his bodie being naked, and one ſleeue yellow, and the other greene: by theſe markes you may ſuppoſe him to be either an ideot, or an artificiall foole: To conclude, if you will adde to theſe, his inſtrument called <hi>Maraca,</hi> and his bundell of fethers, which they call <hi>Araroye,</hi> ſet handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon his backe, his ratling inſtruments alſo made of ſhelles, with ſtones in them bound vnto their legs, by this repreſentation you muſt imagin, hee is dancing and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
            <p>Many patternes and figures are not ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the extraordinary care and induſtrie of thoſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people, in attiring their bodies, according to the whole deſcription which before we haue ſet foorth: for no ſimilitude can make a liuely repreſentation of the whole matter as it is, vnleſſe euery thing be in their proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, but the attyring of thoſe women, which they call <hi>Quoniam,</hi> and in ſome places where they haue acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and commerce with the Portugals, they name them <hi>Maria,</hi> how much more excellent it is than the others, let vs diligently marke and conſider. For firſt of all, as we ſaid in the beginning of this chapter, the women goe naked as well as the men, and all of them plucke off their haires as men do, leauing not a haire vpon their eye-browes or eye-lids: but as concerning the haire of their heads, they differ much from men: for the men (as is ſaid) ſhaue all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts of their heades, and let the hinder parts grow long, but women there do not onely nouriſh their haires on their heades, but (like our Country-women) vſe often to combe and waſh them, as alſo to bind and wrappe them vp, with Cotton head-laces dyed blacke, though for the moſt part they go with their hairs looſe and ſpred abroad, like vnto thoſe ancient mad-brained <hi>Bacchides</hi> of Rome:
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:24800:236"/>
for they much delight to haue them hanging downe, and flaggering about their ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>In another thing alſo the women differ from the men; for they make no holes in their lippes as men do, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they adorne not, nor beautifie their faces with Iewels and ſtones, but they make ſuch great holes in their eares; as when their eare-rings bee foorth, they may put in their fingers: and their eare-rings bee made of that great ſhell, which they call <hi>Vignol,</hi> beeing in whiteneſſe and length, like vnto a midling candle, ſo as if you behold them afarre off hanging vppon their ſhoulders, and dangling vppon their breaſts, you would iudge them like the hanging eares of a hound.</p>
            <p>As for their faces, they trimme them in this faſhion, and in doing thereof, euery one helpeth other: firſt, they paynt with a pencill a circle in the middle of their cheekes, either redde, blew, or yellow, in forme of a cockle or ſnayle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, ſterring them vntill their faces be varyed and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed all ouer, with thoſe ſundry colours: in like manner do they paynt the place, where the haire of their eye-lidds and eye-browes did grow, (which faſhion I haue heard, is vſed of ſome light houſe-wiues in France.) They haue bracelets alſo made of peeces of bones, cutte like fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcales, or Serpents ſcales, ioyned and made faſt with waxe mingled with gumme, ſo artificially and finely, as they cannot be amended by any artificiall skill or cunning, they be an hand-breadth in length, and do ſomewhat reſemble the bracelet or wriſt-band, which is vſed with vs in blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bellowes.</p>
            <p>They vſually alſo weare bright and exceeding white chaines, which they call <hi>Bou-re,</hi> but they weare them not about their neckes as men do, but about their armes in
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:24800:236"/>
ſtead of bracelets: and for this purpoſe they haue a great deſire of glaſſe-buttons, either yellow, blew, or greene, with holes in them, and put vpon a threede: theſe they cal <hi>(Maurobi)</hi> and whether we go into their villages or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or that they approch neere vnto our caſtels or bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes, they vrgently ſeeeke to get of vs ſome of theſe but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, offering vs their fruites, and other commodities in exchange: and oftentimes they will vrge vs for them with theſe glauering words: <hi>Mair Deagat-orem amabe mauroubi,</hi> that is to ſay, You are a good French-man, giue vs ſome bracelets of your glaſſe buttons. In like manner do they importunatly require of vs combes, which they call <hi>Guap</hi> or <hi>Kuap:</hi> glaſſes alſo which they call <hi>Araua,</hi> and other ſuch like trinckets, wherein they take great delight. But aboue all things, this ſeemeth moſt ſtrange, that although their bodies, armes, thighes, and legges, bee not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed with diuers colors like men, and that they vſe not thoſe ornaments of fethers, yet could wee neuer intreate them, to put on any clothes made of that curled cloth, or ſmocks, though we oftentimes offered them: for they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in that ſtubborneneſſe, from the which I thinke they be not yet reclaimed, alledging for excuſe, the auncient receiued cuſtomes of all the borderers. For all of them vſe when they come neere any waters or riuers, to fall downe and to take vp water with their hands, to waſh their heads, and oftentimes (like duckes) they will plunge and diue into the water tenne times in one day, and then to put off their garments ſo oftentimes in the day, would bee very troubleſome vnto them: an excellent and goodly reaſon ſure, yet muſt wee needes allow it, for wee could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alter or diſſwade them by diſputing with them, for ſo great a delight is nakedneſſe vnto them, that not
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:24800:237"/>
onely the free Tovovpinambaltian women, which liued vppon the Continent, would thus ſtubbornely reiect all apparell, but the captiues alſo and ſlaues, which wee bought of them, and which we vſed as villaines, and drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to defend our caſtels, could not bee reſtrained, but would euery night before they ſlept, put off their ſmockes and all their other apparel, and wander naked vp and down the Iland.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if the power were in themſelues either to take or leaue their garments: (for wee could hardly force them to put them on by beating) they had rather indure the heate of the Sunne, and hurt their armes and ſholders with carrying ſtones and earth naked, then to put on any clothes. And thus much is ſufficient to ſpeake of the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, bracelets, and all the other compleat attire of the American women, and therefore without any further Epilogue to my ſpeech: I leaue it for euery one to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of, as to him ſeemeth good, &amp; will in this place adde a word or two of the bigger ſort of children, thoſe which be three or foure yeares of age, and which they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call <hi>Canomi mitri:</hi> for in theſe we were much delighted: they be fatter of their bodies, &amp; of a whiter bone then any children with holes in their lips, their haires of their heads ſhorne round, and their bodies oftentimes painted: And in this manner they would come dancing by flockes to meet vs, when we came to their villages. And for to haue vs giue them ſome things, they would often repeate theſe flattering words, <hi>Covtovaſſat amaebe pinda:</hi> that is, good fellow giue mee theſe hookes: and if they obtained of vs, what they deſired, as oftentimes they did, and that wee threw ſome tenne or twelue little hookes vppon the ſand, they would ſtriue and ſcramble for them, and greatly
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:24800:237"/>
exult and reioyce, and lying along vpon the ground, would ſcrape in the earth like Conneys, which was no little pleaſure vnto vs: Finally, although I diligently peruſed and marked thoſe barbarous people, for a whole yeare together, wherein I liued amongſt them, ſo as I might conceiue in my minde a certaine Idea, or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, yet I ſay, by reaſon of their diuerſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and behauiours, vtterly different from ours it is a very difficult matter to expreſſe their true proportion, either in writing or painting: but if any one couet to inioy the full pleaſure of them, I could wiſh him to goe into America himſelfe. But perhaps you will ſay it is more then one dayes iourney: that is truth indeed, and therefore I will not perſwade any one to enterpriſe the matter ouer raſhly.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude my ſpeach, I muſt ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to anſwere thoſe that either thinke or write, that the often familiarity with thoſe barbarous naked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and eſpecially with the women is a great prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to luſt and laſciuiouſneſſe, I ſay therefore, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the firſt ſight that nakedneſſe may iuſtly bee accounted the nouriſhment of concupiſcence, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding as experience hath made manifeſt, it is moſt true, that men by that vnciuill and vncomely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, are not ſo much as ſtirred in their mindes to luſt, ſo as I dare preſume to affirme, that gallant and gorgeous attire, painted beauties, counterfeit haire, criſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and friſled lockes, thoſe great and coſtly rayles which women weare ſo artificially folded, and wreathed, thoſe lawne gorgets, looſe and flaggering garments, and ſuch other like, where-with our women doe ſo buſily
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:24800:238"/>
falſify and counterfet them-ſelues, are more hurtfull and dangerous, then the nakedneſſe of thoſe barbarous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, although in beauty they bee nothing inferiour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſo as if it were lawfull for others, (obſeruing a decorum) to follow their faſhions, I could alledge very ſubſtantiall reaſons to make good my opinion, and refute all arguments that can bee obiected for proofe of the contrary.</p>
            <p>But not to dwell longer vpon this matter, I referre mee to the teſtimonie of thoſe which ſayled with mee into Braſilia, and which haue beheld both the one and the other, yet would I not haue my words wreſted to that ſence, as though I any wayes approoued that naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, againſt the authority of the holy Scripture, which ſaith, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eua</hi> perceiuing they were naked after their ſinne, were aſhamed, for I deteſt the hereſie of thoſe, which hauing violated the law of nature, (not well obſerued in this caſe, of thoſe wretched and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Americans,) doe their vttermoſt indeuours, to bring in this wicked and beaſtly cuſtome.</p>
            <p>But what I haue ſayd touching theſe rude people, tendeth to no other end, but that it may appeare, that we are no leſſe faultie, who condemning them that goe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked without regarde of ſhamefaſtneſſe, doe our ſelues offend as greeuouſly in the contrary, to wit, in ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and gorgious apparell: And now hauing deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the externall habit and trimming of the Barbarians, it will not breake ſquare or order to ſay ſome-thing in this place, of their manner of dyet: And this is chiefly to bee noted, that although they neither ſowe nor haue
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:24800:238"/>
any kinde of corne or graine, nor plant any Vines, yet notwithſtanding (as I haue often found true by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) doe they liue moſt finely and daintily, though they bee vtterly deſtitute of bread and wine: for they haue two ſorts of rootes, the one called Aypi, the other Manyot both of which waxe ſo exceedingly within three or foure moneths, that they will bee a foote and an halfe long, and as thicke as a mans thigh: theſe the women (for men bee neuer troubled with the buſineſſe) plucke vppe and drye againſt the fire, mingling them with that which they call Boucano, ſome-times alſo they bruſe and breake them in peeces, when they bee greene and freſh, with ſharpe flint ſtones faſtned to a beame, as wee are wonte to grate Cheeſe and Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, and make thereof a very fine white meale or flower, ſo as that new meale beeing ſteeped in water, the whole Iuiſe which is preſſed out of it, (of which I will ſpeake by and by) doth taſte and ſauour like new and moyſte Wafers made of Wheate: inſomuch, as after my returne into France, euery place where I came ſmelled thereof; which renewed the memory of that where-with thoſe barbarous and rude peoples houſes or roomes bee vſually waſhed and ſprinckled, with ſo great hindrance and loſſe is that meale made of thoſe kinde of rootes.</p>
            <p>For the preparation of this meale, the women of Braſilia deuiſe great earthen Veſſels, very fitte for that vſe, containing euery one a buſhell, or thereabout, which beeing ſet vpon the fire, they put there-vnto the meale, and euer as it boyleth, the gourd being cut in the middle,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:24800:239"/>
they take out that which is within, and vſe the vtmoſt rinde in ſteed of diſhes to eate pottage, and this when it is boyled is like vnto little comfits. Of this flower or dowe they make two ſorts, for one manner is throughly boyled and hard, which they call <hi>(Ouy-entan)</hi> and this they carry into the warres with them, becauſe it will keepe longeſt, the other ſort is leſſe boyld and ſofter, and that they call <hi>Ouy-pov,</hi> in this reſpect this is better then the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it taſteth like the crummes of white bread, but that firſt ſauour whereof I ſpake before, becommeth more pleaſanter and ſweeter by boyling; And as this meate, eſpecially when it is new, is of an excellent ſauour and taſte, ſo is it very nouriſhing and eaſily concocted, yet notwithſtanding (as I haue tryed) they cannot by any meanes make bread thereof: but they will make it into a lumpe, which ſmelleth like a batch of wheat dowe, and is maruellous faire to looke vpon, and as white as fine wheate flower, yet in boyling it is ſo dryed and cruſted vpon the out-ſide, that it beeing cut or broken, the inner part thereof is maruelous drye, and like as it was before it was boyled. Whereby I am induced to thinke, that hee was much deceiued, which firſt reported (not well regarding my ſpeeches) that thoſe which dwell two or three degrees beyond the Aequinoctiall line (which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bee certainly the <hi>Tououpinambaltij)</hi> did eate bread made of rotten wood, which is to be vnderſtood of theſe rootes whereof wee ſpake. And both ſorts of meate in making a kinde of gruell which they call <hi>Myngant,</hi> eſpecially if it bee mingled with fat broth or liquor, is then like vnto Ryce, and beeing ſo ſeaſoned, it taſteth very well and delicately. But the <hi>Tououpinambaltij,</hi> both men, women and children, from theyr Cradles
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:24800:239"/>
vpwards, doe eate this kinde of drye meale or dowe inſteed of bread: wherevnto they are ſo apt by often vſe, that with the ends of their fingers they will take it out of their earthen veſſels, and throw it ſtedfaſtly into their mouthes, without looſing the leaſt crumme, and therein we often-times aſſaide to imitate them, but beeing little exerciſed, wee ſpilled it vpon our faces, and therefore vnleſſe wee would bee ridiculous, wee muſt needs vſe ſpoones. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer thoſe rootes called Aypi and Manyot be ſome-times chopped when they bee greene into little gobbets, of the meale whereof being moyſte, the women make round balls, which being preſſed betwixt their hands, they wring out of them a certaine liquid white Iuiſe like vnto milke, and putting it into earthen veſſels, ſet it out in the ſunne, by the heate whereof it doth curde and creame ouer like milke, and when they eate it they powre it into diſhes made of ſhels, wherein it is boyled as wee are wont to boyle egges.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the roote Aypi is not onely accuſtomed to bee made into meale, but it eateth alſo very well beeing roaſted in the Aſhes, whereby it will waxe tender and cleaue, and bee very like in taſte vnto Cheſnuts broyld vpon the coales, and being ſo ordered it is very good to eate, but the roote called (Manyot) is farre otherwiſe, for vnleſſe it bee made into dowe and boyled, it is a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous meate; the ſtalkes of both thoſe rootes be like one vnto an other, and of the bigneſſe of lowe Iuniper, and the leaues bee like vnto an herbe called Peony or Pyony. But that which is moſt to bee wondred at in theſe rootes of Braſile called Aypi and Manyot, is the great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them, for the branches of them which be as brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as hempe ſtalkes, how many ſo euer of them be broken
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:24800:240"/>
and put deepe into the earth, without any husbandry at all, within two or three moneths ſpace, will bring forth a great aboundance of rootes.</p>
            <p>The women in like manner doe plant that great Millet whereof we ſpake before, which we commonly call Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins wheat, or Arabian wheate, and which thoſe barbarous people call <hi>Anati,</hi> and of that alſo they make a certaine meale which they boyle and eate, in the ſame manner, as I ſaid they do the other: And thus much ſufficeth to ſay of the manners, apparell and diet of the Americans: and he which deſireth to vnderſtand more, let him read the Indian hiſtory of <hi>Iohn Lerius,</hi> out of whom wee haue gathered that which we haue here ſet downe.</p>

be otherwiſe very vnfortunate, yet haue you many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions miniſtred vnto you. I call the times vnfortunate by reaſon of thoſe calamities, which in Europe are by your ſelfe to be cured, for of none be we more ſtrongly reſiſted, then of the enimie that liueth at our elbow, but let vs now omitte to ſpeake of thoſe troubleſome cares, which, (wee bee well aſſured), are euer in your minde, and come to other matters more calme and temperate, which carry great hope, that as it were an other new world imbracing the faith of Chriſt, may acknowledge your holineſſe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and Empire: Wherefore if you ſhall ſo handle theſe buſineſſes, that the Church both in Aethiopia, and Europe (hauing you her gouernour and protector) may eſcape and auoide all perill and ſhipwrack, and arriue into the hauen of ſaluation, wee ſhall then ſing in your praiſe that Propheticall Canticle contained in the Booke of Wiſdome, <hi>viz.</hi> I will paſſe through all lower parts of the earth, I will behold all thoſe that ſleepe, and illuminate all thoſe that truſt in the Lord, behold I haue not labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for my ſelfe onely, but for all thoſe that ſeeke the truth.

ſonne <hi>Henry</hi> excelled in learning, and eſpecially in the ſtudy of Mathematickes, who for the great deſire hee had to know the motion of the heauens, liued a ſingle life, and for that hee might more deepely and accurately me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate and conſider the courſe of the ſtarres, he liued in a holy promontory called <hi>Saint Vincents</hi> head, which place he choſe out, for that the heauens bee there for the moſt part calme and temperate, leaſt the clowds interpoſing themſelues betwixt the heauens and his inſtruments, his conſideration, and iudgment of the courſe of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, might be thereby hindred.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Henry</hi> to the end he might receiue ſome fruite of his ſtudies, determined to ſeeke out with his owne ſhips, and at his owne charge, that which by often watchings he had found out to be ſo, to wit, that the Atlantick Ocean floweth into the Indian, and the Indian againe into the Atlanticke, and therevpon ſending ſhips thither diuerſe times, they entred into great part of the Atlantick ſhore, wherein many townes, citties, and Iſlands were diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and found forth: in all which places by his meanes, the faith of Chriſt was made knowne, and Churches there erected, eſpecially in thoſe Iſlands which before lay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, the principall whereof was the Iland of Wood, commonly called <hi>Medeyra,</hi> now a moſt famous and fruitfull Iland.

            <p>Amongſt his other great labours and coſtes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee was no niggard, hee determined to ſend cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine men skillfull in the Arabian tongue vnto thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, and eſpecially vnto <hi>Preſtor Iohn,</hi> whereof two of them which hee ſent were <hi>Alfonſus</hi> of Payua borne at the white Caſtell, and another <hi>Iohn Peter</hi> of Couilham both Portingales.

<pb n="509" facs="tcp:24800:243"/>
that <hi>Alphonſus</hi> ſhould returne againe into Aethiopia vnto <hi>Preſtor Iohn,</hi> and that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould go forward into India, but <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing found out Calecut Goa, and the whole ſhore of the Malabars, ſayled to Zofala, and from thence againe to Adenes, &amp; ſo went ſtraight to Caire, expecting to finde his companion there and that they might returne together into Portingale to their king (for they appointed when they went from Adene, to meete againe, at a time limited, at the ſame Cayre) whither when he was returned he receyued letters from King <hi>Iohn</hi> out of Portugale, by the hands of two Iewes, whereof one was called <hi>Rabbi A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> a Bienſian, and the other <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a Lamacenſian, by which letters he was certified, that his fellow <hi>Alfonſus</hi> was there dead, and whereby hee was alſo commanded not to returne into his country before hee had vewed Ormuzia and ſaluted <hi>Preſtor Iohn,</hi> of whoſe ſtate the king did greatly deſire to be certified.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Iohn Peter</hi> not knowing what his companion <hi>Alphonſus</hi> had done in his life time, went backe againe to Adenes accompanied with the ſame <hi>Rabbi Abraham</hi> and ſent <hi>Ioſeph</hi> backe againe to the King with letters, ſignifiing his trauels and what he had done, &amp; ſo taking water ſayled from Adenes to Oromuzia, where leauing <hi>Abraham</hi> the Iew and diſpatching him with more letters to the King, he determined to ſaile towards Mecha, which when hee had deſeryed he erneſtly deſired to ſee mount Synai, from thence hee departed to Thor, and againe taking ſhipping and paſſing ouer the ſtraights of the Erythrean ſea, hee came to Zeila and from thence went all the reſt of the way on foote, vnto the court of <hi>Preſtor Iohn,</hi> who was then called <hi>Alexander,</hi> of whome beeing very curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly receiued hee deliuered vnto him the letters which

which thing did exceedingly reioice mee, and for which I in like manner, and all my people with me, praiſed God, with great deuotion.

Croſſes, and proued by enquiring of them, that they obſerued the Ceremonies of the Chriſtian Religion, which be moſt infallible true: and I was exceedingly ſtirred vp with a ſingular deuotion, when I vnderſtood that they founde their way into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> by miracle: for they told vs that the Captaine of the ſhip wandring long by the <hi>Arabicke</hi> ſea, and therefore diſpairing to finde our hauen, determined to leaue this buſines vndiſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to returne into <hi>India,</hi> the rather for the cruell tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts wherewith they were toſſed vpon the ſea, but in the ſame morning betimes that hee entended to retire, a red Croſſe appeared vnto him in heauen, which when he had worſhipped, hee commanded the Mariners to turne the foredeckes of their ſhippes that way as the Croſſe ſtood, and ſo by Gods appointment was our hauen diſcouered and found out, which thing I held to be miraculous.

But now I am at qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and God hath giuen mee reſt with all mine enemies, and yours, for when I march in Armes againſt them in the boundes of my Countrie, they turne their faces and flye from vs, and our Captaines and Souldiers haue the conqueſt of them and their Campes: neither is God angrie with me (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith) and God fulfilleth the deſires of thoſe Kings which require iuſt things, yet this belongeth not to our praiſe, but the praiſes are to bee giuen vnto God, for hee it is that hath giuen the world vnto you, and hath granted vnto you the lands of the Gentiles for euer, and the landes of other people from the limits of your owne Countrie, euen to the entrance into <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Wherefore I giue inceſſant thankes vnto God, and declare his great and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible power and maieſty, conceiuing great hope that the ſonnes of thoſe people which come vnder your dominion, ſhall vndoubtedly bee partakers of the truth of religion, and therefore I praiſe God, and hope that your ſonnes, and my ſelfe, and you alſo, ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly reioyce for the good ſucceſſe of theſe things. And you ought continually to pray vnto God, vntill hee giue you his grace to obtaine the holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which is now in the power of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt, the <hi>Moores, Gentiles,</hi> and Heretickes, which if you bring to paſſe, your eſtimation and renown ſhall be repleniſhed with all praiſe.</p>
               <p>But three of thoſe Embaſſadors which came vnto mee
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:24800:250"/>
with the ſaid <hi>Mathew,</hi> and the great Praefect of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie came downe to <hi>Macua</hi> to commune with the King of <hi>Bernagaes,</hi> who is ſubiect to our gouernment, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſent Embaſſadors vnto me, and great gifts which were moſt deere and acceptable vnto me: but yet your fame and renowne was more deere and precious vnto me then all iewels and treaſures whatſoeuer. But let vs omit theſe things, and conferre amongſt our ſelues how wee may inuade and take the infidels Countries, for which purpoſe I ſhal willingly giue <hi>one hundred thouſand thouſand drachmaes of gold,</hi> &amp; as many fighting men, timber, yron, and copper likewiſe, for to build and furniſh a Nauie, beſides great ſtore of furniture and prouiſion for warres, and wee will accord and agree friendly together, and for becauſe it is not my cuſtome, nor fitting for my dignitie, to ſend embaſſadors to require peace, and ſeeeing you your ſelfe haue formerly required it, with great ſincerity (to confirme the ſayings of our Sauiour Chriſt, for it is written: <hi>Bleſsed bee the Teet which bring peace,)</hi> therefore I my ſelfe am moſt ready to embrace it, after the manner of the Apoſtles, which were of one conſent, and of one heart. O King, and my Father <hi>Emanuell,</hi> God who is only one, the God of heauen, and alwaies of one ſubſtance, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer waxing yonger or older, preſerue and keepe thee in ſafety. He which brought the meſſage from you vnto vs was called <hi>Rhodericus Lima,</hi> hee was the head and chiefeſt man of that embaſſage, and with him was <hi>Francis Aluarez,</hi> whom for his honeſty of life, ſingular religion, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, I haue held moſt deere, and eſpecially for that being demanded of his faith, he anſwered thereunto very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truely. And therefore you ought to exalt him, and to call him maiſter, and to imploy him in conuerting
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:24800:251"/>
the people of <hi>Macua,</hi> and of <hi>Dalaca,</hi> of <hi>Zeila,</hi> and of all the Iſlands of the red ſea, becauſe they bee in the bounds of my kingdomes.</p>
               <p>And I haue granted vnto him a Croſſe, and a ſtaffe in token of his authority, and doe you commaunde that theſe things may be giuen vnto him, and that hee may bee made Biſhiop of thoſe Countries and Iſlands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee well deſerueth it, and is very fitting to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that office, and God ſhall doe good unto thee that thou maieſt bee alwaies ſtrong againſt thy enemies, and conſtraine them to proſtrate themſelues at thy feet, I pray God prolong thy life, and make thee partake of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, in the beſt place, euen as I wiſh for my ſelfe, for with my eares haue I heard much good of you, and I ſee with mine eies that which I thought I ſhould neuer haue ſeene, and God will make all things to goe well with you, and your ſeate ſhall bee vpon the tree of life, which is the ſeate of the Saints. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As a young child I haue done what euer you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded mee, and will doe if your Embaſſadors come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we may aid one another by our mutuall forces: &amp; I ſhall giue, and cauſe to bee giuen vnto all your Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors which ſhal come hither, what euer you will ſignifie to be done, and as you did at <hi>Macna,</hi> at <hi>Dalaca,</hi> and at the ports in the ſtreights of the redde ſea, that wee may bee proſperouſly ioyned together, both in Councell and action, as I doe chiefly deſire: for when your Forces ſhall come to thoſe Coaſtes, I will ſpeedily bee with them with my Armie alſo, and becauſe there bee no Chriſtians in the Marches of my Countrie, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches for Chriſtians, I will giue vnto your people thoſe lands to dwell in, which be neereſt vnto the
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:24800:251"/>
dominion of the <hi>Moores,</hi> for it behoueth that you bring your beginnings to a good end. In the meane ſpace ſend to me learned men, and caruers of Images of gold and ſiluer, workers of copper likewiſe, and of Iron, of tinne, and of lead, and Artificers to imprint bookes for the Church in our language, and ſome that can make gold foyle, <hi>or thin plates, or raies of gold,</hi> and with the ſame can guild other mettals, theſe ſhall bee courteouſly entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in my houſe, and if they ſhall deſire to depart, I will giue vnto them large &amp; ample rewards for their labours. And I ſweare by God, Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, that I will freely ſuffer them to depart when they pleaſe. This I moſt boldly and confidently deſire, becauſe your vertue is apparant vnto me, and your goodneſſe well knowne. And for that I know you loue me well, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am moſt aſſured, becauſe for my ſake you receiued <hi>Mathew</hi> very honourably, and liberally, and ſo ſent him backe againe: and therfore I couet to deſire thoſe things, neither be thou aſhamed of it, for I will truly accompliſh and performe all things. That which the Father deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of the Sonne, cannot bee denyed, and you are my Father, and I your Sonne, and wee bee coupled and ioyned together, and as one bricke is ioyned to another in a wall, ſo we being ſo to agree together, in one heart, and in the loue of Ieſus Chriſt, who is the head of the world, and thoſe which be with him be likened to brickes ioyned together in a wall.</p>

great thankes vnto God for your increaſe &amp; greatnes, and for the crown of your conuerſation in the houſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie. In like manner I tooke pleaſure by the comming of your Embaſſadors, which reported vnto me that kings ſpeeches, whereby a ſingular loue, knowledge, &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was eſtabliſhed betwixt vs, vtterly to extirpe &amp; driue away thoſe wicked &amp; accurſed <hi>Moores,</hi> and vnbeleeuing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which dwell betweene your kingdomes &amp; mine. But while I was thus ioyfull, I heard that your father and mine was departed out of this life, before I could diſpatch my Embaſſadors from hence vnto him: and therefore my ioy was ſuddenly turned into ſadnes, ſo that in the great ſorrow of my heart all the States and Noble men of my Court, and Eccleſiaſticall Prelates, and all which liue in Monaſteries, and all our ſubiects wholly, made great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaion with me, ſo as the pleaſure we conceiued of the firſt meſſage, was equalled and extinguiſhed with the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the laſt.</p>
               <p>Sir, from my firſt entrance into my kingdomes vnto this preſent time, no meſſage nor meſſenger hath come vnto me either from the King or kingdome of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall;</hi> but in the life time of the King your Father, who ſent his Captaines and Gouernours vnto mee, with Clearkes and Deacons, which brought with them all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne prouiſion and apparell for the <hi>Maſse,</hi> for which I reioyced greatly, and receiued them honourably, and ſhortly after diſmiſsed them, that they might returne with honour and peace. And after they came to a Hauen of the ſea, which is within my limits in the redde ſea, they found not the great Gouernour of the Nauie there, whom your father had ſent, for he expected not their comming, but certified mee that hee could not
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:24800:253"/>
ſtay their comming, for that your cuſtome is to create a new chiefe Gouernour of the Fleete once euery three yeares, in which meane time hee that was newly created, came thither, and this was the cauſe that the Embaſſadors ſtaied longer then was needfull. But now I ſend my Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages by <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> the brother of <hi>Licontius,</hi> whoſe name at his baptiſme is <hi>Zoga Zabo,</hi> which is as much to ſay, as the grace of the Father, and hee ſhall manifeſt my deſires before you.</p>
               <p>In like manner I ſend <hi>Francis Aluarez</hi> vnto the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who in my name ſhall yeeld my obedience vnto him, as is fitting.</p>
               <p>O Sir King, &amp; my brother, giue eare and attend, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor to embrace that friendſhip which your Father ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betwixt vs, and ſend your Meſſengers and Letters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vnto vs, for I greatly deſire to ſee them, as from my brother, for ſo it ſhould be, ſeeing wee are both Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And ſeeing the <hi>Moores</hi> which be wicked and naught, accord and agree together in their ſect. And now I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt I will neuer hereafter admit any Embaſſadors from the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor from other Kings, which ſend Embaſſadors vnto me, but from your highneſſe, which I much deſire ſhould often come: for the Kings of the <hi>Moores</hi> account me not their friend, by reaſon of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement, and diſparitie in religion: yet they faine friendſhip, that by that meanes they may more freely and ſafely exerciſe merchandiſe in our kingdomes, which is very profitable vnto them, for they carry great ſtore of gold (wherof they be very greedy) out of my kingdoms: though they be but hollow friends vnto me, and their commodities bring me but little pleaſure, but this hath beene tollerated, becauſe it hath been an ancient cuſtome
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:24800:253"/>
of our former Kings, and though I make no warres vpon them, nor vtterly ouerthrow them, and bring them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, yet in this I am to be borne withall, leſt, if I did ſo, they ſhould violate and pull downe the holy Temple which is at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> wherein is the ſepulcher of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, which God hath ſuffered to be in the power of the wicked <hi>Moores,</hi> and alſo leaſt they ſhould make le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell with the ground other Churches which be in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi> And this is the cauſe why I doe not inwade and ſubdue them; which thing greatly irketh me, and I am the rather perſwaded ſo to doe, ſeeing I haue no bordering Chriſtian king to aſſiſt me, and to cheere and incourage my heart in that, or the like enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore my ſelfe (O King,) haue no great cauſe to reioyce of the Chriſtian Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that they agree not together in one heart, but that warres bee very rife amongſt them. Bee you all of one Chriſtian-like minde, for you ought all of you to bee content of a firme peace amongſt you.</p>
               <p>And certainly, if any of my neighbouring Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings were ioyned with me in an amiable league (as they ought) I would neuer depart from him one houre. And of this I know not well what I ſhould ſay, or what I ſhould do, ſeeing they ſeeme to be ſo ordained by God.</p>
               <p>Sir, ſend your Meſſengers more often vnto mee, I beſeech you, for when I looke vpon your letters, then mee thinkes, I behold your countenance. And ſurely greater friendſhip ariſeth betwixt thoſe wich bee farre diſtant, then thoſe which dwell neere together, by reaſon of the great deſire wherewith they bee delighted,

for he which hath hidden treaſures, though he cannot ſee them with his eyes, yet in his heart hee euer loueth them moſt ardently, as our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpell, where thy treaſure is, there is thy heart alſo.</p>
               <p>And in like manner ought you to make mee your treaſure, and to cowple your heart ſincerely with mine. O my Lord and brother, keepe this word, for you bee moſt prudent, and (as I heare) much like vnto your Father in wiſe-dome, which when I vnderſtood, I forthwith gaue praiſe vnto God, and laying aſide all griefe, conceiued ioy and ſaid: Bleſſed is the wiſe ſonne, and of great eſtimation, the ſonne of King <hi>Emanuell,</hi> which ſitteth in the throne of his fathers kingdomes. My Lord beware then, faint not, ſeeing thou art as ſtrong as thy father was, nor ſhew thy forces to be weake againſt the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for by the aſſiſtance of God, and thine owne vertue, thou ſhalt eaſily vanquiſh and deſtroy them, neither ſhalt thou ſay that thou hadſt ſmall power left thee by thy father, for truely it was great i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and God ſhall euer bring thee helpe.</p>
               <p>I haue men, money, and munition, in aboundance, like the ſands of the ſea, and the ſtarres of heauen, and we ioyning our forces together, may eaſily deſtroy the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and barbarouſnes of the <hi>Moores.</hi> And I deſire nothing elſe of you but skilfull men, which bee able to inſtruct my ſouldiers to keepe their orders and rankes in battell. And thou, O King, art a man of perfect age, King <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> tooke vpon him the gouernment of his kingdome when he was but twelue yeares of age, yet of great power and more wiſe then his father.

                  <hi>Nav</hi> departed this life, and being entred into my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſeate, by Gods ordinance, I obtained greater wealth and forces then euer my Father had: for in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer bee all the borderers and Nations of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wherefore both of vs ought to giue inceſſant thankes vnto God for ſo great benefites receiued.</p>
               <p>Giue care vnto mee my brother and Lord, for this at one word I deſire of you, that you will ſend vnto mee learned men, that can carue images, imprint bookes, and make Swordes, and and all kinde of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons for the warres: head Maſons likewiſe, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, and phyſitions that haue skill to make medicines and cure wounds.</p>
               <p>I would alſo haue ſuch as can drawe gold into thin plates, and bee able curiouſly to carue and ingraue gold and ſiluer, and ſuch likewiſe as haue knowledge to get gold and ſiluer from out the veines of the earth, and to worke in all manner of mettall mines.

But now I much deſire to bee certified by ſome truſty meſſengers, of your holineſſe health and happineſſe, for I neuer yet heard any meſſage from your holineſſe, but ſomething I heard of our owne people, who to performe their vows, went a pilgrimage into thoſe parts, but ſeeing they went not in my name, nor brought with them my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from you, their reports are but an vncertaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe: for I queſtioning with them, they ſaid they came from Ieruſalem, where hauing performed their vowes, they went to <hi>Rome</hi> to viſite the Churches of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, vnderſtanding that they might eaſily come to thoſe
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:24800:257"/>
places which bee inhabited by Chriſtians. And ſurely I take great pleaſure in their ſpeeches, becauſe in my ſweete cogitation, I doe behold the ſimilitude of thy holy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which ſeemeth vnto mee like the countenance of an Angell. And I confeſſe, that I doe loue and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that image as an Angellicall likeneſſe, but yet were it more acceptable and pleaſant vnto mee, deuoutely and diligently to conſider and view your words and Letters.</p>
               <p>And therefore I moſt humbly beſeech you to ſend Meſſengers vnto me with your benediction, thereby to cheere and exhilerate my heart, for ſeeing wee agree in faith and religion, before all things I deſire and intreate that you will ſet my loue and friendſhip in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palleſt part of your heart, as the ring which you weare vpon your finger, and the chaine of gold which you put about your neck, that ſo the remembrance of me may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be blotted out of your memory: for with thankefull words &amp; letters frendſhip is increaſed, it is embraced with ſacred peace, from whence all humane ioy ſpringeth &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth, for euen as hee that is thirſty greatly deſireth cold water (as the ſcripture ſaith) ſo doth my heart conceiue an incredible ioy from the meſſengers &amp; letters which come to me from the furtheſt parts of the world: neither ſhall I only reioice to heare from your holines, but alſo I ſhall be glad to heare certaine newes from all the Kings of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome. And full as ioyfull as thoſe that in battell doe get the beſt ſpoyles. And this may bee done with great facility, ſeeing the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> hath made the whole iourney plaine vnto them, who long ſithence hath ſent his Embaſſadors vnto vs with ſtrong Armies: but neither when my father was liuing,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:24800:258"/>
nor ſithence, haue wee receiued any Meſſage or Letters from any other Chriſtian King, or from the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, although in our treaſuries of Monuments, and Charters of my great Grand father, is preſerued the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of thoſe Letters which Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſent into this Countrie, when the King of Kings, of all <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> being the ſeede of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and a King to bee feared, had the gouernment of this kingdome.</p>
               <p>The forme of which letters were thus. <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to our beloued ſonne the King of the ſeede of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the King of all the kings of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and chiefly to be feared, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in the concluſion of the ſame letters is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that his ſonne <hi>Iohn Paleologus,</hi> which dyed about two yeares before, the King of the <hi>Romaean</hi> Kings, was called to the celebration of the ſacred Synode. And that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, came with him with a great number of Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, and Prelates of all ſorts, among whom were the <hi>Proctors</hi> or <hi>Factors</hi> of the Patriarckes of <hi>Antioch, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> who when they had ioyned themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in loue of holy faith and religion, the vnity of the Church being ordained and eſtabliſhed, all the difficulties and troubles of ancient time, which ſeemed erronious, &amp; contrary to religion, were (by Gods diuine aſſiſtance) vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly taken away &amp; aboliſhed: which things being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed and ſet in order, the Pope himſelfe brought great ioy vnto them all.</p>
               <p>This booke of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> wee haue ſent vnto you, which wee haue kept vncorrupted, and wee would haue ſent vnto you the whole order and power of the Popes bleſſing, but that the volume of theſe things would ſeeme
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:24800:258"/>
too great, for it would exceed in bignes the whole booke of <hi>Paul</hi> to all the nations he writ vnto.</p>
               <p>The Legates which brought theſe things vnto vs from the Pope, were <hi>Theodorus, Peter, Didymus,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt, and you ſhall do well (moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father) to command your bookes to be looked ouer, where (I ſuppoſe) ſome memory of theſe things which we write of, may be found out. Wherefore holy father, if you will write any thing vnto vs beleeue it confidently, that we will moſt diligently commit it to our bookes, that the eternall memory of thoſe things may remaine to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and ſurely I account him bleſſed whoſe memory is preſerued in writing in the ſacred citty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the ſeate of the Saints, S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for theſe bee Lords of the kingdome of heauen, &amp; iudges of the whole world. And becauſe that this is my beliefe, I therfore ſend theſe letters, that I may obtaine grace of your holines, and your moſt ſacred Senate, that from thence may come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me a holy benediction, &amp; increaſe of all good things. And I moſt earneſtly beſeech your holines to ſend vnto me ſome images &amp; pictures of the Saints, &amp; eſpecially of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that your name may be often in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, &amp; that I may take continuall pleaſure in your gifts. Furthermore I heartily intreate you to ſend vnto me men learned in the Scriptures, workmen likewiſe that can make images &amp; ſwords, and all maner of weapons for the warre, grauers alſo of gold and ſiluer, and Carpenters, &amp; Maſons, eſpecially which can build houſes of ſtone, and make co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering for them of lead and copper, wherby the roofes of the houſes may be defended. And beſides theſe, ſuch as can make glaſſe &amp; inſtruments of muſicke, and ſuch as be skilfull in muſicke, thoſe alſo that can play vpon Flutes,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:24800:259"/>
Trumpets, and pſhalmes, ſhall be moſt welcome &amp; deere vnto vs: and theſe workmen I much deſire ſhould bee ſent me from your Court: but if there be not ſufficicient ſtore in your court, your holines may command them of other Kings, who will obey your command moſt readily. When theſe ſhal come to me, they ſhall bee honorably eſteemed of according to their deſerts, &amp; from my liberality ſhall be amply rewarded, and if any ſhall deſire to returne home, he ſhall depart with liberall gifts whither hee pleaſe: for I will not detaine any one againſt his will, though I ſhould haue great fruit and benefite by his induſtry.</p>
               <p>But I muſt now ſpeake of other matters, &amp; demand of you (moſt holy father) why you exhort not the Chriſtian kings, your children, to lay aſide thir armes, and as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth brethren, to accord and agree amongſt themſelues, ſeeing they be thy ſheepe, and thou their ſheepheard? for your holines knoweth right well what the Goſpell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, where it is ſaid: <hi>That euery kingdome diuided in it ſelfe ſhall be deſolated, and brought to ruine.</hi> And if the Kings would agree in their hearts, &amp; conclude an aſſured league and peace together, they might eaſily vanquiſh all the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> and by their fortunate entrance, and ſudden ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption vtterly burſt, and throw downe the ſepulcher of that falſe Prophet <hi>Mahomet.</hi> For this cauſe (holy father) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour your ſelfe that a firme peace and aſſured league of friendſhip may bee concluded and eſtabliſhed amongſt them, &amp; admoniſh them to be aſſiſtant &amp; aiding vnto me, ſeeing in the confines of my kingdomes, I am on all ſides incloſed and incompaſſed about with thoſe moſt wicked men the <hi>Mahometane Moores,</hi> for thoſe <hi>Mahometane Moores</hi> yeeld mutual aid one to another, &amp; the kings with kings, petty kings with petty kings, do ſincerely and conſtantly

aſſemble themſelues againſt vs. There is a <hi>Moore</hi> very neere neighbour vnto me, to whom the other bordering <hi>Moores</hi> miniſter weapons, horſes, and munition for the warres. Theſe be the kings of <hi>India, Perſis, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> which things grieue and moleſt mee exceedingly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, when I behold the enemies of the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ioyned together in brotherly loue, and to enioy peace, &amp; to ſee the Chriſtian kings my brothers to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all moued by theſe iniuries, nor to yeeld mee any helpe, as aſſuredly behoueth Chriſtians to doe, ſeeing the impious brood of <hi>Mahomet</hi> do aid and aſſiſt one another: neither am I he, that for that purpoſe ſhould require Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers &amp; prouiſion for warres of you, ſeeing I haue Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers left of mine owne: but onely I deſire your praiers and oriſons, wiſhing alſo fauour &amp; grace with your holines, &amp; with all Chriſtian Kings my brethren: for I muſt ſeeke to obtaine friendſhip of you, that I may bee fully inſtructed and furniſhed of thoſe things which I formerly deſired, to the terror of the <hi>Moores,</hi> &amp; that my neigbours, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Chriſtian faith may vnderſtand that the kings do fauor &amp; aid me with a ſingular care &amp; affection, which ſurely will redound to the praiſe of vs in common, ſeeing we agree together in one verity of religion and faith, and in this councell wee will conforme, which ſhall be firme and abſolute with that which ſhal fall out to be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. God therfore fulfill all your deſires about the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Ieſus Chriſt, and of God our Father, to whom all men giue praiſes for euer and euer. And you moſt holy Lord and father imbrace me, I beſeech you, with all the Saints of Ieſus Chriſt which be at <hi>Rome,</hi> into which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings let all the boderers of my kingdomes, and thoſe which dwell in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> be receiued, &amp; giue thanks to our

               <p>HAppy and holy father, which art ordained of God to be the conſecrator and ſanctifier of all nations, and the poſſeſſor of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſeate: to you bee giuen the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and whatſoeuer you either binde or looſe vpon earth, ſhall be bound or looſed in heauen, as Chriſt himſelfe hath ſaid, and as S. <hi>Mathew</hi> hath written in his Goſpell.</p>
               <p>I the King, whoſe name the Lyons doe worſhip, by the grace of God, called <hi>Athani Tingil,</hi> that is to ſay, virgins incenſe, which name I receiued in baptiſme, but now, when I firſt tooke vpon mee the gouernment of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I aſſumed vnto me the name of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the beloued of God, the piller of faith, the kinſman of the ſtock of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the ſon of the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of faith, the ſon of the ſeed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the ſon of the hand of <hi>Mary,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nav</hi> by the fleſh, Emperour of great &amp; high <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and of great kingdomes, dominions &amp; lands King of <hi>Xoa,</hi> of <hi>Caffate,</hi> of <hi>Fatigar,</hi> of <hi>Angote,</hi> of <hi>Baru,</hi> of <hi>Baaligaze,</hi> of <hi>Adea,</hi> of <hi>Vangue,</hi> of <hi>Goiame</hi> (where is the head of the riuer <hi>Nilus)</hi> of <hi>Damaraa, Vaguemedri, Ambeaa, Vague, Tigri Mahon,</hi> of <hi>Sabain,</hi> where <hi>Saba</hi> was Queene, &amp; of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagaes,</hi> and Lord vnto <hi>Nobia</hi> in the end of <hi>Egypt.</hi> All theſe

Prouinces be within my power, and many other, which now I haue not reckoned: nor haue I expreſſed theſe kingdomes &amp; prouinces in their proper names, for pride or vaine-glory, but for this cauſe onely, that God may be praiſed more and more, who of his ſingular benignity hath giuen vnto the kings, my predeceſſors, the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch great and ample kingdomes of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion, and yet ſurely hee hath made me worthy of a more excellent fauour and grace, then other Kings, that I might continually deuote my ſelfe to religion, becauſe he hath made me <hi>Adell,</hi> that is, the Lord and enemie of the <hi>Moores,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> which worſhip idols, I ſend vnto you to kiſſe your holines feete, after the manner of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings my brethren, to whom I am nothing inferior, neither in religion nor power, for I within mine owne kingdomes am the piller of faith, neither am I aided with any forreine helpe; for I repoſe my whole truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God alone, who gouerneth and ſuſtaineth me vp, from the time wherein the Angell of God ſpake vnto <hi>Phillip,</hi> that hee ſhould inſtruct in the true faith, the Eunuch of the mighty Queene <hi>Candace,</hi> the Queene of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> as ſhee was going from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Gaza.</hi> And <hi>Phillip</hi> did then baptize the Eunuch, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell commaunded, and the Eunuch baptized the Queene, with a great part of her houſhold, and of her people, which hath euer ſithence continued Chriſtians, remaining for all times after that, firme and ſtable in the faith of Chriſt.

mightie wood, and hedged and incloſed againſt the <hi>Moores</hi> that lye in waite for me, and other nations which bee enemies to the Chriſtian faith, and refuſe to heare the word of God, or my exhortations. But I my ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing girded with my ſword, doe perſecute and expell them out by little &amp; little, indeed by Gods diuine helpe, which I neuer found wanting, which happeneth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to Chriſtian kings, for if the limits of their kingdoms be large, it may eaſily be obtained, for that one may aſſiſt &amp; miniſter helpe vnto another, and receiue further helpe by your holines benediction, of which I am partaker, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my bookes be contained certain letters, which long ſince Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſent with his benediction, vnto the king of the ſeed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which bleſſing giuen by his own hands, being accepted and taken, I do enioy, and thereof greatly reioyce. And I haue the holy temple, which is at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in great veneration, vnto which I oftentimes ſend oblations due by our pilgrimes, and many more and fatter I would haue ſent, but that the paſſages bee hindred by <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Infidels:</hi> for (beſides the taking away from our meſſengers our gifts and treaſures) they will not ſuffer them to paſſe freely, but if they would ſuffer vs to trauell, I would come into the familiarity &amp; fellowſhip of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Church, as other Chriſtian Kings do, to whom I am nothing inferior in the chriſtian religion, for euen as they belieue, I confeſſe one true faith, and one Church, and I moſt ſincerely beleeue in the holy Trinity, &amp; in one God, and the virginity of our Lady the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and I hold and obſerue all the articles of the faith, as they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Apoſtles.

our Embaſſadors, and that we being Chriſtians ioyned in one faith, might ſerue God with other Chriſtians.

               <p>Theſe Epiſtles tranſlated by <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> I haue ioined to this worke, for the better knowledge of this hiſtorie, wherein we haue changed nor altered nothing (although
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:24800:262"/>

But if <hi>Iouius</hi> ſurceaſe to tranſlate it, I would not bee ſtrange to take the matter in hand, although not willingly, vnleſſe (moſt holy father) it pleaſe you to command, and then ſhall I be more free and ſafe from all malitious detractors, who may happily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that I vndergoe the buſines not with a deſire to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chriſtian common-wealth, but rather in aemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Iouius</hi> glory.

<pb n="545" facs="tcp:24800:262"/>
Chriſtians of Aethiopia: for I deſired to know thoſe things, not by the bare narration of trauelling interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but from a man borne in that Country; and that in his preſence, and receiuing it from his mouth. Amongſt other things, I ſhewed vnto him an Epiſtle ſent into Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall by <hi>Mathew</hi> the Embaſſador, which Epiſtle together with the Articles which he propoſed before King <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> I tranſlated (as I haue ſayd) into the Latine tongue, and many things I haue corrected by his direction, where the interpretation obtained not ſufficient credit, nor likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which he affirmed, did oftentimes happen both to me and to <hi>Iouius:</hi> for as then I had with me the Epiſtles of the ſame <hi>Iouius,</hi> which we conferred with great diligence, and after vnfained friendſhip and the true loue of Chriſt flouriſhed and was eſteemed amongſt vs, I was imbolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to require of him a plaine and ſincere declaration of the faith and religion of the Aethiopians, and to haue it penned downe with his owne hands, which hee graunted vnto me with great alacritie, and foorthwith beganne to make deſcription thereof, which relation of his, I haue faithfully tranſlated into Latin, as by the ſequele will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, wherein I went forward with greater deſire, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience vrging me that I was not ignorant, that if theſe things ſhould haue periſhed with me, they, could neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that be publiſhed by any other man: for becauſe they were ſo framed and compoſed after the Chaldean and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian phraſe, as they could hardly of any man bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but of my ſelfe, who by much familiaritie, might attaine to the knowledge of all thoſe things, as well from the mouth, as from the writings of the ſayd Aethiopian Ambaſſadour.</p>

As he was an infant he grew vp by little and little, ſucking the milk of his mother <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin, and when he attained to the age of thirty yeares, he was baptized in Iordan; he walked like other men, he was wearie, he ſweat, he was both hungrie and thirſtie, and all theſe things he ſuffered freely and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, working many miracles, and by his Diuinitie he reſtored ſight to the blind, healed thoſe which were lame, cleanſed the leapers, and raiſed vp the dead, and laſt of all, he was willingly apprehended and taken, ſcourged, beaten with buffets, and crucified, he languiſhed and died for our offences, and by his death he ouercame death and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and by his ſorrow in his life time, hee diſſolued our ſinnes, and bare our griefes, and with the Baptiſme of his bloud, (which Baptiſme was his death) he baptized the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and Prophets, and he deſcended into hell, where was the ſoule of <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſons, &amp; the ſoule of Chriſt himſelfe which is of <hi>Adam;</hi> which ſoule of <hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt

himſelf took of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> and in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his diuinity, and ſtrength of his croſſe, he brake the brazen gates of hell, binding Satan in chaines of yron, and redeeming thence <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; his ſons. Al theſe things Chriſt did, wherfore he was repleniſhed with diuinity, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity was with his ſoule, &amp; alſo with his moſt holy body: which diuinity gaue vertue to the croſſe, &amp; which diuinity he euer had, &amp; yet hath commune with the Father in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity &amp; Vnity: nor did that Chriſt, while he walked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, euer want his diuinity, for the leaſt twinckling of an eye. After this he was buried, and the third day the ſame Ieſus Chriſt, the Prince of reſurrection, Ieſus Chriſt the chiefe of the Prieſts, Ieſus Chriſt the King of Iſrael, aroſe againe with great power and fortitude, and after all things were fulfilled which the holy Prophets fore-ſhewed, hee aſcended with great glorie &amp; triumph into heauen, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the right hand of the Father: and he ſhall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in glorie, carrying his croſſe before his face, and the ſword of Iuſtice in his hand, to iudge both the quicke and the dead; of whoſe kingdome ſhall be no end. I beleeue one holy Catholike and Apoſtolike Church: I beleeue one Baptiſme, which is the remiſſion of ſinnes, I hope for and beleeue the reſurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Now hauing gone thus farre, I will expreſſe the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, doctrine, and law, which the Apoſtles in their holy books of Councels and Canons, (which we call <hi>Manda</hi> &amp; <hi>Abethylis)</hi> haue taught vs: and of thoſe bookes of the ordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Church there be 8. all which were compiled by the Apoſtles when they were aſſembled together at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: wherof making great inquiry of many Doctours, after I came into Portugall, I found none that did remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them. The obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which the Apoſtles preſcribed vnto vs in theſe bookes, be theſe following: Firſt, that we ought to faſt euery wedneſday in remembrance of the Iewes Councell; for vpon that day they conſulted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed amongſt themſelues, that Chriſt ſhold be killed: and that we ſhold faſt euery Friday; vpon which day Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was crucified, and died for our ſins: and vpon theſe two dayes we are commanded to faſt till the Sun-ſetting. They alſo inioyned vs to faſt with bread &amp; water the forty daies of Lent; and to pray ſeuen times in the day and night. By thoſe edicts alſo we be bound to celebrate our ſacrifice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Wedneſdayes and Fridayes in the euening, becauſe at that time our Lord Ieſus Chriſt yeelded vp the ghoſt vpon the holy Croſſe. They willed alſo, that vpon Sundaies we ſhould al aſſemble together in the holy church at the third houre of the day, from the Sun riſing, to reade and heare the bookes of the Prophets; and that after that we ſhould preach the Goſpell, and celebrate Maſſe. Moreouer, they appointed nine feſtiuall daies to be celebrated in memorie of Chriſt, to wit, the Annunciation, the Natiuity, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the Purification or Candlemas, his Baptiſme, Palm ſunday vnto the octaues of good Friday, (as we term it) which be 12. dayes, the Aſcenſion alſo, and the Feaſt of Penticoſt, with their holy dayes. And by the precepts of
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:24800:265"/>
theſe bookes, we eate fleſh euery day without any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the Feaſt of Eaſter vnto Penticoſt: neither bee we bound to faſt in all this time vnto the octaues of Penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt; which thing we do for the more honour &amp; reuerence of the reſurrection of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.

The Sabbath day we obſerue for this cauſe, for that God hauing perfected the Creation of the world, reſted vpon that day; which day, as it was his will it ſhould be called the Holy of Holies, ſo if that day ſhould not be reuerenced with great honor and religion, it would ſeeme to be done directly againſt the will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of him, who had rather that heauen and earth ſhould periſh, then his word, eſpecially ſeeing Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe came not to deſtroy the law, but to fulfill it: wherfore we obſerue that day not in imitation of the Iewes, but at the bidding of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; his holy Apoſtles: the grace of which Iewes is tranſlated vnto vs Chriſtians.

in like manner exulted with mirth and great ioy: And then <hi>Dauid</hi> paſſing through much part of Aethiopia came laſtly to his mother, who forth-with yeelded vp into his hands the gouernment of all the prouinces, laying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſhoulders the whole care of the Kingdome: And from that time euen vntill this day (being almoſt the ſpace of two thouſand and ſixe hundred yeeres) the Kingdome of Aethiopia hath lineally deſcended from male heire to male heire, and ſince that time wee obſerue the law of the Lord and circumciſion as before is ſaid, and likewiſe ſince that time hitherto, the offices which <hi>Solomon</hi> ordained for his ſonne <hi>Dauid,</hi> for the guiding of his Court, are kept and obſerued in the ſame order and families as they were at that time, neither hath the Emperor himſelfe power to aſſigne others of other kinreds, to execute thoſe offices of the court: the women likewiſe by the commandement and decree of the ſame <hi>Maqueda,</hi> be circumciſed, ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing induced therevnto by this reaſon, that euen as men haue a fore-skinne that couereth their yards, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner haue women a certaine kernelly fleſh which is called <hi>Nympha,</hi> aryſing vp in the middle of their priuy partes, which is very fit to take the character of circumciſion: and this is done both to males and females vpon the eight day, and after circumciſion the men children be baptiſed vpon the fortieth day, and the women children vpon the eighteeth day, vnleſſe any ſickneſſe or infirmity hapneth, which may cauſe it to bee done ſooner, but if any children be baptiſed before the time appointed, it is not lawfull to giue them ſucke of their mothers milke, but onely of their nurſes, vntill their mothers bee purified, and the water wherein they bee baptiſed, is conſecrated and bleſſed with exorciſmes, and that very ſame day wherein children bee
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:24800:270"/>
baptiſed they receiue the bleſſed bodie of our Lord in a little forme of bread: wee receiued baptiſme almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other Chriſtians from the Eunuch of <hi>Candace</hi> Queene of Aethiopia, whoſe name was <hi>Indich,</hi> as it is ſaid in the Acts of the Apoſtles, which together with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion (which wee had at that time as before is ſayd) wee obſerue moſt holily and Chriſtian like, and by Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance euer ſhall obſerue, nor doe we obſerue or admit of any thing but of thoſe onely which are expreſſed in the law and the prophets, and in the Goſpell, and in the bookes of the councels of the Apoſtles, and if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any things beſides thoſe, they bee onely obſerued for the time, for that they ſeeme to appertaine to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and peace of the Church, and that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bond of ſinne: Wherefore our circumciſion is not vncleane, but the law and grace is giuen to our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> which hee receiued of God as a ſigne, not that either he, or his children ſhould be ſaued through circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, but that the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be known from other nations: And that which is inwardly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the ſigne or miſtery of circumciſion wee doe highly obſerue, that is, that wee may bee circumciſed in our hearts: neither doe wee boaſt of circumciſion, nor therefore thinke our ſelues more noble then other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, nor more acceptable vnto God, with whom is no acception of perſons, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, who alſo ſheweth vs that wee bee not ſaued through circumciſion but by faith, becauſe in Chriſt Ieſus, neither circumciſion nor the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the foreskinne preualeth, but the new creature, but <hi>Paul</hi> preached not to deſtroy the law, but to eſtabliſh it, who was alſo baptiſed, and beeing of the ſeed of <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> hee alſo circumciſed <hi>Tymothy,</hi> who was become a
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:24800:270"/>
Chriſtian, his mother beeing an Hebrew and his father a Gentile, knowing that God doth iuſtifie circumciſion by faith, and the fore-skinne by faith: and as he himſelfe was made all to all that hee might ſaue all. To the Iewes hee was as a Iew, that thereby hee might winne the Iewes, and to thoſe which were vnder the law, hee was as one vnder the law, although hee was not vnder the law, to the end hee might gaine thoſe which were vnder the lawe, and to thoſe which were without the law, hee was as one without the law, although hee was not without the law of GOD, but vnder the law of Chriſt, that hee might get thoſe which were without the law: and hee became weake, that hee might gaine thoſe which were weake, which he did to ſhew that we bee ſaued not by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion but by faith.</p>
               <p>And therefore when he preached to the Hebrewes hee ſpake vnto them in diuers ſpeeches, like an Hebrew, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God heretofore ſpake many waies and in many man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to our fathers in the prophets, ſhewing vnto them out of the ſame prophets, that Chriſt was of the ſeed of <hi>Dauid</hi> after the fleſh. Moreouer he preached vnto them that Chriſt was with our fathers in the tents in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and that he led them into the Land of promiſe by the hand of <hi>Ioſua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> alſo teſtifieth in the ſame place, that Chriſt was the chiefe of prieſts, and that hee entred into a new tent, which is the <hi>Sanctum ſanctorum, The holy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> and that with the ſacrifice of his bodie and bloud, hee aboliſhed the bloud of goates and bulles, whereby none that killeth them ſhall bee iuſtified: and ſo hee ſpake ſundry waies to the Iewes, and alſo ſuffering himſelfe to bee worſhipped of his people, by many ceremonies in a
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:24800:271"/>
holy and vncorrupted faith: Moreouer thoſe children with vs bee accounted halfe Chriſtians, which here I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in the Romane Church bee called Paganes, who becauſe they die without baptiſme ought to bee called halfe Chriſtians, becauſe they be children of the ſanctified bloud of parents baptiſed, and of the holy Ghoſt, and of the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by which three Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies all Chriſtians bee ſo reputed: becauſe there bee three things which giue teſtimony in earth, the ſpirite, water and bloud, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> witneſſeth in his firſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Epiſtle: the Goſpell alſo ſaith, <hi>a good tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good fruite, and an euill tree bringeth forth euill fruite,</hi> and therefore the children of Chriſtians are not like vnto the children of the Gentiles, and of the Iewes, and of the Moores, which bee withered trees without any fruit, but the Chriſtians bee elected in their mothers wombes, as holy <hi>Ieremias</hi> the prophet, and Saint <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> were: Furthermore the children of Chriſtian women are elected and conſecrated by the communication and imparting of the body &amp; bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: for when women great with child do take the moſt bleſſed body of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, the infant in the wombe receiuing nutriment is thereby ſanctified, for euen as the child in the mothers wombe, conceiueth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorrow or ioy, according as the mother is affected, ſo alſo is it nouriſhed by the mothers noriſhment, and as our Lord ſaith in his holy Ghoſpell, if any one eate my body and drinke my bloud, hee ſhall not taſt of eternall death: and againe, if any one eate of my body and drinke my bloud hee ſhall remaine with mee: and <hi>Paul</hi> the teacher of the Gentiles ſaith, the vnbeleeuing husband is iuſtified by the beleeuing wife, &amp; the vnbeleeuing wife is ſanctified
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:24800:271"/>
by the beleeuing husband, otherwiſe your children ſhould be vncleane, but now they bee ſanctified, which, if it bee ſo that the children of an vnbeleeuing mother bee ſanctified by the ſaithfulneſſe of the father, then be they much more holy that bee borne of faithfull fathers and mothers: for which cauſe it is farre more holy to call children before they bee chriſtned halfe Chriſtians, then Pagans: and the Apoſtles alſo haue ſaid in their bookes of councels, that al which beleeue and be not baptiſed, may iuſtly bee termed halfe Chriſtians, who alſo ſay in the ſaid bookes: if Iew, Moore, or Gentile will receiue the faith, hee is not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be admitted, but they will that hee firſt come vnto the gate of the Church, and there to heare Sermons, and the words of our Sauiour Chriſt, that before he be incited and brought, as it were, by ſtelth vnto the faith, hee may know the yoke of the law, which when hee hath done hee may be called halfe a Chriſtian, although he be not baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Ghoſpel teacheth, he that beleeueth, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed ſhal bee ſaued, and hee which beleeueth not ſhall bee damned. And our cuſtome is that women with child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be deliuered ſhould be confeſſed, and that then they ſhould receiue the Lords body, and thoſe which doe not this, as alſo the fathers of thoſe children which compel not their wiues to doe it, bee accounted wicked and euill Chriſtians: Moreouer you muſt vnderſtand that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and chriſme, or extreame vnction of oyle, bee not accounted Sacraments, nor bee in any vſe with vs, as I ſee they bee heare by the cuſtome of the Romane Church. Alſo by <hi>Moyſes</hi> lawes and the ordinance of the Apoſtles it is not lawfull for vs to eate vncleane meates, and this wee doe for the full obſeruation of the law and the Scriptures, which conſiſt of one and foure ſcore bookes in
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:24800:272"/>
both Old and New Teſtament, that is to ſay forty and ſixe bookes of the Old Teſtament, and thirty fiue of the New, which expreſſe number of bookes of the Scriptures wee haue by computation from the Apoſtles themſelues, from which bookes of the Old and New Teſtament it is not lawful for vs to ad or diminiſh any thing, no though an Angell from heauen ſhould indeauour to perſwade vs therevnto. And hee which dare to attempt any ſuch thing ought to be reputed as accurſed: Wherefore neither the Patriarcke nor our Biſhops, by themſelues, nor in their councels, doe thinke or ſuppoſe that they can make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lawes thereby any one may bee bound to a mortall or deadly ſinne: for in thoſe bookes of councels it is ordained by the holy Apoſtles, that wee ſhould confeſſe our ſins, and what penance wee ought to take, according to the heinouſneſſe of each ſinne, is there ſet downe. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct vs alſo how we ſhould pray, faſt, and doe deedes of charity: and this is very familiar in vſe amongſt vs, that as ſoone as wee haue committed any ſinne, we forthwith, runne to the feete of the confeſſor, and this is vſed both of men and women, of what eſtate or condition ſoeuer they bee of: And as oft as wee bee confeſſed we receiue the bodie of our bleſſed LORD in both kindes, in ſweete or vnleauened wheaten bread: and if wee ſhould bee confeſſed euery day, wee ſhould likewiſe euery day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the moſt bleſſed and reuerent Sacrament, and this cuſtome is common as well to the Clergie as to Lay people: And the Sacrament of the Altar is not kept with vs in Churches, as it is heere amongſt the people of Europe. Neither doe thoſe which be ſick receiue the Lords body, vntill they begin to waxe ſtrong and recouer there helth: and this is done becauſe all men both Lay and
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:24800:272"/>
Clergy, doe vſually receiue it euery weeke twice, and all which bee willing ſo to doe come vnto the Church, for it is miniſtred to none but in the Church, not ſo much as to the Patriarch or to <hi>Preſtor Iohn</hi> himſelfe: We alwaies vſe one conſeſſor, and doe neuer take any other vnleſſe he bee abſent, and at his returne wee goe to him againe, and the confeſſors (by there power they haue from the Church) giue vs abſolution of all our ſinnes, reſeruing no caſe to the Biſhops or Patriarcke, though it bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo heinous.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the Prieſts may not heere their confeſſions, to whom they bee confeſſed themſelues: Both prieſts alſo and Munkes, and all Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters with vs liue by their owne labour, for the Church neither hath nor receiueth any tithes. Yet it hath reuenewes and lands which both Clerkes and Monkes digge and till, either by there owne or other mens labour, and other almes haue the none but ſuch as bee freely offered in the Churches, for the buriall of the dead, and other Godly matters: neither is it lawfull for them to begge in the ſtreetes, nor to extorte or wreſt any almes from the people.</p>
               <p>In our Churches alſo is euery day onely one Maſſe celebrated, which we account as a ſacrifice, nor is it lawful (by our old ordinances) to ſolemnize more then one in a day; &amp; for this Maſſe we take no hire nor reward: and in the miniſtery thereof, the Sacrament of the Altar is not ſhewed as heere I perceiue it is. And with vs, all Prieſts, Deacons and Sub-deacons, and thoſe which come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, receiue the bodie of our Lord: and wee ſay no Maſſe for the remiſſion and forgiueneſſe of ſoules departed; but the dead bee buried with croſſes and
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:24800:273"/>
Orizons, in a certaine place, and ouer the dead bodies wee chiefly amongſt other praiers recite the beginning of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Ghoſpel, and the day following the buriall of the corpes, wee offer almes for him which wee doe vpon certaine daies after, vpon al which daies we keepe funerall bankets: and thus far I haue ſpoken of our faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. But now, for that after our comming into Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, we had many and often diſputations and contentions with diuers Doctors, &amp; eſpecially with our Maiſters <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacus Ortyſius</hi> Biſhop of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> Iſle, and Deane of the Kings Chappel, and with <hi>Peter Margalhus,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the choiſe and difference of meates, it ſhal not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting to ſay ſomething of that matter.</p>
               <p>Firſt you muſt vnderſtand, that wee obſerue a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of meates out of the Old Teſtament, which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is appointed by the word of GOD it ſelfe, which word was afterwards borne of the Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> and walked and was conuerſant with his Diſciples, and that word of God I haue alwaies accounted an euer liuing, whole and inuiolated word, neither did that mouth which heeretofore forbad to eate of vncleaneſſe, ſay afterwards in any part of his Goſpell, that wee ſhould eate.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is ſaid in the Goſpell, that which enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in by the mouth defileth not the man, but ſuch things as proceed forth of the mouth, hee pronounced not this ſpeech, for becauſe hee would breake that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee had appointed, but that hee might refute the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the Iewes, which taxed and blamed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, becauſe they did eate meate with vnwaſhed hands, for neither the Apoſtles at that time that they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, did euer vſe any vncleane things, or taſted of thoſe things which bee forbidden in
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:24800:273"/>
the law, nor yet did any of the Apoſtles tranſgreſſe the law, nor can it bee prooued by any of our writings, that the Apoſtles at thoſe times which followed our Lords paſſion when they beganne to preach the Goſpell, did either eate or kill any vncleane things, and yet it is true that <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd, eate of euery thing that commeth into the ſhambles making no queſtion for conſcience ſake, and after that, if an Infidell call you to ſupper, and that you will goe, eate of all things which be ſet before you, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no queſtion for conſcience ſake: and againe, if any one ſhall ſay, this is ſacrificed to Idols, eate not of it becauſe of him that ſhewed you, and for conſcience ſake &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All theſe things <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to pleaſe thoſe which were not yet confirmed in the faith, becauſe there aroſe many diſputations and contentions betwixt thoſe and the Iewes, for the appeaſing whereof he did more eaſily yeeld vnto them, and conforme himſelfe vnto their will, which were not throughly confirmed in the faith. And this hee did not that he would breake the law, but that by gratifying others in releaſing them from ceremonies, hee might thereby winne them to the faith: The ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Let not him that eateth deſpice him that eateth not, &amp; let not him that eateth not condemne him that eateth, becauſe hee which eateth, eateth to the Lord, and hee which eateth not, eateth not to the Lord,</hi> wherefore it is very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily done to reprehend ſtrangers that bee Chriſtians ſo ſharply and bitterly, as I haue beene oftentimes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended my ſelfe, both for this matter and for other things which belonged not to the true faith: but it ſhal be better and more ſtanding with wiſdome, to ſuſtaine ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians whether they bee Greekes, Americans, or Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:24800:274"/>
or of any other of the ſeuen Chriſtian Churches in charity and imbracings of Chriſt, and to ſuffer them to liue and be conuerſant amongſt other Chriſtian brothers, without contumelies or reproches; for we bee al the ſons of baptiſme, and ioyne together in opinion concerning the true faith: and there is no cauſe why wee ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo bitterly touching ceremonies, but that each one ſhould obſerue his owne ceremonies, without the hatred rayling or inueighing of other: neither is he that hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled into other nations, and obſerueth his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ceremonies therefore to be excluded from the ſociety of the Church. Moreouer that which we haue in the Acts of the Apoſtles, to wit, how <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw Heauen opened, &amp; a certaine veſſel deſcending like vnto a great ſheet, bound or cloſed vp at the foure corners, wherein were all kind of foure footed beaſts and ſerpents of the earth, and foules of the aire, and a voice ſaid vnto <hi>Peter, ariſe</hi> Peter, <hi>kil and eate,</hi> to whom <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>God forbid Lord, for I did neuer eate of any thing commune or vncleane,</hi> and the voice repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto him againe ſaying, <hi>that which God hath made cleane doe not thou cal commune or vncleane:</hi> which words being repeated three times, the veſſel was againe taken vp into Heauen: which done the ſpirit ſent him into Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria vnto <hi>Cornelius</hi> a deu out man, and one that feared God, with whom when <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake, the holy Ghoſt fell vpon all thoſe which heard the word of God, and when they had receiued the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Peter</hi> commanded that all <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> houſhold ſhould be baptiſed: But when the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and brethren which were in Iudea, heard that <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> was baptiſed, they were diſpleaſed at <hi>Peter</hi> that hee had giuen Baptiſme, and the word of God to the Gentiles, ſaying, why wenteſt thou to men that be not circumciſed
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:24800:274"/>
and didſt eate with them, but when <hi>Peter</hi> had declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the whole viſion, they were pacified and gaue thankes vnto God, ſaying, And therefore hath hee giuen repentance vnto the Gentiles for their ſaluation. And they remembred the word of the Lord, which hee ſpake when he aſcended vp into heauen <hi>Go throughout all the world and preach the Goſpell vnto all creatures: he that beleeueth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaued, but hee which beleeueth not ſhall be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Apoſtles began to preach the Goſpel through out all the world vnto euery creature, in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt; and the ſound of them went throughout all the world. And this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wherein both cleane and vncleane things did appeare, we in Aethiopia expound thus: That by the cleane beaſts was meant the people of Iſrael: and by the vncleane beaſts the people of the Gentiles. And for this cauſe be the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles called vncleane; for that they bee worſhippers of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and willingly do the workes of the diuel, which be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane: and whereas the voyce ſayd vnto <hi>Peter, Kill,</hi> that we interpret in this manner, <hi>Peter,</hi> baptize: and when it is ſaid, <hi>Peter,</hi> eate; that is interpreted, as if he had ſayd, Teach and preach the lawe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to the people of Iſraell, and to the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is moſt certaine, that it cannot bee found in any place of the Scriptures, that either <hi>Peter</hi> or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles did kill or eate any vncleane beaſt, after this viſion.</p>
               <p>And alſo we muſt vnderſtand, when the Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of bread, he meaneth not meate or corporal nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therby, but the explication and expoſition of Chriſt his doctrine, and of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="570" facs="tcp:24800:275"/>
And ſurely it were well done for all teachers and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of this ſheet, which was ſhewed vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> to teach high and great matters, and not pettie or light things, and ſuch as do ſeeme little to appertaine vnto ſaluation, nor thereby cunningly to hunt after this document, as though it ſhould be conuenient or lawfull for vs to eate vncleane things, ſeeing no ſuch thing can bee gathered out of the Scriptures: for what is the cauſe, that the Apoſtles in their bookes of Councels haue taught vs not to eate beaſts that be ſtrangled, ſuffocated, or killed' of other beaſts, or bloud, becauſe the Lord loueth cleannes and ſobriety, and hateth gluttony and vncleanneſſe. And our Lord alſo greatly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thoſe that abſtaine from fleſh, but much more thoſe that faſt with bread and water, and herbes, as <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt the Eremite did beyond Iordane, who did euer eat herbes: and S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Eremite, who remained in the wilderneſſe foure ſcore yeares euer faſting: and S. <hi>Anthonie,</hi> and Saint <hi>Macarius,</hi> and many other their ſpirituall children, which did neuer taſt fleſh.</p>
               <p>Therefore my brethren we ought not to deſpiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh againſt our neighbors, becauſe <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, Hee which detracteth his brother, or condemneth his brother, detracteth the law, and condemneth the law: <hi>Paul</hi> alſo tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, That it were better for euery one to liue contented with their owne traditions, then to diſpute with his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian brother of the law: and againe, Not to know more than is behoofull, but to be wiſe vnto ſobrietie, and vnto euery one as God hath diuided the meaſure of faith: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vndecent to diſpute with our brethren of the law, or of the difference of meates, becauſe the meate doth not commend vs to God, eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith: We ſhall neither abound if we do eate; nor want, if
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:24800:275"/>
we do not eat. And therfore let vs ſeek thoſe things which be aboue, and the celeſtiall food, and leaue off theſe vaine diſputations. Al theſe things which I haue written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Traditions, I haue not done to breed diſputation, but that as much as in me lyeth, I may defend and protect my country-folkes againſt the bitter taunts and reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many, who ſetting aſide all reuerence, will not ſtick to defame &amp; reuile that moſt potent Prince precious <hi>Iohn</hi> and vs his ſubiects, with ſlanders and reproches, calling vs Iewes and Mahometans, becauſe we obſerue Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and keepe holy the Sabbath day, like vnto the Iewes: and alſo for that like the Mahometans, wee faſt vntill the Sunne going downe, which they alledge is vnfit for a Chriſtian man to do: and this they obiect againſt vs moſt bitterly, that we allow and hold it as lawfull for Prieſts to marry, as for lay people: this alſo they omit not to ſpeake againſt vs, and that moſt nippingly; for that we, as it were, diſtruſting in our firſt Baptiſme, be re-baptized once euery yeare, &amp; that women be circumciſed as well as men, which cuſtome was neuer vſed amongſt the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, becauſe we hold, that a difference of meats is moſt religiouſly to be obſerued: and laſt of all, becauſe we call thoſe children halfe Chriſtians, which before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme be wont to be called Pagans: to which ſlanders and miſreports, I am inforced to ſay thus much; that I may purge our people from ſuch reproches and calumnies, &amp; that I may make the Doctors of the holy Romane church more affable vnto vs, by whom (how holily I know not) I haue bin forbidden to receiue the body of our Lord euer ſince I came into Portugall, which is the ſpace of 7. yeares, and that (which I ſpeake with griefe and teares) I am repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt the Chriſtian brethren as an Ethnicke, and

               <p>And I am not ſent from my moſt mightie Lord the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Aethiopia, vnto the Biſhop of Rome, and vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> the moſt renowned king of Portugall, to mooue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations and contentions: But to begin friendſhip and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and not either to increaſe or diminiſh humane traditions: but that I ſhould inquire and diligently vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, touching the Hereſies of <hi>Arrius,</hi> Prince of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes: whether the Chriſtians of Europe would meete with vs to ouerthrow the opinions of this man, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of whoſe errors, there was a Councell aſſembled together at Nicea, vnder Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> conſiſting of three hundred and eighteene Biſhops; and withall, that I might know, whether that be obſerued among the Chriſtians of Europe, which the Apoſtles teach in their bookes of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods: that is, That a Councell ſhould be celebrated in the church of Chriſt twiſe euery yeare, to diſpute of matters of faith: the firſt of which Councels (by the Apoſtles deſire) ſhould be aſſembled at the feaſt of Penticoſt, the other the tenth of October: as alſo to vnderſtand, how we did agree together, touching the errors of <hi>Macedonius;</hi> for which cauſe there was a Councel of an hundred and fifty biſhops aſſembled together at Conſtantinople, vnder Pope <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus:</hi> and likewiſe of the errors of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> for whome there was a Councell of two hundred Biſhops, aſſembled together in Epheſus vnder Pope <hi>Celeſtine.</hi> Laſtly, that I might alſo know of the fourth Chalcedonian councel; wherein, for the errors of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> were aſſembled 632. bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, at which time <hi>S.

<pb n="573" facs="tcp:24800:276"/>
concluded for the peace of the church, the matter beeing left as it was, they all departed home euery one remaining in his owne opinion: The bookes of which Councels and of others which were celebrated afterwards, our moſt mightie Lord the Emperour of Aethiopia hath in his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: and of this cockle which the enemy of truth, the diuel, hath ſowne amongſt Chriſtians, my Lord is much grieued and all his ſubiects which beleeue in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Our countri-men euen from the beginning of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, haue acknowledged the biſhop of Rome to be the chiefe Biſhop, whome at this day wee obey as the Vicar of Chriſt: In whoſe court we would often bee, but that the iourney is ouer long, and many kingdomes of the Mahometanes betwixt vs, that may hinder our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: ſo as, though you ſhould enter into all thoſe great dangers, yet you can effect nothing, although that moſt wiſe and inuincible King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> of happie memorie, who was the firſt that by his nauigations, (not without Gods celeſtiall aſſiſtance) made paſſage into Eaſt India, gaue great hope that it might afterwards be done more commodiouſly: for he hauing ouercome the Ocean with his nauie, brought the red ſea into his ſubiection, being no whit deterred with the greatneſſe of the coaſt, ſo as hee might increaſe the faith of Chriſt, and (as it were) make a way open to make vſe of our friendſhip.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that is now done, and that each nation may receiue ayde from the other, wee hope that in ſhort time, by the Portugals forces and our owne, all the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, and other vnbeleeuing Ethnickes, ſhall be driuen and expelled from the whole Erithraean ſea, and from all Arabia, Perſis, and India.</p>
               <p>In like manner we truſt, by the power of Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:24800:277"/>
that it will come to paſſe, that (peace beeing eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the Chriſtians of Europe) the enemies of the croſſe ſhall bee expelled alſo from the mediterranean pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Pontus and other Prouinces, that according to the words of Chriſt, There may be vpon earth, one lawe, one fold, and one ſhepheard.</p>
               <p>Of which thing we haue two Oracles or predictions: one, out of the Prophecy of S. <hi>Ficator,</hi> the other of S. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noda</hi> the Eremit, who was borne in the vttermoſt rock of Egypt: neither of which two differeth from other. And ſince the time that my moſt mighty Lord receiued the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the moſt famous king <hi>Emanuel,</hi> the truth of theſe oracles doth ſeeme to haſten to an end; for truly our Prince thinks of nothing more, than of that: meditating alſo (both by his councell &amp; forces) how he may root out all Mahometans from the face of the earth. For theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and for others which I haue layd open before the moſt famous King <hi>Iohn,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> was I ſent hither by my moſt mightie Lord as an Ambaſſadour, and not for friuolous and vaine diſputations: And I pray with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained heart, that the great and mighty God may bring the decrees and indeauours of our Prince, for which I was ſent, to a happie end, and to his glorie. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hauing gone thus far, I will now briefly expound ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the way, of the ſtate of our Patriarke and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. And firſt you muſt vnderſtand, that (by a ſollemne cuſtome) our Patriarke is created by the voyces of our Monkes of Hieruſalem, which remaine there about the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher of our Lord, his election &amp; creation is in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The Patriarke being dead, our Emperour <hi>Preſter Iohn</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>endeth foorthwith a ſpeedie meſſenger vnto Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, vnto the Monkes there, (as is ſayd) who receiuing
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:24800:277"/>
the meſſage and the gifts which our Lord the Emperour ſendeth vnto the holy Sepulcher, they preſenrly, and with all poſſible expedition, elect another Patriarch by the moſt voyces: but it is not lawfull to elect any other, than one of Alexandria, and one of incorrupt manners, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted conuerſation; who being created, they ſigne their ſuffrages, and giue them into the Legates hands that came for that purpoſe: he foorthwith goeth to Cayre, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he is come, he offereth that creation vnto the Patriarch of Alexandria, whoſe ſeate is alwaies there, to be read.</p>
               <p>And when he perceiueth which of the people of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria they haue elected, he foorth-with ſendeth the man ordained to ſuch honors, with the Legate into Aethiopia, who by an old ordonance ought alwaies to be an Eremit, of the Order of <hi>S. Anthony:</hi> with whom the Ambaſſadour goeth ſtraight into Aethiopia, where he is receiued of all men with great ioy and honor: in which buſines ſomtimes is ſpent a yere or two; in al which time, precious <hi>Iohn</hi> doth diſpoſe of the reuenues of the Patriarke according to his pleaſure. Now the chiefeſt office of the Patriarch, is to giue orders; which none but he can either giue or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but he can beſtow vpon none, either Biſhopricke, or other Church-benefice: this onely belongeth to precious <hi>Iohn,</hi> who diſpenceth of all things according to his will. And the Patriarch beeing dead, he whoſe power and yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuenues is the largeſt, is made heire of the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all his goods. Moreouer, the office of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch is to proceed to excommunication againſt the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, the obſeruation whereof is ſo ſtrict, as the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of perpetuall ſteruing to death is inflicted vpon the offenders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="576" facs="tcp:24800:278"/>
Indulgences he giueth nor granteth none, neither bee any interdicted the Sacraments of the church, for any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence whatſoeuer, be it neuer ſo hainous, but onely for homicide: the name of the Patriarchſhip in our ſpeech is called <hi>Abunna:</hi> but he which now executeth the office is called <hi>Marcus,</hi> which was the proper name giuen him in Baptiſme, he is a man of an hundred yeares of age or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue.</p>
               <p>And you muſt note, that we begin our yeare in the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of September, which day alwaies falleth vpon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, the other feſtiuall dayes, as the Feaſt of the Natiuity of our Lord, Eaſter and the reſt, bee celebrated with vs at the ſame times they be in the Roman Church.</p>
               <p>And this I may not obſcurely paſſe ouer as though it were not ſo, that Saint <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtle did preach the Goſpell and faith of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt our Lord in our countrie.</p>
               <p>Now if you deſire to know of the name of our Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he is fully perſwaded, that hee was euer called preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Iohn,</hi> and not Presbiter <hi>Iohn,</hi> as is falſly bruted abrode: for in one ſpeech it is written with characters, that ſignifie <hi>Ioannes Belull,</hi> that is as much to ſay, as precious or high <hi>Iohn:</hi> and in the chaldaean tongue it is <hi>Ioannes Encoe,</hi> which beeing interpreted, doth ſignifie precious or high <hi>Iohn.</hi> Neither is hee to be named Emperour of the Abyſſini, as <hi>Matheus</hi> hath vntruly declared, but Emperour of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians: and <hi>Mathew</hi> beeing an Armenian, could not throughly vnderſtand our matters, eſpecially thoſe which appertained vnto faith and Chriſtian Religion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he related many things in the preſence of the moſt prudent and moſt potent king <hi>Emanuel</hi> of happy memory,
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:24800:278"/>
which with vs are nothing ſoe, and this hee did not with a deſire to ſpeake vntruths, for hee was a good man, but for that hee was not throughly inſtructed in matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our religion: The ſucceſſion of his Kingdomes and Empire doth not alwaies deſcend vpon the eldeſt ſonne, but vnto him vpon whome the father pleaſeth to beſtow it, And hee which now gouerneth the Empire was his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers third ſonne, which hee merited and obtayned by an awfull and holy reuerence to his father, for when his father lay a dying, he commanded all his ſonnes to ſit downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his throne, which all the reſt of his children did ſauing he, and he refuſed, ſaying, God for bid that ſo much ſhould be attributed vnto me, that I ſhould ſit in my Lords chaire, whoſe deuotion when his father ſaw, hee indued him with all his Kingdomes &amp; Empire, he is called <hi>Dauid,</hi> the power of whoſe Empire, as well ouer Chriſtians as Ethnickes, is large and ample, wherin be many Kings and petty Kings, Earles, Barons and Peeres, and much Nobility, all which be moſt obedient to his command: In all whoſe domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there is no mony vſed, but ſuch as is brought from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, for they giue and receiue ſiluer and gold by weight: wee haue many citties and great townes, but not ſuch as we ſee here in Portugall, the reaſon whereof (for the moſt part) is, that precious <hi>Ioan</hi> liueth alwaies in campes and tents, which cuſtome is vſed for this purpoſe, that the nobility may continually excerciſe themſelues in military affaires: And this I may not omit to tell you, that wee bee compaſled about on all ſides with the enimies of our faith, with whom we haue many and euer proſperous conflicts, which victories we attribute to gods diuine aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: written lawes we haue none in vſe amongſt vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be the complaints of thoſe which ſue others expreſſed
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:24800:279"/>
in libells or writings but by words, which is done leaſt by the couetuouſneſſe of Iudges and counſellors controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſhould be protracted. And this more I thinke ſit to ſhew you, that this <hi>Mathew</hi> was not ſent by <hi>Dauid</hi> our Emperor vnto the moſt inuincible and potent King <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuell</hi> of happy memory, but by Queene <hi>Helena</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors wife, ſurnamed the hand of <hi>Mary,</hi> who at that time by reaſon of <hi>Dauids,</hi> nonage, tooke vpon her the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdomes, being a woman without doubt moſt prudent and holy: And the ſame <hi>Helen</hi> (as ſhee was excceeding well learned) writ two bookes in the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an tongue, one of the which is called <hi>Enzera Chebaa</hi> that is to ſay, praiſe God vpon the Organes and inſtruments of Muſicke, in which booke ſhee diſputeth very learnedly of the Trinitie, and of the virginity of <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Chriſt. The other booke is called Chedale Chaay, that is to ſay, the ſonne beame, contayning very acute diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the law of God. All theſe things concerning our faith, religion and ſtate of our country, I <hi>Zaga Zabo,</hi> by interpretation the grace of the father, both Biſhop and Preeſt, and <hi>Bugana Raz</hi> that is Captaine, Knight and Vece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of the Prouince, haue declared, which I could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at your requeſt my moſt deere Sonne in Chriſt <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> nor yet any other man deſiring to be inſtructed there in, neither is it lawfull to deny it for two cauſes, the firſt whereof is, for that I am commanded by my moſt mighty Lord Precious <hi>Iohn</hi> Emperor of the Aethiopians, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie euery one that demandeth of me, concerning our faith, religion, and prouinces, &amp; that I ſhould conceale nothing, but faithfully declare vnto them the truth of al things both by words and writing; the other reaſon is, for that I deeme it very fitting and labour well ſpent, that our names, cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes and ordinances, and the ſytuation of our countries ſhould bee publikely knowen, which matters I neuer writ
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:24800:279"/>
vnto any one till this time, nor yet declared in words, not that I was ſparing of my labour, but becauſe no Chriſtian, after my comming into portugall, deſired to know ſuch things of me, whereof I could not, nor cannot but greatly maruell. And ſeeing by many arguments I perceiue that you much deſire the knowledge of our affaires, I beeſeech you by the wounds of our Sauiour Chriſt and by his croſſe to put this my confeſſion of our faith and religion into the latine tongue, that by your meanes all the Godly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of Europe, may vnderſtand our cuſtomes &amp; the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of our maners. Moreouer if in your trauells you hap to goe to Rome, then let mee intreat you to ſalute in my name, the Pope &amp; the moſt reuerent Cardinalls, Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and all other the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of Chriſt, by Chriſt Ieſus in a kiſſe of peace, and that you will deſire of the Pope, that hee will ſend vnto me <hi>Francis Aluarez</hi> furniſhed ſuch letters, whereby he may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere my Lord the Emperor of Aethiopia, that after my long ſtay I may returne into mine owne country and viſit my owne manſion houſe, for I haue bin long here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that before my death (which by reaſon of my great age is at the dore) I may effect that which I am comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. And that hauing furniſhed this Embaſſage I might dedicat the reſidue of my life vnto God, &amp; only ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d my time in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, moreouer I intreate you if you finde any thing in my writings not well penned, that you will frame it to the latine phraſe, but in ſuch manner as in no point you alter the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: &amp; laſtly I deſire you that in your tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you wil ſearch the old &amp; new teſtament, that you may know from what place I haue alleaged my authorities, that you may be more certain in your tranſlation: but if I haue not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led euery thing ſo happily as may ſatiſfie thoſe which bee curious, I am to be pardoned by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my want of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean</hi> bookes whereof I haue none, for thoſe I had I loſt by
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:24800:280"/>
miſfortune in my iourny: wherefore being deſtitute of the vſe of all bookes, I could ſpeake of nothing but what was freſh in my memory, yet haue I deliuered all things moſt faithfuly.</p>
               <p>Farwel my deare beloued ſonne in Chriſt. Vliſpone the twenty foure day of Aprill, in the yeare of our Lord God 1534.</p>
               <p>When I had finiſhed this buſines I remembred my ſelfe of that place whereas I ſay that Chriſt deſcended into hel for the ſoule of <hi>Adam,</hi> and for the ſoule of Chriſt, which the ſame Chriſt receiued of his mother S. <hi>Mary</hi> the virgin.</p>
               <p>Of which thing wee haue an aſſured teſtimony in thoſe bookes which wee call the bookes of gouernance, which Chriſt Ieſus deliuered vnto his Apoſtles, in which bookes be expreſſed theſe words, which be called the miſteries of doctrines, by whoſe authority and teſtimony we all of vs continue in this opinion without doubting: but after I came into Portugall I found diuines teaching a contrary doctrine againſt all our opinions, which is ſo certaine, as wee doe not onely beleeue this, but alſo affirme that the ſoules of all men had their beginning from <hi>Adam,</hi> and that as our fleſh is of the ſeed of <hi>Adames</hi> fleſh ſo like-wiſe our ſoule being, as a candle, kindled by the ſoule of <hi>Adam,</hi> had her originall and nature from <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby it appeareth that we bee all the ſeede of <hi>Adam</hi> both of the fleſh and of the ſoule.</p>

               <p>There be at this day with <hi>Goſtavus</hi> King of Suetia and Gothia ſome great peeres &amp; ſtates that be fallen from the Romaine Church: there be ſome in thoſe Kingdomes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that do altogether diſſent and diſagree from the right Diameter and true courſe of religion, vnto theſe by your dignity &amp; paſtoral function, may you direct your letters, requiring them by the woundes of our Sauiour Chriſt, (whome all men, though neuer ſo farre differring from the Roman Church, doe acknowledge to bee Gods ſonne and our Sauiour) that they will permit and ſuffer this Eaſt and Weſt Lappia, with thoſe large prouinces of Finmarchia Scrifinia and Biarmia (the greateſt part where of knoweth not Chriſt) to come and imbrace the ſweet yoke of Chriſt: and that they wil extort no more from them, then other Chriſtian Princes are accuſtomed to take from their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, either by courſe of law or by voluntary extorſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="585" facs="tcp:24800:282"/>
And it were good, not onely to ſend letters, but learned men alſo, and men of approoued ſanctity and holyneſſe of life, that theſe Prouinces may be annexed to the Romaine Church by the faith of Chriſt: whom (together with the people of Aethiopia) being reduced to the right law of Chriſt, although the people be offended, yet the Lord ſhall raigne, ſitting vpon the Cherubins, and although the earth be mooued, it ſhall reioyce, and all Ilands ſhall bee ioyfull. Farewell right reuerend and high Biſhop in Chriſt Ieſus, Amen.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE country of Lappia (through which runneth the Botnian ſea) is deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Eaſt and Weſt Lappia, the vtmoſt part of which ſea is Tornia, vpon the Eaſt part it ioyneth vnto the white lake, towards the North it compaſſeth diuers Prouinces, and ſo extendeth it ſelfe to a place vnknowne, and inclining Weſtwards towards Iſland, it ioyneth vnto part of Noruegia: vpon the South it is compaſſed about with the other part of Noruegia, with Suetia, Finland and both the Botnias.</p>
               <p>Eaſt Lappia hath in it a church dedicated to Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> in the eighty fourth degree of the eleuation of the
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:24800:283"/>
pole, which is adorned and beautified with a magnificent and ſumptuous Sepulcher, and with men skilfull and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the holy Scriptures'. This Church is vnder the Archbiſhop of Vpſall, within whoſe Dioceſſe it is, and yet, notwithſtanding the neighbors round about that church, whether it be by the careleſneſſe &amp; negligence, or through the couetouſneſſe of the Prelates, and great men, do not acknowledge Chriſt (as is reported). <hi>Lappia</hi> in the Latine toung is interpreted a fooliſh and ſottiſh or hartleſſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which name (as I thinke) is impoſed vpon them, for that the ſoile by the continuall and binding cold, being as it were dull, is leſſe apt eyther to receiue or bring forth fruites: the naturall borne people of Lappia be very ſtrong ſet, and of a middle ſtature, they be mauelous nimble and dexterious in vſing their bowes and darts, which practiſe of throwing the dart they exerciſe euen from their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in ſuch ſort, that if a boy ſhoote at a marke and miſſe it, he hath no meate giuen him vntill he haue hit the marke: inſteed of other garments they weare skins finely ſowed together, where-with they defend them-ſelues from the cold; which they be ſo accuſtomed to indure, that if need bee, they will ouer-come it without any defence at all of thoſe skinnes: their dwellings are in tents, for of houſes they haue no vſe, becauſe they often remooue out of one place into another: other courſe of life haue they none then hunting, fiſhing, and fowling, wherein they bee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous expert and skilfull, for in that Prouince is great aboundance of thoſe things. They vſe no tillage, and they haue ſhips made without any Iron nailes or pins, which being charged and burdened with fiſhes dried in the ayre, and with pelts, or skinnes, they tranſport them to their neighbours, and bordering people, and get for them in
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:24800:283"/>
exchange victuals and money, in dooing whereof they vſe no ſpeach but ſignes and becks, which onely hapneth through the barbarouſneſſe and harſhneſſe of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which their neighbours can by no meanes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, for otherwiſe they bee very wiſe and cunning in their exchanges.</p>
               <p>The people be very valiant and warlike, in ſteed of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they vſe a kind of beaſts, which in their language bee called <hi>Raingi,</hi> beeing of the ſtature and coulor of Aſſes, hauing clouen hoofes: they be made &amp; horned like Bucks, but that they be couered ouer with a kind of downe, &amp; be not ſo long, nor haue ſo many branches as Bucks hornes haue (as we our ſelues haue ſeene:) theſe beaſts be of ſuch wonderfull ſwiftneſſe, that in the ſpace of twelue houres, they will draw a chariot thirty Germaine miles, and in their going, whether they go ſwift or ſoftly, by the ſtirring of the ioynts of their legges, you may heare a noyſe like vnto the cracking of nuts. The religion of this people is to worſhip the fire and pillers of ſtone for gods.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is not the firſt time that the name of the Chriſtian Aethiopians, hath beene heard amongſt vs, for their Churches be not onely at Ieruſalem and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, but for a ſpace it hath beene lawfull for them to ſolemnize and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate their ſacrifices at Rome and Venice, and many things may be vnderſtood of them and of their cuſtomes, both by the Portugals nauigations, and by the booke of <hi>Francis Aluarez</hi> trauels, who went himſelf into Aethiopia. For as yet wee haue onely heard of the name of Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, but it is ſtrange that the name of the Emperour of Aethiopia, in our great grand-fathers dayes, was firſt knowne to vs out of Aſia, not out of Aethiopia: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe three hundred yeares the Aethiopian Kings had euer large dominions in Aſia, eſpecially in Drangiana in the confines of Suſiana, in India and in Sinus, vntill the Tartarian Emperours expelled them from their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Aſia: for the Abyſſini beeing vanquiſhed and expelled from the country of the people of Sinae, by <hi>Cingis</hi> King of Tartary, <hi>Vncan</hi> the great Emperour of Aethiopia being ſlaine, ſhortly after <hi>Cincan</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Cingis,</hi> and <hi>Cincanus</hi> ſonne <hi>Bathin can,</hi> did vtterly expell and driue out all the Abyſſini, from Moin and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Sinae, and compelled them to flye into Affrick.</p>
               <p>Surely wee haue often wondred, that a nation at this day altogether ignorant in ſea-faring buſineſſe, ſhould be
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:24800:284"/>
ſo mighty and potent, both by ſea and land, that they haue inlarged their dominions from Aethiopia to the people of Sinae.</p>
               <p>In thoſe dayes the knowledge of that Emperor came vnto vs, but by the name of <hi>Preſtigian,</hi> which in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian tongue (now vſed almoſt throughout all Aſia, as Latium is in the Weſt) ſignifieth <hi>Apoſtolicke,</hi> vnder which name is certainly vnderſtood, a rightfull and Chriſtian King.</p>
               <p>That the gouernment of the Aethiopians was great and large in Aſia, is ſignified by the Aethiopian croſſes which are in Giapan, Syna, and other places, as alſo by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is ſituated in the Region of Maabar, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> which hath croſſes, and many other things in it, as are in Aethiopia, and is builded after the Aethiopian faſhion, and (that which is more) retaineth as yet the Aethiopian name.</p>
