            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Do not wonder at your concern for finding an Order of Council
published in the <hi>Gazette</hi> for Reading the King's Declaration for
Liberty of Conscience in all Churches and Chappels in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
You desire to know my Thoughts about it, and I shall fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell them; for this is not a time to be reserved.</p>
            <p>Our Enemies who have given our Gracious King this Counsel against
us, have taken the most effectual way not only to ruin us, but to make us
appear the Instruments of our own Ruin, that what course soever we
take, we shall be undone; and one side or other will conclude that we
have undone our selves, and fall like Fools.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="answer">
            <head>ANSWER.</head>
            <p>They who had formerly heard the frequent Sermons upon
Loyalty preach'd over Tea an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Coffee at <hi>Sam</hi>'s Coffee-House,
would hardly then have believ'd that ever any Clergyman of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
of that stamp, would have been seen in publick pickeering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Orders of his Prince, especially issued forth after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
debate in Council. I know not kow he can boast such a vast
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65759:2"/>
stock of Loyalty as this Gentleman pretends to, when he shall
be so homely as to tax the King with following Council to the
Ruin of his Subjects. So that the business of this Pamphlet is to
render his Majesty a person that follows ill Counsel to the Ruin of
the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Party. Nor is it to be question'd but
that this single Clergyman speaks the sense of many more, or at
least would have many more believe, what he does. <hi>That what
course soever they take they shall be undone.</hi> And yet we find that his
Majesty has publickly declar'd it to be his Aim to fix his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon such a Foundation as may make his Subjects happy
in the injoyment of their Religion with freedom of Exercise, and
their Property without Invasion. However this Loyal <hi>Town Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman</hi>
is an Infidel that will give no credit at all to the solemn At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
of the King in this particular. Nay he will have it, that
<hi>both the one and the other side will conclude that they have undon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and fall like fools;</hi> that is to say, should they have Read the
Declaration in their Churches according to the order of Council.
By which it is apparant that the Church of <hi>England</hi> men have a
very bad opinion not only of the Declaration, but of the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and meaning of it as if it were fram'd to draw them first into
Inconvenience and then to undo them. For says he,</p>
         </div>
         <div type="letter">
            <head>LETTER.</head>
            <p>To lose our Livings and Preferments, nay our Liberties and Lives
in a plain and direct opposition to Popery, as suppose for refusing to read
Mass in our Churches, or to swear to the <hi>Trent</hi>-Creed, is an honourable
way of falling, and has the divine comforts of suffering for Christ and
his Religion; and I hope there is none of us but can chearfully submit
to the will of God in it. But this is not our present Case; to read the
Declaration, is not to read the Mass, nor to profess the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith;
and therefore some will judg that there is no hurt in reading it, and that
to suffer for such a refusal, is not to fall like Confessors, but to
suffer as Criminals for disobeying the lawful Commands of our Prince:
but yet we judge, and we have the concurring Opinions of all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry with us, who have already suffered in this Cause, that
to take away the Test and Penal Laws at this time, is but one stop from
the introducing of Popery; and therefore to read such a Declaration in
our Churches, though it do not immediatly bring Popery in, yet it sets
open our Church doors for it, and then it will take its own time to enter:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65759:2"/>
So that should we comply with this Order, all good Protestants would
despise and hate us, and then we may be easily crushed, and shall soon
fall with great dishonour and without any pity. This is the difficulty of
our Case; we shall be censur'd on both sides but with this difference: We
shall fall a little sooner by not reading the Declaration, if our Gracious
Prince resent this as an act of an obstinate and peevish or factious Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
as our Enemies will be sure to represent it to him; We shall
as certainly fall, and not long after, if we do read it, and then we shall
fall unpitied and despised, and it may be with the Curses of the Nation,
whom we have ruined by our complyance; and this is the way never to
rise more And may I suffer all that can be suffered in this World,
rather than contribute to the final Ruin of the best Church in the
World.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="answer">
            <head>ANSWER.</head>
            <p>Here is a very plausible Harangue built upon the bare suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of a <hi>single Town Clergyman,</hi> while he refuses to read the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
which is the very Act of his Majesties Grace and Favour
that secures him from all those fears and jealousies which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to instill into the People. Nor is it to be thought that men
of Reason and Loyalty, will as the City Clergyman seems to be
convinc'd, so readily believe that the King and his Council sit to
impose Dilemma's upon the Subject. <hi>We shall fall if we do, and we
shall fall if we do not read it.</hi> But this is only the Clergyman's
supposal; On the other side, the refusal to read it is an unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Act of Disobedience to the Command of the Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
than which there cannot be a greater mark of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty
which the Clergy of the Establish'd Religion of much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own.
Besides that it is a Disobedience to the Orders of the Church
it self, which injoyns her Ministers to read during the time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service whatever is injoyned by the King. But, says he, <hi>the
Reading such a Declaration in our Churches, though it do not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
bring in Popery, yet it sets open our Church doors for it, and then
it will take its own time to enter.</hi> But says the Declaration, In the
first place we do declare, That we will protect and maintain our
Archbishops, Bishops and Clergy, and all other our Subjects of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the free exercise of their Religion, as
by Law Establish'd, and in the full injoyment of all their Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without any molestation or disturbance whatsoever: Here is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65759:3"/>
the word of a King to bar the Introducing of Popery so much
fear'd: which if it were sacred as coming from the Lips of a
Crowned Head, they would have render'd still more solemn by
reading it in their Churches. And therefore the refusal of it seems
to be rather an Act of wilful indiscretion, than of that Religious
Care and wary Zeal to which the <hi>City Clergy-man</hi> pretends.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="letter">
            <head>LETTER.</head>
            <p>Let us then examine this matter impartially, as those who have no
mind either to ruine themselves, or to ruine the Church: I suppose no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> can give his consent to the Declaration.
Let us then consider whether reading the Declaration in our Churches be
not an interpretative Consent, and will not with great reason be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
to be so: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By our Law all Ministerial Offcers are accountable for their
Actions: The Authority of Superiors, though of the King himself, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justifie inferiour Officers, much less the Ministers of State, if they
should execute any illegal Commands; which shews, that our Law does
not look upon the Ministers of Church or State to be meer Machines and
Tools to be managed wholly by the Will of Superiours, without exercising
any Act of Judgment or Reason themselves; for then inferiour Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
were no more punishable than the Horses are which draw an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
man to <hi>Tyburn:</hi> and if inferiour Ministers are punishable, then
our Laws suppose that what we do in obedience to Superiours, we make
our own Act by doing it, and I suppose that signifies our Consent, in the
eye of the Law, to what we do. It is a Maxim in our Law, <hi>That the
King can do no wrong;</hi> and therefore if any wrong be done, the
Crime and Guilt is the Minister's who does it: For the Laws are the
King's publick Will, and therefore he is never supposed to command any
thing contrary to Law; nor is any Minister, who does an illegal Action,
allowed to pretend the King's Command and Authority for it: and yet
this is the only Reason I know, why we must not obey a Prince against
the Laws of the Land, or the Laws of God, because what we do, let
the Authority be what it will that commands it, becomes our own Act,
and we are responsible for it; and then as I observed before, it must
imply our own Consent.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="answer">
            <head>ANSWER.</head>
            <p>This Paragraph runs all along upon a meer Begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
For it would enforce an Argument from a Topick that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65759:3"/>
can nor ought to be allowed him: Besides, that it smells very
strong of Common-wealth Logick: as pickeering against the Power
of Princes, and insinuating the Declaration to be Illegal, contrary
to the Laws of God and the Land, and therefore not to be obey'd.
So that a greater presumption certainly could not have enter'd
the Breast of a Clergy-man of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than thus
to question the Legality of the King's Publick Acts. Certainly it
was never thought unlawful, till this Gentleman found it out, for
a King to grant an Act of Indulgence and a Toleration of Religion
to his Subjects. And then again to say, <hi>the King can do no wrong,</hi>
insinuates that some Body has <hi>done wrong,</hi> in advising the Order:
which is a Reflexion of too great Importance for men of Loyal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spositions
to scan. If he mean that the Order, or rather the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
is contrary to the Law of the Land, that is to say, to
the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and the Law enforcing the <hi>Test,</hi> that is absolutely
to deny the King's Royal Power of Dispensation, which has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
render'd them invalid. For he should have first made it out
that the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Test</hi> were such Sacred and Inviolable Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
that all things done contrary to them, were contrary to
Justice and Equity, before he had so slily Inferr'd an Impossibility
of giving his Consent to reading the <hi>Declaration,</hi> as contrary to the
Law of the Land, and the Act of a Superiour Authority nor justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the King himself. But this Gentleman did not consider
that there is no such Stress to be laid upon the Sanctimony of the
Penal Laws, and that supporting the <hi>Test.</hi> For that the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all Humane Laws are, That the Law be Honest, Just, Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
Convenient to Time and Place, and Conformable to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Reason. In every one of which Characters the Penal
Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are deficient, if for no other, though there are many,
yet for that very Reason alledg'd in His Majesties Declaration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they discourage and disable his Majesties Subjects that
are well inclin'd and fit to serve him, from doing him those Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
which by the Law of Nature they are bound to do. But he
goes on</p>

         <div type="letter">
            <head>LETTER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Ministers of Religion have a greater tye and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than this, because they have the care and conduct of mens Souls,
and therefore are bound to take care that what they publish in their
Churches, be neither contrary to the Laws of the Land, nor to the good
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65759:4"/>
of the Church: For the Ministers of Religion are not lookt upon as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Cryers, but what they Read, they are supposed to recommend too,
though they do no more than Read it; and therefore to read any thing in
the Church, which I do not consent to and approve, nay which I think
prejudicial to Religion, and the Church of God, as well as contrary to
the Laws of the Land, is to Mis-guide my People, and to Dissemble with
God and Men, because it is presum'd, that I neither do, nor ought to
read any thing in the Church, which I do not in some degree approve.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="answer">
            <head>ANSWER.</head>
            <p>If Arrogance and high Conceit might pass for Arguments, here
is a fair shew of both: For one would think that the Head of the
Church might be as competent a Judge of what is fittest to be
read in the Churches under his protection, as the Parson of the
Parish. Whoever thinks otherwise must have a very low opinion
of the Head, who takes upon him to be so wise and censorious a
Member. When the Head of the Church sends his Mandates and
Injunctions to his inferior Ministers, Reason does in no measure
justifie their Disputes and Oppositions to the Inverting the Order
of Nature. And therefore it would have argu'd a much more
noble confidence in the truth of his Majesties Sincerity and Piety,
to have read without boggling, the <hi>Declaration</hi> recommended to
their publishing in Churches, which they could not in good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
believe that their Soveraign Head would have enjoyn'd them,
had he not fore-deem'd it both proper and warrantable. We find
the <hi>Declaration</hi> grounded upon the solid foundation of Constant
Royal <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Opinion,</hi> which no question, had the Concurrence
of many able Divines of the first Order in the Church, among
whom that Learned Prelate, and famous Combatant against the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the B. of <hi>L.</hi> appears to be none of the meanest.
So that upon so fair a poise, besides the over-ballancing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

than any deep sense of Religion seems to carry the greater sway.
The <hi>Declaration</hi> duly consider'd, and fram'd with mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
is of one Judgment, but They, hand over-head, are of
another: The <hi>Declaration</hi> finding the Consciences of the Subjects

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65759:4"/>
to remove those incumbrances. They on the other side,
strive to uphold the Dagons of their Animosity against all other
Opinions but their own. Who are now to be the Deciders of
this Controversie? who indeed but the Soveraign Authority in
the person of the King who is Gods Vicegerent; and to whom
for that very reason, unless they will deprive him of that supream
Dignity, all other persons are bound to submit, there being no
higher Tribunal upon Earth to give a more Authentic Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And therefore it was that <hi>Cicers</hi> in his Oration for <hi>Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius,</hi>
tell us, that the Supream Magistrate is the Judge of the
Laws, and the cheif Interpreter of the Law; we only the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Law, that we may be free. Which being so true as
it is, what must be thought of them that set up an Interpretation
of their own against the Interpretation of the Soveraign Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate?
But the City Clergyman goes on with a very quaint Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.</p>

            <p>Indeed, let mens private opinions be what they will, in the nature

them by it. For is not Reading Tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

to what I read, yet I consent to teach my People what I read; and
herein is the evil of it; for it may be it were no fault to consent to the
Declaration, but if I Consent to teach my People what I do not consent
to, my self, I am sure that is a great one: And he who can distinguish
between consenting to read the Declaration, and consenting to teach the
People by the Declaration, when reading the Declaration is teaching it,
has a very subtile distinguishing Conscience: Now if consenting to read
the Declaration be a consent to teach it my People, then the natural Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of Reading the Declaration, is, That he who Reads it, in such a
solemn teaching-manner, Approves it If this be not so, I desire to know, why
I may not read an Homily for Transubstantiation, or Invocation of Saints,
or the worship of Images, if the King sends me such good Catholic Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and commands me to read them? And thus we may instrust our
People in all the points of Popery, and recommend it to them with all
the Sophistry and artificial Insinuations, in obedience to the King, with
a very good Conscience, because without our consent: If it be said, this
would be a contradiction to the Doctrine of our Church by Law Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished;
so I take the Declaration to be; And if we may read the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65759:5"/>
contrary to Law, because it does not imply our consent to it; so
we may Popish Homilies, for the bare reading them will not imply our
consent, no more than the reading the Declaration does: But whether
I consent to the Doctrine or no, it is certain I consent to teach my
People this Doctrine; and it is to be considered, whether an honest man
can do this.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="answer">
            <head>ANSWER.</head>
            <p>The first Question here is, Whether a man that consents to read,
consents to teach? Or rather, Whether Teaching and Reading be
all one? Certainly no man of reason but will believe the City-Clergy-man
was very hard put to it to lay the stress of a Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
to obey the Command of Soveraign Authority upon a Cavill
about the signification of a word or two. Who could have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
it would ever have been requisite for the Council to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
a Tribunal of Grammarians to obviate such an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as this, before they issu'd forth the Order for Reading the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.
But whether Teaching and Reading be all one, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
here to the purpose; For there is not any thing as yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the Letter which proves the Declaration unlawful to be
read: Which he ought first to have done before he had gone about
to split the signification of Words to gratifie a Conscience, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
squeamish because over-surfeited with the Kings Favours.
For there is no Person in <hi>England</hi> ought to uphold that Law which
the King condemns, if it be not in it self unjust and contrary to
the Union of Mankind. For the Introducing of <hi>Popery</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or the Abolishing of any Laws that may prevent it, if it be the
Will and Pleasure of the Soveraign Government, is no more Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
in it self, than it was for the <hi>United Netherlands</hi> to abolish <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
and introduce the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> into their Dominions,
contrary to the Constitutions of the Empire, and the Laws of
<hi>Spain.</hi> So that this <hi>City-Clergyman</hi> moves all this while upon an
Assertion, That the <hi>Declaration</hi> is Illegal and contrary to the Law of
the Land. For if the King of <hi>England</hi> may be depriv'd of his
undoubted Right of Altering, Repealing, or Suspending such
Laws as are inconsistent with those Maxims of Rule which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
at his coming to the Crown, and which he finds destructive
to the greatest part of his Subjects, he loses one of the greatest
Advantages which he enjoys, to pursue those Methods of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65759:5"/>
which he deems most proper for the renowning his Reign
in future History. So much the more hard, when the only means
which he accounts most proper for his purposes shall be condemn'd
for Unlawful by a nice Splitter of Verbal signification. And yet
the distinction of Reading and Consenting is not so difficult as he
pretends. For Consent is an agreement of Thoughts as well as
Words. But a man may read the Story of <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi>
in the Church, and yet not agree it to be Orthodox. Nor can a
man by reading be said to teach his People, unless he inculcates what
he reads by Instruction; for tho' Instruction comprehends Reading,
Reading does not comprehend Instruction. Which is the reason
there are so many ignorant Persons in the world, to whom the
<hi>Bible</hi> and the <hi>Creed</hi> it self are read every <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Year, and
yet at the Years end they are not able to tell ye whose Son <hi>Iesus
Christ</hi> is, or who was <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Father. And whereas he says, <hi>the
King might as well command him to read a Homily for Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
as the Declaration,</hi> the Inference is false, The one being an
Actual Invasion upon the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from
which the <hi>Declaration</hi> upon the Word of a King, is the very thing
that secures him: the other only a Civil Duty requir'd in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the King's Command: and the Refusal of it only a piece
of <hi>Fineness</hi> to render the King's Authority and his Proceedings
suspected to the People.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I suppose no man will doubt, but the King intends, that our
Reading the Declaration should signifie to the Nation, our Consent and
Approbation of it; for the Declaration does not want Publishing, for
it is sufficiently known already: but our Reading it in our Churches must
serve instead of Addresses of Thanks, which the Clergy generally refused,
tho it was only to Thank the King for his Gracious Promises renewed to
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in his Declaration, which was much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
than to publish the Declaration it self in our Churches: This would
perswade one, that the King thinks our reading the Declaration, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
our Consent, and that the People will think it to be so. And he
that can satisfie his Conscience, to do an action without consent, which
the nature of the Thing, the Design, and intention of the Command, and
the Sense of the People expound to be a Consent, may, I think, as well
satisfie himself with Equivocations and mental Reservation.</p>

            <p>Here is nothing still but barely repeated Supposition, together
with an open and glory'd in Confession of the Ingratitude of the
generality of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> than which he could not
certainly have bestow'd a worse Character either upon himself or
his Friends. Since it was an Obstinate Ingratitude that no renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of the King's Favours could reconcile to him, as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from a sowre Disgust, that his Majesty had granted to others
the same Liberty which they enjoy'd. As if all Mankind besides
them, were bound to groan under the continual Yoak of their <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws</hi> and <hi>Tests,</hi> no less Rigorous and Uncharitable. To the
remainder of this part, the Gentleman has form'd a very substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Answer of himself. <hi>I or,</hi> says he,</p>
         </div>
         <div type="letter">
            <head>LETTER.</head>
            <p>There are two things to be answered to this, which must be considered.
I. That the People understand our Minds, and see that this is matter of
Force upon us, and meer Obedience to the King.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="answer">
            <head>ANSWER.</head>
            <p>Then the Refusal was a work of Supererogation, the People being
better instructed, than all their reading could teach them; and
then they must fall that way by going about to instruct them by
their Obstinacy, who were of opinion that their Obedience would
have been a far better Admonishment. <hi>To which he answers,</hi>

         <div type="letter">

            <p>1. <hi>That</hi> possibly the People do understand that the matter of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is against our Principles: But is this any excuse, that we read that,
and by reading recommend that to them, which is against our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
and Iudgments? Reading the Declaration would be no Fault at
all, but our Duty, when the King commands it, did we approve of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it; but to censent to teach our People such Doctrines as we think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Laws of God, or the Laws of the Land, does not lessen but ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the Fault, and People must be very good natur'd to think this an
Excuse.</p>
            <p>2. It is not likely that all the people will be of a mind in this matter,
some may excuse it, others, and those it may be the most, the best, and the
wisest man, will condemn us for it, and then how shall we justifie our
selves against their Censures? when the world will be divided in their
Opinions, the plain way is certainly the best, to do what we can justifie
ourselves, and then let men judge as they please. No men in <hi>England</hi> will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65759:6"/>
be pleased with our Reading the Declaration, but those who hope to make great
advantage of it against us, and against our Church &amp; Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others will
severely condemn us for it, &amp; censure us as false to our Religion, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers
both of Church and State: and besides that, it does not become a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of Religion, to do any thing, which in the opinion of the most charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men can only be excused; for what needs an excuse, is either a fault or
looks very like one; besides this I say; I will not trust mens Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those
who have suffered themselves in this Cause, will not excuse us for fear of
suffering; those who are inclined to excuse us now, will not do so when they
consider the thing better, and come to feel the ill consequences of it: when our
Enemies open their Eyes &amp; tell them what our Reading the Declaration sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
which they will then tell us we ought to have seen before, tho they
were not bound to see it; for we are to guide and instruct them, not they us.</p>

of the Condemnations and Censures of <hi>Vox Populi: Vox populi</hi> is <hi>Vox

            <p>II. Others therefore think, that when we read the Declaration, we should
publickly profess, that it is not our own judgment, but that we only read it in
obedience to the King; and then our reading it cannot imply our consent to it:
Now this is only <hi>Protestatio contra factum,</hi> which all people will laugh at,
and scorn us for: for such a solemn reading it in the time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
when all men ought to be most grave and serious, and for from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
with God or Men, does in the nature of the thing imply our appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation;
and should we declare the contrary, when we read it, what shall we
say to those who ask us, Why then do you read it? But let those who have a
mind try this way, which, for my part, I take to be a greater and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65759:7"/>
provocation of the King, than not to read it; and I suppose, those who do not
read it, will be thought plainer and honester men; and will escape as well as those who
read it and protest against it: and yet nothing less than an express Protestation against
it will salve this matter; for only to say, they read it meerly in obedience to the King, does
not express their dissent: it signifies indeed, that they would not have read it, if the
King had not commanded it; but these words do not signifie, that they disapprove of the
Declaration, when their reading it, though only in obedience to the King, signifies their
approbation of it, as much as  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> can signifie a consent: let us call to mind how it

it was called, and then preached against it.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="answer">
            <head>ANSWER.</head>
            <p>Then it appears that the Declaration has been read, and that by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>England</hi> also. So that it appears
that the reading of it is not of that dangerous Consequence to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as the Author of the <hi>Letter</hi> would pretend to. For we are
to have that charity for those that read it as for those that refused it,
that the forme had as much care for their Consciences, as the latter.
Now then to what purpose all these Terrors and affrights of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
all this dread of the censures of the People for reading it, since
the business admits such a positive variety of Opinion. The Loyal
and Obedient may read it, but the Scrupulous and Refractory will not.
Well then, if the case be so, the <hi>City Clergyman</hi> should have done well,
to have reserv'd his Niceties and Slicing of significations to himself, and
not have gone about so Zealously to spread the infection of his Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

            <p>To return then to our Argument; If reading the Declaration in our Churches be in the

Gentry of the Nation. But now he's come to his Effects and

            <p>For let us consider further, What the Effects and Consequences of our
Reading the Declaration are likely to be, and I think they are Matter
of Conscience too, when they are Evident and Apparent.</p>
            <p>This will certainly render our Persons and Ministry infinitely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
which is against that Apostolick Canon, <hi>Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
thee,</hi> Tit. 2. 15. That is, so to Behave himself in his Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Office, as not to fall under Contempt; and therefore this obliges the
Conscience, not to make our selves Ridiculous, nor to render our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
our Counsels, Exhortations, Preaching, Writing, of no effect,
which is a thousand times worse than being Silenced: Our Sufferings
will Preach more effectually to the People, when we cannot Speak to
them: But he who for Fear or Cowardize, or the Love of this World,
betrays his Church and Religion by undue Compliances, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be thought to do so, may continue to Preach, but to no purpose;
and when we have rendred our selves Ridiculous and contemptible, we
shall then quickly Fall, and Fall unpitied.</p>

            <head>ANSWER.</head>
            <p>He is now wrapt up in the Spirit of Prophesie, what Strange
things will befal him for reading the Declaration, which he
calls a Betraying the Church by undue Complyances: But the
Prophet mistakes the Points that renders the Ministerial Office
he means Ridiculous; for while they keep to the Business of
Sound Doctrine, and meerly True Divinity, there is not a
more Profound or Learned Clergy in the World, than are they
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but when they will be Studying the
Points of Royal Declarations, which are Acts of State, will be
making their Pulpits the Stages of Farce and Satyr, will be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terloping
and Intruding into State Affairs, which nothing at all
concern them; when they will be Teaching the King, the
Judges, Deputy Lieutenants, and all other Magistrates, their
Duties: This is that which renders the Ministry, before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
or any Ministry in the World, Ridiculous. And it
is to be feared, The City-Clergyman has not altogether freed
himself from that Contempt, in calling the Reading of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
a Betraying of the Church by Undue Complyances;
and then Complementing the Nobility and Gentry of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Justifie his Ridiculous Language; and all this to gain
Popularity, or to preserve the Possession of his Living under
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65759:9"/>
the Name of the Protestant Religion; for he must not take it
amiss, That others dive with the same severity into his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he dives into the King's Intentions.</p>

            <p>There is nothing will so effectually tend to the final Ruin of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> because our Reading the Declaration will Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage,
or Provoke, or misguide, all the Friends the Church of
<hi>England</hi> has: can we blame any man for not preserving the Laws and
the Religion of our Church and Nation, when we our selves will
venture nothing for it? can we blame any Man for consenting to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
the <hi>Test</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> when we recommend it to them by
Reading the Declaration? Have we not Reason to expect that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, who have already Suffered in this Cause, when they
hear themselves condemned for it in all the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> will
think it time to mend such a Fault, and reconcile themselves to their
Prince? and if our Church fall this way, is there any Reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that it should ever rise again? These Consequences are almost as
evident as Demonstrations, and let it be what it will in it self, which
I foresee will destroy the <hi>Church of England</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
and <hi>Interest,</hi> I think I ought to make as much Conscience of
doing it, as of doing the most immoral Action in Nature.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="answer">
            <head>ANSWER.</head>
            <p>Here we find him talking as if the Final Ruine of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> lay upon the Church of <hi>England</hi>-mens
Reading or Not Reading the Declaration, and that by
Not Reading it, they had saved the <hi>Palladium</hi>'s and <hi>Ancilia</hi> of
their Religion. And all these Rodomontado's upon bare Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
and Imaginations no ways compatible to Reason; for
it is not Rational to Believe, That the Nobility and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>England,</hi> when they delivered their Sentiments contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to what was Proposed to them concerning the Test (for as
to the Penal Laws, 'tis well known, Their Judgments are
much more Remiss) did what they did for Fear of being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the <hi>Levites</hi> whom they feed. 'Tis therefore a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
in the <hi>City-clergyman</hi> to arrogate in the Plural Number
such a Power over the Nobility and Gentry, as if they were
bound to Justifie his and his Friend's particular Acts of Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65759:9"/>
and could not be Safe in their Resolutions, unless they
were Obstinate. What was proposed to the Nobility and
Gentry was one thing, what was commanded them was
another; and there is a great Difference between not Consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Proposal, and not Submitting to a Sovereign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="letter">

            <p>To say that these mischievous Consequences are not absolutely necessary,
and therefore do not affect the Conscience, because we are not certain
they will follow, is a very mean Objection. Moral Actions indeed have not
such necessary Consequences, as Natural Causes have Necessary Effects;
because no Moral Causes act necessarily. Reading the Declaration
will not as necessarily destroy the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as Fire burns
Wood; but if the Consequence be plain and evident, the most likely
thing that can happen, if it be unreasonable to expect any other, if it
be what is plainly intended and designed, either I must never have any
regard to Moral Consequences of my Actions, or if ever they are to be
consider'd, they are in this case.</p>
            <p>Why are the Nobility and Gentry so extremely averse to the Repeal
of the Test and Penal Laws? why do they forfeit the King's Favour,
and their Honourable Stations, rather than comply with it? If you say
that this tends to destroy the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Protestant
Religion, I ask whether this be the necessary consequence of it? whether
the King cannot keep his Promise to the Church of <hi>England</hi> if the
Test and Penal Laws be repealed? We cannot say, but this may be:
and yet the Nation does not think fit to try it; and we commend those
Great Men who deny it; and if the same Questions were put to us,
we think we ought in Conscience to deny them our selves: and are there
not as high probabilities, that our Reading the Declaration will promote
the Repeal of the Test and Penal Laws, as that such a Repeal will ruine
our Constitution, and bring in Popery upon us? Is it not as probable,
that such a Complyance in us, will disoblige all the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who have hitherto been firm to us, as that when the power of the
Nation is put into Popish Hands; by the Repeal of such Tests and Laws,
the Priests and Iesuites may find some <hi>salvo</hi> for the Kings Conscience,
and persuade him to forget his Promise to the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
and if the probable ill consequences of Repealing the Test and Penal
Laws, be a good reason not to comply with it, I cannot see but that the as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65759:10"/>
probable ill consequences of Reading the Declaration, is as good a reason
not to Read it.</p>

            <p>These are all meer Comments and Descants of the City-Clergyman,
upon the Honour and Conscience of his Majesty,
and the evil design of the Declaration upon the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
drawn from Probabilities of the evil consequences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
the Penal Laws and Test, which the Church of <hi>England</hi>
must no more part with, then the <hi>Iews</hi> with their Ark, without
exposing themselves to utter ruine and destruction. For the
charitable Clergyman takes no care of any other part of the
Protestant Religion, so the Church of <hi>England</hi> be secure. To
all which if he would have but vouchsaf'd to have read the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
he might have found an Answer shining fully out, and
dispelling all the Fogs and Mists of his Probable Consequences
in His Majesty's own words; where he declares a second time,
<hi>That ever since His</hi> granting <hi>the Indulgence, he has made it</hi> His
<hi>principal Care to see it preserved without distinction;</hi> And farther
adds his Resolutions, <hi>To use His utmost Endeavours</hi> to Establish
<hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> on such just and equal foundations, as will
render it unalterable, and <hi>seoure to</hi> All <hi>People the free Exercise of
their Religion for ever.</hi> But this will not serve the City-Clergy-man's
turn; he must have the Rains of Temporal
as well as Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in his own hand, and
drive on for ever, or else there is nothing to be done.
They are like <hi>Caesar,</hi> contemning all Superiors; and like <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
disdaining all Equals. A passionate conceit of their own
Perfection above all other, which no Man of common sense
can be reconcil'd to; and a convincing Argument that those
Persons must have but little or no Conscience themselves, who
with so much vigor and obstinacy labour to uphold a Civil Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of Penal Laws and Tests, so directly opposite to all the
Dictates of Conscience and Reason.</p>

            <p>The most material Objection is, That the Dissenters, whom we
ought not to provoke, will expound our not Reading it, to be the effect
of a Persecuting Spirit: Now I wonder Men should lay any weight on
this, who will not allow the most probable consequences of our Actions,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65759:10"/>
to have any influence upon Conscience; for if we must compare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
to disoblige all the Nobility and Gentry by Reading it, is
likely to be much more fatal, than to anger the Dissenters; and it is
more likely, and there is much more reason for it, that one should be
offended than the other: For the Dissenters who are Wise and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
are sensible of the Snare themselves, and though they desire
Ease and Liberty, they are not willing to have it with such apparent
hazard of Church and State: I am sure that though we were never so
desirous that they might have their Liberty, (and when there is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of shewing our Inclinations without danger, they may
find that we are not such Persecutors as we are represented,) yet we
cannot consent that they should have it this way, which they will find
the dearest Liberty that ever was granted.</p>

            <p>After his Complements put upon the Nobility and Gentry
of the Nation, the Author of the Letter descends to scrape a
new acquaintance with the Dissenters, and fain would draw
them into his Belief, upon a very odd surmise, that they
are now in some kind of manner reconcil'd. But the
Complement is at such a remote distance, that he betray'd his
Politicks to court them at such an indifferent rate. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his Expressions are so obscure, that if this Church of
<hi>England</hi> Man, is so nice that he dare not trust the King upon
such clear and solemn Promises, the Dissenters, who have had
such severe Experience of their Favours, have much less rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to credit the forc'd Complement of the <hi>City-Clergyman.</hi>
This is only to be wonder'd at, that the <hi>City-Clergyman</hi> should
make the King so dear a Seller of <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> when
there was no Price could purchase it from the Persecution of
the Penal Law-Men, his undoubted Brethren.</p>

ever was printed: For as to this City which hath above a Hundred
Parishes in it, it was Read only in Four or Five Churches, all the rest
and best of the Clergy refusing it every where. I will spare their
Names who Read it; but should I mention them, it would make you who

And for the Surprize he talks of, the contrary of it is so true, that in
