         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Faith in Christs blood, which
was shed for you; with asmuch
Hope and Charity of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
that you can purchase
with teares vnfained, from the
Garden of Gods Word, of
each of these a like quantity,
and put them into the vessell

<pb facs="tcp:20509:3"/>
and let them boile well

hearty loue, till you see by the

feele by your zeale illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the black fome of the loue
of the world to stinke in your
stomacke. Then scumme it off
with the spoone of faithfull
prayer: that done, take the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
cloath of Christs
pure innocency, and couer
you warme with as many
cloathes of the Amendment
of life as God shall strengthen
you to beare: And then lie
downe on your bed, ioyned
with the peace of God, and
sweat out all the vile poison of
couetousnesse, Idolatry, and
the participation thereof, with
alkind of pride, oppression, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion,

enuie, swearing, adultery,

theft, drunkennesse, sloth, and

through the limbeck of a clean
heart: then apply the sweet
ointment of a good conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and lay it to your nose,
for feare you smell after your
neighbors goods: And when
you feele your selfe clensed
from all these fore-named dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
then take the powder of
Say-well, and lay it on your
tongue to sauour your mouth,
and the eares of the hearers;

Doe-well. And anoint your

to doe good workes, that
they may be supple and ready
to minister to the poore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
members of Christ as
you see good occasion and are
able: but beware of taking the
wind of vaine-glory in the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
<pb facs="tcp:20509:4"/>
lest the daily gusts therof
do you much harme, let these
bee incorporated all into one
body with the iuyce of the
Herbe of Grace, of which if
thou faile, all the rest will doe
thee little pleasure, neither can
they bee operatiue to either
soule or body. And then arise
from sin willingly, &amp; walk out
your course worthily: and take
vp Christs crosse patiently and
beare it thankfully: obserue
these precepts carefully, and

pray these prayers following
zealously, and God will blesse

sure to put thy knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

thou needst not feare, since

            <p>10 Let thy company where

late and far off, if rich, quickly
and neer home, let thy wife be
either vertuous, noble, rich, or

Nobilitie and riches may be a

is faire as her face, hansome
and neat in her apparell, not
gay, nor sluttish; silent, yet not

shew but for vse also, so shalt
thou not onely content but
pleasure thy friends, whose

not onely please all men, but
shall get thee the name of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous.</p>
            <p>19 Let thy seruants bee so
many as thou mayest imploy
in honest offices, such as will
neither be idle nor ill imployd:
for thy house affaires choose
aged &amp; well experienced men,
rather profitable then han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
but such as waite on thy
person or thy friends, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-like
in body or mind, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let drudges, as horse-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers

come neere thy person, or thy
table, for either their rude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
or ill smell will bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue.
For thy maidseruants
take this rule, let thy house bee
well deckt with them (such I
meane as be hansome) for they
grace a house more then all
thy other furniture, and let thy
wife haue alwayes a couple of
Gentlewomen to attend her
person at the least, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that sluts and foule sowes
will haue alwaies sluttish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>

a god of our belly, a god of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
affection: we haue blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
thy holy name: wee
haue profaned thy Sabbaths:
we haue polluted thy Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary:
wee haue despised thy
Word: we haue done all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of euill in thy sight, and the
feare of thy Maiesty hath not
beene before vs. Thy mercy
hath not allured vs, thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
haue not terrified vs;
but with a high hand we haue
heaped sinne vpon sinne, and
gone on still in all manner of
wickednesse, vntill wee haue
made it too heauy a burden
for vs to beare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20509:10"/>
What then belongs vnto vs
thou iust Iudge of all the
world, but eternall confusion
both of soule and body. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
appealing from
thy iustice, wee implore thy
mercy, and intreat thee in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ to be reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs; for his sake to pardon
and forgiue vs all our sins, to
naile them on his Crosse, to
bury them in his graue, and to
warn them away in his most
pretious bloud. Wash vs O
Lord, and wee shall be clean:
clense vs, and wee shall passe
the snow in whitnesse: Good
Lord be mercifull vnto vs, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and forgiue vs all that is
past, and giue vs grace to leade
a more holy life then we haue
done hitherto. And to this
end, O blessed Lord God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our hearts are the sinkes
<pb facs="tcp:20509:10"/>
of all our sinnes, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of all our vncleannesse,
sanctifie our vncleane hearts,
mortifie our sinfull affections,
pacifie our impure thoughts,
clense our wicked cogitations:
O Lord renew a right spirit
within vs, O Lord giue vs
grace to conceiue aright of
the wonderfull things of thy
Law, &amp; to practice the things
that concerne thy glory.</p>
            <p>And because O Lord wee
should be the more vnworthy
to receiue any good thing
from thee, if we should not be
truly thankfull for those many
good things which we haue
already receiued, we render
vnto thy diuine Maiesty all
possible praise and thankes for
all those blessings which thou
hast so mercifully from time
to time bestowed vpon vs. We
<pb facs="tcp:20509:11"/>
thanke thee O Lord for our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
before we were: for
our creation and what we are:
for our redemption when we
were lost: for our iustification,
and sanctification in this life,
and for our assured hope of
glorification in the life to
come.</p>
            <p>We thanke thee deare Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for whatsoeuer good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
either soule or body: for
our liues, and for our liberty:
for our peace, &amp; for our plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for our health, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie:
and aboue all, for the
sweet and inestimable iewell of
thy holy Word. Thou hast
been more gracious to vs, then
to other Nations. O Lord we
were a people that sate in
darknesse and in the shadow
of death, but thou hast opened
our eyes, and giuen vs a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
<pb facs="tcp:20509:11"/>
for our feete, and a light
for our paths: let not our sins
we beseech thee, remoue this
candle-sticke from vs.</p>
            <p>Wee thanke thee O Lord,
that thou hast sealed vnto our
consciences the free, and full
remission of all our sinnes in
Christ Iesus.</p>
            <p>Wee thanke thee that thou
hast kept vs from many sinnes
which our fraile nature might
haue committed, and for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
vs from many dangers
whereinto we might haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len:
Lord keepe vs both from
sinne and danger.</p>
            <p>And because both of the
weaknesse of our nature, and
the number of our enemies,
how busie they are to tempt,
&amp; how ready we are to yeeld,
Lord shield vs with thy grace,
and protect vs with thy Spirit
<pb facs="tcp:20509:12"/>
against all the assaults &amp; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
both of the world, the
flesh, and the deuill. Let not
the flesh allure vs, let not
the world bewitch vs, let not
the deuill vanquish vs; but
grant good God, that by the
mediation of Christ, and the
assistance of thy blessed Spirit,
against all these we may be
more then conquerours.</p>
            <p>Wee thanke thee O Lord
that thou hast preserued vs to
this present houre; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the time of our pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
here on earth is but
short, Lord giue vs grace to
spend it in thy feare: teach vs
to number our dayes, and that
little time we haue to liue to
bestow it wisely. And for as
much as thy Kingdome O
Christ is not of this world,
neither consisteth in meat, or
<pb facs="tcp:20509:12"/>
drinke, but in righteousnesse,
and peace, and ioy in the holy
Ghost, grant O heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that we renouncing this

thy mercy is far aboue all thy

And how can it be, but with

And therefore (O Lord) I

thee most blessed Trinitie, to
fight valiantly against Satan,
and wisely to preuent all his
practises against me. And here
(O Lord) according as I am
bound, I render vnto thee all
possible praise and thankes for
all those blessings and benefits
which thou so graciously and

for my health, wealth, foode,
