            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Enemy or other; nay the very Walls of some Towns (so narrowly they are prest) frontire unto both. Mean time, imagine with what heart I can behold so many noble creatures (so nobly obliging me) suffering under so many heavy Calamities, one's Territory spoyl'd, an others Castles raz'd unto the ground, and all reduc'd by it to such want and povertie, as I heard a Great <hi>Princesse</hi> say not long since, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she had reform'd her House and Family al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to a fourth part, That she fear'd she should be forc'd to Spinn to maintain the rest. Yet do they venture Lives &amp; Fortunes here to maintain their King in possession of his own, whilst better cheap they might be subject to an other Prince, and change hands, only by crossing of their Arms, and sitting still (a rare Example of Loyalty in Subjects now adayes.) <hi>Italy</hi> then, being the only Country now free from Wars, and the miseries it brings in train of it, thither I resolve to go, in search of that Peace all Countrys have lost but it. And if you ask me, with what heart I can leave this Noble Company, I am so much obliged unto? Truly, just with such an one as I should depart with Life, or whatever were dearer unto me then it; Nor could I ever resolve to do it, without hope of returning soon again, and some sudden change of Fortune. Mean time, part of my Grief, and resentment of my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I have endeavoured to expresse in this following copy of Verses, which, cause

            <p>The Copy of that Letter Count <hi>de Ogniato</hi> thought fit to make use of, to injealouse the <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi> upon the arrival of the Duke <hi>Guise,</hi> as written from <hi>France</hi> intercepted and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is thus.</p>

to waken their jealousies, that he intends to set on foot the Title of that house again; pray let him be advised of it.

to fill our sayls, and the air so pure, as in comparison with the pleasure of it there, it seemes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>paine</hi> to breath on Land, where the air is stuffing, suffocating, and noisom, tainted as it passes with Ordures and Filth, (there being few Countryes like <hi>Arabia,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording more sweets than stenches) whereas that of the Sea comes purely (as it were) drayn'd and purified by the Sun-beams, as it passes to the sence. Then for other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, you have none on <hi>Land,</hi> but we had some at Sea to equal it; and to begin with the most incredible, Hawking and Hunting. (besides Fishing) we had perpetually for more than a moneth together. Our ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all incompast with <hi>Dorado's</hi> or shining Fishes (somwhat like <hi>Dolphins</hi>) hunting the Flying Fishes, which you might see on Top of the water, fluttering to escape, and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rado's</hi> bounding to overtake them, till being hard pursued, and so near prest, as they were in danger to be ta'n, the poor flying Fish would get on wing, and flying one danger, incurre another; for a slight of Sea fowl (call'd <hi>Booby's</hi> by the <hi>English</hi>) followed us all the way hovering in the air, in expectance of their prey, seeing the flying fish on wing, would stoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40918:36"/>
with many barbed heads) never failing of their Cast, and this furnished us with fresh Fish all the time, it being excellent meat, short and crisp like our <hi>Salmons,</hi> and much like them in bignesse; which being ta'n, strange it was to behold the curious colours of its scales, fading by degrees, as death won on life, (just as the skies colour does when night comes on) till quite dead it became all black, with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it putting on mourning for its death, whose life had cloath'd it in such rich and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering colour. An other sort of Fish we took call'd the <hi>Shark</hi> or <hi>Tuberon,</hi> black and great as a <hi>Porpoise,</hi> with terrible long Teeth, huge wide jaws, and so ravenous, as at a bit 'twould snatch a <hi>Legg</hi> or <hi>Arm</hi> away of any it found swimming in the Sea; these have certaine little Fishes called the <hi>Pilot Fish,</hi> cleaving to them so fast by a <hi>Fynn</hi> o'th' top of the head, you can hardly separate them by any force: they have great heads, some spann long of body, and are excellent meat. Nor wanted we the pleasure of Gardens too at Sea, the Ocean (for many hundred miles from Land, and many miles together) being all cover'd over with a certain <hi>Green,</hi> so thick as the Ship could hardly make way tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough it, with many <hi>Gridiline</hi> Flowers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides like our <hi>Crocus's,</hi> rendring it a most delightfull spectacle. Then for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prospect, do but behold the rising and setting Sun, and you should see a

hundred several forms and figures, like your scenes in Masques and playes, with lights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, reflecting them to the Eye, and betwixt light and shadow, setting them off more resplendently to the view.

and much about that bulk; tis all green, the body being nothing but a collection of the leaves, which spred out towards the Top, and fall like plumes of Feathers, each leaf being some 6 foot in length, and 2 in bredth, on top of which, the fruit grows some 40 together in a bunch, in husks like Beans, all yellow when they are ripe, the fruit of colour and tast much like our <hi>Apricock,</hi> but much more firm and more delicious. For their <hi>Caijus,</hi> it is a sort of Tree of the bignes of our ordinary Apple-trees, the leaves like chesnut leaves, and fruit much like the bigger sort of green Figs, fastned to the Tree in lieu of stalk, by certain Chesnuts, which roasted are excellent meat, the fruit ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten whole, melts all away to juice, exceeding cooling and refreshing, excepting certain strings which hang in your teeth, so tough, you cannot swallow them.

For the rest, it produces neither <hi>Corn,</hi> nor <hi>Wine,</hi> nor <hi>Salt,</hi> which I attribute not so much to the difference of the Climate, as some politique reason to keep them with that necessary dependency on <hi>Portugal,</hi> to vent their commodities, and prevent revolt. Now for their Sugar thus it grows, and thus 'tis made; Their Sugar canes are prun'd to the heighth of standing corn: nor need they other culture, but every second year to cut them close by the roots, as we do <hi>Osiers,</hi> when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the next year they never fail to spring up agen, the flaggs of which Canes are of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant green, and shew a far off just like a Field of Corn, which being ripe about the month of <hi>Iune,</hi> they joint them in pieces some foot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>long, and carry them to the Mill, turn'd by <hi>Oxen,</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi> consisting of two round <hi>Cylinders,</hi> about the bignesse of <hi>Mil-posts,</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40918:48"/>
diminishing the Royal Authority, as on the contrary it rendred it, but the more absolute, whence they were deceived, who imagined the Parlament there an imperious Maister, as 'tis in some Countries, or an abject Vassal, as it is in others; it being rather in nature of an humble frend, to advise and counsel as often as was requisite for the Kingdoms good; That there are some things which like the wheels of Chariots, or wings of Birds, look like bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensom; when indeed they are but helps to support and lighten the burthen, and one of those things was the Parlament of <hi>England</hi>; not so much an Embarasment to the Royal power, as an expediating and faciliating it, not so much to Limit the Regal Authority, as not to leave it altogether Limitlesse, that its bounds was like that of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> boundles, but for its own conservation, that the King could do all things, but ruine and destroy himself and his Kingdoms, an Impuissance so far from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, as is that of <hi>Almighty God</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to sin, which is on the contrary one of his most God-like Attributes. In fine, that the King of <hi>England</hi> was one of the <hi>potentest</hi> Kings in the Christan world, but with his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament <hi>omnipotent,</hi> and that without that he was but one 'tis true; but that without him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For the rest of our affairs, his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had rendred him more intelligent; and he could say, That as 'tis not then when the House falls, that the ruin begins, but when

some main pillar or foundation is neglected, the want of maintaining which, draws on the Ruine of all the rest: So 'twas not now the Ruine of the Royal Authority began in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but then when the Schism began; when that foundation of Monarchy, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for <hi>Latin,</hi> it being no where a vulgar Language, but the <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite</hi> Tongue, take even the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> themselves (whose proper Language it ought to be) out of the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Schools,</hi> and you cannot doe them a greater displeasure, than speak <hi>Latin</hi> to them, so as it rather serves to <hi>interlard</hi> other Languages, than to make an intire meal of discourse, and but upon great necessity is never to be used. And now I'll tell you an observation or two concerning Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, e'r I end this Letter; and the first is, that (almost) all the Languages of <hi>Europe,</hi> are originally derived from the two main Fount<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ns of the <hi>Almain</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, the <hi>Italian, French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> branching from the last, as the <hi>Low Dutch, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nish, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> &amp;c. from the first. The next is the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they have, according as their Countryes, Border and Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ne one upon another, or by <hi>flux</hi> and <hi>reflux</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi>; The Italian for example being more Current in <hi>Turky</hi> than the <hi>French,</hi> for the first reason: As the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:40918:58"/>
(for the second) is more current than the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> there. The last is concerning your subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Languages, as the <hi>Walloon</hi> and <hi>Liegois</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Portuguez</hi> to the <hi>Spanish,</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> to <hi>English,</hi> &amp;c. all which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand you in speaking the chief or Master Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but not o'th contrary, and all these your Master Language says use but their old absolet words, as Servants wear their Masters old Garments, but they (too proud to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this) say rather, that as old men keep constant to their old fashions, whilst their Sons refine dayly upon them in bravery, and change for new, so the plainesse of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is but an Argument of the antiquity thereof.

If the memory of what they did were termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with themselves, or that memory no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appertained to them when they were gon, Hence 'tis, that this is used as a spur to incite men unto Vertue; 'Tis Fames Trumpet, that encourages men, and edges them to valor, and the sound of this like that of <hi>Meltiades</hi> Trophies to <hi>Themistocles,</hi> is still resounding in our Ears, and animating us to great and noble Actions; But if (as I say) we examine on th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, the frivolousnesse of the Thing, we shall find our selves impos'd by <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> and conclude with that <hi>Greek,</hi> who taken with the voice of the <hi>Nightingal,</hi> and imagining it

alive, and take whose list my Fame when I am dead, which at most, is but as the Eccho of dying voices, or the perfume of expiring Odours, rather shaddows than substances, and not so much as pictures, which terminate at least the imagination to certain <hi>species</hi> and Resemblances.

                  <hi>Mocking, Ieering</hi> and <hi>Derision,</hi> may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd a malicious publishing of others Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, with intent to render them ridiculous, (for if it be their Vices, 'tis <hi>Reproach</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely,</hi> and done on purpose to render them odious,) and 'tis lawfull in no case, but only when Imperfections are affected, to laugh them out of them; whence 'tis good when us'd for <hi>Physick,</hi> but when only for <hi>poison,</hi> 'tis detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. However, it becomes none but <hi>Buffoons,</hi> and under pain of becoming Ridiculous ones self, none is to endeavour to make others so. It tends to <hi>Enmitie,</hi> if it proceeds not thence; (for the faults of those we love, we seek to hide, and never seek to find fault with any, but those we care not for:) Mean time, whilst they imagin they shew their wits, they but shew their folly by't, and want of wit, none more foolishly purchasing Enemies, than they; it being as great a folly for a <hi>Iest</hi> to lose a Frend, as to sell ones <hi>Horse</hi> to buy him <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender.</hi> 'Tis a dangerous Vice too, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the occasion of quarrel, (whilst it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40918:63"/>
touches men where th'are most sensible) and therefore none but Women may safely use it; which is the cause (perhaps) why now adayes more <hi>women</hi> ar tainted with this vice than <hi>men.</hi> And if you mark it, their Mocking and Jeering at others, is principally for not being fine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and <hi>a la mode</hi> (forsooth) they learning by looking on their <hi>Glasses,</hi> to looke on nothing but superficial things; (having more regard to the discomposure of ones <hi>Garments,</hi> than of their <hi>manners,</hi> and the disorder of their <hi>hair,</hi> than of their <hi>mind</hi>) and for such as these, your blunt man marrs their mirth, his not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put out of Countenance by't, putting them out of countenance themselves: Such an one was our Countrymen Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> an excellent Souldier, but a blunt Courtier, who coming to Court after the losse of <hi>Sluce</hi> in <hi>Flandres,</hi> and being jeer'd for it by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with <hi>Is this he that deliver'd up Sluce?</hi> Pray let's see him, a <hi>doughty souldier no doubt he is.</hi>
                  <q>Answered them <hi>brusquely,</hi> Yes Ladies, I am he; and on so good conditions, there is none of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but would have deliver'd up your <hi>Sluces</hi> too.</q> Nor did he spare <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> her self, when waiting long at Court to deliver a certain Petition for arrears of pay, and the <hi>Queen</hi> not willing to see him, he one day Encountring her where was no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding him, she, to put him out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, feign'd to smell some evil savour in the Room, crying nicely out, <hi>Fogh, What a stink's

here? Williams,</hi> I think it be your Boots (said she) that smell so. No by — said he, 'tis my Petition (<hi>Madam</hi>) I have kept it so long, e'r I could get it deliver'd. But to return to our subject. There are divers sorts of <hi>Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> and <hi>Mockery</hi>; Some by whisper, others more openly; some before ones face; others behind ones back; some finaly by laughing out-right, and others <hi>Ironically,</hi> and by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled scorn: Of which, that of whisper is commonly the most offensive, which, whilst it takes away all place from Reply, leaves place to imagine the Injury greater than it is; whence, whilst the Affront perhaps regards but one, the Offence of it extends it self to all. Your publique way of Jeering is most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and your secret more base and cowardly; above all your <hi>Ironicall</hi> one does the least harm to those they mock, and the most to those who use it; it marring their Natures quite, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them falshood and dissembling. And generally those who are so diligent in marking others faults and Imperfections, must needs be full of Faults and Imperfections themselves; Since, whilst their minds are still abroad to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve others faults, they can never be at home to mark and amend their own. In fine, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever light they make of it, they are to know, that no Generous spirit but can easilier brook Injury than Scorn, and the reparation of it too, is easier made: and that they but render themselves by it odious unto all, it being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40918:64"/>
for men to love those who esteem them, as tis to hate all those who disesteem them, (as those who mock and jeer them manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare they do.) To conclude, I could with them only to observe this rule, Never to say any thing of others, but what they would say be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their faces, or what they would others should say of them behind their backs.</p>

            <head>XXXIX To the Lady, —</head>
            <head type="sub">How we are to contemn the Calumnies of the World.</head>
            <p>I Never knew any one nobly eminent in any kind but they were envyed and calumniated; It being the nature of base and low spirits, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to arrive to that height, to which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by their merits and excellencies are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, to seek by detraction to pluck them down as low as they; nor will it be ever so happy with the world, to have more Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors than Envious: Emulation making men strive to be as good as others, but Envy to make others as bad as it, whence this vice is only found amongst the worser sort, to whom every one thats better than they seems to exprobate their being so ill; so as 'tis either some particular hate or self love that blinds them from seeing their own faults as well as those of other mens, else they would never calumniate others as they do, if they but considered, that one ought to be most cleer themselves of those faults they reproach to others, and he who cheaply sells others fame (upon th' accompt) makes but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket to buy his own. Mean while it being as impossible all should speak well, as that all
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40918:67"/>
should do well, and 'tis not what we are, but what they are that make them speak ill of us: we are to indeavour so to live, as our lives may give the lie to their reports, and that they may never say true any harm of us, and let them say false what they please, twill be more their own harm than ours.</p>
            <p>To this purpose (Madam) I'll tell you a pleasant story, which I use often to recount, when I would laugh at these busie Censurers of others Actions. An <hi>Old man</hi> and his Son (a young stripling) travelling on the way, the <hi>Boy</hi> mounted on an <hi>Asse,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> trud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it on foot; The first Company they met began to revile the <hi>Boy,</hi> calling him ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Rascal,</hi> was he not asham'd to ride, and let his <hi>Father</hi> walk on foot (nor must you i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine the charitable presage of hanging was forgot amongst them.) At this the <hi>Boy</hi> desired his <hi>Father</hi> to get up, and let him walk on foot; which being done, the next Company revil'd the <hi>Father</hi> as much as formerly tother had done the <hi>Son,</hi> calling him hard-hearted and cruel (strong and robustous as he was) to ride, and let the Tender Infant walk on foot; when the <hi>Father</hi> to content them took up his <hi>Son</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and so they jogg'd on a while, till the next Company raild on them afresh, for over-burthening the poor <hi>Asse,</hi> calling them more Beasts than he (nor did the <hi>Asse</hi> ever know before how many friends he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the multitude) when to content these
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40918:68"/>
at last the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> both light and led the <hi>Asse,</hi> which when the next Company e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spy'd, they laught at them more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had rail'd at them before, calling them a hundred fools, to tire and weary themselves, having an <hi>Asse</hi> to ride on: When the Good man perceiving the impossibility of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the world, and avoiding its censure, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolv'd thereafter to content himself, and let them judge and censure him as they pleas'd.</p>
            <p>And 'twas a wise resolution, I having found by experience, that one sooner stops <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he mouth of Calumnie by a resolute going on their way, than a too nice fear of irritating it, it being of the nature of Cowards, the more you fear it, the more outragious it becomes, and the vulgar like <hi>Apelles Coblar,</hi> but care for its censure once, and they will never leave censuring you; Mean time I know, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> says, that I am debtor in point of Fame both to the foolish and the wise, but if they wo'nt accept the payment, when tis lawfully tendered them, but find fault and cavill still; let them still remain unsatisfyed for me, and for that <hi>vae scandal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> that <hi>woe to scandal,</hi> 'tis to be understood where <hi>scandal</hi> is given, not where 'tis taken before 'tis gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, never brave spirit yet, car'd what the Vulgar said, nor ever was brave nor noble Action perform'd by those
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40918:68"/>
that did. Insomuch as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister them matter himself to censure him. <hi>Alexander</hi> gloried in it affirming nothing was more great, nor <hi>Kingly,</hi> than to do well, and hear ill for it; and <hi>Aristides</hi> was so offended at the peoples speaking well of him, as he askt his Friends, not without Indignation, What ill he had done that he should deserve it at their hands.</p>
            <p>But what should we goe so far for Examples, when we have others nearer home, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring to have heard of the late Earl of <hi>Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> how (amongst his many other Excellent Apothegms) he demanded one day of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Whether none spoke ill of him? and she assuring him they were so far from it, as (on the contrary) every one spoke well of him; <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>I am sorry for it,</hi> said he, for <hi>'tis a sign I have nothing of extraordinary,</hi> they <hi>being most commonly your</hi> ordinariest persons of <hi>whom the world speaks</hi> well, with the slight commendations of <hi>Oh he is a good man! An honest man</hi>! &amp;c. But God be thanked there is no great danger of that in the Age wherein we live, <hi>Calumny</hi> being so universal a a Trade now, as every one is of it; Neither need you take care to afford them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> matter, for they can make it of themselves, and out of themselves (as the Spider does) So whilst 'twas the Custom in antient Times (when there was more Charity in the world) to excuse the Act by the Intention, we are now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40918:69"/>
to such a height of uncharity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Intentision, when we cann't the Act, at least, calling Devotion, Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; Honest Liberty, Dissolutenesse; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, Flattery; nor is there any Action so Good, they cannot sind a bad name for; nor intail upon't an ill intention, insomuch as one was so injurious to his Mistris Beauty not long since to say,
<q>
                  <l>"Cease jealous Thoughts, and thus resolve at last,</l>
                  <l>"She has more Beautie than becomes the Chast,</l>
               </q>
Worthy of no Mistris, but such an ugly one as none should Love but he, who would intitle Deformity, rather then Beauty to vertue, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the intention of Nature, with whom it implies a certain fitnesse to conserve choicest Iewells in the fairest Cabinets, and to lodge the noblest persons in the stateliest Palaces; Yet such is the Iniquity of the Times, as Beauty only, because 'tis Beautiful, is calumniated now, as Vertue, because 'tis out of fashion: And this Madam is just your case, whose excessive Beautie makes you not onely the mark of Envious Eyes, but also of malicious Tongues, to spit their venome at, whilst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by your Innocence, their poyson, like the Cockatrices, but returns upon themselves. Mean time thank your beauty (<hi>Madam</hi>) or rather he who gave it you, for delivering you by it from the many vices of your detractors,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40918:69"/>
you having too many perfections to envy the praise of them in others, or to calumniate that in them, which is so praise worthy in your self, whilst you need not vex Nature nor your self, as they do, to become fairer than you are. To whom (or rather to the Truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) I must give this Testimony, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as a Spy of all that's fair and good, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd almost o'r all the world, I never met with greater Beauty accompanied with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Innocence, nor one who thought lesse harm, because she did none, nor judg'd lesse ill of others, because she knew none in her self, and of this your chearfulnesse and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of behaviour is to me sufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Those who dissemble most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over-doing, whilst they are over-anxious to do enough; whilst who are secretly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest, cloath it in an outward demurenesse, and feign'd modesty, which most commonly, like Gold gilt, shews fairer than Gold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>If any fault then there be, tis in the Time it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self, which though it can never warrant bad Actions, can render Indifferent warrantable at least, and so I see no reason but our behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as our fashons, may alter with the times, and become more large or strait, as the fashons are. To conclude this point, what is affected is deform'd. as what is naturall is ever beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as 'tis (Madam) in you to be cheerfully free, and in a word, your self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In which I wish
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40918:70"/>
none to imitate you, if they be not of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, nor you to alter, unlesse you be of theirs.</p>
            <p>Be still then your self (Madam) in spight of your Detractors; that is, one of the fairest and beautifullest creatures in the world, and let none make you lesse Good, by calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Goodnesse as they do; And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion assure your self, that as you shall never want Detractors of the baser sort: (as are all such who detract from you) So of the better and nobler you shall never want Admirers and Honoures: amongst the rest (Madam) I hope more than one Age, as more than one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall testifie how much I am your Faithfull Honourer and Admirer.</p>
