            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entles, I haue (with your fauours) deciphered a Load-starre, in whose gleames shine good will, &amp; whose glory is made splendent with loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loues onely grace. Sometime when Eagles haue tried their yong Birds with the Sun-beames, they wil direct their vndazeled eyes to gaze at the bright gleames of Poets, a lesse starre; whose twinkeling sparkelings may encrease their disports. And (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hearts) if your eyes that haue viewd the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sun-shine of Artes graces, deigne (after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of those mightie and magnanimous byrds) to beholde the dimme twinckeling of this vnperfect Load-starre; you shall not only hereafter giue life to my labors, but by your gentle acceptance, make me bold to aduenture the archtecture of some worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er worke. The subiect, which serues for the Zodiack to this wandring Starre (which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tinues the yeerly course of the Day-starre, through the twelue Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall

It may be some <hi>Zoylist</hi> will barke (as doo Wolues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Moone) following against it the humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous phrase of the base backbiter (all whose byrdes seeming to himselfe Swannes, and other winged foules but night Crowes) vomits forth to his owne shame, what hee supposeth should disgrace others credits: and wanting teeth (as dooth the infectious Serpent <hi>Porphyrius</hi>) not being able to bite, is by his suscepted enuious conceit (ingendred of the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of his owne singularitie (himselfe mostly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred. And what maisterdome is it to nip blossomes in their first spring? Can yoong byrdes flie till they proue and trie to plie their winges? Better kill Flies with a flap, than be idle; greater credit, to play small game with his owne charge, than great summes at a cast, to others cost; and more commendable, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish plaine labors, than to be reckoned mongst his acquaintance and friends for a sluggish loyterer. These weake reasons (Gentlemen) builded on a good ground, may not be denide to goe for currant, towards the free passe of this my pilgrim-like Starre, through the clymate of your acceptable eies: whose wandring course when you beholde, if you like it, loue it; if dislike it, I pray, leaue it; It hath tane ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by Astronomicall computation, at the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the gay Springtide, the 9. of March last past, in the 1599. yeare of the worldes redemption

(noted by the vertue of an Easterne Starre to three Sages) and from the worldes first creation, and the dayes of olde <hi>Adam,</hi> 5562. when the Sunne tooke his direct entrance (following his accustomed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse) towards the first minute of <hi>Aries:</hi> which signe Astronomers about that tide tearme Equinoctiall, because then (when the Sunne enters therein) the dayes which in length were before shorter than the nightes, become with them checke-mate in equall Longitude. The naturall heate &amp; moisture of which pleasant time, makes euery creature (as well vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable as reasonable) to receiue comfort; and in their kinde, to encrease and multiply. When the chaunting birds eccho in the woods and fields, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a delectable kerelie; when the earth araide in her pride, and deckt with diuers colours, yeelds admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to those, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>template on natures ornaments; which farre surpasse the reach of heauen-searching Art: And when, what pleasure may be obtained in Gardens (dyapred with sundry sorts of flourishing Roses and Flowers) or what solace, to see the sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging meades and pastorall Countries; and what health may bee had by following Phisicke rules; is both sought and practised. The worst is, that the coniunction then of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturne</hi> (noting a corruptnesse of the aire) may bee coniectured that many shall bee tormented with a chollericke &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie frenzie; which disease if it chance to breed enmitie mongst the friends of mutuall Louers, may hap to increase their grieuous sorrowes.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T what time (as the Historicall Records of auncient <hi>Anualls</hi> make mention) the King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> through the attempting brauados of some insulting Rebels, held the holde of his royall seate in hazard, as daily awaiting his downe-fall, drawne through ciuil warres, and warlike muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: There liued in <hi>Palermo,</hi> the chiefe Citie of <hi>Scicilia,</hi> two most renowned Families, by whose sp√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy helpes and strong supportes, both for men and Munition, prouided and sent forth both by sea &amp; land, the distressed Kings enemies were mightily discomfited, and farre discarded from his territories of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and he himselfe quietly repossessed his right: to the no smal comfort of the rebellious foe.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Scicilian</hi> suffrages were so copious, and so corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent to the Kings petition, wholy passionate for want of peace, as that the Rebels being conuinced and vtterly subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were so scattered here and there with the suddaine assault of flie, flie, as that some ranne to the matchlesse mountaines, and there wrought on themselues ruthfull massacres: Others sought out shelters in the wilde Forrests, and there for want off<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>de, and surprized with feare of wilde beastes, remained in the iawes of dreadful death: Others as extrauagant vagabo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ds exiled themselues from their natiue homes into forraign lands: and fearing their owne Country would proue too hot for their rebellious hearts: Others became Gally-slaues, Rouers and Pyrates at sea, ventering the meane of their best liues, twixt <hi>Scilla</hi> &amp; rauenous <hi>Charibdis</hi>: fewe submitting to their Liege,
<pb facs="tcp:20326:5"/>
for feare of the penaltie of lawe: yet fewe or none through the iust decr√©e of the dooming heauens escaping punishment.</p>
            <p>This inestimable benefite by the two <hi>Scicilian</hi> Nobles bestowed on this peace-minding King, wrought no small league of friendship and friendly amitie, both twixt <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Scicilia</hi>: so farre forth, that whatsoeuer enemy s√©em'd repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the one, was accounted rebellious to the other: both esteeming themselues most fortunate, that euer the tantaras of warres so raigned, as to make their perdurable and pligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peace on both parties so worthily royaliz'd mongst other nations, and their neighbour Countries.</p>
            <p>The two famous, honourable and renowned <hi>Scicilian</hi> Families, that were with all prosperities so maiestically forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, were <hi>Seigniour Iacomin Pierro,</hi> and <hi>Don Alexander Bartolo</hi>; whom Nature and Fortune s√©eking to inrich in the highest measure with prodigall gifts, straind themselues so far, as that Fortune could bestow no more wealth, for they raignd haile-copemates with kings; nor Nature any more worth, for that two sw√©ete ofsprings brought to both parties more pleasure, than do the massie heapes of golden wealth comfort vnto the couetous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seignior Pierra</hi> had a sonne, and <hi>Don Bartolo</hi> a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the one as liuely, as the other was louely; both adornd and beautified with all exquisite perfections both of body &amp; mind.</p>
            <p>And h√©ere (Gentles) would I wil you to haue some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <hi>Pharus</hi> erected, for the better direction of your longing spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, to viewe the variable motion of this wandring Loade-starre: eying whose course, your eyes wil be carried beyond ken of some credulitie: your eares be replenished with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sounds of material varietie; and your hearts (I hope) be procurde to y√©eld such materiall collusions some part of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full applauditie.</p>
            <p>On a winters night, when the Sunne had trauerst in the clymate of the West, and was instantly entering into <hi>Aquarius</hi>; when brumall frosts and boystrous showres were most predominant, and men vse to expell the congealing colde

               </gap>uggishnesse and drowsie sloth: vsed argumentall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, concerning the chiefe perficies of <hi>Summum Bonum</hi> or the chiefest good.</p>
            <p>Some, (as that first of all I may remember our present pastimes) saide downe many groundes, touching pleasure, feastings, carowses, and such like, and therein to be containde a <hi>Summum Bonum:</hi> For what greater felicitie (according to mans carnall reason) may be enioyed on earth, than to liue merrily voyd of care, and fr√©e from perturbations? We reade, that there were diuers festiualls celebrated and seriously obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, with the common consent of whole Countries, by the <hi>Bacchinalls</hi>: Diuers games accustomed, as some ordained by <hi>Apollo,</hi> after the downfall of the huge Serpent <hi>Pithon,</hi> which were titled <hi>Pithonia</hi>; And far haue the games of <hi>Olimpus</hi> bin bruted, where all commers spent the time in myrth, iollitie, and abundant cheare. All which considered, it mou'd the Sect of the <hi>Epicures</hi> to aduaunce worldly pleasure vnto the height of <hi>Summum Bonum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Pierro</hi> thus reasoned, there came a suddain mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, that informed, how his sonne young <hi>lacomin</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a suddaine traunce, and had lost both his sp√©ech &amp; sence, euen ready to y√©eld vp the ghoast.</p>
            <p>No sooner was that message done, but that newes was brought to <hi>Bartolo,</hi> that if he would euer behold his daughter <hi>Katherina</hi> liuing, he should hasten horne, for that she was
<pb facs="tcp:20326:7"/>
falne into a suddaine consumption, and euen worne to skin and bone, as if she had bene ouer-looked by some outragious monster.</p>
            <p>These sorrowfull tydings so amazed these Parents, that (as impatient as olde <hi>Priam,</hi> that sawe his children all lie gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and the Citie on fire) they began on both sides to be euen through outrage at their wittes ende: Lifting cries vp to the heauens, tearing their haires, and raging gainst the Deste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that had so cruelly concluded the period of all their future hopes in so short a circuite: cutting off those braunches, by whose fruites they expected to liue after their olde barkes were withered. <hi>Don Andrea</hi> comforted them, the whole assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreated them, nought auailed; for their hearts burned with fire, and their mindes with feare, vntil their longing eies visited their distressed ofsprings: And so with paces as swift as their distempered f√©ete could support, they hasted both to their seuerall homes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Andrea Alizandra</hi> considering this vnexpected chaunge, through so vnfortunate a chaunce, set downe his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as a principle that <hi>Omnia humana mutabilia.</hi> But what (saith he) should I, that from my infancie haue bene attendant on the buckelings of couragious <hi>Mars,</hi> now s√©eme to muster in sentences vnder the correction of graue <hi>Minerua? Victa est fortuna ferendo.</hi> I haue indurde, and so haue ouercome: They are but Fortunes nouices, that cannot with patience oppugne any inconuenience; A death is due to nature, and the sooner that we die, the sooner are our debtt's satisfied.</p>
            <p>Men may not be mortall, then would the creature aduance him beyond the Creator: As <hi>Prometheus</hi> would, attempting to steale the fire of eternall life from heauen: for which cause <hi>Iupiter</hi> adiudged him to be tyed at colde <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and there eternally to haue his limmes deuoured by a Uulture. <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus sua sorte, beatior Policrate.</hi> I, I, a contented minde is all in all. Did we not sometime taste the sowre, we should not well perceiue the sw√©et: were we not now and then crost with mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, we could not know what it were to be fortunate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20326:7"/>Peace is the mother of securitie, and securitie the nurse of pouertie, and pouertie the author of infamie: for, <hi>nil habet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foelix, paupertas durius in se, quam quod ridiculos homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes facit.</hi> And yet must we gratefully welcome all, that the supernall Gods do send to worke our triall: and happie, yea thrice happy is that man that so may be purified. Hauing thus contemplated with himselfe on the foresaid accidents, to driue off that encreasing melancholy passion, he tooke in hand his Lute, and thereon recorded this Dittie.</p>

            <p>But it was otherwise, for his Father <hi>Pierro</hi> (hauing not s√©ene him many houres before) welcomming certaine friends of his, newly come to <hi>Palermo</hi>: caused young <hi>Iacomin</hi> to come in presence (who then for the absence of one, hated the presence of all) to k√©epe them conference, and beare them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>

            <p>Can a celestiall vertue haue incontinencie? then what incontinencie is contained in Loue, whose vertue is celestiall?

I speake not of fained loue, whose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is not made perfect in the inmost roomes of the heart; but standing without such entring, is seated for a while on the outward eye-lids: whose societie is warie with a looke, and lost with a winke: whose appendix is lust, and index leaudnesse. No, no, (quoth hee) such, all such doo I defie, not deifie: such doth my breast abhorre, and not vpholde; yea, such doth my very soule loathe, and neuer loue: because it is no loue.

So they that followe that shadow of loue, in seate thereof (for want of infusoe substance from aboue) persist with lustfull sin: whose contagion is shames nurse, and confusion the ofspring.

Some are Saturnists, and loue solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conceits: Some are Martialists, and admire at the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taras of warres: Some Bacchinalls, and are wholly addicted to pamper their stomacks: Some <hi>Midas</hi> mates, that will haue all they touch to turne to Gold: Some are like <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uas</hi> Owle, that delight to praise themselues, and disdaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And let them (said he) so wallow through and through in their humourous loues, guided onely by their sensuall appetites. Perseuere thou in that heauenly affect, which through infused loyaltie thou hast delighted: continue that course, which is through inspiration in th√©e begun: whose perfection, not all the power of the earth can make imperfect: whose perdurance, no battle are of violent passion can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frindge, nor the wide world by any meane disioyne the band thereof, nor diminish the vertue.</p>
            <p>Hauing made a stoppe to his sp√©ech, he vsed endeuour for their departure: and hauing prouided a Barke, and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to conduct the vessell through <hi>Oceanus</hi> watry regiment: giuing a watch-word at a time well appointed by the parties, for their conueyance aboorde, fardling such necessaries vp as were thought requisite, <hi>Katherina</hi> and himselfe at once were shipt: and the Marriners launcht forth into the d√©epe.</p>
            <p>I should haue giuen you (kind Gentles) to vnderstand, that at the very instant, that the poore woman (as is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited) was their vnsuspected messenger, <hi>Virgo</hi> was predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: whose vertue containd betwixt these Louers such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as that neither thought of perillous dangers to come, nor the plagues (if their drifts had bene espied) then present, could confront them, or reuoke them from their enterprise.

Threatning it to haue winter-like weather, (in stead of a faire haruest season) and to be molested in some respects with foggy inclosures, and bitter cold, mixed with very cold and windie moistures. What n√©ed I vse ambages? the sequell of our Louers euents will shewe, how there was some signe of chaungeable weather.</p>
            <p>For they had not sailed thr√©e dayes from <hi>Palermo,</hi> but that some Gallies appertaining to certain Pyrates, that were whilome competitors in the conspiracie and rebellion (before in the beginning mentioned) gainst the King of <hi>Tunise,</hi> had espied them scowting: and being led with hope of getting some purchase or pettie prize, made hastily towards them. Whom when the Barksmen had descried, not able (by reason of the calme) to make away from them, mistrusting they should b√©e set on, prouided their shotin readinesse, as resolued to vse their best endeuors to saue their own. Soone had the Gallies ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ane them, and fiercely chased them: that the Barke at last was fetcht vp, and by them being boorded, yet valiantly resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with hardie fight. Especially <hi>Iacomin,</hi> who (euen despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, carelesse whether he liued or died, so that his <hi>Katherina</hi> might be saued harmlesse) fought against the enemie with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie courage, and valiantly (defending the distressed vessell) laid on loade round about him: till that he was sore wounded, through encountring so many at their first entrances. At last through much bl√©eding he became faint: and then the pyrates (driuing the wearied and maimed Marriners to corners) rife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Barke: And hauing found <hi>Katherina</hi> in the cabin (as they were searching for wealth) euen all amort and woe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, for this extreame misfortune; hauing neither remorse of her laments, nor respect of her vowes, nor pittie of her plaints, nor any compassion of her praiers, pluckt her forth the cabin, carrying her perforce, conueyed her into their Gallies: And thus hauing taken all that was worth bearing away, turned towards <hi>Tunise.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Iacomin</hi> with wofull eyes (scarce able through faintnesse to lift vp his head) beholding his <hi>Katherina</hi> violently taken

But vsing pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence perforce, through the Marriners helping meanes, as the winde and tide would afford, made after their enemies: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that way, sooner then on any other coast, to come a shore, and obtaine succour.</p>
            <p>Was not this a shaking tempest (trowe y√©e) to br√©ed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their torments? It was <hi>Scorpio</hi> that incensed these Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers to fiercenesse, but <hi>Sagitarius</hi> that made them so mightie and magnificent in their attempts.

            <p>The lustie <hi>Tunisian</hi> Prince, being made frolicke (euer sithence the time that the two <hi>Scicilian</hi> families wrought meanes to beate downe his enemies) by continued peace, was become as wanton and effeminate, as <hi>Sardanapalus</hi>: placing all his felicitie in gallant womens beautie. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not lacke what his lustfull minde best liked: at one end of the Citie (where he held his royall Court had he built a stately Castle: where whose walls were of perdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable bricke, and couerings brasse, verie fairely flourisht with carued Images on the outmost lymites. But the artificiall diuisions and partitions, with glorious Galleries, and decked Chambers within, were by the skill of a cunning hand, made superexcellent.

There was imblazoned the Citie of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the glorious Pallaces of king <hi>Pryam</hi>: with all his valiant sons and daughters. There was <hi>Paris</hi> portraid, marching in pomp, with a troupe of gallants attending, through <hi>Troy,</hi> leading towards <hi>Ihum,</hi> the p√©erlesse Dame of <hi>Greece,</hi> hand in hand: whilest the princely Prophetesse <hi>Cassandra,</hi> with hands raisde to heauen, and haire hanging downe ouer her shoulders, cried out, <hi>Graia iuuenco venit, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Such as these s√©emed common in that bowerly Paradise: for euery Chamber s√©emed a myrrour of delight. But that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious edifice, which exc√©eded all the rest, was a Garret, which the king himselfe commonly at his pleasure would make his resting Pauilion. The side walles were ouerlaide with rich cloth of golo, ouer-diapred with admirable bright Margarites, and glorious Pirops: that in the night lightned with splendor the whole Chamber ouer with such cleare shine, as in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it s√©emed, the burnisht Sunne neuer was falne in the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.

The vaulted couering was shadowed with a gorgious Canapie, branched about with Angelicall features and gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring flowers.</p>
            <p>In the midst (directly vnder the Canapie) was placed a Chaire, imbost with silke, and costly knobbes of gold, so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lifted as a stately Throne. Ouer the head thereof, araied in liuely colours, was a Parliament of the Gods depainted, with gorgious roabes: Aboue all the troupe of which glorious Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, was portrayd a beauteous seate, whereon sate <hi>Cupid</hi> and his Loue ouerlooking them all, and treading on great <hi>loue</hi> and <hi>Iunos</hi> Dyadems. <hi>Cupid</hi> held in his hand a faire Scepter, wherewith (it s√©emed) he beckened to all the rest, as if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them: and his Loues browes were garnisht with a tryple Crowne, whereon Fortune laie figured bound in Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and her wh√©ele shiuered in p√©eces: On his Scepter was drawne in golden Letters this Poesie, <hi>Amor imperat astris:</hi> On her Crowne was this Motto, <hi>Sicforma, Diuos,</hi> fairly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen. The frames of the faire windows made all with Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine stone and Christall, beautified throughout with bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zures of honourable Armes, would oppose <hi>Apelles</hi> pencyll to portraie, much more my pen: for all was as admirable, as the Pallace of the radiant Sunne: describing the which, as <hi>Ouid</hi> did conclude the one, so may I likewise end the other (leauing the rest to your coniectures) and say, <hi>Artificem superabat opus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This so glorious Castle, supplied the place of an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for beauteous dames: for therein were inclosed the choice dainties of the Country, for the kings onely taste. They had all ease enough, but little libertie: fed and feasted sumptuously, but were neuer suffered to walke without doores: euery one had a seuerall Chamber for her owne commoditie, but could welcome none but the king their Louer: many wisht (it may be) to haue chaunge of meates beyond commons: yet scarce any durst on deaths penaltie let enter other dishe, than such as with allowance came from their Liege. So that, these sweetes were crost, with some sowres: these dainties were constrainds from chaunge of delicates, and all remained mewed for one mans diet.

            <p>And may it be (said sh√©e) that the iust Deities will deigne a wretch such fauour, as propitiously to rescue her in midst of hard extreames! Then (poore soule) prostrate thy selfe, and powre forth gratefull prayers, to their diuine powers.</p>

               <hi>Iacomin</hi> had not long soiournied at the Inne, (hauing kept his bed a day or two, more to get ease in minde, than for trouble of any daungerous disease in body: marrie his wounds were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what gr√©ene) but that his hurts were cured, and his body currant; yet in his minde continued such a corasiue, as made his colour chaunge, his complexion alter, and his strong composition extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.

With vacant steppes he treads through and through the str√©etes of the Citie, enquiring of many (whom in his walkes he met) for a woman lately taken on the Seas by certain Gallies, but could neither be enformed of the one, nor heare of the other. Which made him in minde so outragious, as the furious <hi>Palatine,</hi> when he suspected, <hi>Medor</hi> had plaid false with his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> abandoned all lawes of reasonable consideration, and cried out, woe, woe, woe, accursed caytiffe.

Pacing by the Castle (at which he wondred, it seemed in shewe so flourishing) he staied his steppes a litle, gazing at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen and carued Images with earnest lookes, imagining it to be some worthie Monasterie. Hauing sufficiently satisfied his sight, as he began in his waie to foote it forward, <hi>Katherina</hi> (hauing before espied him) eying him from a Casement of the wide window, calde <hi>Iacomin</hi> by name, twice or thrice aloud: vnto the which voice, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that a while he had listned, inquired, who calleth <hi>Iacomin?</hi> And therewithal lifting his eyes aloft at the windows, sawe her face, whom his heart so highly honoured. What <hi>Catherina</hi> (quoth he?) I, I, thy <hi>Katherina</hi> (my dears <hi>Iacomin</hi>) saide shee: And then for exceeding ioy both euen remained surprised with a sowning trance, hauing their sences euen ingaged by an extasie: But remembring themselues, <hi>Iacomin</hi> began to enquire how she happened into that hold, and to whom the house that held her so seuerely was belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging? Sh√©e repeated the whole summe and substance briefly vnto him: which <hi>Iacomin</hi> hauing heard, And pittie tis, I trow (said he) that so faire a place, should serue for so fowle a purpose.

            <p>And (quoth h√©e) as certainly as I busse this fist, wishing I might as easily touch your faire ch√©ekes, for requital of your tryed friendshippe, I will not faile to b√©e h√©ere at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>

his outrage was now quelled by reason.

            <p>When she beheld her Loue cr√©eping in at the Casement (dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with his suddaine presence from her <hi>momento</hi>) she ranne and receiued him in her armes with an heartie <hi>Saluie.</hi> And when they had imparted mutual <hi>congies,</hi> (their eyes courting each other with amorous glances and steadie lookes) they tel to louely imbracings:
<pb facs="tcp:20326:34"/>
and thus questioned <hi>Iacomin</hi> whilst he held her about the middle with folding armes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Katherina</hi> (said he) feruent loue hath made me light, to gaine thy company: and now suddaine doubt giues the onset against my brest, and suspect of afterclaps assaults my heart with hard battery, to make me y√©eld vnto dispaire. But the heauens and all the celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Godheads know, the vndaunted fortitude of my zealous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the constant motion of my loue-hallowing minde. For though seuen-mouthed <hi>Nilus</hi> should waxe drie, and that I should endure the thirst of <hi>Tantalus</hi>; or if my bread should turn to stones, and I abide more toyle than <hi>Sisiphus</hi>: If the earth should he turnd to st√©ele, the sea be set a fire, and the starres forsake the skie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come barres of brasse to affright me, to the intent I should change the motion of my life, or forsake loue; yet would I rather endure ten thousand deaths, than he found for my mindes mutation, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, faultring fickle and so faultie. And therefore (sw√©te <hi>Katheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) I coniure th√©e by the diuine essence of that loue, wherewith through the infusion of heauenly graces thou art inspired, towards me, tel me if the lewde king hath appointed any time to visit th√©e? By heauens innumerable ioyes (said she) possest by all the blessed Senate there, (deare Loue) I avow, thy <hi>Katherina</hi> neuer gaue consent that at any time the kings presence should repaire hither; neither haue I heard by any, that he mindes to visit me. Haue all bidden th√©e good night then (quoth <hi>Iacomin</hi>) and hath the k√©eper fast lockt the doores, or is not yet departed the Castle? Long since (said she) and therefore you n√©ed not doubt (I hope) of any danger: For no th√©efe on earth I protest whist I haue breath, shal rob you of your right and interest.</p>
            <p>These Lampes had not long possest the oyle of their parley, to lighten their thoughts, but that (after they had both together made them vnreadie, and were laide in bed) dimme sl√©epe drowsily eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their eye beames, with clowdie slumbers. So that their mindes, ere while the mappes of cares, and entertainers of watchful woes, were now (<hi>Endimion</hi>-like) growne carelesse; respecting neyther feareful Cautions, nor doubtful Caueats.</p>
            <p>This while was the King with his Guard come to the Castle, to court with louely Rhetoricke his new-come Goddesse, d√©eming,
<pb facs="tcp:20326:35"/>
that now her moodie minde, was by the pleasure of the place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mirthfull; and her heart, erst harned with sorrow, to be now softned with solace. And causing the k√©eper to vnlocke the gates, ascended the grosses, and came to <hi>Katherinas</hi> Chamber doore, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to open it: wherein when he entred, and beheld other ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there in bed, imbracing his <hi>Venus</hi>; not able to endure that sight, he flung forth the chamber, giuing them straight charge and command, that when these sl√©epers should awake, they should both be bound backe to backe to a stake, and end their liues (as traitors ought) in flames of fire: and hauing pronounced that wrathfull doome, with rage departed.</p>
            <p>Here (Gentles) should I tell you, how <hi>Iuno</hi> being incensed with anger for this accident, committed through <hi>Fortunes</hi> spite, (descending downe from <hi>Olympus</hi> in her glorious Chariot, drawn by her byrds, whose starr-<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ied prauncing plumes present before their mistresse eyes, so many prettie colours, as doth the Rain-bow in the heauens) checkt her presumption with an <hi>Egregiam vero laudem</hi>; and blamed the <hi>Faieries</hi> and <hi>Satyres</hi> for their slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; bidding them to binde fast her hands straighter, that she might not turne so thwartfully her maligning wh√©ele. But that must I n√©eds cut off to auoyd tediousnesse: yet will I giue you to knowe, that after sh√©e had rung a peale of scolding at <hi>Fortune</hi> (on the one side) and hadde gently (on the other side) chastised the negligence of her leaders; sh√©e entreated <hi>Morphens</hi> to obserue his part yet in any case: avowing by all her Deitie, rather then this faire couple should endure any wracke, shee would her selfe at the instance brandish foorth with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, to withstand all those that should performe theyr executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Flames? (said sh√©e) shall scorching flames consume my worthy subiects? No, Ile send <hi>Boreas,</hi> both with windes and showers to quench the fires: Whilest with <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> helpe, Ile hide them, as erst I did <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Dido,</hi> in some vaultie Caue.</p>
            <p>And so commaunded her glorious Foules (whose wings and taile-plumes stood proudly spread) in haste to carrie her vnto the highest heauens, from whence sh√©e entred to behold the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent:
<pb facs="tcp:20326:35"/>
minding wholly to conserue them both in safetie, although she should s√©e them bound at stake, and stand in extreamest peril of kindeling flames.</p>
            <p>Soundly yet rested these slumberings friends (little thinking what sowre sawce the King had ordained, minding it should bee mingled mongst their sw√©etes) til the trauayling Sunne was gone well onwarde in the East: All which time did the Kings Guard attend them. Assoone as their eyes awaking opened, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Kings being there, and of his bloudie sentence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against them. Whereat first they mourned, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward well resolued to endure their menaced death, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues readie to take the end of their liues on earth.</p>
            <p>Now (my Loue) quoth <hi>Katherina,</hi> shall the world beholde in vs, a spectacle, presenting fidelitie. In th√©e, loue; in m√©e, loyaltie; in th√©e, constancie: in m√©e, chastitie: in both, firme affection and sure confidence.</p>
            <p>As sh√©e would proc√©ed, the Executioners came, and bounde their armes, which both indured with admired patience: the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers pittying their distresse with some kinde remorse, and would haue spared them, had not they all bene bound on paine of death, to doo the Kings commaund.</p>
            <p>This while were some busied in putting vp the stake, some prouiding Faggots, Pitch <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ales, Strawe, and all other Fuell: Which br√©eding a rumour with suddaine admiration, in vulgar eares, multitudes came in heapes vnto the place of execution, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the performance of a wofull stratagem.</p>
            <p>Foorth at last were brought these wofull Louers, guarded on each side with Billes and Holbards, like rebellious Traytors: and bound they were to the stake, backe to backe, contrary to their mindes: who earnestly intreated the araigners, to suffer them end their liues face to face. But the cruel King had otherwise giuen in charge, and that bred their greatest griefe. Yet patience preuailed with them in this their too seuere handling.</p>
            <p>What, my deare, (quoth <hi>Iacomin</hi>) they may by this seperation robbe vs, of comfortable countenance in this fraile and transitorie life: but their crueltie cannot bereaue vs of sight in the glorious

            <p>Then were remorslesse brandes of fire brought to enkindle the Fuel: and <hi>Iuno</hi> had in readinesse placed watrie <hi>Iris</hi> directly ouer that clymate to shoote forth showres: When, loe (as pleased the iust pooming Deities, that at their good pleasures can preserue the vertuous from vniust persecutions, and vndeserued punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) the Lorde high Admyrall (drawne in a costly Coache of Ebonie) code by, and of the people inquired what the prisoners were: but was not resolued by any, but was told by all, they were straungers that were to die.</p>
            <p>His honour therefore standing on his saddle-cloth, questioned (comming neare vnto the stake) their names? He answered, <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comin</hi> mine: and mine <hi>Katherina</hi> said sh√©e.</p>
            <p>Of what Countrey (replied the Admirall) are ye? Of <hi>Scici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> (saide they). Of what place in <hi>Scicilia</hi>? (quoth the Admirall) Both of <hi>Palermo</hi> answered <hi>Iacomin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of what Parents in <hi>Palermo</hi> are you sprung? (saide h√©e) I am the haplesse sonne of <hi>Signior Iacomin Pierro,</hi> (answered the one.) And I the daughter of <hi>Don Alexander Bartolo</hi> (saide the other.) Dooth the King, who hath condemned ye (quoth he then hastily) know either of you?</p>
            <p>Neither of vs, and it shall please you, (answered they) neither skils it much that our extreame fortunes and perils indured should be knowne to his maiestie: for these flames shall ende our liues, and with our wretched liues, our extreame miseries. Yet be not driuen to dispaire (replied the Admirall) I wil to the Court, and conferre with the King concerning you: And then giuing in charge on paine of death that they should deferre a while (til they had word againe from him) to kindle the fires, he caused his Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to yerke onwarde his light-hoofed Iennets to the Court: where when he was arriued, and dismist from his Coache, was come into the Kings presence: after some salute, he thus with bold stomacke breathed forth sp√©eches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20326:36"/>Can they (quoth he) that place Kings, pull downe Kings? then looke thou once again to be beaten out of <hi>Tunise</hi>: For <hi>Scicilia,</hi> once our chiefe aide, will become our cruellest enemie: and thou be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to s√©eke a new Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The King hauing heard these cracking thunders, strooken with feare of some scorching lightnings to follow, mildly answered the Admirall with these words.</p>
            <p>Why, what is the cause my good Lord (said he) of these sudden threatnings? how haue I giuen occasion to make our friends foes? or <hi>Scicilia</hi> our enemies?</p>
            <p>Thou s√©ekest (replied the Admirall) to burne the flourishing braunches of those fruitefull stocks, which in thy greatest extreams stood as strongest supporters to hold thy f√©et from falling vnder Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells yoake. Doest thou not remember how scarce thrice seuen yeares sithens, <hi>Seigneor Iacomin Pierro,</hi> and <hi>Don Alexander Bartolo,</hi> the two egregious Uiceroyes of <hi>Scicilia</hi> (did by sending th√©e assistant Forces) seate th√©e (subduing valiantly thy insulting foes) safely in thy Kingdome? and now for requitall, doest thou s√©eme to burne the onely issue of them both? for that the two faithfull Louers s√©eke the fruition of their loues? why, the younge Gentleman that is yonder (like a Traytor) at the stake, is the sonne of <hi>Iacomin:</hi> and she, the daughter off <hi>Bartolo</hi>; both euen destroyed through thy vnknowne ignorance.</p>
            <p>Oh heauens! (quoth the King, breaking off this Dr√©ery tale ere it was ended) I would not for my Crowne and Kingdome haue proued so tyrannous.</p>
            <p>So tyrannous? (replied the Admirall) I well know not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are not yet tortured and turned to ashes or no: the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners were by th√©e so straightly charged, to hasten on their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and inkindle the fires.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Iupiter</hi> (then inraged said he) I am then vndone, vtterly vndone, vndone for euer. Ho whose there, ho? come hither one. Gallope to the stake yonder on a Courser, that can outrunne <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasus</hi> in swift set race: and s√©e if the prisoners there standing, do yet breathe aliue: what not there yet? Oh how my heart houers for heauinesse in my breast, as though it would get forth, and run thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before my posting seruant? had I ouer-carowst my selfe, and
<pb facs="tcp:20326:37"/>
ouerdrenched my braines with wine, as would the great golbing <hi>Alexander</hi>? that so drunkenly I condemned these straungers, enquiring neither what they were, whence they came, nor whither they would? Oh infortunate chaunce! Oh synister chaunge! By the Gods, if they suruiue, I will excommunicate from my breast this ill humour of lustfull venerie (engendred in me through wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton sloath) and will banish from my hosome all those Curtezan-like Danies: whose blandishments and insnaring flatteries haue so liuely vpheld my youthes leaud lust: For now, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer till now, did I conceiue what was true Loue: with which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper tytle, my subtle Concubines (queanish and whorish drabs as they are) haue mantled my vnbridled lust. And so long, as that my behauiour hath beene more brutish than the vnreasonable beasts.</p>
            <p>I now s√©e the vanitie thereof, for hereby was I ledde to worke this vnmercifull mischiefe on the liues of these two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Louers, whose setled mindes may b√©e made subiect to no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge.</p>
            <p>My amendment shall be my best repentance, for now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that, which long since I read, <hi>Optima paenitentia, vita noua</hi>; and yet doo I repent my franticke follies with hoartie griefe, and by the propitious helpes of the Gods, my modest liuing hereafter, shall wipe cleane away the blemishes of my former life, so viciously and vily ledde.</p>

            <p>Faire Princes (said he) I doubt not but the Deities haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the long lengthening of your dated dayes; and well may

your liues endure with happinesse. For by the lusters of your wel-willing and wel-liuing, doo I behold the leaudnesse of mine ill led life: by your vertues, my vices: by your loue, my lust: by your constancies, my incontinencies.</p>
            <p>And ioy I doo with incredible gladnesse, that by the bright beames of (now praised be Gods) your liuely lookes, I am put to wit of both your royall Parents: And therefore (Princes) now fr√©ely be frolicke: for we will feast away all perils forepast. And what pleasures I can wish or your selues will, do but (in token that you forgiue my intended iniuries vnwittingly minded against you) deigne to require or request: and commaund, rather than demaund: and I will performe it to the vttermost Ace.</p>
            <p>Then replied <hi>Iacomin,</hi> saying: Dread Prince, our verie soules abhorre the sparkes of vnhumaine reuenge: and our minds (alway debonaire towarde our friendes) indure not to thinke on intended or inacted iniuries.</p>
            <p>All the recompence that we would haue, is the hope, that our agr√©ements shall amend all amisses: and our loue, exile all loosenesse, (as you haue plighted by promise) for euer heereafter from your royall person: which will not only lift your honor (loft) vnto the highest altitude: but driue all into an admiration by so luckie a chaunge.</p>
            <p>Which being saide, the King taking his seate, willing also the rest so to take their ease: holding <hi>Iacomin</hi> by the hande (who then was placed nexte to his person) thus replied as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>Uertuous <hi>Scicilian,</hi> mine owne motion for my amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was much, but thy Princely words haue incensed me tenne times more. For proofe therefore that I am perfectly mooued with penitent compunction, behold what my minde wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ls me in your presence, and before all these my honourable Lordes to haue performed, though it portray mine highly deserued shame.</p>
            <p>Then calling foorthe the K√©eper of his Castle, h√©e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him, to bring before him, all these impudent dames, whose dishonesties had so mightily disgraced his honours and dignities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20326:38"/>And whilest the K√©eper went to accomplish his highnesse pleasure, he thus progressed in his sp√©ech.</p>
            <p>My Castle, where you, most chaste and modest <hi>Katherina</hi> (said he, turning toward the place where she sate) were inclosed, containes in holde a hundred lauish and licentious Dames, whose wanton dispositions, haue (like pitch) defiled the glory of my youth. These will I bannish farre from my Court, willing them to recall themselues: for (they say commonly) take away the cause, and the effect will die. I haue heard that <hi>Israels</hi> King, who before in the name of <hi>Iehoua</hi> his God, slew with a stone (which he sent from a sling) the huge Giant <hi>Goliath,</hi> consenting afterward to wanton sinne (that assaulted him whilest in a Gallerie he subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to idle sloath) wrought the murther of one of his dearest Lords: therby inkindling against him, both the wrath of his God, and incurring dishonor vnto his name. The like had I (vile wretch) offensiuely against you almost committed: but that some good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell guided our Admirall, to withstand such a mischiefe. Sith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so viciously to followe wantonnesse, is vily to be a bond slaue to all villainies: to shun the deadly seruitude of the one, I will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doo the diuellish instigation of the other.</p>
            <p>And with that entred the virgins into place: wherefore h√©e commaunded his Treasuror, to bestowe on them seuerally an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred markes: and so to conuey them from the Court, to leade the remnant of their liues in their natiue homes.</p>
            <p>Whose liberalitie bestowed towards them for their maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, was by all there present much commended. And then the King to driue away melancholy from all (that s√©emed to maruell at the lookes of his halfe-discontent darlings, and choise minions) caused Tables and dice to be brought forth, to br√©ed disporte: and Cardes in packs to be throwne on boord, to passe away the time, till the Cooke and Cator were prouided to serue in dinner. Himselfe at the Chesse-boord stood as a Chalenger; and younge <hi>Iacomin</hi> to shewe himselfe a champion, vndertooke the combat at that wittie weapon: alway with caution (after he had to trie, entred the lists) k√©eping him free from annoying checke. And when their gaming was ended, they feasted, and were frolicke.</p>
            <p>After this maner past these nobles the time together, for the
<pb facs="tcp:20326:38"/>
space of some thr√©e or foure dayes: in which time, the king had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided a gallant Fl√©ete to guide these <hi>Scicilians</hi> safely home to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo.</hi> And the Admirall made him ready to beare them company in that conduct.</p>
            <p>Now hath our <hi>Load-starre</hi> (Gentlemen) past <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and paceth like <hi>Athlantas</hi> Coursers, towards the exaltation of <hi>Pisces</hi>: whose scales shewing and shining bright and cleare, gaue him libertie now at last fr√©ely to prognosticate happy successe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the prosperous running of this wandring Starres race, am I in briefe to shut vp the Catostrophe of all the Scenes.</p>
            <p>Our yoong <hi>Scicilians,</hi> giuing the <hi>Tunisian</hi> King abundant thankes for their gracious entertainments; with the Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, departed from <hi>Tunise</hi>; and manned with a faire Fl√©ete, shipt themselues, and crost the Seas; cutting through the Ocean, till peaceably they attained the Port of <hi>Palermo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fame resounding through common eares report of their safe arriuall, moued the dissentious P√©eres, <hi>Pierro</hi> and <hi>Battolo,</hi> with seueral ioies, and yet could they not mittigate their rancord enuies, nor asswage their minds, from s√©eking mutual reuenge: in so much that they scarce deigned to bid welcome their owne children.</p>
            <p>Which being noised in the eares of <hi>Don Andrea Alizandra</hi> (then dwelling in the countrey) in regard of his countreys weale, and <hi>Scicilians</hi> well-fare, with all conuenient sp√©ed repaired to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo</hi>; and informing the <hi>Tunisian</hi> Admirall how disorderly eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing stood in hap-hazard; caused him by sound of Trumpet to summon the Citizens to the Parliament house.

Behold, the Gods in mercie haue wrought myraculous meanes to vnite your discentious Families againe togither, and to settle them in one concordant sympathy. S√©e your honourable issues, (euen dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen through your discords into deadly dispaire to haue any happie day, for condeigning of their loues) are beyond hope safely retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home to amend your tyrannous liues. May not you ioy at the vertuous amitie of your children (whose indissoluble league is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded both by the powers of heauen and earth) and abashed with shame, blush at your brutishnesse? Hath <hi>Tunise</hi> King, your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wel-wisher; and I, your present wel-willer, manned them hither with a gallant nauie, to haue this welcome? What shall we say, but as it is bruted of you in other countreys? that your two peace-fr√©ezing heads, seeme to enforce the quiet of all the members of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia,</hi> through cold choller to congeale? Is it not dishonour to hold such discord? is it not reproach to be accounted so rash? is it not infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, without sufficient cause to persist so enuious? then for shame chaunge your outragious angers, and entertaine chearefully these couragious Louers: I meane not one without the other, (for they both are one) but both in one, and one in both. Then shall your rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous estate be corroborated, your honours standing (in hazard) remaine fortified; and your countreys commodities decaying, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly multiplied.</p>

loud shoutes, and admirable shrill applaudities: wherewith the mindes of these powerful P√©eres on both sides were so moued, that forgiuing and forgetting all euills forepast, reconciled themselues with mutual imbracings, and welcommed both their children, and the worthy Admirall with heartie gratulation: to their no small ioyes, and generall contentments of the whole Commons: that for seuen dayes space they continually rung bels, and made bonefires, whilest the Nobles of the Land, banqueted and made holy day: with <hi>Iacomin</hi> and <hi>Katherina,</hi> celebrating a vniuersall festiuall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the whole Realme: that now s√©emed to compare this their peace (as the Oracles had foretold) so happily againe renewed, to the auntient <hi>Aureo seculo.</hi>
