         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And this, as a lyttle aboue is sayde, is vnderstanded, that from Ierusalem to the Iles of <hi>Grecia,</hi> to the sea <hi>Illyrico</hi> which is the end of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Italy,</hi> by <hi>Slauonia,</hi> or <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> where before they had not hearde the name of Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.

               <p>But now let vs come to the summe of this reckning, and say, that if for the golde that is founde in <hi>Antilla,</hi> wée should beléeue that it is <hi>Tharsis,</hi> and <hi>Ophyn,</hi> and <hi>Sethyn,</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other things that be founde in <hi>Ophyn,</hi> &amp;c, and not in <hi>Antil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> we must beléeue that it is not those, nor those it.

And as <hi>Chenchis Cane</hi> by his prouidence and wisedome, made himselfe the firste Lord of the <hi>Tartares,</hi> as is before declared, so likewise this for his wisdome and prouidence, contrarie to the good will of his kinred, that would haue put him out of it, did so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and gouerne his Dominions and Countries, til the yeare of our Lord God .1298. so that he raigned two and fortie yeares, and was fiue and forty yeares old when he was made Emperor, and euerye yeare hadde warres, for he was valiant and expert in the warres, but he himselfe after he was made Emperour, neuer went to the warres but one time, but alwayes sent his sonnes, or some noble men, whom he thought best. And the cause wherefore hée went at that time in person, was this. In the yeare of our Lord God .1286. a nephew of his, of the age of thirtie yeares Lord of many prouinces, Cities, and townes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing himselfe to be subiecte to the greate <hi>Cane,</hi> as his predecessors had ben, determined in himself not to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to anye, and concorded with another kinseman of the

But you shall vnderstande that when the greate <hi>Cane</hi> will make his power, and take time to doe it, he may ioyne so greate a number, that it were a greate trouble to number them.

The trée that maketh the pepper is like the <hi>Yedra,</hi> or Iuie trée, the berries are gréen lyke vnto the Iuniper berries, and redde, and being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled wyth ashes, they harden with the sunne: there is a gréene fruite named Durians, of the bignesse of Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

They let the tame Elephants females goe vnto the mountaynes, vntill suche time as the wilde bee acquainted with them, for the male commonly doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himselfe with one female, and when they haue once acquaintance, the female bringeth the wild, by little and little, grasing, vnto a small yard strongly walled, hauyng two dores, one to come in at, and another to goe out at.

The Elephants haue so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, that manye with their féete, pull away the Speares from their enimies, for that they shoulde not hurt those that be vpon their backes. The King rideth vpon a white Elephant, which hath a chayne of golde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, being long vnto his féete, set full of many precious stones.

They estéeme it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to kill a man, and he that doth any crime, hathe no penaltie, and the debters be giuen to be as slaues vnto the creditors, and some debters will rather dye than serue, and take a Sword, and kill those that are weaker than they, till they find one that is of more strength than themselfe, who killeth them, &amp; then they carrie the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of that murtherer before the Iudge, and cause him to

pay the debtes of the debler. If any of them do buy a new Sword or knife, he proueth it vpon the body of the firste that he méeteth, and there is no penaltie for it. Those that come by looke vpon the wound, and prayse the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of him that did it, if it be a great wound. They take as many wiues as they list. They do vse much the game of Cockfighting, and they that bring them as well as the lokers on, lay wagers whiche Cocke shall ouercome, and winne the game. In <hi>Laua</hi> the great, there is a Fowle like vnto a Doue, which hath no féete, his feathers light, and a long tayle: he resteth alwayes on the trées, hys flesh is not eaten, the skinne and tayle are estéemed, for they do vse to weare them on their heads.</p>

The other is called <hi>Bandan,</hi> where Cloues grow, and from thence it is caryed vnto the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands named <hi>Clauas.</hi> In <hi>Bandan</hi> there be thrée kinds of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniayes or Parrets, with redde feathers, and yellowe billes, and others of diuers couloures, whiche are called <hi>Noros,</hi> that is to say, cleare.

They do delight muche to sée children, and for to sée them, they come where men be. Their heads when they be layde, séeme like to Celes heads, and when he lifteth vp his head, it séemeth bigger. It hath at the hinder partes a face like to a man and as though it were paynted of diuers couloures. They doe take them by inchantments, which the people vse muche there, and carrie them to be séene, and doe no hurt to anye body.

Their Skinnes be of diuers couloures, and those people vse them for diuers couerings, for it is very fayre to behold. Also, there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Serpentes of a maruellous figure in that Countrey, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length of one cubite, with wings like vnto Battes. They haue seauen heads, ordinarily sette of the length of his bodye. They dwell among the trées, and are of a swifte flighte. The yare more venomous than the other, that onely with their breath they kill a man. Also, there be Cattes of the Mountayne, that flye, for they haue a small skinne from the backe vnto the bellie, ouer all theyr body and féete, whyche is gathered vp when they are still: and when they will flye, they spredde it, and moue it lyke wings, leaping from one trée vnto another. The Hunters do follow them, till they be wéerie with flying, that they fall downe, and so are taken. Also, there is in this Countrey a trée named <hi>Cachy,</hi> that of the troncheon

They are windie, so that if they be putte into the fire, except they be cut, they will start out. They do giue the vtter rine vnto the Oxen to eate. Sometimes they fynde this fruite vnder grounde in the rootes of the trées, and those be of a pleasanter tast, therefore they doe vse to presente them vnto the Kings and Nobles. The fruite within hath no rine. This trée is muche like vnto a great Figge trée: the leaues are like vnto the leaues of <hi>Platanos,</hi> or ragged.

muche like vnto oures, painted within with diuers pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, whiche they doe decke with floures at their feasts. They haue within Idolles of stone, and gold, of siluer, and of Iuorie, some of .60. foote in height. They haue among themselues diuers manners in worshipping, and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing. When they enter into the Church, they wash them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in cleane water, and so they go in the morning, and in the afternoone, they go in lying along vpon the ground, lifting vppe their féete and handes, and so praye a whyle, then they doe kisse the grounde, and sense their Idolles with the smoake of swéete woodde. On this side of <hi>Gange</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> vse no belles, but in steade of them, they doe strike vppon a vessell of Copper, and with an other vessel they doe offer victualles vnto their Gods as the Gentiles did, and afterwarde doe imparte it to the poore, that they maye eate it.</p>

They haue a hoope of Iron aboute their neckes, the vtter parte of the hoope is rounde, and within, it is sharpe like vnto a Rasar: also they doe hang vnto the fore parte of the hoope down theyr breaste a chaine, and being sette downe, they fasten theyr féete vnto it, and béeyng thus, as the Prieste sayeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wordes, they stretch forth their legges; and lifte vp their heades, and thus with the sharpenesse of the hoope, cutte off their heades in sacrifice of their Idoll, yéelding vppe their liues. And they that kill themselues in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are estéemed as Saints. In the Citie of <hi>Bizenegalia</hi> in certaine time of the yeare, they doe carry about the Cittie in procession their Idoll betwéene two cartes, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

Others there be, that for the better adorning of the carts, make holes throgh the sides of their bodies, putting a rope throughe it, and tye themselues vnto the carte, and so hanging dead in the procession, accompany theyr Idoll, thinking that they cannot doe greater worshippe nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto their Gods. And they make their solempnity thrée times in a yeare. In one time there gather togither all the menne and women, and people of all ages, washing themselues in the sea, or in a riuer, hauing all newe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, doyng nothing else in thrée dayes but feaste, daunce, and sing.

In the thirde, they doe sette vppe poales like small mastes through all the stréetes, and from the toppe vnto the grounde, they doe hang very faire clothes, wroughte with golde, belonging vnto their Gods and painted, and on the topped of these poales, al the whole nine dayes that it endureth, they do sette a religious man that hathe a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne and méeke face, who suffereth all that paine for to receiue the grace of his God, and the people throwe vnto him Orrenges, Lemmons, and other like fruites, and he suffereth it all with patience There bée other thrée so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempne dayes, that they doe caste Saffron water vppon those that passe throughe the stréetes, and manye laughe at it. They doe celebrate their weddings wyth banquets, songs, trumpets, and instrumentes muche like vnto ours, sauing Organs whiche they haue not: they doe make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sumptuous feasts day and nighte, with instrumentes,

They daunce rounde aboute as wée doe, following one after an other in order, and twoo of them carrying twoo painted wandes in their handes, and as they doe méete, they doe chaunge stickes or wandes. And <hi>Nicholas</hi> rehearseth, that this was a fayre sighte to beholde. They doe vse no Bathes, sauing the <hi>Indians</hi> beyonde <hi>Gange.</hi> The others doe washe themselues manye times of the daye with colde water: they haue scant of oile, and other fruites of ours, as Peaches, Peares, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Damsons, Apples, and of Grapes they haue but fewe, and (as aboue is rehearsed) onely in one place. And in <hi>Puditfetamas,</hi> a prouince, there groweth a certaine trée withoute fruite, it groweth thrée cubites aboue grounde, and they call it shamefulnesse, for when a man commeth vnto it, it incloseth the braunches, and when he goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it spreadeth abroade his braunches.</p>

In some regions they haue no money, but vse in steade of money a certayne small stone whiche they name Cattes eye, and in some other places they do vse péeces of Iron like néedles, somewhat bigger.

There commeth the partie before hys Idoll, and sweareth by that Idoll, that he is not faultie, and they haue readye a hotte burnyng Iron like vnto a fishe hooke, and cause hym that swore, to touch it with his tongue, and to licke it, and if it doe him no hurte, he is quitte. And others bring the partie before hys Idoll, and cause hym to take that same burning yron in his hande, and so to carry it certaine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and if it hurt him not, he is quitte, but if it doe, he is guiltie. The thirde manner of swearing, whiche is moste vsed. is suche: They doe sette before his Idoll, a potte full of hote melted butter, and he that sweareth not to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, dippeth in two of his fingers into the butter, and so wrappeth them with a clowte, and sealeth it, that it shall not vnloose, and at thrée dayes ende they vndoe it, and if there be founde any signe of burning, hée is guiltie, if not, he is quytte.

               <p>The things that of the byrde <hi>Phoenix</hi> be declared and written in verses by <hi>Latancio,</hi> séeme not to be fables, for the sayde <hi>Nicholas</hi> doeth say, that at the end of <hi>India,</hi> there is only one byrde named <hi>Seuienda,</hi> whose bil is like vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boge, or togither with many hoales, and when the time of his death commeth, he gathereth togither dry woodde into his neste, and sitting vpon it, he singeth so swéetely wyth his bill, that he delighteth and pleaseth muche those that heare him, and then flittering with his wings vppon the wood, there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth fire, and he letteth hymselfe burne, &amp; then there commeth a worme out of his neste, and of hys ashes, and of it bréedeth the birde, vnto the likenesse of that byrdes byl. Those of that country made the Alnogue with the which they play very swéetly. And <hi>Nicholas</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling much of it, they tolde him of what the making of it procéeded. Also there is in the first <hi>India,</hi> in an Iland cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Saylana,</hi> a riuer named <hi>Arotanie,</hi> so full of fishe, that easily they maye take them vp with their handes, but as soone as a manne holdeth one of these fishes in his hande,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:5316:96"/>
there commeth vnto him a Feuar, and letting the fish go, the Feuar is gone from hym, the cause of it appeareth to be the nature of the fish, as among vs there is a fish which we call <hi>Torpedo,</hi> whych fish if a man do hold in his hand, it will be num, and grieue him: although the <hi>Indians</hi> saye, that it commeth by meanes of their Goddes, by a certaine tale that they do tell of it.</p>
               <p>AFter, for an information to the reader, kéeping y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of the Historie, I did write those things rehearsed, as the sayd <hi>Nicholas</hi> gaue report, and then there came ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the high <hi>India,</hi> which standeth towardes Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentrion, or the North, and he came, sente vnto the Pope for to sée the things and manners of these parties, for in those parties they had fame, that in the Occident or west there was another worlde, being Christians. And this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> declared that neare vnto <hi>Cataya</hi> there was a kingdome, which indured twentie dayes iourney, the which king and people were Christians, but of the sect of the Nestorians. He declared that the Patriach of the Nestorians had sent him for to bring him tydings certaine from these parties. He rehearsed that they had bigger, &amp; more richer Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches than ours, being al vaulted, and that their Patriarch was very rich in golde and in siluer, that euery father of family did giue yearelye vnto him an ounce of siluer. I communed with this man, by an interpretet whych could the Turkish tong, and the Latin, and I demaunded of him by meanes of this, the wayes, &amp; townes, houses, customs, manners, and of other things that a man delighteth to heare, there was great difficultie to learne it, for lacke of the interpreter, and also of the <hi>Indian,</hi> but he affirmed the power of the great <hi>Cane,</hi> or Emperoure of al men, to be greate and mighty, for he had vnder him nyne mighty kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:5316:96"/>Also he declared that he hadde trauelled many months through the high <hi>Scithia,</hi> is nowe <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and throughe <hi>Persia,</hi> and that finallye he came vnto the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> from whence he entered into the sea, and sayled vnto <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN the same time there came vnto the Pope certaine men from <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in deuotion of the faith, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had communication, by an interpreter, to knowe if they knew any thing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuer of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and of his springing.

And as these witnesses of sighte, did tell me of these and of others worthy to remayne in memorie, it séemed vnto me verye good to write them.</p>
               <p>They declared that the Riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> hadde his heade and Welspryng neare vnto the Region Equinoctiall at the foote of verye hyghe mountaynes, whyche are alwayes couered on the toppe with Mistes, from thrée welsprings, two of them standing 40. paces the one from

the other, and in 500. paces they méete, and make the riuer so great, that no man may passe ouer but with boate. The thirde which is the biggest, standeth a thousand paces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other two, and he commeth into the riuer of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ten myles off. Also they sayde that more than 1000. riuers did enter into <hi>Nilus,</hi> and it increaseth so muche in those countryes, with the raine of March, April, and May, that it maketh <hi>Nilus</hi> to swell ouer so muche, that it made wonderfull great floudes. Also they declared that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Nilus</hi> was verye swéete and sauerie, before he ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth among the other Riuers, and it hath vertue to heale those that haue the leaprie and scabs, if they washe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in it. And beyonde the headsprings of <hi>Nilus</hi> fiftéene dayes iourney, there be verye fruitefull countries, ful of people, and well tilled, hauing very notable Cities, and also sayde that beyonde that countrey there was the sea, but they had not séene it, and that neare vnto the spring of <hi>Nilus</hi> there was a Citie, wherein they were borne, and it was fiue and twentie myles in compasse, full of people, and in the night had 1000. watches for to defende the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from daunger and alterations that might rise. This region is temperate, and delectable, and plentifull of alll thyngs, in so much as 3. times in the yere there springeth new grasse, and twice in the yeare it beareth corne. It hath abundaunce of broade and wine, although the most parte of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> vse (in steade of wine) barley sodden in water.

The leafe of this trée is more than a cubit in breadth, and more than two cubits in length. They sayd also, that towardes the Ilande <hi>Meroe,</hi> the <hi>Nilus</hi> coulde not be sayled, by reason of the number of Rockes that were there, and that from <hi>Meroe</hi> vnto <hi>Egipt,</hi> it was naui<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Betwéene <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Egipt</hi> there be desertes of .50. dayes iourney, and they trauell so farre, hauing with them prouision of meate and drinke vpon Cammels. It hath dangerous passages in many places, by reason of the wilde men that go naked in those deserts, like wild beastes riding vppon Cammels, whose flesh and milke they do eate. They doe robbe the Cammels and prouision that the trauellers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, so that many dye for hunger, and for this cause there passe fewe that way vnto vs. The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are of longer life than we, for many liue vntil .120. yeares, and .150. yeares, and in some places they liue tyll 200. yeares. It is a Countrey much inhabited, and neuer hath the plage, nor other infirmities, so with this, &amp; with their long liues, their multitude is much encreased. They haue diuers customes, according to the diuersitie of the Countrey. They haue no wooll, but weare linnen and silk both men and women. And in some places, the women

From Christmas vnto Lent they feast eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day, eating and daunsing. They do vse little Tables, so that two or thrée may sitte at one of them, and do couer them with table clothes as we do. They haue but one King, whiche is entituled King of Kings, after or vnder God, and they saye, he hath many Kings vnder him, and that they haue diuers kinds of beastes. The Oxen are crooke backed, like vnto Camels, with hornes of thrée cubites in length bending vpon their backes, so that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one of their hornes they do carrie a Rundlet of wine. Their dogges are of the bignesse of our Asses, and there is some of them that may do more than a Lion, and hunt with them. They haue very great Elephants, and bring vp some of them for their pleasure &amp; for hostilitie, &amp; some for the warres. They bring them vp of yong ones, &amp; tame them, and then kill the old. Their téeth are of sixe cubites in length. Also, they do tame and bring vp Lions, and to shew them for a magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and ostentation.
