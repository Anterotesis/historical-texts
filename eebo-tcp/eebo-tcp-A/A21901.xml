            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Queenes moſt excellent Maieſtie in her Princely nature, conſidering how dangerous a matter it is by continuance of the Faire called Bartholomew Faire, vſuallie kept in Smithfield, to increaſe and diſperſe the infection of the ſickeneſſe, being preſently in ſundry places, in, and about London, to ſundry other places of her Realme, being cleare and not touched with any ſuch infection, or to bring more infection thither from other places: hath thought it neceſſarie for auoiding of ſuch danger, to ſtay for this preſent the holding or keeping of the ſaid Faire at this time of S. Bartholomewes day, in ſuch ſort as was vſuall, whereas there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reſort of all kind of people out of euery part of her Realme to the ſaid Faire. And therefore to preuent theſe dangers, her Maieſtie doeth now command, that in the vſuall place of Smithfield, there be no maner of market for any wares kept, nor any ſtalles nor boothes for any maner of merchandiſe, or for victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ſuffred to be ſet vp, but that the open place of the ground called Smithfield, be only occupied with ſale of horſes &amp; cattell, &amp; of ſtall wares, as butter, cheeſe, &amp; ſuch like, in groſſe, and not by retaile, the ſame to continue for the ſpace of two dayes onely. And for vent of woollen Clothes, Kerſies, and Linnen cloth, to bee all ſold in groſſe, and not by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, the ſame ſhall be all brought within the cloſe yarde of S. Bartholomewes, where ſhops are there continued, and haue gates to ſhut the ſame place in the nights, and there ſuch cloth to bee offered to ſale, and to be bought in groſſe, and not by Retaile, the ſame market to continue but three dayes, that is, the Euen, and day of S. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew, and the morow after: And that the ſale and vent of Leather be kept in the outſide of the Ring of Smithfield, as hath bene accuſtomed, without erecting of any Shops or Boothes for the ſame, or for any victualler, or other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupier of any wares whatſoeuer. And for notice hereof to be giuen to ſuch of her Maieſties good Subiects, as for lacke of knowledge of this her Maieſties princely ordinance, might reſort to London to ſell or buie ſmall wares by Retaile, and there receiue infection, and carie the ſame into their Countreys: Her Maieſtie commandeth that the L. Maior of London ſhall cauſe this her Maieſties Proclamation to be preſently publiſhed in all vſuall places of the Citie, in the time of two or three Market dayes, and to be alſo proclaimed by the Shirifes of Middleſex, Kent, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, and Eſſex, in ſome places of thoſe Counties neere to the ſaid Citie, whereby none may reſort to the Citie, at this feaſt of S. Bartholomew by pretence of any Faire, but ſuch as ſhal haue cauſe to ſell or buie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities in groſſe, and in the place appointed, as is aboue mentioned. And if any ſhall attempt to doe any thing contrarie to this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the ſame to be puniſhed by ſtraight impriſonment without baile, during her Maieſties pleaſure, or further puniſhment according to the qualitie of their offence. And for the reſtraining of any ſicke and infected perſons, or any of their families from comming abroad to endanger others, and for ſome further ſtaie (by Gods permiſſion) of the preſent infection: Her Maieſtie hath cauſed certaine orders to be by her Counſell preſcribed to be obſerued by the Lord Maior, and other officers of priuiledged places about London.
