         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it is the earneſt deſire of my heart, that all of you
would ſo do. Now whereas two things offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto me, to diſcourſe with you by the way of
Preface, namely the commendation of the Scripture,
and an exhortation to the ſtudy of it on the one hand,
and a diſcovery of the reproach that is caſt upon it,
with the various wayes and meanes that are uſed by
ſome for the leſſening and depreſſing of its Authority

purpoſe, by one or other almoſt every day performed;
I ſhall inſiſt at preſent on the latter only; which alſo
is more ſuited to diſcover my aime and intention in

a Preface to ſuch ſhort diſcourſes as theſe following;
<pb facs="tcp:170488:3"/>

                  <p>Many there have beene and are, who, through the

but equall that men ſhould be called to an account
upon their owne principles; and thoſe, who ſuppoſing

unfiniſhed, that may be needfull to convince it of
perfidiouſneſſe? that ſaies the Scripture was
committed to it alone, and would, if it were
able, deprive all others of the poſſeſſion of it or
their lives; what Scripture then was this, or
when was this deed of truſt made unto them?
The oracles of God, they tell us, committed to the

carried on at the ſame time, and moſtly by the

<hi>Rabbinicall</hi> learning before the Reformation.
<hi>Raymundus Martinus, Porchetus de ſylvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>

not interpoſe in this matter, the method of <hi>Galatinus</hi>
and his <hi>ſtile</hi> are peculiar to him, but the coincidence
of his Quotations too many to be aſcribed to common
Accident. That <hi>Porchetus</hi> took his <hi>Victoria adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
impios Judaeos</hi> for the moſt part from <hi>Raymun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
himſelfe confeſſeth in his Preface. However cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it is, <hi>Galatinus</hi> had no ſmall opinion of his
own skill, and therefore, according to the uſuall way
of men, who have attained, as they think, to ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency
in any one kind of learning, laying more
weight upon it than it is able to beare, he boldly
affirmes, that the <hi>Originall</hi> of the Scripture is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and not to be reſtored but by the <hi>Talmud;</hi>
In which one conceſſion he more injures the cauſe he
pleads for againſt the Jews, then he advantageth it
by all his books beſide. Of his <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> of <hi>Rabbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Haskadoſh</hi> there is no more news as yet in the

At the ſame time <hi>Eraſmus, Reuchlin, Vives,
Xantes, Pagninus,</hi> and others, moved effectually for
the reſtauration of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
But the worke principally proſpered in the hands of
the firſt Reformers, as they were all of them general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
skilled in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſo ſome of them as <hi>Capito,
Bibliander, Fagius, Munſter</hi> to that Height and
uſefulneſſe, that they may well be reckoned as the
Fathers and <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of that learning. At that
time lived <hi>Elias Levita,</hi> the moſt learned of the
Jews of that Age, whoſe <hi>Grammaticall</hi> writings
<pb facs="tcp:170488:10"/>
were of huge importance in the ſtudying of that to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue.
This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he was acquainted with many of the firſt
Reformers, ſo he lived particularly with <hi>Paulus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
as I have elſe where declared. Now in one
book, which in thoſe daies he publiſhed, called <hi>Maſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rech,
Hammaſoreth,</hi> he broached a new opinion, not
much heard of, at leaſt not at all received among the
Jews, nor for ought that yet appears, once mentioned
by Chriſtians before, namely that the points or vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and accents uſed in the Hebrew Bible, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by ſome criticall Jew or <hi>Maſſorite,</hi> living
at <hi>Tiberias</hi> about 5 or 600 yeares after Chriſt: no

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ime was to reduce the world of
Chriſtians to a dependance on the ancient <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
for the whole ſenſe of the Scripture; <hi>Hinc prima
mali labes,</hi> Here lies the firſt breach in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The fraud being not diſcovered, and this opinion
being broached and confirmed by the great and almoſt
only maſter of the language of that Age, ſome even
of the firſt Reformers embraced his fancy. Perhaps
<hi>Zuinglius</hi> had ſpoken to it before: juſtly I know
not. After a while the poyſon of this error beginning
to operate, the Papiſts waiting on the mouths of the
Reformers, like the ſervants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> on <hi>Ahab,</hi>
to catch at every word that might fall from them to
their advantage, beg an to make uſe of it. Hence <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlaeus,</hi>
lib. de Auth. Scripturae, Cap. 5. applauds
<hi>Luther,</hi> for ſaying the <hi>Jews had corrupted the
Bible with Points and diſtinctions,</hi> as well he
might, for nothing could be ſpoken more to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

But we muſt not it ſeems reſt here: within a few
yeares after, to make way for another deſigne, which
then he had conceived; <hi>Ludovicus Capellus</hi> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb facs="tcp:170488:11"/>
a diſcourſe in the defence of the opinion of <hi>Elias,</hi>
(at leaſt ſo far as concerned the riſe of the punctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
under the Title of <hi>Arcanum punctationis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velatum.</hi>
The book was publiſhed by <hi>Erpenius</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the name of the Author. But the Perſon was
ſufficiently known; and <hi>Rivetus</hi> not long after took
notice of him, and ſaith he was his friend, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
his name. Iſag. ad Scr. 1. cap. 8. This new
attempt immediately pleaſeth ſome. Among others,
our learned Profeſſour Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> reads a publick
Lecture on the <hi>Veſpers</hi> of our <hi>Comitia</hi> on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
wherein though he prefaceth his diſcourſe
with an obſervation of the advantage the Papiſts
make of that opinion of the novelty of the points, and
the danger of it, yet upon the matter he falls in whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with <hi>Capellus, though he name him not.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the large <hi>Encomiums</hi> of himſelfe, and his
worke, printed by <hi>Capellus</hi> in the cloſe of his <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica
ſacra,</hi> there are two Letters from one Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>
here in England, in one whereof he tells him, that
without doubt the Doctor read on that ſubject by the
help of his book; as indeed he uſeth his Arguments, &amp;
quotes his Treatiſe, under the name of <hi>Sud Haniſeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoth
Hanaegalah.</hi> But that (<hi>I</hi> ſay) which ſeems to
me moſt admirable in the Doctors diſcourſe is, that
whereas he had prefaced it with the weight of the
controverſy he had in hand, by the advantage the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> make of the opinion of the <hi>novelty</hi> of the
<hi>Points,</hi> citing their words to that purpoſe, himſelfe in
the body of his exercitations falls in with them, and
<pb facs="tcp:170488:11"/>
ſpeaks the very <hi>things</hi> which he ſeemed before to
have blamed. And by this means this opinion ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſo greatly to the diſparagement of the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Originals,</hi> is crept in amongſt Proteſtants
alſo. Of the ſtop put unto its progreſſe by the full and
learned Anſwer of <hi>Buxtorfius the younger</hi> (who
alone in this learning, in this age, ſeems to anſwer
his Fathers worth) unto <hi>Capellus,</hi> in his diſcourſe
<hi>de origine &amp; antiquitate Punctorum,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak
more afterwards. However it is not amiſſe fallen out
that the maſters of this new perſwaſion are not at
all agreed among themſelves. <hi>Capellus</hi> would have
it eaſy to underſtand the Hebrew text, and every
word, though not abſolutely by it ſelfe, yet as it lies
in its contexture, though there were no points at all.
<hi>Morinus</hi> would make the language altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
on that account; the one ſaith, that the
points are a late invention of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi>
and the other, that without them, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yet
though they look diverſe wayes, there is a firebrand
between them. But we have this Brand brought yet
nearer to the Churches bread corne, in the <hi>prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
to the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> lately printed at
<hi>London.</hi> The ſolemne Eſpouſall of this opinion of
<hi>the Hebrew punctation,</hi> in that great worke, was
one chiefe occaſion of the ſecond diſcourſe, as you will
find it at large declared in the entrance of it. I dare
not mention the deſperate conſequences that attend
this imagination, being affrighted among other
<pb facs="tcp:170488:12"/>
things, by a little Treatiſe lately ſent me (upon the
occaſion of a diſcourſe on this ſubject) by my worthy
and learned friend <hi>Dr. Ward,</hi> intituled <hi>fides divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
wherein its Author, who ever he be, from ſome
principles of this Nature, and unwary Expreſſions
of ſome learned men amongſt us, labours to eject and
caſt out as uſeleſſe the whole Scripture or word of
God. I ſhould have immediately returned an anſwer
to that <hi>peſtilent diſcourſe,</hi> but that upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
I found all his objections obviated or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in the enſuing, <hi>treatiſes,</hi> which were then
wholly finiſhed. And this, as I ſaid, was the firſt way
whereby the poyſon of <hi>undervaluing</hi> the Originalls
crept in among Proteſtants themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now together with the knowledge of the tongues,
the uſe of that knowledge in <hi>Criticall obſervations,</hi>
did alſo encreaſe. The excellent uſe of this ſtudy and
employment, with the fruits of it in the explanation
of ſundry difficulties, with many other advantages,
cannot be eaſily expreſſed. But as the beſt things are
apt to be moſt abuſed, ſo in particular it hath falne
out with this kind of learning and ſtudie. Proteſtants
here alſo have chiefly mannaged the buſineſſe. <hi>Beza,
Camerarius, Scaliger, Caſaubon, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Uſher, Grotius, Henſius, Fuller, Dieu, Mede,

others, have excelled in this kind. But the mind
of man being exceedingly vaine-glorious, curious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
after a doore to reputation and renowne, by
this kind of learning was opened in the world, it
<pb facs="tcp:170488:12"/>
quicly ſpread its ſelfe over all bounds and limits of
Sobriety. The manifold inco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>veniences, if not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes,
that have enſued on the boldneſſe and curioſity
of ſome in <hi>criticiſing</hi> on the Scripture, I ſhall not
now inſiſt upon; and what it might yet grow unto,
I have often heard the great <hi>Uſher,</hi> expreſſing his
feare. Of the ſucceſſe of <hi>Grotius</hi> in this way we have
a ſolid account weekly in the Lectures of our learned
Profeſſor, which I hope, he will in due time benefit the
Publick withall. But it is only one or two things that
my preſent deſigne calls mee upon to remarke.</p>
                  <p>Among other wayes that ſundry men have fixed
on to exerciſe their <hi>criticall abilities,</hi> one hath beene
the collecting of <hi>various lections</hi> both in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
and New. The firſt and honeſteſt courſe fixed
on to this purpoſe, was that of conſulting <hi>various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,</hi>
and comparing them among themſelves; wherein
yet there were ſundry miſcarriages, as I ſhall ſhew in
the ſecond treatiſe. This was the worke of <hi>Eraſmus,
Stephen, Beza, Arias Montanus,</hi> and ſome others;
ſome that came after them finding this Province poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed,
and no other world of the like nature remaining
for them to conquer, fixed upon another way, ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
to the ſervice of their deſigne, as pernitious a
principle, as ever I thinke was fixed on by any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man ſince the foundation of the Church of Chriſt,
excepting only thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now this principle is
that upon many grounds, which ſome of them are long
in recounting: there are ſundry corruptions crept into
the <hi>Originals,</hi> which by their criticall faculty, with
<pb facs="tcp:170488:13"/>
the uſe of ſundry Engines, thoſe eſpecially of the Old
Tranſlations are to be diſcovered and removed. And
this alſo receives countenance from theſe <hi>Prole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomena</hi>
to the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> as will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be ſhowne and diſcuſſed. Now this principle
being once fixed, and a liberty of <hi>criticiſing</hi> on the
Scripture, yea a neceſſity of it thence evinced, it is
inconceiveable what springs of corrections and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments
riſe up under their hands. Let me not be
thought tedious if I recount ſome of them to you.</p>
                  <p>1 It is knowne that there is a double Conſonancy
in the Hebrew Conſonants among themſelves; of
ſome in <hi>figure</hi> that are unlike in <hi>ſound,</hi> of ſome in
<hi>ſound</hi> that are unlike in <hi>figure,</hi> of the firſt ſort are
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
of the latter are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
Now this is one
principle of our new <hi>Criticks,</hi> that the Scribes of
the Bible were ſometimes miſtaken by the likeneſſe
of the Letters, in reſpect of <hi>figure,</hi> ſometimes by
their likneſſe in reſpect of ſound; and ſo remembring
the words they wrote, oftentimes put one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
ſo that whether they uſed their Eyes, or their
Memories, they failed on one hand or another; though
the <hi>Jewes</hi> deny any Copy amongſt them to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
but exactly by patterne, or that it is lawfull for
a man to write one word in a Copy, but by patterne,
though he could remember the words of the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
now whereas the ſignification of every word is
regulated by its <hi>radix,</hi> it often falls out, that in the
<pb facs="tcp:170488:13"/>
formation and inflexion of words, by reaſon of letters
that are <hi>defective,</hi> there remaines but one letter
of the <hi>Radix</hi> in them, at leaſt that is pronounced:
How frequent this is in this tongue, thoſe who have
very little skill in it, may gheſſe by only taking a
view of <hi>Frobenius</hi> his <hi>Bible,</hi> wherein the <hi>Radicall</hi>
letters are printed in a diſtinct character, from all
the praefixes and affixes in their variations. Now if
a man hath a mind to <hi>criticiſe</hi> and mend the Bible,
it is but taking his word, or words, that he will fix
upon, &amp; try what they will make by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mutation
of the letters that are alike in figure or ſound. Let
him try what <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> will doe in the place of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or on the
contrary; which as they are <hi>radicall,</hi> or as they
are <hi>prefixed,</hi> will ſufficiently alter the ſenſe; and ſo
of all the reſt mentioned. If by this meanes any new
ſenſe that is tolerable, and pleaſeth the <hi>Criticke,</hi>
doth emerge, it is but ſaying the Scribe was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the <hi>likeneſſe</hi> of the Letters, or in the <hi>affinity</hi>
of the ſound, and then it is no matter, though all the
Copies in the world agree to the contrary, without
the leaſt variation. It is evident that this courſe
hath ſtood <hi>Capellus</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> in very good
ſtead. And <hi>Symeon de Muys</hi> tells us a pretty ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of himſelfe to this purpoſe. <hi>de Heb. Edit. Antiq.

of the <hi>Criticiſmes</hi> on the old Teſtament, that theſe
times afford: a thouſand inſtances might be given
to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>2. But in caſe this courſe faile, and no reliefe
<pb facs="tcp:170488:14"/>
be afforded this way, than the <hi>tranſpoſition</hi> of
Letters offers its aſſiſtance; thoſe who know any
thing in this language, know what alteration in the
ſenſe of words may be made by ſuch a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
frequently words of contrary ſenſes, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
oppoſite conſiſt only of the ſame Letters diverſly
placed. Every Lexicon will ſupply men with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,

by this meanes, men may deſtroy the world. But</p>
                  <p>4. Suppoſe that this ground proves barren alſo,
it is but going to an old Tranſlation, the 70, or
<hi>vulgar</hi> Latin, and where any word likes us, to
conſider what <hi>Hebrew</hi> word anſwers unto it, and if
it diſcovers an agreement in any one Letter, in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
or ſound, with the word in that Text, then to
ſay that ſo they read in that <hi>copy;</hi> yea rather
then faile, be the word as farre different from what
is read in the Bible as can be imagined, averre it
to yeeld the more convenient ſenſe, and a various le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is found out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170488:14"/>
And theſe are the chiefe heads and ſprings of the <hi>criticiſms</hi>
on the old Teſtament, which with ſo great a reputation of
learning men have boldly obtruded on us of late dayes. It is
not imaginable what prejudice the Sacred truth of the
Scripture, preſerved by the infinite love and care of God,
hath already ſuffered hereby, and what it may further ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
for my part, I cannot but tremble to think. Lay but
theſe two Principles together, namely that the <hi>points are a
late invention of ſome Judaicall Rabbins,</hi> (on which
account there is no reaſon in the world that we ſhould be
bound unto them) and that it is <hi>lawfull to gather vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Lections by the help of Tranſlations,</hi> where there
are no diverſities in our preſent Copies, which are owned in
the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> to the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> and for my
part I muſt needs cry cut <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as not ſeeing any
meanes of being delivered from utter uncertaintie in and
about all ſacred truth. Thoſe who have more wiſdome
&amp; learning, &amp; are able to look throngh all the digladiations
that are likely to enſue on theſe principles, I hope will
rather take paines to inſtruct me, and ſuch as I am, then
be angry or offended with us, that we are not ſo wiſe or
learned as themſelves. In the meane time I deſire thoſe
who are ſhaken in mind by any of the ſpecious pretences of
<hi>Capellus</hi> and others, to conſider the <hi>ſpecimen,</hi> given us, of
reconciling the difficulties, that they lay as the ground of
their conjectures in the <hi>miſcellany notes,</hi> or <hi>Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the learned <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pocock;</hi> as uſefull and learned
a worke as is extant in that kinde, in ſo few ſheets of paper.
The dangerous and cauſeleſſe attempts of men, to rectifie
our preſent copies of the <hi>Bible,</hi> the Reader may there alſo

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170488:15"/>
But we have not as yet done; there is a new invention of
<hi>Capellus,</hi> greatly applauded amongst the men of theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

<hi>Prefacer</hi> to theſe <hi>Biblia Polyglotta</hi> is of the ſame
judgement; <hi>Morin: Praefat: ad opuſc. Haebr: Samarit.</hi>
Hereupon he informes us, that in the Tranſlation of the
<hi>Pentateuch</hi> he went for the meaning of ſundry words unto
<hi>Hierome,</hi> and the Tranſlation of the 70. But it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to theſe learned perſons, that <hi>Hierome,</hi> whom one of
them makes his rule; tels us over and over, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Tranſlation of the 70. he had his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it ſelfe; and
the help of ſuch <hi>Hebrews</hi> as he hired to his aſſiſtance. And
for <hi>Capellus,</hi> is not that the <hi>Helena</hi> for which he contends,
and upon the matter the onely foundation of his ſacred
worke of Criticiſing on the Scripture, that there was a
ſucceſſion of learned men of the <hi>Jewes</hi> at Tiberias untill
an hundred yeares after <hi>Hierome,</hi> who invented the Points
of the <hi>Hebrew Bible,</hi> and that not in an arbitrary manner,
but according to the <hi>tradition</hi> they had received from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
who ſpoke that language in its purity? ſhall theſe men be
thought to have had the knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue
from the Tranſlation of the 70; Certainly they would not
then have hated it ſo, as he informes us they did. But this
thing is plainly ridiculous. The Language gives us the
<pb facs="tcp:170488:15"/>
knowledge of it ſelfe. Conſidering the helps that by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
have been in all Ages, and at all times afforded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
ever ſince the time wherein <hi>Capellus</hi> ſaies, ſome knew
it ſo well, as to invent and affix the preſent <hi>Punctation,</hi>
there hath beene a ſucceſſion of <hi>living</hi> or <hi>dead</hi> Maſters to
further the knowledge of it. And this will not ſeem ſtrange
to them who have given us exact Tranſlations of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi>

the Authority of the <hi>Hebrew verity,</hi> as it was

and cleared the Papiſts in their reproaching of the Word of

It is founded on no leſſe ſtable bottome than this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,

of ſame few men of no credit with us, aſſerting
that for truth, which we have abundant cauſe to believe
to be utterly falſe; But of theſe men ſo far.</p>
                  <p>I thought at the Entrance of my diſcourſe to have alſo
inſiſted on ſome other wayes, whereby Satan in theſe daies
aſſaults the ſacred truth of the Word of God in its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Purity, Integrity, or Perfection; eſpecially in the
Poor, Deluded, <hi>Fanaticall</hi> ſoules amongſt us, commonly
called <hi>Quakers.</hi> For the inſtruction of the younger ſort,
againſt whoſe abominations I have ſubjoyned the <hi>Theſes</hi>
in the Cloſe of the other Treatiſes. But I am ſenſible how
far already I have exceeded the bounds of a <hi>Preface</hi> unto
ſo ſmall Treatiſes as theſe enſuing; and therefore giving
a briefe account of my undertaking in this Cauſe of God
and his Word, for the vindication of the Authority and
Integrity of it, I ſhall put a Cloſe to this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſome of you have heard me profeſſing my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe
to appeare any more in the World this way. I
have not in ſome things met with ſuch pleaſing Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as to encourage me unto it: where I have been for
Peace, others have made themſelves ready for war. Some
of them, eſpecially<note n="*" place="margin">M. G. F.</note> 
                     <hi>one of late,</hi> neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
me, nor the things that he writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
but his mind for oppoſition was to be ſatisfied. This
is the manner of not a few in their <hi>writings;</hi> they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb facs="tcp:170488:16"/>
other men by their own <hi>ignorance,</hi> and what they
know not themſelves, they thinke is hid to others alſo;
Hence when any thing preſents its ſelfe <hi>new</hi> to their
minds; as though they were the <hi>firſt</hi> that knew, what
they then firſt know, and which they have only an obſcure
glimpſe of, they reſt not untill they have publiſhed it to
their <hi>praiſe.</hi> Such are the diſcourſes of that perſon, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
triviall, partly obviated and rendred utterly uſeleſſe to
his <hi>purpoſe</hi> by that treatiſe, which he ventured weakly to
oppoſe. I wiſh I could prevaile with thoſe, whoſe <hi>intereſt</hi>
compells them to chooſe rather to be ignorant, then to be
<hi>taught</hi> by me, to let my books alone. Another after two or
three years conſideration, in anſwer to a book of neer 140
ſheets of paper, returnes a ſcoffing reply to ſo
much of it,<note place="margin">Mr. I. G.</note> as was written in a <hi>quarter of an
houre.</hi> I am therefore ſtill minded to abſtaine from ſuch
Engagements. And I think I may ſay if there were leſſe
writing by ſome, there would be more reading by others,
at leaſt to more purpoſe. Many books full of profound lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
lye neglected, whilſt men ſpend their time on Trifles;
And many things of great Worth are ſuppreſſed by their
Authors, whilſt things of uo value are poured out, one
on the neck of another. One of your
ſelves I have often ſolicited for the
<hi>Publiſhing of ſome Divinity le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi>

there are 3 parts. The firſt is a Subject that having
<pb facs="tcp:170488:17"/>
preached on, I was by many urged to publiſh my thoughts
upon it, judging it might be uſefull: I have anſwered their
requeſts; what I have performed through the grace of
Chriſt in the worke undertaken, is left to the judgment of
the Godly learned Reader. The ſecond concernes the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena</hi>
and <hi>Appendix</hi> to the late <hi>Biblia Polyglotta:</hi>
of this I ſaid often, <hi>ab alio quovis hoc fieri mallem,
quàm à me, ſed à me tamen potius quàm à nemine.</hi>
The reaſons of my ingaging in that worke are declared at
large in the entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of it. The <hi>theſes</hi> in the cloſe were drawn
in by their affinity in Subject to the other diſcourſes, and to
compleat the doctrine of the Scripture concerning the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I endeavoured to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prize in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole truth about
the Word of God, as to name &amp; thing oppoſed by the poor
fanaticall Quakers, as alſo to diſcover the Principles they
proceed upon in their Confuſed oppoſition to that Truth.</p>

Truth whoſe Word is Truth, ſpeaking

of the Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, his <hi>Voyce</hi>
to them was accompanied with its

unto them; And God ſpeaking by
them, or their <hi>Writings</hi> unto us, his
<hi>Word</hi> is accompanied with its own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and gives Aſſurance unto us.
His <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Veracity</hi> did, and do
in the one and the other ſufficiently
manifeſt themſelves, that men may
quietly repoſe their Soules upon

Thus are we <hi>built</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. That then which to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment
of the <hi>Soules of Believers,</hi>
I ſhall labour to prove and evince, is
plainly this; namely, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Old and New Teſtament,
do abundantly, and uncontroleably
<hi>manifeſt</hi> themſelves to be the Word
of the living God; ſo that merely on
the account of their own <hi>propoſall</hi> of
themſelves unto us, in the Name and
Majeſty of God, as ſuch, without the
contribution of help or Aſſiſtance from
<hi>Tradition, Church,</hi> or any thing elſe
without themſelves, we are obliged
upon the penalty of eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as are all to whom by any
meanes they come, or are brought) to
receive them, with that <hi>ſubjection</hi> of
ſoule which is due to the Word of
God. The Authority of God ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in them, they afford unto us all
the divine <hi>Evidence</hi> of themſelves,
which God is <hi>willing</hi> to grant unto us,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170488:34"/>
or <hi>can</hi> be granted us, or is any way
<hi>needfull</hi> for us. So then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Authority
of the <hi>written Word,</hi> in its ſelfe and
unto us, is <hi>from</hi> its ſelfe, as the Word
of God, and the <hi>eviction</hi> of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
unto us, is <hi>by</hi> its ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. When the <hi>Authority</hi> of
the Scripture is enquired after, ſtrictly
its <hi>power to command,</hi> and require <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in the name of God,</hi> is intended.
To aske then whence it hath its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
is to aske, whence it hath its
Power to command in the name of
God. Surely men will not ſay, that
the Scripture hath its <hi>power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the name of God,</hi> from any
thing but its ſelfe. And it is indeed a
contradiction for men to ſay, They
give <hi>Authority</hi> to the Scriptures.
Why do they do ſo? Why do they
give this Authority to that <hi>Book</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then another? They muſt ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is the Word of God. So the
Reaſon why they give Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, is the <hi>formall</hi> Reaſon of all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170488:35"/>
its Authority, which it hath antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to their <hi>charter</hi> and conceſſion
of Power. <gap reason="foreign">

Scripture hath its Authority in its
ſelfe, and from its ſelfe, or its owne
divine Originall, but not <hi>quoad nos;</hi>
not in <hi>reſpect of us;</hi> that it may <hi>reach</hi>

God reveale himſelfe to us, it muſt be

they are <hi>teſtifyed</hi> unto from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

and keep their Authority; but if they
will deale with us, and put forth their

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. Authority is a thing that
no Perſon or Thing can have in him,
or its ſelfe, that hath it not in reſpect
of others. In its very nature it relates
to others, that are ſubject unto it.
All Authority ariſeth from Relation;
and anſwers it throughout. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God over his <hi>Creatures,</hi> is
from their Relation to him as their
<hi>Creator.</hi> A Kings Authority is in
reſpect of his ſubjects. And he who
hath no ſubjects, hath no <hi>Kingly</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in himſelfe, but is only a <hi>Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
King.</hi> The Authority of a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
relates to his <hi>flock;</hi> and he who
hath no flock, hath no <hi>Authority</hi> of a
Miniſter; if he have not a <hi>Miniſteriall</hi>
Authority, in reference to a flock, a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170488:36"/>
People, a <hi>Church;</hi> he <hi>hath</hi> none, he <hi>can</hi>
have none in himſelfe. So is it in this
Caſe; If the Scripture hath no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from its ſelfe, in <hi>reſpect of
us,</hi> it hath none in its ſelfe, nor can
have. If it hath it in <hi>its ſelfe,</hi> it hath it
in <hi>reſpect of us.</hi> Such a <hi>Reſpect,</hi> that
is, a Right to Command and oblige
to Obedience, is as inſeparable from
Authority, or a <hi>Morall</hi> Power, as heat
is from fire. It is true: A man may
have <hi>de jure,</hi> a lawfull <hi>Authority</hi> over
them, whom <hi>de facto,</hi> he cannot force
or compell to obedience. But want
of force doth not leſſen Authority.
God looſeth not his Authority over
men, though he put not forth towards
them, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. or
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the greatneſse
of his Power, or the Efficacy of the might
of his ſtrength</hi> to cauſe them to obey.
It is fond then to imagine, that a Man,
or any thing, ſhould have an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>himſelfe,</hi> or <hi>its ſelfe,</hi> and yet not
have that Authority in reſpect of
them who are to be ſubject thereunto.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170488:36"/>
That is not a <hi>Law</hi> properly at all,
which is not a <hi>Law</hi> to ſome. Beſides,
all the evill of <hi>Diſobedience</hi> relates to
the Authority of him that requires the
Obedience. <hi>James.</hi> 2. 10, 11. No
action is <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> but from the
<hi>ſubjection</hi> of him who performes it,
unto him who requires Obedience.
And therefore if the Scripture hath
not an <hi>Authority</hi> in its ſelfe, towards
us, there is no evill in our <hi>diſobedience</hi>
unto its commands; or our not doing
what it commandeth, and our doing
what it for biddeth, is not diſobedience,
becauſe it hath not an Authority over
us; I ſpeake of it as conſidered in its

have we carried this objection; <hi>To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
the commands of the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the communication of a Teſtimony

Poſition is evident and cleare; and ſo
our <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the Enquiry made.
The Scripture hath all its <hi>Authority</hi>

his Soveraigne power and Authority,
his Righteouſneſſe and Holineſſe, by
the innate (or ingrafted) <hi>light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and Principles of the conſciences
of men. That indiſpenſible <hi>morall
obedience,</hi> which he requireth of us, as
his <hi>creatures</hi> ſubject to his law, is in
generall thus made knowne unto us.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170488:38"/>
For the <hi>Gentiles which have not the law,

that where ever they are ſeene and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
they undeniably evince that
they are ſo, and that what they teach
concerning him, they doe it in his
Name and Authority. There is no
need of <hi>Traditions,</hi> no need of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
no need of the Authority of any
Churches to convince a <hi>rationall
Creature,</hi> that the works of God are
<hi>his,</hi> and <hi>His</hi> only; and that he is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nlal,
and infinite in Power that made
them. They carry about with them
their owne Authority. By being <hi>what</hi>
they are, they declare <hi>whoſe</hi> they are.
To reveale God by his works, there
is need of nothing, but that they be

                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The <hi>Arguments</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
any thing is confimed are of two
ſorts; <hi>Inartificiall,</hi> by the Way of
<hi>Teſtimony;</hi> and <hi>Artificiall,</hi> by the
Way of Deductions and Inferences.
What ever is capable of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Evidence</hi> unto Truth, falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one of theſe two heads. Both
theſe kinds of <hi>Proofes</hi> we make uſe
of, in the buſineſſe in hand. Some
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170488:43"/>
profeſſe they owne the <hi>Authority</hi> of
the Scriptures, and alſo urge others
ſo to doe; but they well diſpute on
what grounds and Accounts they doe
foe. With thoſe we may deale in the
<hi>firſt way,</hi> by Teſtimony from the
Scriptures themſelves, which upon
their own <hi>Principles</hi> they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe.
When they ſhall be pleaſed to
informe us, that they have relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoſe <hi>Principles,</hi> and doe no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
owne the Scripture to be the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> We will withdraw the
<hi>Witneſſes</hi> upon their <hi>Exceptions</hi> whom
for the preſent we make uſe of. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
that are innate and ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

as <hi>Mediums</hi> of <hi>Artificiall</hi> Arguments

them who at preſent own not
the Authority of the Scripture on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
account whatever, or who are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. In both theſe caſes the
<hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the Scripture is pleaded,
and is to be received; or cannot with
any pretence of Reaſon be refuſed; in
the <hi>former,</hi> upon the account of the
acknowledged Authority and <hi>Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the Witneſſe though ſpeaking in
its owne caſe; in the <hi>latter</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that <hi>ſelfe Evidence</hi> which the
Teſtimony inſiſted on is accompanied
withall, made out by ſuch <hi>Reaſonings</hi>
and Arguments as for the <hi>kind</hi> of
them, Perſons who owne not it's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
cannot but admit. In <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
things; if a man of knowne <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity</hi>
and unſpotted Reputation beare
Witneſſe in any cauſe, and give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable
Evidence to his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
from the very <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of the things whereof he ſpeakes,
as it is expected that thoſe who know
and admit of his <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
doe acquieſce in his <hi>Aſſertion,</hi>
ſo thoſe to whom he is a <hi>Stranger,</hi>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:170488:44"/>
who are not moved by his Authority,
will yet be overcome to aſſent to what
is witneſſed by him, from the nature
of the things he aſſerts, eſpecially if
there be a coincidence of all ſuch <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,</hi>
as are any way needfull
to give Evidence to the matter in hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Thus it is, in the caſe
under conſideration. For thoſe who
profeſſe themſelves to believe the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the Word of God,
and ſo owne the credit and fidelity of
the <hi>Witneſſe,</hi> it may reaſonably be
expected from them, yea in ſtrict
Juſtice <hi>demanded</hi> of them, that they
ſtand to the Teſtimony, that they
give to <hi>themſelves,</hi> and their owne
divine Originall. By ſaying that the
<hi>Scripture</hi> is the Word of God, and
then <hi>commanding</hi> as to prove it ſo to
be, they render themſelves obnoxious
unto every <hi>Teſtimony</hi> that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
from it, that ſo it is; and that it is
to be received on it's <hi>own</hi> Teſtimony.
This Witneſſe they cannot wave
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170488:44"/>
without diſavowing their owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<hi>Principles;</hi> without which <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
they have not the leaſt colour
of impoſing this taske on us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. As for them, with whom
we have not the Preſent advantage of
their own <hi>Acknowledgment,</hi> it is not
reaſonable to impoſe upon them with
the bare <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of that <hi>Witneſſe</hi>
concerning whom the Queſtion is,
whether he be worthy the <hi>Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
pleaded for; But yet Arguments
taken from the Scripture, from what
<hi>it is,</hi> and <hi>doth, it's</hi> Nature and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
by which the cauſes and ſprings
of all things are diſcovered, are not
to be refuſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. But it is neither of theſe,
that principally I intend to deale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
my preſent Diſcourſe is rather
about the ſatisfaction of our owne <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,</hi>
than the Anſwering of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>Objections.</hi> Only we muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
our <hi>Conſciences</hi> upon ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170488:45"/>
as will ſtand againſt all mens <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</hi>
This then is chiefly enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
after; namely what it is that gives
ſuch an <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word of God, as that relying
thereon we have a ſure Bottome and
foundation for our receiving them as
ſuch; and from whence it is, that thoſe
who receive them not in <hi>that manner,</hi>
are left <hi>inexcuſable</hi> in their damnable
unbeliefe. This we ſay, is in, and
from the Scripture its ſelfe; ſo that
there is no other need of any further
<hi>witneſſe</hi> or <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> nor is any, in the

                        <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Written

for the <hi>riſing of one from the dead,</hi>
is laid in the common Apprehenſion
of men not knowing the <hi>power</hi> of
God in the Scriptures; who thinke,
that if an <hi>evident miracle</hi> were
wrought, all pretences and pleas of
<hi>Unbeliefe</hi> would be excluded; who
doth not think ſo? Our <hi>Saviour</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers

then his <hi>owne,</hi> if the <hi>Socinians</hi> may be

yet the evidence of the miſſion of ſuch

what <hi>meanes</hi> ſoever (which indeed is all

Principles received by ſtronge Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,

By the manifeſtation of the truth we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

the firſt and only abſolute Truth, in the

reſts upon, and is the <hi>formall object</hi> of it;
ſo wherever the Word <hi>comes,</hi> by what

of Light to evidence to all, (and
will doe it <hi>eventually</hi> to all that are not
blinded by the God of this world) <hi>that
Authority</hi> of God it's Authour; And the
<hi>only Reaſon</hi> why it is not received by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the World to whom it is come, is,
the Advantage that <hi>Sathan</hi> hath to keep
them in ignorance and blindneſſe, by the

the Evidence of that Light which it hath

but the beaming of the Majeſty, Truth,

not, it ſhall not prejudice them who doe.
By this <hi>ſelfe evidencing</hi> Light, I ſay, doth
the Scripture make ſuch a <hi>propoſition</hi> of
it's ſelfe, as the Word of God, that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that the ſpirit immediatly, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
ſaith unto every <hi>individuall</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
this Book <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>containes</hi> the

of any ſuch Teſtimony. Yea the
Principles we have laid downe, reſolving

conſiſts not in a <hi>perſwaſion</hi> that a man
takes up, he knowes not well how, or why;
only this he knowes, he will not <hi>Depoſe</hi>
it though it coſt him his life. This would
be like that, which by <hi>Morinus</hi> is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed

But if a man ſhould ſay, that

Word of God, and that he will <hi>dye</hi> a

And this Teſtimony of his, as it is Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative,

more Efficacy, Power and
Certainty unto them that doe receive it,
then any Voice, or <hi>internall</hi> Word, boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted

which, as it ſatisfies our ſoules

in reference unto the ſatisfaction of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to whom the Word of God ſhall

Power, Efficacy, Majeſty and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
affords us the <hi>Witneſse,</hi> that our faith is
reſolved unto. And thus whereas there
are but two heads, whereunto all Grounds
of Aſſent do belong, namely <hi>Authority</hi> of
Teſtimony, and the <hi>ſelfe Evidence of
Truth,</hi> they do here both concurre in one.
In the ſame Word we have both the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

be anſwered, that their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> is to
be received becauſe they are the <hi>Church

I can any other way have any Kowledge
of them ſo to be, or of any <hi>Authority</hi>
that any number of men, more, or leſſe,
can have in this caſe, under that Name or
Notion, unleſſe by the <hi>Scripture</hi> it's ſelfe;
And if ſo, it will quickly appeare what
place is to be allotted to their <hi>Teſtimony,</hi>
who cannot be admitted as <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the Scripture it's ſelfe be owned and
received; becauſe they have neither <hi>plea</hi> nor
claime to be ſo admitted, but only from
the <hi>Scripture:</hi> If they ſhall averre, that
they <hi>take this honour</hi> to <hi>themſelves,</hi> and
that without Relation to the Scripture
they claime a right of Authoritative wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
bearing in this caſe, I ſay againe, upon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170488:72"/>
the generall grounds of <hi>naturall</hi> Reaſon,
and Equity, I have no more inducements
to give credit to <hi>their Aſſertions,</hi> then to
an alike number of men holding out a
<hi>Tradition</hi> utterly to the contrary of what
they aſſert.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 23. But yet ſuppoſe, that <hi>this</hi>
alſo were granted, and that men might be
allowed to ſpeake in their owne name and
Authority, giving <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which upon the <hi>hypotheſis</hi> under
conſideration, God himſelfe is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to doe; I ſhall deſire to know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when the <hi>Church</hi> declares the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to be the Word of God unto us,
it doth apprehend <hi>any thing</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
as the Ground of that Judgment and
declaration or no? If it ſayes no; but
that it is propoſed upon <hi>it's ſole Authority;</hi>
then ſurely if we thinke Good to <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe
in this deciſion</hi> of this doubt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
it is full time for us, to lay aſide all
our <hi>ſtuddies</hi> and enquiries after the <hi>Mind</hi>
of God, and ſeek only what that <hi>man,</hi> or
<hi>thoſe men</hi> ſay, who are intruſted with this
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170488:72"/>
Authority, as they ſay, and as they would
have us believe them, though we know
not at all how or by what meanes they
came by it; ſeeing they dare not pretend
any thing from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> leaſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they direct us to <hi>that,</hi> in the firſt place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 24. If it be ſaid, that they
doe upon other accounts <hi>judge</hi> and believe
the ſcripture to be <hi>true,</hi> and to be the
Word of God; I ſuppoſe it will not be
thought <hi>unreaſonable</hi> if we enquire after
thoſe Grounds and accounts, ſeeing they
are of ſo great concernement unto us; All
Truths in Relations conſiſting, in their
<hi>conſonancy</hi> and Agreement, to the <hi>nature</hi>
of the things they deliver, I deſire to
know how they came to judge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonancy,
betweene the <hi>nature</hi> of the things
delivered in the Scripture, and the <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of them therein? The things whereof
we ſpeake being heavenly, <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious,
and ſupernaturall, there cannot
be any <hi>knowledge</hi> obtained of them but
by the Word it's ſelfe. How then can
they make any Judgment of the Truth of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170488:73"/>
that Scripture in the Relation of theſe
things, which are no where to be <hi>known</hi> (I
ſpeak of many of them) in the leaſt, but
by that Scripture its ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 25. If they ſhall ſay, that they
found their judgment and declaration upon
ſome <hi>diſcovery,</hi> that the Scripture makes
of its ſelfe unto them; they affirme the
<hi>ſame</hi> that we plead for: only they would
very deſireouſly appropriate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Priviledge of being <hi>able</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
that <hi>diſcovery</hi> ſo made in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
To make good this claime, they
muſt either plead ſomewhat from <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
or from the Scriptures: if from
<hi>themſelves,</hi> it can be nothing, but that
they <hi>ſee,</hi> like the men of <hi>China,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are blind, or have but <hi>one eye</hi> at the
beſt, being <hi>wiſer</hi> then any others, and more
able to <hi>diſcerne</hi> then they. Now though
I ſhall eaſily grant them to be very <hi>ſubtle</hi>
and <hi>cunning,</hi> yet that they are <hi>ſo much wiſer</hi>
then all the world beſides, that they are
meet to <hi>impoſe</hi> upon their beliefe things
that they neither <hi>do,</hi> nor can <hi>diſcerne</hi> or
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170488:73"/>
know, I would not be thought to <hi>admit,</hi>
untill I can believe my ſelfe and all others
not of their ſociety or combination, to be
<hi>beaſts</hi> of the field, and they as the <hi>ſerpent</hi>
amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 26. If it be from the <hi>Scripture</hi>
that they ſeek to make Good this claime;
then as we cauſe them there to make a
<hi>ſtand,</hi> which is all we aime at, ſo their plea
muſt be from the <hi>promiſe</hi> of ſome ſpeciall
Aſſiſtance granted to them for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
if their aſſiſtance be that of the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
it is either of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> that is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to believers, to worke in them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deſcribed and related, or it is ſome
<hi>private</hi> Teſtimony that they pretend is
afforded to them; If the <hi>former</hi> be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
we are in a condition, wherein the
<hi>neceſsity</hi> of devolving all on the ſcripture
its ſelfe, to decide and judge who are <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers,</hi>
lies in every ones view; if the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
who ſhall give me <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> that
when they pretend that <hi>witneſſe</hi> and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
they do not <hi>lye</hi> and deceive; we

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 27. I confeſſe the Argument
which hath not long ſince been ſingled
out, and <hi>dextrovſly</hi> mannaged by an <hi>able</hi>
and learned pen, namely; of proving the
Truth of the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the Scripture,<note place="margin">D. Ward Eſſay &amp;c.</note>
from the Truth of the <hi>ſtory,</hi> and the Truth
of the ſtory from the certainty there
is that the Writers of the Books of the
<hi>Bible,</hi> were thoſe Perſons whoſe names
and inſcriptions they beare; ſo purſuing
the Evidence, that what they wrote
was <hi>true</hi> and <hi>known</hi> to them ſo to be, from
all <hi>requiſita</hi> that may poſſibly be <hi>ſought</hi>
after for the ſtrengthening of ſuch Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is of <hi>great force</hi> and efficacy. It is
I ſay of great <hi>force and efficacy</hi> as to the
end for which it is inſiſted on; that is to
ſatisfy mens <hi>rational Enquiries;</hi> but as to a
ground of faith, it hath the ſame <hi>inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
with all other Arguments of the like
kind; Though I ſhould grant that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
&amp; <hi>penmen</hi> of the Scripture were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the greateſt <hi>induſtry, honeſty, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170488:74"/>
faithfullneſſe, holineſſe</hi> that ever lived

<hi>wrote</hi> nothing, but what themſelves had
as Good Aſſurance of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as what men by
their ſenſes of ſeeing and hearing are able
to attaine; yet ſuch a Knowledge and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
is not a <hi>ſufficient foundation</hi> for
the faith of the Church of God; if they
received not every Word by <hi>inſpiration,</hi>
and that <hi>evidencing</hi> it's ſelfe unto us, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then by the Authority of <hi>their
Integrity,</hi> it can be no foundation for us
to build our faith upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 28. Before the committing
of the Scriptures to writing, God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the World an Experiment what keepers
men were of this <hi>Revelation</hi> by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
Within ſome hundreds of yeares
after the <hi>flood,</hi> all knowledge of him,
through the <hi>craft</hi> of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
of the minds of men which is unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable,
was ſo loſt, that nothing, but as it
were the <hi>creation of a new World,</hi> or the
Erection of a new Church ſtate by new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
could relieve it. After that great
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170488:75"/>
                        <hi>triall</hi> what can be farther pretended, on
the behalfe of <hi>Tradition</hi> I know not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 29. The ſumme of all is; The
mercifull Good Providence of God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by divers and <hi>various meanes;</hi> uſing
therin amongſt other things, the <hi>miniſtry</hi>
of men and <hi>Churches,</hi> preſerved the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Teſtament in
the World; and by the ſame gratious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſall
afforded them unto us, they are
received and ſubmitted unto by us, upon
the <hi>Grounds</hi> and evidences of their divine
<hi>Originall</hi> before inſiſted on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect</hi> 30. Upon the whole matter
then, I would know, whither if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
ſhould be <hi>brought</hi> to any man,
<hi>when,</hi> or <hi>where,</hi> he could not poſſibly have
it atteſted to be the Word of God, by
any <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private</hi> Authority of <hi>man,</hi>
or <hi>Church, Tradition,</hi> or otherwiſe, he
were bound to believe it or no? whither
he ſhould <hi>obey</hi> God in believing, or <hi>ſin</hi> in
the rejecting of it? ſuppoſe de do but take
it into conſideration, doe but give it the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170488:75"/>
reading or hearing, ſeeing in every place
it avers it's ſelfe to be the Word of God,
he muſt of neceſſity either give credit unto
it, or disbelieve it; To hang in ſuſpenſe,
which ariſeth from the imperfect actings
of the faculties of the ſoule, is in it's ſelfe
a <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> and in this caſe being recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
no the worſt ſide, is <hi>interpretatively</hi>
a Rejection. If you ſay it were the duty
of ſuch an one to <hi>believe</hi> it, you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the ſcripture it's ſelfe a <hi>ſufficient
Evidence</hi> of it's own originall Authority;
without which it can be no man's duty to
believe it. If you ſay, it would not be
his <hi>ſinne</hi> to reject and refuſe it, to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all that it ſpeakes in the name of
God; then this is that you ſay; God may
<hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really</hi> ſpeake unto a man, (as
he doth by the Scripture) and yet that
man not be <hi>bound</hi> to believe him. We
deale not thus with one another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 31. To wind up then the <hi>plea</hi>
inſiſted on in the foregoing Chapter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>ſelfe evidencing</hi> Light and
Power of the Scripture, from which we
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170488:76"/>
have diverted, and to make way for ſome
<hi>other conſiderations,</hi> that tend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of their <hi>divine Originall,</hi> I ſhall
cloſe this diſcourſe with the two generall
conſiderations following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 32. 1 Then laying aſide theſe
<hi>failing pleas,</hi> there ſeemes to be a <hi>morall
impoſſibility</hi> that the Word of God, ſhould
not manifeſt it's own <hi>Originall,</hi> and it's
Authority from thence. <hi>Quaelibet herba
deum.</hi> There is no <hi>Worke</hi> of God, as was
ſhewed, but reveales it's Authour. A
curious <hi>Artificer</hi> imparts that of <hi>forme,</hi>
ſhape, proportion, and comelineſſe to
the fruit of his <hi>Invention,</hi> and worke of
his <hi>hands,</hi> that every one that looks upon
it, muſt conclude, that it comes from <hi>skill</hi>
and Ability. A man in the delivery of
his mind in the writing of a <hi>Book,</hi> will
give it ſuch an impreſſion of Reaſon, that
though you cannot conclude that this, or
that man wrote it, yet you muſt, that it
was the product of a man, or Rationall
creature: yea ſome <hi>individuall</hi> men of
Excellency in ſome skill, are inſtantly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170488:76"/>
knowne by them, that are able to judge
in that Art or skill, by the Effects of their
skill. This is the <hi>Peice,</hi> this is the <hi>hand,</hi>
the Worke of ſuch an one. How eaſy is
it for thoſe who are converſant about <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Authours</hi> to diſcover an Authour by
the ſpirit and <hi>ſtile</hi> of his writings. Now
certainly this is <hi>ſtrange</hi> beyond all beliefe,
that almoſt every <hi>Agent</hi> ſhould give an
impreſſe to it's worke, whereby it may
be appropriated unto him, and only the
<hi>Word,</hi> wherein it was the deſigne of the
Great and Holy God to give us a portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as it were of his Wiſdome, Holineſſe
and Goodneſſe, ſo farre as we are capable
of an Acquaintance with him in this Life,
is not able to declare and evince it's Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.
That God who is <hi>prima Veritas,</hi>
the firſt and ſoveraigne Truth, infinitely
ſeperated and diſtinguiſhed from all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
on all accounts whatever, ſhould
<hi>Write</hi> a Book, or at leaſt immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
it, commanding us to receive it as <hi>his,</hi>
under the <hi>penalty</hi> of his Eternall diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and yet that <hi>Booke</hi> not make a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
diſcovery of it's ſelfe to be his, to be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170488:77"/>
from him, is paſt all beliefe. Let men that
live on <hi>things</hi> received by <hi>Tradition</hi> from
their Fathers, who perhaps never had
ſenſe of any <hi>reall</hi> Tranſaction betweene
God and their ſoules, who ſcarſe ever
peruſed the Word <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> in their lives,
nor brought their <hi>Conſciences</hi> to it; pleaſe

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 33. I ſuppoſe it will not be
denyed but that it was the Mind and Will
of God, that thoſe to whom his Word
ſhould <hi>come,</hi> ſhould <hi>owne</hi> it and receive it
as his; if not, it were <hi>no ſinne</hi> in them to
reject it, unto whom it doth ſo come; if
it <hi>were,</hi> then either he hath given thoſe

might be knowne to be his, or he hath
not done ſo; and that either becauſe he

on the <hi>ſeveralls;</hi> take one inſtance in the

horrible <hi>fruits</hi> and effects have mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
on this account produced? What
have they not invented? What have they
not <hi>done?</hi> What have they not <hi>ſuffered?</hi>
and yet continued in dread and bondage
all their daies? Now with what a Glorious

ſuch men? This firſt <hi>aſtoniſheth,</hi> then

This is the deſigne of the Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

particulars of <hi>preſent</hi> Worſhip, or <hi>future</hi>
Bleſſedneſſe; this meets with men in all
their wandrings, ſtops them in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions,
convinces them of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
folly, uncertainty, falſeneſſe of all
their Reaſonings about theſe things; and
that with ſuch an Evidence and Light, as
at once ſubdues them, captivates their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and quiets their ſoules: ſo was
that old <hi>Roman</hi> World conquered by it;
ſo ſhall the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> be, in Gods good

                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. Of what hath been ſpoken,
this is the ſumme. All mankind that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their <hi>dependance</hi> upon God,
and Relation to him, are <hi>naturally</hi> (and
cannot be otherwiſe) grievouſly involved
and perplexed in their hearts, thoughts,
and Reaſonings, about the Worſhip of
God, Acceptation with him having ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the future Enjoyment of him;
ſome with more cleare and diſtinct Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
of theſe things; Some under more
<hi>darke</hi> and generall notions of them are
thus exerciſed; To extricate themſelves,
and to come to ſome iſſue in and about
theſe enquiries, hath been the great <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne</hi>
of their Lives, the Aime they had in
all things they did, as they thought, <hi>Well</hi>
and <hi>laudably</hi> in this world. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all which, they were never able to
deliver themſelves, no not <hi>one</hi> of them,
or attaine ſatisfaction to their ſoules, but
waxed vaine in their imaginations, and
their <hi>fooliſh hearts were more and more
darkened;</hi> In this eſtate of things, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Scripture comeing in with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170488:82"/>
full, unqueſtionable <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to all
theſe, ſuited to the enquirings of every
<hi>individuall</hi> ſoule, with a largeneſſe of
Wiſdome, and depth of Goodneſſe, not
to be fathomed, it muſt needs be from
that God with whom we have to doe. And
thoſe who are not perſwaded hereby, that
will not caſt Anchor in this harbour, let
them put to ſea once more, if they dare;
turne themſelves looſe to other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and try if all the forementioned
<hi>perplexities</hi> do not inevitably returne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Another conſideration of
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Scripture to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
regards ſome particulars of it. There
are ſome <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Scripture, ſome
Revelations in it, ſo <hi>ſublimely</hi> glorious, of
ſo profound and myſterious an <hi>Excellency,</hi>
that at the firſt propoſall of them, nature
ſtartles, ſhrinks, and is taken with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
meeting with that which is <hi>above</hi> it,
too great and too <hi>excellent</hi> for it, which it
could deſirouſly avoid and decline; but
yet gathering it ſelfe up to them, it yeilds,
and finds, that unleſſe they are <hi>accepted,</hi>
                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:170488:82"/>
and ſubmitted unto, though unſearchable,
that not only All that hath been received,
muſt be rejected, but alſo the whole <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi>
of the <hi>Creature</hi> on God be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
or rendred only <hi>dreadfull,</hi> terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and deſtructive to nature its ſelfe.
Such are the Doctrines of the Trinity, of
the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the ſon of God, of the
Reſurrection of the dead, of the <hi>new birth,</hi>
and the like. At the firſt Revelation of
theſe things, nature is <hi>amazed,</hi> cries, how
can theſe things be? Or gathers up it
ſelfe to <hi>Oppoſition;</hi> this is babling, like the
<hi>Athenians; folly,</hi> as all the <hi>wiſe</hi> Greeks. But
when the <hi>Eyes</hi> of Reaſon are a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
though it can never clearly behold
the <hi>Glory</hi> of this Sun, yet it confeſſeth a
Glory to be in it, above all that it is able
to apprehend. I could manifeſt in <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi>
that the Doctrines before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſeverall others are of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
namely though great, above and
beyond the reach of Reaſon, yet upon
ſearch found to be ſuch, as without <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion</hi>
to them, the whole comfortable
Relation between God and man muſt needs
be diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:170488:83"/>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. Let us take a view in our
Way of <hi>one</hi> of the Inſtances. What is
there in the whole Book of God, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at firſt ſight doth more recoyle at,
then the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity?</hi> How
many do yet <hi>ſtumble</hi> &amp; fall at it? I confeſſe
the Doctrine its ſelfe is but <hi>ſparingly,</hi> yet
it is <hi>clearly</hi> and diſtinctly delivered unto
us in the Scripture. The ſumme of it is;
that God is <hi>one;</hi> His nature, or his Being,
<hi>one;</hi> That all the <hi>Properties,</hi> or infinite
Eſſentiall Excellencies of God, as God,
do belong to that <hi>one nature</hi> and Being.
This God is infinitely Good, Holy, Juſt,
Powerfull, He is eternall, <hi>omnipotent, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t;</hi>
&amp; theſe things belong to none, but
him that is that <hi>One</hi> God. That this God
is the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; which
are not <hi>diverſe names</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Perſon,
nor <hi>diſtinct</hi> Attributes or Properties of
the ſame <hi>nature</hi> or Being; but <hi>One, Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and a <hi>Third,</hi> all <hi>equally</hi> that One
God, yet <hi>really</hi> diſtinguiſhed between
themſelves by ſuch uncommunicable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitute the <hi>One</hi> to be that <hi>One,</hi>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:170488:83"/>
and the <hi>Other</hi> to be that Other; and the
<hi>Third</hi> to be that Third. Thus the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is not the Union, nor <hi>Unity</hi> of three,
but it is a Trinity <hi>in</hi> Unity, or the <hi>Ternary</hi>
number of <hi>Perſons</hi> in the ſame Eſſence;
nor doth the <hi>Trinity</hi> in its formall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
denote the <hi>Eſsence,</hi> as if the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
were comprehended in the Trinity,
which is in each Perſon; but it denotes
only the <hi>diſtinction</hi> of the Perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in that Number.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. This I ſay is the ſumme of
this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as it is delivered unto us in
the Scripture. Here Reaſon is entangled;
yet after a while finds <hi>evidently,</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
this be embraced, all other things
wherein it hath to do with <hi>God,</hi> will not
be of <hi>value</hi> to the ſoule; this will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be made to appeare. Or all that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
which is <hi>here</hi> between God and
man, founded on the Revelation of his
mind and will unto him, which makes
way for his Enjoyment in <hi>Glory,</hi> there
are theſe two parts. 1 Gods gratious <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi>
of his Love, Goodneſſe &amp;c.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170488:84"/>
with the fruits of them unto man: 2. The
<hi>obedience</hi> of man unto God in a way of
<hi>Gratitude</hi> for that Love, according to the
mind and will of God revealed to him.
Theſe two compriſe the <hi>whole</hi> of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe
between God and man. Now
when the mind of man is <hi>exerciſed</hi> about
theſe things, he finds at <hi>laſt</hi> that they are
ſo wrapped up in the Doctrine of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
that without the beliefe, receiving,
and acceptance of it, it is utterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that any <hi>intereſt</hi> in them, ſhould be
obteined, or preſerved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. For the firſt; or the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi>
of God unto us in a Way of Love
and Goodneſſe, it is wholly <hi>founded</hi> upon,
and enwrapped in this Truth, both as to
the <hi>eternall</hi> Spring, and <hi>actuall</hi> Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. A few inſtances will evince this
Aſſertion. The Eternall fountaine of all
Grace, flowing from Love and Goodneſſe,
lies in Gods <hi>Election,</hi> or Predeſtination.
This being an Act of Gods <hi>Will,</hi> cannot
be apprehended, but as an eternall act of
his <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> or Word alſo. All the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170488:84"/>
thoughts of it's purſuit, lye in the
<hi>Covenant</hi> that was betweene the <hi>Father</hi>
and the <hi>Son,</hi> as to the Son's undrtaking to
execute that Purpoſe of his. This I have
at large elſewhere declared.</p>
                     <p>Take away then the doctrine of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and both theſe are gone; There can
be no <hi>purpoſe</hi> of Grace by the Father in
the ſon, no <hi>Covenant</hi> for the putting of
that purpoſe in Execution; and ſo the
foundation of all <hi>fruits</hi> of Love &amp; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
is loſt to the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. As to the Execution of
this <hi>Purpoſe,</hi> with the actuall diſpenſation
of the fruits of Grace and Goodneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, it lyes wholely in the unſpeakable
<hi>Condeſcention</hi> of the Son unto <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
with what enſued thereon. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi>
of the Eternall Word, by the
Power of the Holy Ghoſt, is the <hi>bottome</hi>
of our Participation of Grace. Without
it, it was abſolutely <hi>impoſſible</hi> that man
ſhould be made partake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of the favour of
God. Now this <hi>enwraps</hi> the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Trinity</hi> in it's boſome; nor can
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170488:85"/>
once be <hi>apprehended,</hi> without it's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.
Deny the Trinity, and
all this <hi>meanes</hi> of the <hi>Communication</hi> of
Grace, with the whole of the ſatisfaction,
and Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt <hi>falls</hi> to the
Ground. Every Tittle of it ſpeakes this
Truth: And they who deny the one, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. Our actuall <hi>Participation</hi>
of the fruits of this Grace, is by the Holy
Ghoſt. We cannot our ſelves <hi>ſeize</hi> on
them, nor bring them home to our
owne ſoules. The <hi>impoſsibility</hi> hereof I
cannot now ſtay to manifeſt. Now whence
is this Holy Ghoſt? Is he not <hi>ſent</hi> from the
Father, by the Son? Can we entertaine
any thought of his effectuall <hi>working</hi> in us,
and upon us, but it includes this whole
Doctrine? They therefore who deny the
<hi>Trinity</hi> deny the Efficacy of it's opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. So it is, as to our <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
unto God, whereby the Communion
betweene God and man is compleated.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170488:85"/>
Although the <hi>formall object</hi> of Divine
worſhip be the <hi>nature</hi> of God; and the
Perſons are not worſhipped as Perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
but as they are each of them God;
yet as God they are every one of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
to be worſhipped. So is it, as to
our faith, our Love our thanksgiving, all
our Obedience, as I have abundantly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated</hi>
in my Treatiſe of diſtinct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Father in <hi>Love,</hi> the Son
in <hi>Grace,</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt in the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the Goſpell. Thus without
the <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of this Truth, none
of that <hi>Obedience</hi> which God requireth at
our hands, can in a due manner be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. Hence the ſcripture ſpeakes
not of any thing <hi>betweene God and us,</hi> but
what is founded on this Account. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>worketh,</hi> the Son <hi>worketh,</hi> and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt <hi>worketh.</hi> The Father <hi>worketh</hi> not
but by the <hi>Son</hi> and his ſpirit; The Son &amp;
Spirit work not, but from the Father. The
Father <hi>Glorifieth</hi> the Son; the Son <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth</hi>
the Father; and the Holy Ghoſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170488:86"/>
them both. Before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world, the Son was <hi>with</hi> the
Father, and <hi>rejoyced</hi> in his peculiar worke
for the <hi>Redemption</hi> of mankind. At the
<hi>Creation,</hi> the Father <hi>made</hi> all things, but
by the Son, and the Power of the Spirit.
In Redemption the Father ſends the Son;
the Son by his owne condeſcention un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
the worke, and is <hi>incarnate</hi> by
the Holy Ghoſt. The Father as was ſaid,
<hi>communicates</hi> his love, and all the fruites
of it unto us by the Son; as the Holy
Ghoſt doth the merrits, and <hi>fruits</hi> of the
mediation of the Son. The Father is
not knowne nor worſhipped, but by and
in the Son; Nor Father or Son but by the
Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</p>

ſoule that was before ſtartled at the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
in the notion of it, is fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that all the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> it hath ſought
after in it's ſeeking unto God, is utterly
loſt, if this be not admitted. There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any foundation left of the <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of love to him, nor meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170488:86"/>
Obedience unto God. Beſides,
all the things that he hath been enquiring
after, appeare on this <hi>account</hi> in their
Glory, beauty &amp; reality unto him: ſo that,
that which moſt <hi>ſtaggerd</hi> him at firſt in
the <hi>receiving</hi> of the Truth, becauſe of it's
deep myſterious glory, doth now moſt
confirme him in the <hi>embracing</hi> of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of its <hi>neceſsity, Power,</hi> and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Excellency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 21. And this is one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Many belonging to the <hi>things</hi>
of the Scripture, that upon the <hi>Grounds</hi>
before mentioned, hath in it, as to my
ſenſe and Apprehenſion, an Evidence of
Conviction not to be withſtood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. Another conſideration of
the like Efficacy, may be taken from a
briefe <hi>veiw</hi> of the whole Scripture with
the deſigne of it. The <hi>conſent of parts</hi> or
Harmony of the ſcripture in it's ſelfe, and
every part of it with each other, and with
the whole, is commonly <hi>pleaded</hi> as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of it's divine Originall. Thus
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170488:87"/>
much certainly it doth evince beyond all
<hi>poſsible</hi> contradiction, that the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from <hi>one</hi> and the ſame principle;
hath the <hi>ſame</hi> Authout; and He wiſe, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning,</hi>
able to comprehend the whole
compaſſe of what he intended to deliver
and reveale. Otherwiſe, or by <hi>any</hi> other,
that <hi>oneneſſe</hi> of Spirit, deſigne and ayme,
in unſpeakable variety and diverſity of
meanes of it's delivery, that abſolute cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency
of it to it's ſelfe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from any thing elſe, could not have
been attained. Now it is certaine, that
this <hi>principle</hi> muſt be <hi>ſummum</hi> in it's kind;
either <hi>bonum,</hi> or <hi>malum.</hi> If the Scripture
be what it <hi>reveales</hi> and declares it ſelfe to
be, it is then unqueſtionably the <hi>Word of
the Living God, Truth</hi> it's ſelfe; for that
it profeſſeth of it's ſelfe, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the ending; to which profeſſion
all that it <hi>reveales</hi> anſwers abſolutely, and
unqueſtionably in a tendency to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
alone. If it be not ſo, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that the <hi>Authour</hi> of it had a
<hi>blaſphemous</hi> deſigne to hold forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be God, who is not ſo; a <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170488:87"/>
deſigne to deceive the Sons of men,
and to make them believe that they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and honour God; and obey him when
they doe not; and ſo to draw them into
everlaſting deſtruction, and that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
theſe ends of blaſphemy, Atheiſme
and malice, he hath laid out in a <hi>long
courſe</hi> of time, all the induſtry and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that a Creature could be made
partaker of: Now he that ſhould doe thus,
muſt be the <hi>Devill,</hi> and none elſe; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creature can poſſibly arrive at that
<hi>height</hi> of obſtinacy in evill. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
whilſt God is pleaſed to continue
unto us any thing, whereby we are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from the <hi>Beaſts</hi> that periſh; whilſt
there is a <hi>ſence</hi> of a diſtance betweene
Good and Evill abiding amongſt men,
it cannot fall upon the underſtanding of
any man, that that Doctrine which is ſo
<hi>holy</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> ſo abſolutely leading to
the utmoſt improvement of whatever is
good, juſt, commendable and praiſe
Worthy, ſo ſuitable to all the Light of
God, of <hi>Good</hi> and Evil that remaines in us;
could proceed from any one everlaſtingly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170488:88"/>
hardened in Evill, and that in the purſuit
of the wickedſt deſigne, that that wicked
one could poſſibly be engaged in; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to enthrone himſelfe, and malitiouſly
to cheat, couſen and ruine the ſoules of
men; ſo that upon neceſſity the Scripture
can own no Authour but him, whoſe it
is, even the <hi>Living God.</hi>

It cannot be denyed, but that this often
fals out through the Corruption of the

                     <p>Sect. 5. <hi>But my preſent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being not to be extended beyond
the concernement of the Truth which
in the</hi> foregoing diſcourſe <hi>I have pleaded
for, I ſhall firſt propoſe a briefe</hi> abſtract
<hi>thereof, as to that part of it, which ſeemes
to be eſpecially concerned, and then lay
downe what to me appeares in it's preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
in the</hi> Volumes <hi>now under debate;
not doubting but a fuller account of the</hi>
whole, <hi>will by ſome or other be ſpedily
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170488:93"/>
tendred unto the Learned and impartiall
Readers of them. The ſumme of what
I am pleading for, as to the particular
Head to be vindicated is; that as the</hi>
Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament,
were immediatly, and entirely given out by
God himſelfe, his mind being in them repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
unto us, without the leaſt interveniency
of ſuch mediums, and Waies, as were capable
of giving change or alteration to the leaſt
iota or ſyllable; ſo by his Good and mercifull
providentiall diſpenſation, in his Love to
his Word and Church, his whole Word as
firſt given out by him, is preſerved unto us
entire in the Originall Languages; where
ſhining in its owne beauty and luſtre, (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in all Tranſlations ſo farre, as they faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
repreſent the Originalls) it manifeſts
and evidences unto the conſciences of men,
without other <hi>forraigne</hi> help or aſsiſtance, its
divine originall and Authority.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. Now the ſeverall Aſſertions
or Propoſitions contained in this poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are to me ſuch important Truths,
that I ſhall not be blamed in the leaſt by
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170488:94"/>
my own <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor I hope by any others,
in contending for them, judging them
<hi>fundamentall</hi> parts of the <hi>faith</hi> once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the ſaints; and though ſome of
them may ſeeme to be leſſe weighty then
others, yet they are ſo <hi>concatenated</hi> in
themſelves, that by the removall or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of any one of them, our <hi>intereſt</hi>
in the others is utterly taken away. It will
aſſuredly be granted, that the perſwaſion
of the <hi>coming forth</hi> of the Word immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from God, in the way pleaded for,
is the foundation of all faith, hope, and
obedience. But what I pray will it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
us, that God did ſo once <hi>deliver</hi> his
Word, if we are not aſſured alſo, that,
that word ſo delivered, hath been by his
ſpeciall <hi>care</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> preſerved en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and uncorrupt unto us; or that it doth
not evidence and manifeſt its ſelfe to be
his Word, being ſo preſerved. Bleſſed
may we ſay were the <hi>Ages paſt,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Word of God in its unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
power and purity, when it ſhone
brightly in its own glorious native Light,
and was free from thoſe <hi>defects</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170488:94"/>
which through the <hi>default</hi> of
men, in a long tract of time it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted;
but for us, as we know not well
where to lay a ſure foundation of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that <hi>this Book</hi> rather then any other
doth conteine what is left unto us of that
Word of his, ſo it is impoſſible we ſhould
ever come to any certainty almoſt of any
<hi>individuall VVord,</hi> or expreſſion, whither
it be from God or no; far be it from the
thoughts of any Good man, that God
whoſe <hi>Covenant</hi> with his Church, is, that
his Word and ſpirit ſhall never depart
from it. <hi>Iſa. 59. 21. Math. 5. 18. 1 Pet. 1.
25. 1 Cor. 11. Math.</hi> 28. 20. hath left it
in uncertainties, about the things that are
the foundation of all that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
which he requires at our hands.</p>
                     <p>As then I have in the foregoing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
evinced as I hope the <hi>ſelfe Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Light and power</hi> of the Scripture, ſo

<hi>men,</hi> their <hi>Oſcitancy</hi> and negligence in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
the old Heathen Authors, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,

in a Chriſtian, or any one that
hath the leaſt ſenſe of the nature and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of the Word, or the care of God
towards his Church. Shall we think that
men who wrote out Books, wherein them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and others were no more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
then it is poſſible for men to be in
the writings of the Perſons mentioned,
and others like them, had as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be carefull and diligent in that they
did, as thoſe who knew and conſidered
that every letter and <hi>Tittle</hi> that they were
tranſcribing, was part of the Word of the
Great God, wherein the <hi>eternall</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their own ſoules, and the ſoules
of others did lye. Certainly whatever

In their exact conſideration of every let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

<hi>Occidentall</hi> or <hi>Paleſtine</hi> Jewes, all that I
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170488:107"/>
know of them, (and I wiſh that thoſe that
know more of them would informe me
better) is that they firſt <hi>appeared</hi> in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

doe I know any that doe, it may
be ſome doe; but in my preſent haſt, I
cannot enquire after them. But the thing
it's ſelfe proclaimes their no importance,
and <hi>Capellus</hi> the moſt skillfull and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

Text, ſo to give countenance to his <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica
Sacra,</hi> confeſſes that they are all <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall,</hi>
and not in matters of any moment.
Beſides theſe, there are no other various
lections of the old Teſtament. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures

Abilities to correct the word of God, are
not to be admitted to that Title. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                     <p>However now <hi>Sathan</hi> ſeems to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
the utmoſt of his <hi>malice,</hi> men of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages the utmoſt of their <hi>negligence,</hi>
of theſe latter Ages of their <hi>diligence,</hi> the

nothing at all to the prejudice of our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
as may poſſibly, God aſſiſting, be
further manifeſted hereafter in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
conſideration of ſome, or all of theſe
<hi>divers Readings</hi> therein exhibited unto us.
Thoſe which are of importance, have been
already conſidered by others; eſpecially
<hi>Glaſſius; Tract. 1. lib.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. It is evident that the deſigne
of this <hi>Appendix</hi> was to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
every thing of this ſort, that might
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170488:114"/>
by any meanes be afforded; At the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that the <hi>Reader</hi> may not be too much
ſtartled at the fruit of their diligence,
whoſe work and labour it was, I ſhall only
remarke concerning it ſome few things
that on a generall view of it occurre unto
me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. 1. Then here is profeſſedly
no <hi>choice</hi> made, nor judgment uſed in <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,</hi>
which may indeed be called <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Lections;</hi> but all differences what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that could be found in any <hi>copies,</hi>
printed or written, are equally given out.
Hence many differences that had been
formerly rejected by learned men for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
corruptions, are here tendred us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
The very firſt obſervation in the
<hi>Treatiſe</hi> next printed unto this collection
in the <hi>Appendix</hi> it ſelfe, rejects one of the
varieties, as a corruption. So have ſome
others of them been by <hi>Arias Montanus,
Camero,</hi> and many more. It is not every
variety or difference in a copy that ſhould
preſently be cried up for a <hi>various Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
A man might with as good colour
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170488:114"/>
and pretence take all the <hi>printed copies</hi> he
could get, of various editions, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out the <hi>errata Typographica,</hi> print
them for various Lections, as give us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I ſhall ſay the moſt of theſe in this <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi>
under that name. It may be ſaid
indeed, that the <hi>Compoſers</hi> of this <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi>
found it not incumbent on them, to
make any judgment of the <hi>Readings,</hi>
which <hi>de facto</hi> they found in the copies
they peruſed, but merely to repreſent
what they ſo found, leaving the judgment
of them unto others; I ſay alſo it may be
ſo; and therefore as I do not reflect on
them, nor their diligence, ſo I hope they
nor others, will not be offended, that I
give this notice of what Judgment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
yet to be made concerning them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. 2 Whereas <hi>Beza,</hi> who is
commonly blamed by men of all ſides and
parties, for making too bold upon <hi>various
lections,</hi> hath profeſſedly ſtigmatized his
own <hi>M S,</hi> that he ſent unto <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as
ſo corrupt in the <hi>Goſpell of Luke,</hi> that he
durſt not publiſh the <hi>various lections</hi> of it,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170488:115"/>
for feare of offence and ſcandall, however
he thought it had not fallen into the hands
of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that had deſignedly depraved
it; we have here, if I miſtake not, all the
<hi>corruptions</hi> of that copy given us as various
<hi>Readings;</hi> for though I have not ſeen
the copy its ſelfe, yet the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the <hi>various lections</hi> in that
Goſpell, into a <hi>bulke</hi> as bigge or bigger,
than the collection of all the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
beſides the Goſpels and Acts,
wherein that copy is cited 1440 times,
puts it out of all queſtion that ſo we are
dealt withall: Now if this courſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and every <hi>ſtigmatized</hi> copy may be
ſearched for differences, and theſe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>printed</hi> to be <hi>various readings,</hi> there
is no doubt but we may have enough of
them to frighten poor <hi>unſtable ſoules</hi> into
the armes of the pretended infallible
guide; I meane as to the uſe that will be
made of this worke, by ſuch perſons as
<hi>Morinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:170488:115"/>
and that whilſt the learned <hi>Collectors</hi>
had their hands and minds buſied about
other things, ſome <hi>miſtakes</hi> did fall into
this worke of gathering theſe <hi>various le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
Some things I meet withall in it,
that I profeſſe, I cannot bring to any
good conſiſtency among themſelves; to
let paſſe particular inſtances, and inſiſt on
one only of a more generall and eminent
importance. In the entrance unto this
collection an account is given us of the
<hi>antiert copies,</hi> out of which theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
are made; Among the reſt one of
them is ſaid to be an antient copy in the
<hi>Library</hi> of <hi>Emanuell Colledge in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge:</hi>
this is noted by the letters <hi>Em:</hi>
throughout the whole collection. Now
whereas it is told us in thoſe <hi>preliminary
cautions</hi> and obſervations, that it contains
only <hi>Pauls Epiſtles,</hi> I wonder how it is
come to paſſe, that ſo many various <hi>lecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in the <hi>Goſpels</hi> and <hi>Acts,</hi> as in the <hi>farra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>
its ſelfe are fixed on the credit of that
book, could come to be gathered out of
a copy of <hi>Pauls Epiſtles;</hi> certainly here
muſt be ſome miſtake, either in the <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170488:116"/>
Authors</hi> of the previous directions, or
by thoſe employed to gather the <hi>varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
following; And it may be ſuppoſed
that that miſtake goes not alone; ſo that
upon a farther conſideration of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
it may be, we ſhall not find them ſo
clearly atteſted, as at firſt view they ſeeme
to be. It would indeed be a miracle, if in
a worke of that <hi>variety</hi> many things
ſhould not eſcape the eye of the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
obſerver.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. I am not then upon the whole
matter out of hopes, but that upon a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<hi>review</hi> of all theſe <hi>various Lections,</hi>
they may be reduced to a leſſe <hi>offenſive,</hi>
and leſſe formidable number; Let it be
remembred that the <hi>vulgar copie</hi> we uſe,
was the publick <hi>poſſeſsion</hi> of many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
that upon the invention of
Printing, it was in actuall <hi>authority</hi>
throughout the World, with them that
uſed and underſtood that Language, as far
as any thing appeares to the contrary. Let
<hi>that</hi> then paſſe for the ſtandard which is
confeſſedly its right and due, and we ſhall
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170488:116"/>
God aſſiſting quickly ſee, how little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
there is to pretend ſuch <hi>varieties</hi> of
<hi>Readings,</hi> as we are now ſurpriſed withall.
For 1. Let thoſe places be <hi>ſeparated,</hi>
which are not ſufficiently atteſted unto, ſo
as to pretend to be <hi>various lections:</hi> it
being againſt all pretence of Reaſon, that
every miſtake of every obſcure private
copy, perhaps not above 2 or 300 yeares
old, (or if elder) ſhould be admitted as a
various lection, againſt the concurrent
conſent of it may be all others that
are extant in the world, and that
without any congruity of Reaſon, as to
the ſenſe of the Text where it is fallen out.
Men may if they pleaſe take paines to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the world, wherein ſuch and ſuch
<hi>copies</hi> are corrupted, or miſtaken, but to
impoſe their known failings on us as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
lections, is a courſe not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
                     <p>2. Let the ſame judgment, and that
deſervedly, paſſe on all thoſe <hi>different pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
which are altogether inconſiderable,
conſiſting in <hi>accents</hi> or the change of a <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
not in the leaſt intrenching on the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170488:117"/>
ſenſe of the place, or giving the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of any other ſenſe to be poſſibly
gathered out of them, but what is in the
approved reading; to what end ſhould the
minds of men be troubled with them or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, being evident miſtakes of the
<hi>ſcribes,</hi> and of no importance at all.</p>
                     <p>3. Let them alſo be removed from
the pretences which carry their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
along with them, that they are
<hi>ſpurious,</hi> either 1 By their <hi>ſuperfluity</hi> or
<hi>redundancy</hi> of unneceſſary Words, or 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>
their <hi>deficiency</hi> in words, evidently neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to the ſenſe of their places, or 3. their
<hi>incoherence</hi> with the Text in their ſeverall
ſtations, or 4. <hi>evidence</hi> of being intended
as expoſitory of difficulties, having been
moved and aſſoyled by ſome of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
upon the places, and their reſolutions
being intimated; or 5. are foyſted out of
the 70, as many places out of the <hi>new</hi> have
been aſſerted into that copy of the old; or

                        <hi>various Lections;</hi> and of how very little

that we may have full Aſſurance, that we

them in Generall, I muſt crave leave to
ſay, and it being but the Repreſentation of
mens avowed Judgments, I hope I may
ſay without offence, that together with
many high and honourable <hi>expreſſions</hi>
concerning the Originalls, ſetting aſide
the <hi>incredible figment,</hi> of the Jewes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the Bible out of hatred to the
Chriſtians, which being firſt ſuppoſed by
<hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> (though he ſpeak of the
<hi>Septuagint</hi> only) hath ſcarce found one or
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170488:119"/>
two ſince to own it, but is rejected by the
Univerſality of learned men, antient and
Moderne, unleſſe ſome few Papiſts mad
upon their Idols, and the <hi>Theſis</hi> preferring
in generall this or that Tranſlation above
the Originall, there is no opinion that I
know of, that was ever <hi>ventilated</hi> among
Chriſtians, tending to the depreſſion of
the worth, or impairing the <hi>eſteeme</hi> of the
Hebrew copies, which is not <hi>directly,</hi> or by
juſt conſequence owned in theſe <hi>Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena.</hi>
Thence it is contended that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Hebrew Character</hi> is not that uſed
by God himſelfe, and in the old Church
before the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but it is
the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> the other being left to the
<hi>Samaritans;</hi> That the <hi>Points,</hi> or <hi>vowels</hi>
and <hi>accents</hi> are a late invention of the <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Maſſorites,</hi> long after ſundry Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were extant in the world; That the
<hi>Keri Uketif</hi> are <hi>criticall</hi> notes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
partly of <hi>various lections</hi> gathered
by the late <hi>Maſsorites</hi> and Rabbins; That
conſidering how oft times in likelyhood
<hi>Tranſlators</hi> read the Text before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the <hi>Points</hi> and <hi>accents,</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170488:119"/>
Reading may be corrected and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by them, and that becauſe the old
Tranſlators had other <hi>copies,</hi> or differing
copies from them which we now enjoy.
That where <hi>groſſe faults</hi> are crept into the
<hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> men may by their own <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures</hi>
find out <hi>various lections,</hi> whereby
they may be amended; and to this purpoſe
an inſtance of ſuch <hi>various lections,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>corrections of the Originall</hi> is in the

That the Books of the Scriptures have
had the fate of other Books; by paſſing

have heretofore vented theſe or ſome of
theſe <hi>paradoxes:</hi> eſpecially <hi>Capellus</hi> in his

ſacra,</hi> and other Treatiſes: in the defence
<hi>whereof,</hi> as I heare, he ſtill laboureth, being
unwilling to <hi>ſuffer loſſe</hi> in the fruit of ſo

reply unto <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> in the defence of his

more fly to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> by the help of his

But let it be <hi>free</hi> for men to make

                     <argument>
                        <p>1. The originall of the Points propoſed to

of the points to the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the Scripture; the teſtimony
of Morinus, Junius, Johannes Iſaac,
Cevallerius, and others. 3 The uſe made
by the Papiſts of the opinion of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
of the Points. 4 The importance of
the Points farther manifeſted. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
danger of making the Hebrew
Punctation Arbitrary. 5 That danger e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by Inſtance. 6 No reliefe againſt
that Danger, on the grounds of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
conſidered. 7 The Authors of the
Hebrew Punctation according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena:
who &amp; what. Morinus his folly.
The improbability of this pretence. 8 The
ſtate of the Jewes, the ſuppoſed inventors
of the Points after the deſtruction of the
Temple. 9 Two attempts made by them to
reſtore their Religion. The former under
Barchochab with its iſsue. 10 The ſecond
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170488:122"/>
under R. Juda, with its iſſue. 11 The riſe
and foundation of the Talmuds. 12 The
ſtate of the Jews upon, and after the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Talmuds. 13 Their rancour
againſt Chriſt. 14 Who the Tiberian Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorites
were, that are the ſuppoſed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the Hebrew Punctation: their
deſcription. 15 That figment rejected.
16 The late Teſtimony of Dr. Light foot
to this purpoſe. 17 The riſe of the opinion
of the Novelty of the Points. Of Elias
Levita. The value of his Teſtimony in
this caſe. 18 Of the Validity of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Jewiſh Rabbins. 19 Some
conſiderations about the antiquity of the
Points; the firſt from the nature of the
Punctation its ſelfe, in reference unto
Grammaticall Rules. 20 From the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee
Paraphraſe, and integrity of the
Scripture as now pointed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THis being in my Apprehenſion the
ſtate of things amongſt us, I hope I
may without offence proceed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the <hi>particulars</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
from whence it is feared that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170488:123"/>
may ariſe againſt the <hi>purity</hi> and
<hi>ſelfe evidencing power</hi> of the Scriptures
pleaded for in the foregoing Treatiſe.
That which in the firſt place was mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is the Aſſertion of the <hi>Points,</hi> or <hi>vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi>
and <hi>Accents</hi> to be a <hi>novell invention</hi> of
ſome <hi>Rabbins</hi> of <hi>Tiberias in Palaeſtina.</hi>
This the learned Author of the <hi>Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>

and ſuch other Additions as he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

it will be neceſſary to conſider, 1 what <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
into the right underſtanding of the

As for the antiquity of the vowels and

who maintaine the Hebrew language as the

ſeeing that they who are otherwiſe

wholly pluck it up by the roots. for without

nothing firme and certaine.</p>

the poyſon of ſuch Attempts; The leaſt

So that whereas ſaving to my ſelfe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

about the yeare of Chriſt 500, or in the

and the finiſhing of the <hi>Babilonian
Talmud;</hi> The improbability of this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or <hi>Legend,</hi> I am not now to inſiſt upon.
<hi>Morinus</hi> makes the <hi>lye</hi> lowder. He tels
us that the <hi>Babilonian Talmud</hi> was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
but a little before the yeare 700,

and wrote about it. Now this <hi>Rabbi</hi> was
a <hi>Grammarian;</hi> which kind of learning
among the Jews ſucceeded that of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorites.</hi>
And he lived about the yeare
1030; ſo that no roome at all ſeemes to
be left for this worke. That there was
formerly a Schoole of the Jewes, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men famous at <hi>Tiberias</hi> is granted.
<hi>Hierome</hi> tels us that he hired a <hi>learned
Jew</hi> from thence for his aſſiſtance. <hi>Epiſt:ad

That they continued there in any eſteem,

by our Authours for this Worke,
is not made to appeare from any Hiſtory
or record of <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> yea it
is certaine, that about the <hi>time mentioned</hi>
the chiefeſt flouriſhing of the <hi>Jewiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
was at <hi>Babilon,</hi> with ſome other

compleated their <hi>Talmud,</hi> the great <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dect</hi>

That any perſons conſiderably <hi>learned</hi>
were then in <hi>Tiberias</hi> is a mere conjecture.
And it is moſt improbable, conſidering
what deſtruction had been made of them
at <hi>Diocaeſaria</hi> and <hi>Tiberias,</hi> about the year
of Chriſt 352, by <hi>Gallus</hi> at the command
of <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> That there ſhould be ſuch

as to invent this <hi>Worke,</hi> and
impoſe it on all the world, no man once
taking notice that any ſuch perſons <hi>ever</hi>
were, is beyond all belief. Notwitſtanding
any intanglements that men by their
conjectures may put upon the perſwaſion
of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the points, I can as
ſoone believe the moſt incredible fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the whole <hi>Talmud,</hi> as this fable.
But this is not my buſineſſe; Let it be
granted, that ſuch Perſons there were;
on the ſuppoſition under conſideration,
I am only enquiring what is the <hi>ſtate</hi> and

becauſe compiled in the land of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in

where the <hi>Jews</hi> had their <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi>

But this is invented by the curſed <hi>wretches,</hi>

cited by <hi>Genebrard</hi> from <hi>Abraham Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
in his <hi>Cabala hyſtoriae,</hi> where he ſaies,
that Chriſtians invented this ſtory that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> was crucified in the life of <hi>Herod,</hi>
(that is the <hi>Tetrarch</hi>) that it might appeare
that their <hi>Temple</hi> was deſtroyed immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thereupon: <hi>when</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is evident
from the Miſhna, and Talmud, that he lived
in the time of Alexander, and was crucified

the true ground why they perverted the

is fond to imagine; and
the premiſes of that learned
man fight againſt his own concluſion. <hi>It is
knowne</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the Jews are prone to in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſt
on every thing that makes for the honour
of their people and Language, and therefore
their teſtimony, to the Divine originall of the
preſent punctation being in their own caſe,
is not to be admitted. Only Elias who in
this ſpeakes againſt the common intereſt of
his people is preſumed to ſpeake upon convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of truth.</hi> But the whole <hi>evidence</hi> in
this cauſe is on the other ſide. Let us
grant that all the <hi>Jewes</hi> are zealous of the
honour and reputation of their Nation and
Language; as they are: let us grant that
they <hi>greedily</hi> cloſe with every thing, that
may ſeeme to have a tendency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?
what will be the iſſue, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
inference from theſe Premiſes?
Why as nothing could be ſpoken more
honourably of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> whileſt they
were the Church and people of God, then
that of <hi>Paul,</hi> that to them <hi>were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170488:143"/>
imagined or fixed on, more to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

that their <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> ſhould
make ſuch an addition to the ſcripture,
ſo generally acknowledged to be unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably
uſefull. And to this purpoſe <hi>Elias</hi>
who was the Father of this Opinion, was
farre from making ſuch deductions thence
as ſome doe now adayes; namely, that
it is <hi>lawfull</hi> for us to change the <hi>Vowells</hi>
and <hi>Accents</hi> at our pleaſure; But tyes all
men as ſtrictly to them as if they had been
the worke of <hi>Ezra;</hi> It is <hi>Elias</hi> then that
ſpeakes in his owne caſe; whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is therefore not to be admitted.
What was done of old, and in the dayes
of <hi>Ezra</hi> is ours, who ſucceed into the
priviledges of that Church; what hath
been done ſince the deſtruction of the
<hi>Temple,</hi> is properly and peculiarly theirs.</p>

that by the account given of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
their ſtate and condition of old and of late,
I might have weakned one great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which learned men make uſe of, to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170488:143"/>
confirme the <hi>ſacred Antiquity</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Hebrew punctation,</hi> taken from the
univerſall conſent and teſtimony of the
<hi>Jewiſh Doctors, Ancient and moderne,</hi>
this one <hi>Elias,</hi> excepted. Who can
thinke ſuch perſons are in any thing to be
believed. But indeed the caſe is quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.
Though we account them
wholy <hi>unmeet</hi> for the worke that is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
unto them, and on ſuppoſition that
it is theirs, affirme that it had need un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
another manner of triall then as
yet out of Reverence to its generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Antiquity, it hath met withall;
yet they were <hi>men ſtill,</hi> who were full-well
able to declare what <hi>de facto</hi> they
found to be ſo, and what they found o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.
It cannot, I think, be reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
ſuppoſed, that ſo many men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in ſo many ſeverall <hi>Ages,</hi> at ſuch vaſt
diſtances from one another, who ſome of

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170488:144"/>
what ever can be proved againſt them, I
ſhall willingly admit. But to be driven

are made by <hi>Languages</hi>) then the <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
of it and them, muſt be <hi>collected</hi>
from the obſervation of their uſe, as they
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170488:144"/>
were found in all their variety before any
ſuch <hi>art,</hi> was invented or uſed; and Rules
muſt be ſuited thereunto; The drawing
into <hi>Rules</hi> all the <hi>Inſtances</hi> that being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
would fall under ſuch <hi>Rules,</hi> and
the diſtinct obſervation of <hi>Anomalous
words,</hi> either ſingly, or in <hi>Exceptions</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
many under one head, that
would not be ſo reduced, was the worke
of <hi>Grammar.</hi> But on the other ſide, if the
<hi>Vowels and Accents</hi> were invented by
themſelves, and added to the Letters,
then the <hi>Rule</hi> and Art of diſpoſing, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing,
and changing of them, muſt
be conſtituted and fixed before the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of them; for they were placed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Rules</hi> made, and according to
them. A middle way that I know of, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be fixed on. Either they are of the

have had Rules made by their <hi>ſtation</hi>
therein, or they have been ſupplyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it according to <hi>Rules</hi> of Art. Things
are not thus come to paſſe by chance; nor

and pointed otherwiſe then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Language, preciſely reckoning them up
when they had ſo done, and how often
they are ſo uſed, as " and ⸪ for ˜: and

the thing they ſeeme to have aimed at;

This is not a place to ſpeake at large of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170488:148"/>
                        <hi>Samaritans,</hi> Their <hi>Pentateuch</hi> and its
<hi>Tranſlation.</hi> The Originall of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is knowne from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
their Worſhip of God, 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 17.
Their ſolemne <hi>Excommunication</hi> and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
out from any intereſt among the
people of God, is alſo recorded, <hi>Ezra. 9.
Nehem.</hi> 6: and <hi>c.</hi> 13. Their continuance
in their abominations after the cloſing of
the <hi>Canon</hi> of the ſcripture is reported by
<hi>Joſephus Antiq. lib. 11. c.</hi> 8. In the dayes
of the <hi>Machabees</hi> they were conquered by
<hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> and brought into ſubjection by
the Jewes. <hi>Joſeph. Antiq. lib. 13: cap.</hi>
17. Yet their <hi>Will worſhip</hi> upon the
credit of the tradition of their Fathers
continued to the dayes of <hi>our Saviour,</hi>
and their hatred to the people of God,
<hi>Joh. 4. When, by whom,</hi> in what <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter</hi>
they firſt received the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> is
moſt uncertaine; not likely by the Prieſt
ſent to them; for notwithſtanding his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
they continued in open <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie;</hi>
which evidences that they had not
ſo much as ſeen the booke of the Law.
Probably this was done when they were
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170488:149"/>
quered by <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> and their Temple
razed after it had ſtood 200 yeares. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
did the <hi>Edomites.</hi> What Diligence
they uſed in the preſervation of it, being
never committed to them by God, we
ſhall ſee afterwards. That there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them remaining at this day, or have
been this 1000 yeares paſt, is unknowne.
That the Letters of their <hi>Pentateuch</hi> were
the ancient Hebrew letters, as <hi>Euſebius,
Hierome</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> report,
ſeemes to me (on the beſt enquiry I have
been able to make) a groundleſſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and meere fable. The <hi>evidences</hi>
tendred for to prove it, are much to weak
to beare the weight of ſuch an Aſſertion.
<hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpaeks only on report; <hi>affirmatur;</hi>
it was ſo affirmed, on what ground he tels
us not. <hi>Hierome</hi> indeed is more poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
but give me leave to ſay, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
this to be falſe, ſufficient inſtances
of the like miſtakes may be given in him.
For the Teſtimony of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> I have
often declared, that with me it is of no
weight, unleſſe ſeconded by very good
evidence. And indeed the foundation of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170488:149"/>
the whole ſtory is very vaine. The <hi>Jews</hi>
are thought and ſaid to have forgot their
own Characters in the Captivity, and to
have learned the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
whereof they adhered unto it after
their returne; when the ſame men were
alive at the burning of one, and the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the other Temple; that the men
of one and the ſame generation ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the uſe of their own letters, which
they had been exerciſed in, is incredible.
Beſides they had their <hi>Bibles</hi> with them
alwaies, and that in their own <hi>character</hi>
only; whither they had any one other
book or no we know not: and whence
then this forgetting of one Character, and
learning of another ſhould ariſe, doth not
appeare. Nor ſhall I in ſuch an improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fiction lay much weight on Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys,
the moſt antient whereof is 600 years
later then the pretended matter of fact.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. The moſt weighty proofe in
this caſe is taken from the ancient <hi>Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
coines,</hi> taken up with <hi>Samaritan</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
upon them. We are now in the <hi>high
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170488:150"/>
road</hi> of forgeries and fables: in nothing
hath the world been more cheated. But be
it granted that the <hi>pretended coines</hi> are
truly Ancient; muſt it <hi>needs follow,</hi> that
becauſe the Letters were then <hi>known,</hi> and
in uſe, that they only were ſo: that the
<hi>Bible</hi> was <hi>written</hi> with them, and thoſe
now in uſe unknown. To ſalve the credit
of the <hi>coynes,</hi> I ſhall crave leave to anſwer
this conjecture with another. The <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
Letters</hi> are plainly <hi>praeternaturall</hi> (If I
may ſo ſay) a ſtudied inventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; in their frame
and figure fit to adorne, when <hi>extended</hi> or
<hi>greatned</hi> by way of engraving or emboſſing
any thing they ſhall be put upon, or cut in.
Why may we not think they were <hi>inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
for that purpoſe: namely to <hi>engrave</hi>
on veſſels, &amp; to <hi>ſtamp on coyne,</hi> &amp; ſo came
to be of ſome uſe in vvriting alſo. Their
ſhape and frame promiſes ſome ſuch thing.

that cannot be proved, namely that ſuch a

And if their <hi>Authority</hi> be to be

all the miracles, that they worke, where

credit them in other things. However, as
I ſaid, I do not underſtand this Argument;
the Jews keep a book in their Synagogues

accents were invented by the <hi>Tiberian

are in the preſent <hi>Hebrew punctation</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with 14 or 15: which as it is affirmed,
manifeſts abundantly that they are not

of old <hi>Reges?</hi> And that the diſtinction
of the <hi>Vowels</hi> into <hi>long</hi> and <hi>ſhort</hi> was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> rather than <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Grammarians;</hi> the Jewes calling them
ſome abſolutely <hi>reges,</hi> ſome great and
ſmall, ſome <hi>matres &amp; filias.</hi> But then
ſaith he, the <hi>Grammarians</hi> were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventours
of theſe points, why ſo? <hi>Aben
Ezra</hi> refers this unto the worke of the
<hi>Grammarians, to know the progreſſes of the

&amp;c:</hi> but can any thing be more evident
againſt his deſigne than his owne teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170488:162"/>
It was the worke of the <hi>Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
to <hi>know</hi> theſe things, therefore not
to <hi>invent</hi> them; Did they invent the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall</hi>

alſo then invented the tongue; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts

<hi>points</hi> and <hi>accents;</hi> &amp; yet this is alſo aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to them by <hi>Aben-Ezra.</hi> But it is well
that <hi>Morinus</hi> hath at length lighted upon
<hi>R. Jehuda Chiug:</hi> His Opinion before was
collected out of <hi>Kimchi, Ephodius, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus</hi>
and others. But what ſayes he now
himſelfe? for ought appeares by what
we have quoted by <hi>Morinus,</hi> he is like to
prove a <hi>Notable witneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the points. It may be well ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that <hi>Morinus</hi> writing on ſet purpoſe
againſt their <hi>Antiquity</hi> would produce
that Teſtimony which in his <hi>whole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
was moſt to his purpoſe; And yet
he fixes on one, wherein this <hi>Antient
Grammarian</hi> who lived about the yeares
of Chriſt. 1150, or 1200; gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>points</hi> with their <hi>names</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt <hi>intimation</hi> of any thing to
the impeachment of their Divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170488:163"/>
So alſo the ſame <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> on
<hi>Pſal. 9. verſ.</hi> 7: tels us, of one <hi>Adonim

And therefore when <hi>Morinus</hi> comes to
make the Concluſion of his Argument,
diſcovering it ſeemes himſelfe the folly of
the pretence, that the points were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Grammarians,</hi> the laſt ſort

without their owning of theſe points to
be of <hi>divine Originall</hi> we ſhall be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
in all <hi>Tranſlations</hi> and expoſitions of
the Scripture. It is true; whileſt the
<hi>Hebrew language</hi> was the Vulgar tongue
of the nation, and was ſpoken by every
one uniformely every where, It had been
poſſible, that upon a ſuppoſition that
there were no <hi>points,</hi> men without infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible

affix <hi>notes</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> which might

Tranſlations, expoſitions, and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
that have been made in the Church
of God for ſome 100<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> of yeares, is the
<hi>Arbitrary invention</hi> of ſome few <hi>Jewes,</hi>
living in an obſcure Corner of the world

and therefore the <hi>old Tranſlators</hi> might
read either, or both, as they ſaw cauſe.
There was no occaſion at all why theſe

of the <hi>Caldee</hi> and 70, making uſe of the

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170488:171"/>

but that theſe differences were in their

<hi>Maſorites,</hi> is not to be ſaid naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but proved, if ſuch a novell <hi>fancy</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any Credit in the world. That the

their <hi>Conſonants,</hi> ſupplying their <hi>Vowells</hi>

been gathered by ſome obſcure Jews, no
mention being made of thoſe collections
in the <hi>Maſora,</hi> or any of their <hi>Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
is the ſumme of the diſcourſe under
Conſideration. When all this, or any part
of it is proved by <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> or evident
Reaſon, we ſhall further attend unto
it.</p>

rejoice, that <hi>Capellus</hi> his fancy about theſe
things, then which I know nothing more
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170488:172"/>
pernicious to the truth of God, is rejected.
If theſe 100<hi rend="sup">ds</hi> of <hi>words</hi> were the <hi>Criticall

what ſecurity have we of the mind of God
as truely repreſented unto us, ſeeing that
it is ſuppoſed alſo, that ſome of the words
in the margin were ſometimes in the
<hi>line;</hi> and if it be ſuppoſed, as it is, that
there are innumerable other places of the
like nature, ſtanding in need of ſuch amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
what a door would be opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Curious Pragmaticall</hi> wits, to overturne
all the certainty of the Truth of the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The great and ſignall uſe of
<hi>various Tranſlations,</hi> which hitherto we
have eſteemed them for, was the help af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
by them in Expoſitions of the
Scripture. To have repreſented unto us
in one view the ſeverall Apprehenſions
and judgments of ſo many worthy and
learned men, as were the Authors of theſe
<hi>Tranſlations,</hi> upon the <hi>Originall</hi> words of
the Scripture, is a ſignall help and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
unto men enquiring into the mind
and will of God in his Word. That <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
were of any other uſe formerly, was
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170488:173"/>
not apprehended. They are of late preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto us under another <hi>notion:</hi> namely,
as means and helps of <hi>correcting</hi> the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,
and finding out the <hi>Corruptions</hi>
that are in our preſent copies, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Copies which their Authors
<hi>uſed,</hi> did really differ from thoſe which we
now enjoy, and uſe. For this rare Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we are, as for the former, chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to the <hi>learned</hi> and moſt <hi>diligent
Capellus,</hi> who is followed, as in ſundry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
himſelfe declares, by the no leſſe
<hi>learned Grotius.</hi> To this purpoſe the <hi>ſcene</hi>
is thus laid. It is ſuppoſed of old there
were <hi>ſundry Copies</hi> of the old Teſtament
differing in many things, words, <hi>ſentences,</hi>
from thoſe we now enjoy. Out of theſe
<hi>Copies</hi> ſome of the <hi>Antient Tranſlations</hi>
have been made. In their Tranſlations
they expreſſe the ſenſe and meaning of the
<hi>Copies</hi> they made uſe of. Hence by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what they deliver, where they <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>
from our preſent copies, we may find
out, (that is, <hi>learned</hi> men who are expert
at <hi>Conjectures</hi> may do ſo) how thay read in
theirs. Thus may we come to a further
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170488:174"/>
diſcovery of the <hi>Various Corruptions</hi> that
are crept into the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> and by
the help of thoſe <hi>Tranſlations</hi> amend
them. Thus <hi>Capellus.</hi> The learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of our <hi>Prolegomena</hi> handles this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
<hi>Prol.</hi> 6. I do not remember that he
expreſly any where affirmes, that they had
<hi>other Copies</hi> then thoſe we now enjoy; But
whereas (beſides the <hi>keri</hi> and <hi>ketib,</hi> the
<hi>various readings</hi> of <hi>Ben Aſher,</hi> and <hi>Ben
Napthali,</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt and Weſterne Jews</hi>)
there are through the neglect, oſcitancy,
and <hi>frailty</hi> of the Tranſcribers, many
things befallen the Text, not ſuch failings
as happening in one Copy, may be eaſily
rectified by others, which are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as <hi>various lections,</hi> nor ſuch as may
be <hi>Collected</hi> out of any <hi>Antient Copies,</hi> but
faults, or miſtakes in all the <hi>Copies</hi> we
enjoy, or have ever been known, by the
help and uſe of Tranſlations, conjecturing
how they read in their books, either vvith
<hi>other words,</hi> or <hi>letters,</hi> Conſonants or
Points, vve may collect <hi>Various lections,</hi>
as out of the Originall; What this <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
upon the matter differeth from that of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170488:174"/>
                        <hi>Capellus</hi> I ſee not; for the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>our Copies,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>old,</hi> are by
him aſſigned to no other <hi>Originall;</hi> nor
doth <hi>Capellus</hi> ſay that the <hi>Jewes</hi> have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
corrupted the Text; but only
that alterations are befallen it, by the
meanes and waies recounted in the <hi>Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena.</hi>
To make this evident by Inſtances!
we have a great number of ſuch <hi>Various
Lections</hi> gathered by <hi>Grotius</hi> in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</hi>
The truth is, how the <hi>Volume</hi>
ſhould come under that name, at firſt
View I much wondred. The greateſt
part of it, gives us no <hi>Various Lections</hi>
of the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> as is pretended; but
<hi>Various interpretations</hi> of others from the
<hi>Hebrew.</hi> But the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> ſalve that
ſeeming difficulty. The particulars aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned
as <hi>Various Lections,</hi> are not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
readings collected out of any <hi>Copies
extant,</hi> or ever knowne to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
but <hi>Criticall conjectures</hi> of his own
for the amendment of the Text, or at
moſt Conjectures upon the reading of the
words by <hi>Tranſlatours,</hi> eſpecially the 70
and <hi>Vulgar latine.</hi>

                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. Let us now Conſider our
<hi>diſeaſe</hi> intimated, and the <hi>Remedy</hi> praeſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
together with the <hi>improbability</hi> of
the one, and the unſuitableneſſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to the removeall of it; being once
ſuppoſed. The diſtemper pretended is
<hi>dreadfull,</hi> and ſuch, as it may well prove
<hi>mortall</hi> to the Sacred truth of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
The ſumme of it as was declared
before, is that there were <hi>of old ſundry Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi>
extant, differing in many things from
thoſe we now enjoy, according to which,
the <hi>ancient Tranſlations</hi> were made;
whence it is come to paſſe, that in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places they differ from our preſent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
even all that are extant in the world;
So <hi>Capellus;</hi> or that there are <hi>Corruptions</hi>
befallen the Text (Varieties from the

of Tranſlations, as our <hi>Prolegomena.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Now whereas the firſt <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation</hi>
that ever was, as is pretended, is
that of the 70, and that of all others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
only thoſe which have been <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated</hi>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:170488:175"/>
out of it, doth moſt vary and differ
from our Bible, as may be made good by
ſome 1000<hi rend="sup">ds</hi> of inſtances, we cannot but
be exceedinly uncertaine in finding out
wherein thoſe <hi>Copies,</hi> which as it is
ſaid, were <hi>uſed</hi> by them, did differ from
ours, or wherein ours are Corrupted;
but are left unto endleſſe uncertaine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.
What ſenſe others may have
of this diſtemper I know not; for my
owne part I am ſollicitous for the <hi>Arke;</hi>
or the Sacred truth of the Originall; And
that becauſe I am fully perſwaded that
the Remedy and reliefe of this evill, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in the <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> is unfitted to
the Cure, yea fitted to increaſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.
Some other Courſe then muſt be
taken. And ſeeing the Remedy, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
<hi>inſufficient</hi> to effect the Cure,
let us try whether the whole diſtemper
be not a meere <hi>fancy,</hi> and and ſo doe what
in us lye to prevent that Horrible and
<hi>outragious</hi> violence, which will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
be offered to the Sacred Hebrew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. It is well knowne that the
<hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> if it have the
Originall pretended, and which alone
makes it <hi>conſiderable,</hi> was made and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
300 years or nere thereabout, before
the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of our Saviour, that was,
in that time and ſeaſon wherein the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
of God were <hi>committed to the Jewes</hi>
whileſt that Church and people were the
only people of God, accepted with him,
deſigned by him keepers of his Word for
the uſe of the whole Church of Chriſt to

of truth. A time when there was an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique

now can it be once imagined that there

in the Copies of the Scripture
through the negligence of that Church, &amp;
yet afterwards neither our <hi>Saviour</hi> nor his

the good providence and care of God

Authours of this Inſinuation prove the

kind of Remembrance of them, and not
put us off with <hi>weak conjectures,</hi> upon
the ſignification of one or two words,
and it ſhall be of weight with us? Is it
meet that a matter of ſo huge importance,
called into Queſtion by none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſhould be caſt and determined by
their conjectures? doe they think that
men will part with the poſſeſſion of <hi>Truth</hi>
upon ſo eaſy tearmes? that they will be
caſt from their inheritance by divination?
but they will ſay is it not evident that the
<hi>old Tranſlatours</hi> did make uſe of other <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,</hi>
in that we ſee how they have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
many <hi>Words,</hi> and places, ſo as it
was not poſſible they ſhould have done,
had they rendred our Copy according to
what we now read; But will indeed this
be pleaded? may it not be extended to <hi>all</hi>
places, as well as to <hi>any?</hi> and may not
men plead ſo for every <hi>variation</hi> made
by the <hi>Seaventy</hi> from the Originall; they

were committed thereunto, will permit
us to entertaine the leaſt <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> that
there was ever in the world any Copy
of the Bible differing in the <hi>leaſt</hi> from

it will be granted. (1.) That we
be certaine concerning them, that they
are <hi>tranſlated</hi> out of the <hi>Originalls</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and not out of the Interpretations
of them that went before them; for if that
appeare, all their Authority as to the

buſineſſe enquired after, falls to the
ground, or is at beſt reſolved into that
former, whence they are taken, if they
are at agreement therewith; otherwiſe
they are a thing of naught; and this
one conſideration, will be found to lay
hold of one <hi>moiety</hi> of theſe <hi>Tranſlations:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> That they be of venerable <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>

theſe things at leaſt, concurre not in a

any <hi>order;</hi> ſeeing there is no more
Reaſon for that which is layd down in this

for the honour I beare to the <hi>renounedly
learned publiſher</hi> of it &amp; the various lections
of the ſeverall Copies thereof; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe he hath dealt herein with his

of that Tranſlation, which I had for
the ſubſtance of it, received from him in
a diſcourſe before, wherein alſo he gave
me a ſatisfactory account concerning ſome
other tranſlations, which I ſhall not need

his judgment in ſuch things is to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at leaſt equall, with any now alive.</p>
                     <p>Then he tells us upon the matter that
this Tranſlation is a Cento made up of
many <hi>ill ſuted pieces,</hi> there being no <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation</hi>

which was Tranſlated out of it:
on theſe and the like <hi>heads</hi> doth that <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
of the <hi>Eaſterne learning,</hi> who hath not

with great diligence and judgment into
the nature of the <hi>learning</hi> extant in them,
and the importance of the <hi>Bookes</hi> we have,
diſcourſe in that preface. It is the way
of <hi>Scioliſts</hi> when they have obtained a
little skill in any language or <hi>ſcience</hi> to
perſwade the <hi>World</hi> that all worth and

learned, and whoſe learning is regulated
by a <hi>ſound Judgment,</hi> know that the

true ſuiting of men to a cleare acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with truth. In that kind, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this particular are we beholding to
this Worthy learned Perſon. I ſuppoſe
there will not need much <hi>arguing,</hi> to
prove that this <hi>Tranſlation</hi> though excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170488:180"/>
uſefull in its own place, and kind, yet
is not in the leaſt a fit <hi>remedy</hi> to relieve us,

may it exerciſe the <hi>ability</hi> of learned men,

                     <p>Should I now goe to gather inſtances
of the failings of this Tranſlation, open

I think I might make a <hi>Volume</hi> neare as

                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. Whether the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
be any fitter for this uſe, any one
who ſhall be pleaſed to conſider &amp; weigh
it, will eaſily diſcover. It ſeemes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to have been made out of the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi>
at leaſt for ſome part of it; or that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170488:181"/>
the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the 70 hath been in
many things changed ſince this was made,
which I rather ſuppoſe. But <hi>when, where,</hi>
or by <hi>whom,</hi> it doth not appeare; nor doth
it in many things ſeeme to have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
at all unto the Hebrew; the note
at the <hi>cloſe</hi> of the Prophets I ſuppoſe to
proceed rather from the <hi>Scribe</hi> of that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall</hi>
Copy, than the <hi>Tranſlatour;</hi>
but that the Reader may ſee what hands
it hath paſſed through, he may take it as
its rendered by the <hi>learned Authour</hi> of the

that there is ſcarce one of them, but yeelds
a cleare Argument of Corruption in it,

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:170488:184"/>
Teſtament; who have the promiſe made
good unto them. And much more unto
the ſame purpoſe will ſome of them be
found to ſay, when men of wiſdome and
learning who are able to inſtruct them,
ſhall condiſcend <hi>perſonally</hi> ſo to doe. But
I ſhall forbeare, what might farther be
ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe is à Cento</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
The <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jonathan</hi> is ancient,
ſo alſo is that of <hi>Onkelos;</hi> they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to have been made before, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the time of our Saviour. Some of
the Jewes would have <hi>Jonathan</hi> to have
lived not long after <hi>Ezra.</hi> Others that he
was the chiefe Diſciple of <hi>Hillel</hi> about an
100 yeares before Chriſts Incarnation;
ſome are otherwiſe minded, and will not
own it to be much older than the <hi>Talmud:</hi>
but as yet I ſee no grounds ſufficient to
overthrow the <hi>received</hi> opinion. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts, of the Scripture were <hi>Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>
at ſeverall times, ſome above 500
yeares after our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and are full of
<hi>Talmudicall</hi> fancies, if not fables; as that
on the Canticles. That all theſe <hi>Targums</hi>
                        <pb n="333" facs="tcp:170488:184"/>
are of excelent uſe is confeſſed, and we are
beholding to the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
them in ſo handſome an order
and place, that with great facility they
may be compared with the Originall.
But as to the end under Conſideration,
how little Advantage is from hence to be
obtained theſe few enſuing obſervations
will evince. 1. It was never the aime of
thoſe <hi>Paraphraſts</hi> to render the <hi>Originall</hi>
Text exactly <hi>verbum de verbo;</hi> but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the Text, according
as it appeared to their judgment; Hence it
is impoſſible to give any true account
how they read in any place, wherein they
<hi>diſſent</hi> from our preſent Copies, ſince
their endeavour was to give us the ſenſe
as they thought rather than the bare and
naked importance of the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
hence <hi>Elias</hi> ſaith of them
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>behold the Targumiſts obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not ſometimes the way of Grammar.</hi>
2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> It is evident, that all the <hi>Targums</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to give us often <hi>myſticall</hi> ſences,
eſpecially the latter, and ſo were <hi>neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated</hi>
                        <pb n="334" facs="tcp:170488:185"/>
to goe off from the letter of the Text.
3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. It is evident that they have often
made <hi>additions</hi> of whole ſentences to the
Scripture, even the beſt of them, from
their own Apprehenſions or corrupt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
whereof there is not one <hi>tittle</hi> or
<hi>Syllable</hi> in the Scripture nor ever was.
4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. What carefull hands it hath paſſed
through, the <hi>bulky collection</hi> of various
lections given in this <hi>Appendix</hi> doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
manifeſt; and ſeeing it hath
not laine under any peculiar care and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull

they are the <hi>worſt</hi> and moſt corrupt

<hi>bulke</hi> of them, as preſented unto us in
the <hi>Appendix.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Corruptions ſuppoſed, I
could heartily wiſh that learned men
would abſtaine from ſuch <hi>inſinuations</hi>
unleſſe they are able to give them ſome
<hi>pretence</hi> by inſtances; It is not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of this or that <hi>Copy,</hi> which by the
<hi>Errour</hi> of the <hi>Scribes</hi> or <hi>Printers</hi> may
have <hi>important</hi> miſtakes found in it.
There is no need of mens <hi>criticall</hi> abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to rectify ſuch miſtakes, other
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170488:191"/>
Copies are at hand for their reliefe.
It is of the Text without ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
that this inſinuation is made;
now to caſt ſcruples into the minds of
men, about the integrity and <hi>ſincerity</hi>
of that, without ſufficient ground or
warrant, is ſurely not allowable. It
is not good to deale ſo with <hi>men</hi> or
their writings, much leſſe with the
Word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Should any man write
that in caſe of ſuch a mans <hi>theft,</hi> or
<hi>murder,</hi> who is a man of <hi>unſpotted
reputation,</hi> it were good to take ſuch
or ſuch a courſe with him, and publiſh
it to the world, would their ſtirring of
ſuch rumours be looked on as an <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
Chriſtian,</hi> and candid courſe of
proceeding? And is it ſafe to deale
ſo with the Scripture? I ſpeake of
<hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for Papiſts, who are growne
bold in the oppoſition to the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls</hi>
of the Scripture, I muſt needs
ſay, that I look upon them as effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manageing a deſigne of Sathan to
draw men into Atheiſme. Nor in
particular doe I account of <hi>Morinus</hi>
                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:170488:191"/>
his Exercitations one whit better. It
is readily acknowledged, that there are
many <hi>difficult places</hi> in the Scripture,
eſpecially in the <hi>Hiſtoricall Bookes</hi> of
the old Teſtament. Some of them
have by ſome been lookt at as <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.
The induſtry of <hi>learned</hi> men of old,
and of late <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> have
been well excerciſed in the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and reconciliation of them: by
one, or other, a faire &amp; probable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is given of them all. Where
we cannot reach the utmoſt depth of
truth, it hath been thought meet, that
<hi>poore wormes</hi> ſhould captivate their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
to the <hi>truth</hi> and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God in his word. If there be
this liberty once given that they may
be looked on as <hi>corruptions,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
at the pleaſure of men, how
we ſhall be able to ſtay before we come
to the <hi>bottome</hi> of queſtioning the
whole Scripture, I know not. That
then which yet we inſiſt upon, is, that
according to all Rules of <hi>equall proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,</hi>
men are to prove <hi>ſuch Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,</hi>
                        <pb n="348" facs="tcp:170488:192"/>
before they entertaine us with
their proviſion of meanes for remedy.</p>

various lections gathered out of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
his Annotations, I ſhall not much
concerne my ſelfe therein; they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſſe then <hi>various lections</hi> of that
learned mans own obſervations; ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide;
1. The various lections of the
70, and vulgar latine of <hi>Symmachus,
Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Theodotion,</hi> wherein
we are not concerned. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The <hi>Keri</hi>
and <hi>Cethib</hi> which we have often times
<hi>over</hi> and <hi>over</hi> in this Volume. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The
various readings of the <hi>Orientall</hi> and
<hi>Occidentall</hi> Jewes which we have alſo
elſewhere. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Conjectures how the
70, or <hi>vulgar latin</hi> read, by altering
<hi>letters</hi> only. 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Conjectures of his
own how the <hi>Text</hi> may be mended,
and a very <hi>little</hi> roome will take up
what <hi>remaines;</hi> By that <hi>curſory view</hi>
I have taken of them, I ſee not <hi>one word</hi>
that can pretend to be a various le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
unleſſe it belong to the <hi>Keri</hi> and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:170488:192"/>
                        <hi>Cethib,</hi> or the difference between the
<hi>Orientall</hi> and the <hi>Occidentall</hi> Jews: ſo
that as I ſayd before, as to my preſent
deſigne I am not at all concerned in
that <hi>collection;</hi> thoſe that are may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. As ſhort an account will
ſeeme for the generall conſideration of
the whole bulkie collection of <hi>various
lections</hi> that we have here preſented
unto us; for thoſe of the ſeverall <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations</hi>
we are not at all concerned in
them: where any or all of them faile,
or are corrupted, we have a <hi>Rule</hi> bleſſed
be God, preſerved to rectify them by.
For thoſe of the <hi>Originalls</hi> I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to them in particular; I ſhall only
adde, that we have ſome of them both
from the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new</hi> Teſtament given
us <hi>thrice</hi> over at leaſt, many of the <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi>
and <hi>Cethib,</hi> after a double ſervice <hi>done</hi>
by them, are given us againe, <hi>the
third time by Grotius,</hi> ſo alſo are thoſe
