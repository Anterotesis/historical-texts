            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was: whoſe Family, a few years ſince, being reduced in the Male-Line, only to your ſelf; you ſee Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by vouchſafing you three flouriſhing. Branches of Male-Iſſue, has given you good Hopes, and a fair Proſpect of a long Continuance of it. And as the many Favours I have received from you, have highly engaged me to wiſh Prosperity to it; ſo whenever any thing ſhall be ſuggeſted to my Underſtanding whereby I may be a Mean to promote it, it ſhall most readily be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by,</p>

            <p>THE Illuſtrious <hi>Houſe of</hi> Auſtria, having the largeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Dominions among the <hi>European</hi> Princes, I have thought fit to begin with that. This <hi>Houſe</hi> owes its Original to the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Habsburg;</hi> whom a late Writer derives from the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Mount Aventine,</hi> of the ancient <hi>Perleonian</hi> Family; which was formerly of the greateſt Repute and Authority of any in <hi>Rome;</hi> and had its ſeat on <hi>Mount Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. Albertus Dives Anicius Perleonius,</hi> a perſon Deſcended of the ſaid Family, was driven out of <hi>Rome, An.</hi> 1144. by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldiſtick</hi> Hereticks, together with his Brother <hi>Rudolph,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Roman See.</hi> Whereupon he travelled into <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and there married the Daughter of <hi>Wernerus,</hi> laſt Earl of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> of the <hi>Anician Perleonian Race.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>He had for his Sons <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the firſt; betwixt which two Princes, there was a diviſion made of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, when the <hi>Houſe of Auſtria</hi> became likewiſe divided into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Lines.</p>

It flouriſhes in all Riches, and in the Beauty of its Edifices, both publick and private; but three eſpecially commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Magnificence; the Caſtle, the Hoſpital, and the Cathedral. Its fortified with Walls, Ramparts, and deep Trenches, and the Caſtle in it is ſo ſtrong, that its judg'd impregnable. The Trade is ſo great, that private Shops there equal publick Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes of other Places, and the People are ſo rich, that the Wife of every Mechanick goes in her Silks and Taffaties.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> has alſo in <hi>Italy</hi> the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> which is the Capital of that Kingdom, and contains Seven Miles in compaſs. It's honoured with the Seat of a <hi>Viceroy,</hi> and the continual Reſort, if not conſtant Reſidence of moſt of the great Men of the Realm; which makes the private Buildings to be very graceful, and the publick ſtately; and it had increaſed much more in Buildings, if the King had not forbidden it by his ſpecial Edict; and this partly at the perſuaſion of his Noblemen, who fear'd, that if there were not ſuch a Reſtraint, their Vaſſals would forſake the Country to inhabit here, ſo to enjoy the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Exemptions of the Royal City; but principally upon Jealouſie, and point of State, the better to prevent all Revolts and Mutinies, which in moſt populous Cities are of greateſt danger. In the Account of <hi>Maſaniello</hi>'s Rebellion at <hi>Naples, Ann.</hi> 1647, publiſhed by the Lord <hi>Alexander Giraffi,</hi> we find that in <hi>Naples,</hi> at that time were above Six hundred thouſand Souls: for he there ſays, that <hi>Maſaniello,</hi> on the Fourth Day of his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, had One hundred and fifty thouſand Men bearing Arms under him, beſides Boys and Women. Now allowing as many Women in the City as Men, it makes Three hundred thouſand, and allowing all under Sixteen Years of Age in the City to equal in number the Men and Women, it makes Six hundred thouſand, not counting decrepid perſons, which make a Sixth Part of Mankind, nor all thoſe perſons who adhering to the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> never followed <hi>Maſaniello.</hi> Scarce any Country of <hi>Europe</hi> may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the <hi>Kingdom of Naples</hi> for its Beauty, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of its Soil, and its great plenty of generous Wines, Fruits and Corn, or what elſe may afford Delight and Pleaſure.</p>

The Emperor's Palace, now defaced, was ſeated on a lofty Mountain, and built of ſuch huge and maſſy Stones, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought it rather to have been the Work of Devils than of Men The ſpacious <hi>Market-place</hi> there has been always eſteemed as the greateſt and moſt regular found in any Town of <hi>America:</hi> its Figure is ſquare, and at its Angles, it gives an opening to four great Roads, tending in a ſtreight Line towards the four principal parts of the World, and to the moſt conſiderable Provinces of the Empire of <hi>Peru,</hi> made by the <hi>Ingas</hi> of a vaſt length and breadth with a moſt incredible Charge and Pains for the uſe of their Subjects. To ſay a little of the Riſe of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian Monarchs, Heylin</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Peruvians</hi> were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally governed by the Chief of their <hi>Tribes,</hi> as in all Countries elſe, where neither the Arms of Foreigners, nor the Ambition of ſome few of the Natives had diminiſhed any thing of thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Rights; nor ſubject to any one Supreme, till theſe later times, the <hi>Ingas</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> growing into their Greatneſs but a little before their Fall. Their Territory at firſt was not above Five or Six Leagues in compaſs, ſituate in that part of the Country where <hi>Cuſco</hi> now ſtands. They were oppos'd at their firſt Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by their Neighbours, and had not prevail'd to their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had they not uſed the Policy (however they got it) which has been uſed by many in theſe parts of the World, in Imitation of the Truth, conveyed down to us by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> from <hi>Noah</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs.</hi> For the <hi>Ingas</hi> gave out that their Family had not only been the <hi>Seminary</hi> from which Mankind came, but the Authors of that Religion alſo, which was then in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52231:7"/>
uſe; particularly that the whole Earth had been deſtroyed by a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,</hi> except only ſeven perſons, who had hid themſelves in a Cave, called <hi>Paticambo,</hi> where having liv'd in ſafety till the Fury of the Waters had been aſſwaged, they came abroad at laſt, and repeopled the Country. That <hi>Viracocha</hi> the Creator, and great God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had appear'd to one of them, and taught him how, and with what <hi>Rites</hi> he would be worſhipped; which <hi>Rites</hi> were afterwards received over all <hi>Peru:</hi> and finally, that the ſame <hi>Viracocha</hi> had appeared lately to the Chief of their Family, aſſuring him, that he would aid him with inviſible Forces againſt all their Enemies. This ſoon gained Belief among thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and drew many to take part with the <hi>Ingas,</hi> whereby they became victorious. This is ſuppoſed to have happened Four hundred years before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> put an end to this flouriſhing Kingdom, <hi>an.</hi> 1533, within which time they had brought all the Country, which we now call <hi>Peru,</hi> and many of the adjacent Provinces under their Dominion. The <hi>Ingas</hi> were much reverenced by their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſo faithfully ſerved, that never any of their Subjects were found guilty of Treaſon: nor wanted they good Arts whereby to indear their Subjects, to keep them out of leiſure to foment new Factions. The way of Indearment was by the fair and ſatisfactory Diſtribution of the Spoils gotten in the Wars, whether Lands or Goods; all which they divided into three parts, allotting the firſt unto the Service of the Gods; the ſecond for the maintenance of the King, his Court, and Nobles; the third to the relief of the common People. When there was no Cauſe of Wars, they kept the People buſied in Works of Magnificence, as building of Palaces in every one of the conquered Provinces, which ſerved not only as Forts to aſſure the Conqueſt, but were employed as Store Houſes to lay up Proviſions to be diſtributed among the People in times of Dearth. But that which was the Work of greateſt Trouble, and chiefeſt Uſe, was the Croſs-ways that they made all over the Country, the one upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the other on the Plains, extending Five hundred Leagues in length; a Work to be preferred before any of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Egypt:</hi> for they were forced to raiſe the Ground in many places to the height of the Mountains, and to lay the Mountains level with the flatteſt Plains, to cut through ſome Rocks, and underprop others that were ruinous, to make even ſuch Ways as were uneaſie, and ſupport the Precipices, and in the Plains to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52231:7"/>
vanquiſh ſo many Difficulties, as the uncertain Foundation of a ſandy Country muſt needs carry with it. And for the Nobility, the <hi>Inga</hi> did not only command them to reſide in <hi>Cuſco,</hi> to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of their perſons, but cauſed them to have their Children brought up there, that they might ſerve as Hoſtages for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Loyalty. They ordered alſo that all ſuch as repaired to <hi>Cuſco,</hi> the Imperial City, ſhould be attired according to their own Country Faſhion, ſo to prevent thoſe Leagues and Aſſociations, which otherwiſe, without any Notice, or Obſervation, might be made amongſt them; and many ſuch politick Institutions were by them devis'd.</p>
               <p>As for the Names of the <hi>Ingas</hi> of <hi>Peru, Mango-Capac</hi> deſcended of the chief of the firſt ſeven Families, was the firſt who laid the Foundation of this puiſſant Monarchy. The Fourteenth <hi>Inga</hi> of this Race was <hi>Atabaliba,</hi> who was vanquiſhed and taken Priſoner by <hi>Franciſco Pizarro,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commander at <hi>Caxamalca,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Lima;</hi> where, tho he gave him for a Ranſom of his Life and Liberty, an Houſe piled up on all ſides with Gold and Silver, valued (as ſome ſay) at ten Millions of Crowns, yet they ſlew him at laſt; in whoſe place <hi>Pizarro</hi> ſubſtituted his ſecond Brother, called <hi>Mango-Capac</hi> the Second, who was the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <hi>Inga,</hi> and who, after many Viciſſicudes of Fortune, was at laſt ſlain in the City of <hi>Cuſco,</hi> and ſo the Kingdom of the <hi>Ingas</hi> began and ended in a Prince of the ſame Name, as it has happened to many Eſtates.</p>

               <p>As to the Forces and Revenues of theſe <hi>Ingas,</hi> doubtleſs they were exceeding great; for tho (as <hi>Heylin</hi> ſays) we find no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Muſters, which they made of their Men, nor what great Armies they drew with them into the Field, yet by their great Succeſſes, and many Victories, we may conclude them to have been Maſters of great Bands of Men, and skilful in the Arts of Conduct; nor can we otherwiſe conjecture at the Greatneſs of their yearly Revenues, but by the Greatneſs of their Treaſure, ſo infinite and almoſt incredible, that all the Veſſels of the King's

There is a Bridge in it made by the croſſing of two Streets at equal Angles, the ground of one Street being as high as the tops of the Houſes of the other, ſo that to continue it, they were forced to build a Bridge, or Arch in the lower Street, to let the upper to paſs over it.

In <hi>Buda</hi> there are eight <hi>Baths;</hi> that called of the green Pillars, tho now they are red, is impregnated with a petrifying Juice, which diſcerns itſelf on the ſides of the Bath, upon the Spouts and other places, and makes a grey Stone. The exhalation of the Bath, reverberated by the Cupula, by the Irons extended from one Column to another, and by the Capitals of the Pillars, forms long Stones like Icicles, which hang to all thoſe places. One Bath there has a white Water of a ſulphureous ſmell, and if mony be rubbed betwixt the Fingers half a minute, while the hot Water falls from a Spout, it gilds it. The hotteſt Bath there has neither colour, ſmell, nor taſt differing from common Water, and depoſes no ſediment; only the ſides of the Bath are green, and have a fungous ſubſtance all over.</p>

                  <item>10. In the Churches, nothing at <hi>Paris</hi> being ſo great as S. <hi>Pauls</hi> has been, and is like to be; nor ſo beautiful as King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Chapel.</item>

               <p>Its worthy of Obſervation, that before the Reſtauration of Monarchy in <hi>England, An.</hi> 1660. the people of <hi>Paris</hi> were more than thoſe of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> put together: whereas now the people of <hi>London</hi> are more than thoſe of <hi>Paris, Rome</hi> and <hi>Rouen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The foremention'd Author alſo makes out by a rational com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, ſeems not to have been above half as big again as <hi>London</hi> now is; and that now <hi>London</hi> is near ſix times as great as the preſent <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein are 119000 ſouls beſides <hi>Jews,</hi> which he computes at 6000.</p>

               <item>4. The Infraction of their Priviledges.</item>

thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> 6245. From whence, and the difference of Air, its probable that the people of <hi>London</hi> are quadruple to thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> having taken a view of this City in his Travels, before <hi>London</hi> was rebuilt, gives this handſom account of it. <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for Riches, Trade, Shipping, fair Streets, and pleaſant Habitations, ſcarce yields to any other City of the World, its ſeated on the River <hi>Ye. An.</hi> 1470 it was wall'd about with a Brick Wall, to defend it againſt the Citizens of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> The <hi>Arms</hi> of it are three Croſſes on a Pale, with an Imperial Crown over all; the laſt given them by <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour. Of late years this City is mightily increaced; and encompaſt with a new Wall, and fortified after the modern way. And the whole Town being in a low marſhy ground, the water is let in thro all the conſiderable Streets, and its all built upon Piles, or high Firr-Trees, driven down perpendicularly ſo cloſe together, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be forc'd in betwixt them This ſupports the greateſt buildings, where no bottom is. For the Foundation of one Tower, or Steeple alone, there were ramm'd into the ground 6334 great Trees. The <hi>Town Houſe</hi> is the nobleſt building in all theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: a Pile of free Stone one hundred and ten paces in Front, larger than the magnificent Church of S. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> and eighty one paces deep, or on the ſides. On the top of it ſtands <hi>Atlas,</hi> or <hi>Columbus,</hi> holding a Globe on his Shoulders made of Copper, of about ten Foot diameter; which is as large, perhaps, as any Globe, or Ball whatſoever, imploy'd in this Ornamental uſe. The Draw-Bridges at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> part in the middle, and a Veſſel, tho under Sail, may paſs them without the help of any one on ſhore; for the Maſt Head, or break water of the Ship bearing againſt the Bridge, in the middle, opens it.

            <p>Its remarkable that the whole compaſs of the Province of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is but one hundred and eighty Miles, no part thereof being diſtant from the Sea above three hours journey, and yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains twenty three wall'd Towns, and four hundred Villages.</p>
            <p>From the Steeple of the Town of <hi>Gorcham,</hi> in this Province, a man may behold twenty two wall'd Towns, beſide a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Villages. And the Town of <hi>Utrech,</hi> ſituate within the

The Ground it ſtands on conſiſts of ſeven little Hills, like that of ancient <hi>Rome;</hi> thus all the Houſes being of different Elevations, are advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly ſeen from the Fields, and Sea, and appear very beautiful: but the inſide of it does not anſwer the Beauty of this Proſpect: for the ſtreets are narrow, and run winding; the Houſes are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily built of Wood, whence there often happen Fires, and they are but of two ſtories high.</p>
            <p>Its remarkable, that this City was taken by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the Name, and eleventh Emperor of the <hi>Turks, ann.</hi> 1453, on Tueſday, being the twenty ſeventh day of <hi>May,</hi> and the third day of <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> a day which is kept Feſtival in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> whom the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from the time of their Patriarch <hi>Photius,</hi> who lived about the year 860, had denied to proceed from the Son of God, drawing all the Oriental Church to this Error, in which they have ſtill continued.

The moſt ſplendid and auguſt Temple of S. <hi>Sophia,</hi> is the Church of my God, a terreſtrial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; which I believe the <hi>Seraphims</hi> themſelves with admiration admire; and if God vouchſafes to refide in Works, rendered as polite as poſſible, by the Hands of Men, certainly he reſides here, or no where.

Sun, and celeſtial Giant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who had beſtowed ſeventeen years in finiſhing it, entred it firſt with the Patriarch <hi>Euthymius,</hi> he gave God thanks, that by his aſſiſtance he had compleated ſo admirable a Work, and ſaid: <hi>Vici te Solomo.</hi> And on a Pedeſtal in the midſt of the Imperial <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> before the Church, he cauſed to be placed the <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> as gazing on it, and holding his Finger on his Mouth, as owning himſelf far exceeded by this Structure of the new <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> But however this Temple is adorned, its but a Trifle, if compared in bigneſs with the ancient Temple at <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a pleaſant ſtory in <hi>Glycas</hi> relating to this Edifice. When <hi>Juſtinian</hi> undertook to build it, he bought ſeveral Houſes near the place where he intended the Building, which, People, willing to promote the Work, ſold him at a reaſonable value. But there was one Man, who by no means would part with his Houſe, notwithſtanding any Offers made him by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; whereat the Emperor was much troubled. A Magiſtrate of the Town underſtanding this, and well knowing the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Man, and that he was greatly delighted in ſeeing Feats of Chivalry, at a time when a <hi>Turnament</hi> was to be held, clapped this Man into cuſtody; whereupon he cryed out that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſhould have what he pleaſed, ſo he might have freedom to ſee the ſight; and parted with his Houſe accordingly.</p>
            <p>The Palace of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> contains three Courts, one within another, the Buildings yielding unto thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> for the neat contrivances, but far ſurpaſſing them for coſt and curiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> has many other conſiderable Cities; the chief is <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is eight miles in compaſs, and being viewed from a high place, it preſents a moſt delightful proſpect; the <hi>Moſques</hi> being built of various Colours, and very beautious, and the other Houſes, tho but two ſtories high, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving generally their Roofs raiſed with Turrets for Coverings, and being all ſurrounded with Palm Trees and Gardens.</p>

The Revenues conſiſt chiefly in Tributes raiſed on the People, and in Cuſtoms, and theſe are paid for the moſt part in Silver. As for the Gold which is raiſed, it proceeds from four Sources, whereof two are foreign, and two of the Country. One of the firſt is the Trade of the <hi>Engliſh, French, Dutch, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Moſcovites,</hi> and <hi>Polanders,</hi> who bring Ducats from their Countries.

            <p n="1">I. HIſtorians make eight <hi>Dynaſtyes</hi> of <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings.

            <p>This Dynaſty of the <hi>Turcoman</hi> or <hi>Armenian</hi> Race continued till 1496, that <hi>Alanat,</hi> the laſt King of it was overthrown and ſlain by <hi>Hyſmael,</hi> one of the <hi>Sophian</hi> Race and Faction. The Quarrel and Occaſion was thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Impoſtor, and firſt Emperor of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> by his laſt Will and Teſtament bequeathed the Succeſſion of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to <hi>Haly,</hi> his near Kinſman, and Husband to <hi>Fatima</hi> his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Daughter: but <hi>Abudezar, Haumar,</hi> and <hi>Oſman,</hi> three power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men, and the chief Commanders of the Army in the time of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſucceſſively followed one another in the ſupreme Dignity. After their Deaths <hi>Hali</hi> enjoyed that Honor for a little while, ſupplanted firſt, and afterwards vanquiſhed by <hi>Muhavias,</hi> a great Man of War, who ſucceeded in it, and to ſecure himſelf, ſlew <hi>Haſen,</hi> or <hi>Oſſan,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hali,</hi> and eleven of his Sons, a twelfth eſcaping, called <hi>Muſa Ceredine,</hi> from whom <hi>Hyſmael Sophi</hi> abovementioned, was lineally deſcended, who, after his Victory, and being crowned King, or <hi>Shaw</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> altered the Form of Religion, making <hi>Hali</hi> and himſelf the ſole Succeſſors of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> and condemning <hi>Abudezar, Haumar,</hi> and <hi>Oſman</hi> with the <hi>Turks,</hi> as Rebels, and Schiſmaticks. Hence proceeded the

Bloody Wars betwixt them and the <hi>Turks;</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> burning whatſoever Book they found concerning thoſe three; and the <hi>Turks</hi> holding it more meritorious to kill one <hi>Perſian,</hi> than ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Hyſmael Sophi</hi> was the Founder of this eighth <hi>Dynaſty</hi> of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, <hi>ann.</hi> 1505, from whom is deſcended,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cha Soliman,</hi> the preſent King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> at his coming to the Crown called <hi>Cha Sophi;</hi> he came to be King, <hi>ann.</hi> 1665, his Father great <hi>Cha Abas</hi> then dying, himſelf at that time being thirty five years of Age. Its a remarkable Paſſage concerning the change of this King's Name, and his being twice crown'd, which was on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>It happened ſome time after his being crowned, that he grew indiſpoſed in his Health, and his Phyſician had tried ſeveral me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods on him without ſucceſs; whereupon the King's Mother growing impatient, fell ſeverely on the Phyſician, and charged him for being either Fool or Traitor, that he did not cure the King. The Doctor finding himſelf ſo hardly put to it, had no way to ſhift himſelf but by charging the Fault on the Stars and the Aſtrologers; and told her, if the King languiſhed, and could not recover a perfect health, it proceeded not from any Failure in him, or his Medicines, but for that the Aſtrologers had not taken the Aſpect of a fortunate Conſtellation at the time of his Coronation. The Phyſician was back'd by all his Friends at Court, and particularly by one of the King's Aſtrologers, who had a ſecret hatred againſt the Prince of the Aſtrologers, who had been appointed to obſerve the favourable hour for the King's Coronation; and the former made out the miſtake aſtrologically to the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the Court; ſo that the King and Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were poſſeſſed of the truth of what the Phyſician had aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The chief Aſtrologer ſeeing how things went, was forced, for fear of drawing on him ſomewhat worſe, not only to forbear contradiction, but withal to applaud what was ſaid; and upon this ſecond Inauguration, the King changed his name, as is ſaid before, which was judged unfortunate to the State; and he began (as he thought) to find himſelf better afterward.</p>
            <p>Note that the word <hi>Cha,</hi> in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue, ſignifies King, and that tho many call all the Kings of <hi>Perſia, Sohpies,</hi> ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Accounts ſay it is an Error ſo to do, and that <hi>Sophi</hi> is a proper name, or rather a name of the Religion of <hi>Hali;</hi> it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying wiſe and knowing in the Law.</p>

Zungteus</hi> the King of the <hi>Tartars</hi> died on the way, and left but one Son, ſix years of Age. The <hi>Tartars</hi> own'd him for their Emperour, and after having Crown'd him ſecond Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>China</hi> by the name of <hi>Zunchius,</hi> they purſued their Enterprize under the Conduct of <hi>Amavangus,</hi> his Uncle and Tutor; and in ſeven years they perfected the Conqueſt of almoſt the whole Empire, and defeated many Princes of the <hi>Royal Houſe;</hi> who had been Crown'd in different Provinces. This Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Zunchius</hi> died <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. 1661. and had for Succeſſor his Son, only eight years of Age.

Now it happened about the year 1508, that <hi>Mahomet Ben Amet,</hi> a Native of <hi>Dora,</hi> in the farther <hi>Numidia,</hi> pretending a Deſcent from their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> cauſed himſelf to be called <hi>Xeriffe,</hi> a Name by which the Kindred and Succeſſors of that Impoſtor uſed to call themſelves: and being a poor Hermite only (which ſort of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Saints have often impoſed on this People) plotted to make his Sons the chief Princes of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> To this end he ſent them to <hi>Meccha,</hi> whence they returned with ſuch an opinion of Sanctity, that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the then King of <hi>Fez,</hi> made <hi>Amet,</hi> the elder of them, Governor of the famous College of <hi>Amado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach,</hi> and the youngeſt, called <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Tutor to his Children. In thoſe days the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> greatly infeſted the Provinces of the Realm of <hi>Morocco;</hi> to repreſs whoſe Inſolences, <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Amet</hi> obtained Commiſſions, tho much oppoſed therein by <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> the King's Brother, who told him, that under colour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they might quickly raiſe themſelves to a power, and how unſafe it was to truſt an arm'd Hypocriſie. But this Counſel was rejected, and they being furniſhed with an Army, defeated <hi>Lopez Barriga,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Forces, under King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> and compelled that King to abandon all his Footing there: and they ſubdued <hi>Duccata, Sus,</hi> and <hi>Hea,</hi> three Provinces of the Realm of <hi>Morocco,</hi> entered that City, poiſoned the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary King, and ſalute <hi>Amet</hi> King thereof, by the name of <hi>Xeriffe</hi> of <hi>Morocco,</hi> inveſting <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the other Brother in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Sus.</hi> During theſe Succeſſes the King of <hi>Fez</hi> died, and his Succeſſor, named <hi>Amet,</hi> an improvident young Prince, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms his <hi>quondam</hi> Tutors in their new Eſtates, conditionally they ſhould hold of him in Chief, and pay him the accuſtomed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.

               <hi>Amet</hi> denied both Tribute and Superiority to the King of <hi>Fez,</hi> whom he overthrew in a ſet Field, and was himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vanquiſhed and diſpoſſeſſed of his Kingdom (upon ſome quarrel breaking out) by his Brother <hi>Mahomet,</hi> King of <hi>Sus,</hi> who having got the Kingdom of <hi>Morocco,</hi> united <hi>Fez</hi> unto it alſo, by the vanquiſhment of <hi>Amet,</hi> the King thereof, who at laſt was ſlain by the <hi>Turks</hi> of his Guard.

The Caſtle there is very large and ſtrong; on a Tower whereof ſtand three Globes made of pure Gold, prized at ſix hundred thouſand Livres. There is no City in all <hi>Barbary</hi> which equals <hi>Fez</hi> in Greatneſs, Beauty, and Number of Inhabitants. Some count in it twenty eight thouſand Houſholds, and ſeven hundred <hi>Moſques,</hi> the chief of which is <hi>Carnven,</hi> being a mile and an half in compaſs; the Roof is large and high raiſed; its one hundred and fifty yards in length, and eighty in breadth: there is a College called <hi>Amadorach,</hi> a moſt curious and delicate Building; it has three Cloiſters of admirable Beauty, ſupported with eight ſquare Pillars of divers Colours; the Roof is curiouſly carved, and the Arches of <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work of Gold and Azure. The Gates are of Braſs finely wrought, and the Doors of the private Chambers

            <p n="4">IV. As for his <hi>Revenues,</hi> he is abſolute Lord of the whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and of his Subjects Goods and Bodies. He has the Tenth, and Firſt Fruits of all Fruits, Corn and Cattle, tho many times contented in the Name of the Firſt Fruits, with one in twenty. He receives the fifth part of a Ducat, for every Acre of Land throughout his Dominions, the other four parts for every Fire, and as much for every Head, above fifteen years of Age. Of Merchandize he receives of every Native two in the hundred; of every Alien, ten; and has a large Impoſt upon every Mill. When any of his greater Officers or Judges die; he is ſole Heir of all their Goods, and yet advances great Sums, by the Sale of thoſe Offices. And upon extraordinary Occaſions he levies what Taxes he pleaſes, but commonly he is pretty moderate in them.</p>

            <p>AS to the Account here given concerning the Chief Princes of the World, and the ſeveral Heads relating to them, I well know that the laſt year, a ſmall Book was printed in 120<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> relating to the firſt Head of mine, <hi>viz.</hi> The Births and Names of the Chief <hi>European</hi> Princes.
