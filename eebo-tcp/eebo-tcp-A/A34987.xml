            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Back-ſlider Reproved, and his Folly made manifeſt, and his Confuſions and Contradictions diſcovered.</head>
            <p>IT is not a new nor ſtrange thing, to ſee the old Enemy of the Light, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prince of Darkneſs, to be diligent in raiſing up as high Mountains and Towers as he can, to keep it from ſhining; and as he can bring forth no evil to man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without ſome Inſtrument into which he gets an entrance; therefore he is diligent in perſwading and tempting from the Light, even thoſe that have ſeen the Appearance of it, and not become ſo ſubject to it as they ſhould have been, whoſe fooliſh hearts he darkens, and fills their minds with vain imaginations, and then are they choice Inſtruments for his purpoſe, as bearing ſomething more of his Image (who himſelf abode not in the Truth) than others. And ſuch as theſe he alwayes ſpurred on in a blind zeal againſt the Light, as that which was moſt deſtructive to his and their works of darkneſs. And among this ſort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, here is one <hi>Robert Cobbet</hi> hath preſented himſelf as an enemy to the Doctrine of the Light, though he is indeed but as one of the meaneſt and ſhattredeſt of that Camp, and hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to but a ſmall meaſure of that ſubtilty which this Father and Prince of Darkneſs doth uſe to furniſh his children withal, that are capable to receive it. But however, what he hath, or thinketh he hath, he hath adventured to preſent to publick view; though indeed it is as a Rod for his own chaſtiſement: and I heartily wiſh there be ſo much ſenſe left in him, that he may feel the ſmart of it, and may amend and leave off his folly and blind zeal, and ſubmit to that which comprehends him, his ſpirit and work; For I knew a time when he could not have believed that he ſhould have been led to ſuch a depth of Confuſion in oppoſing the Light as now he is, though he was never faithful to it as he ought, but ſought in his fallen corruptible wiſdom to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it; but I deſire he may yet ſee a death upon that which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46210:3"/>
hath unto this day, kept his ſoul in death and darkneſs; and in order thereunto, and for the Truths ſake, I have written theſe few lines, briefly to ſhew him and others his Confuſions, Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Abſurdities; or at leaſt a few of thoſe many which he hath uttered, and Printed in his Book, called, <hi>A Word to the Upright, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Reader,</hi> take notice, that after his Book called, <hi>God's Truth atteſted,</hi> was made publick, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was written in Anſwer thereto, ſhewing him how he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted himſelf and the Scriptures too, in a ſeeming Reply thereto, he publiſhed this, called, <hi>A Word to the Upright,</hi> which, he ſaith, is <hi>to eſtabliſh them in theſe erring dayes, and to keep the young ſprouts of the Nation from corruption in Opinion</hi>; which whether <hi>R. C.</hi> hath written a piece that is likely to prove an <hi>eſtabliſhing of the upright from Error, or to prevent the young ſprouts from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in principle or opinion,</hi> will more appear anon, to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>Reader,</hi> when he hath rightly weighed the Conſequences of letting in all his Doctrines for truth, whether it will not render them more like to diſtracted men, than principl'd Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>At my firſt ſight of this Book, it roſe in my heart to write ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Anſwer to it, and to take off the reproach which he hath endeavoured to caſt upon the bleſſed Truth and Way of God which he hath turned his back upon; but when I came to make a diligent ſearch into the matter, I found much of that labour ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the moſt part of his Doctrines being anſwered and confuted by himſelf, in the ſame Book, ſo that it might have been called, <hi>Robert Cobbet</hi> anſwering and confuting <hi>Robert Cobbet,</hi> as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this enſuing rehearſal of his Doctrines and Principles.</p>
            <p>And therefore now let the <hi>Upright,</hi> to whom he writes, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he propounds to them as an <hi>eſtabliſhment against the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of theſe erring dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt as to the Light in the Conſcience, he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. <hi>In that the Light is a ſparkling glimpſe in the Soul, doth convince the Soul of what is done amiſs, which being diſcerned by the Soul, ſerves for a Director of the Soul to Christ Jeſus, where only lies its help.</hi> And in his 10th <hi>page</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Soul hath knowledge from this Light to eſchew evil, and do good; in the doing of either of which, ſtands his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> peace.</hi> And in his 22 <hi>page</hi> ſaith, That <hi>this Spirit or Light in man, is the candle of the Lord that ſearcheth the innermost parts of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46210:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
belly.</hi> And in his 4 <hi>page</hi> faith, <hi>Did not this Light in thy Conſcience condemn thee of all that ever thou didst before the day of God brake forth?</hi> And in his 3 <hi>page</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the end of Chriſt's coming was to beget unto Communion with the Father and himſelf, by giving them his life, which is man's Light, which (my Brethren) being our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we have it by him who is our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And in his 11 <hi>page</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Light ſerves to condemn for unbelief, and to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Creature in his obedience of Faith, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So by this time we ſee what a large teſtimony <hi>R. C.</hi> hath born to the Light in the Conſcience and to its original; to wit, the Life of Jeſus, and to its power, efficacy, and influence; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the effects that follow both the obedient and diſobedient; as wo and peace, condemnation and juſtification, and how it is the Souls director unto Chriſt, and that by which the Soul obtains the knowledge of what is good, and communion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now will or can any, that doth take in and receive this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from <hi>R.C.</hi> doubt or queſtion his being a friend to the Light, and to the <hi>Quakers</hi> too, ſeeing he hath ſo ſtrongly aſſerted their Principle, with ſo many illuſtrations? Well, ſuppoſe that now thou doſt believe <hi>R.C.</hi> in theſe things, and be ſetled in thy mind that he hath written the truth, and ſo come to find a need of loving and obeying this Light in thy Conſcience; which he further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in the 21 <hi>page</hi> thus, <hi>The Word that was God by which all things was made; in him was Life, and that Life was the Light of men, and he it is that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> I ſay, if thou doſt come to be ſettled thus in theſe erring dayes (as he calls them) and doſt come to have an eſteem of the Light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>R.C.</hi> hath written; my Counſel is unto thee, that if <hi>R. C.</hi> or any elſe, ſhall deny this Doctrine again, and write or ſpeak againſt it, that thou believe them not, but keep ſingle to this truth and thou ſhalt find the good effects of it, beyond what he hath or can declare; yet thus far <hi>R. C.</hi> hath againſt his will witneſſed to the truth. Now mark what follows as to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that <hi>R. C.</hi> may ſufficiently appear to confute himſelf; He ſaith in the 22 <hi>page, The Light in the Conſcience cannot lead the followers of its dictates further than its own centre, which is the centre of nature; and its power felt, but the power of the centre of nature; and that man's internal Light hath no more power to give Salvation than
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46210:4"/>
the Soul hath to ſave its ſelf,</hi> as in the ſame page; <hi>and that the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into it for a manifeſtation of the Salvation that came by grace in Chriſt, is a Doctrine that turns away the Creature from Chriſt the Redeemer to a property of nature, wherein can be no ſaving health,</hi> as in page 10. And again, in the ſame <hi>page</hi> he ſaith, <hi>The Light in the Conſcience being a property in man, as man is a creature, its office in the Soul is not appointed to give Salvation.</hi> And in the 21 page he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt the Word that maketh all things, is not the Light; and although he be goodneſs it ſelf, and ſends forth his love (to wit) his life, which ſhed in the heart, is a Light which he calls his Spirit, which Light is not Chriſt though of his nature.</hi> And in the 5 page ſaith, <hi>That the ſpirit of man is of the principle of light, and is a ſpark of that nature, which having loſt its life by the tranſgreſſion of the man to God, is dead, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by this time where is the ſettlements for the young ſprouts of the Nation? who muſt (if they will believe <hi>R. C.</hi>) believe that the Light in Conſcience is to lead to Chriſt, and yet can lead no further than the centre of Nature; and that it is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and hath power to miniſter wo and peace, to juſtifie or condemn; and now muſt believe it can do neither, it being but a property of Nature, and dead to God: and muſt believe that the Light of men, is the Life and Chriſt; and now muſt believe that though this Light is his Life, and is his Spirit, and of his Nature, yet it is not He. Oh horrible blindneſs and ſottiſhneſs! Is this the way to ſettle People, for ſuch double-minded and double-tongued Hypocrites to take in hand to doctrinate them thus back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward, to believe and deny the ſame thing, and all in one hours time?</p>
            <p>But one thing more I have to note, which <hi>R. C.</hi> goes about to ſettle us in, in theſe <hi>erring times,</hi> about what we ſhould and ought to believe of Chriſt, and what he is that is the Saviour: in which mark; Firſt he affirms in the 3d page, <hi>That Chriſt is everlaſting as he is the Word</hi>; and in the 16 page ſaith, <hi>The Seed is Chriſt, to whom the Covenant was made by God, as written, My Covenant ſhall be with thee, and with thy ſeed, and he is Lord and Saviour:</hi> And in pag. 17. he quotes the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>They have believed that I came down from thee.</hi> So here thou mayſt ſee who <hi>R.C.</hi> acknowledgeth to be the Saviour, even the Seed of Promiſe, with which God's
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46210:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Covenant ſtands for ever, which Seed came down from God, &amp;c. So this is good ſound Doctrine according to Scripture; but that thou mayſt be unſettled again from this: <hi>R. C.</hi> ſaith again in the 18 page, That <hi>the Saviour is in Nature and Creaturality like him</hi>; and that <hi>the Seed that broke the Serpents head is not ſomething that this</hi> R.C. <hi>is not, as he is nature and creature, but is the off ſpring of</hi> Adam, <hi>conſiſting as he doth:</hi> and ſaith in his 12 page, <hi>the body was Chriſt:</hi> and in his 6 page, <hi>Behold I ſhew you a Mystery, you men in the clouds, Chriſt being the product of the Holy Ghoſt to a coagulated ſubſtance from the properties of Man in</hi> Mary. And in the 18 page ſaith, <hi>Being out of doubt that the Soul of Chriſt was of and from the properties of nature and creature, made by generation of the properties of</hi> Mary, <hi>is that Seed God promiſed to break the Serpents head:</hi> and in the 19 page, <hi>Is it not the Body of Chriſt by which we are reconciled unto God? yes verily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So now let all People ſee if this man be like to ſettle any, and to keep the <hi>young ſprouts</hi> from being deceived, who is thus confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf; one while telling it is the Seed that is the Saviour, and the everlaſting Word of God, and he which came down from God, &amp;c. and then preſently ſaying it is a thing <hi>produced,</hi> a thing <hi>formed of the properties of man, a body that reconciles, a coagulated ſubſtance, a thing in nature like him himſelf, conſiſting as he doth both in kind and ſubſtance</hi>; and much ſuch-like, as may be ſeen more at large in his Book.</p>
            <p>Well, if <hi>R. C.</hi> had known Chriſt Jeſus, and the Power of his Death and Reſurrection, he had not written ſo confuſedly; for then he had known the virtue of the Seed, and the ſervice of Body and Soul too, and had known the offering to be made by the eternal Spirit, and then he would not have ſaid that it was the body only that reconciled, or that the body only was Chriſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Body without the Spirit is dead, and that could not give life; but the Son of God that took the body, hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and can give life to them that believe, and was, and is, and is to come; and he is in the Faithful, and they are in him and in his body, bone of it, and fleſh of it; and the life which they live is by faith in him, and not by talk of him. But theſe things <hi>R.C.</hi> is a ſtranger to, and ſo imagines about him, and intrudes into things which he hath not ſeen, and is vainly puft up in a fleſhly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46210:5"/>
mind, and fleſhly knowledge which is for judgment; for this jumble and confuſion is the only way to bring into Atheiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if there were no better Aſſerters of the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity then he is. But let all ſober People wait to feel a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that life and fulneſs that dwelt in that Body of Jeſus, for which it was prepared, that ſo they may by the power of that Life be ſettled in the knowledge of the Saviour Jeſus, and may daily wait for his Appearance to ſave; for he ever liveth and is ever needed, and none are ſafe but under the government of his Spirit. Now as to what ſubſtance he was of, <hi>R. C.</hi> ſaith in his 6th page, <hi>His ſubſtance was from the properties of man in</hi> Mary: but in the ſame page he ſaith again, <hi>That the body of our Lord was of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſubſtance.</hi> And in his other Book ſaith, <hi>He is the Son from the ſubſtance of the Father</hi>; and was, he ſaith, of <hi>the nature of heaven.</hi> So then the properties of Man in <hi>Mary</hi> was heavenly ſubſtance, of the nature of heaven, or elſe <hi>R. C.</hi> is here unſettled, and in error and darkneſs himſelf; nay that which is more, <hi>R. C.</hi> himſelf muſt be of this heavenly ſubſtance, this nature of heaven; for he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt conſiſted as he doth.</hi> But leſt ye ſhould believe what he ſaith about the heavenly Nature, he ſaith, <hi>his ſoul was made by generation of the properties of</hi> Mary. <hi>R. C.</hi> wilt thou not bluſh at theſe things when thou reviews them?</p>
            <p>And then for the form of this ſubſtance, he ſaith page 8. That <hi>while he there ſtood, differed nothing from the form of a ſervant:</hi> but in the 6 page he ſaith, <hi>That as he was thus circumſcribed, and thus conſiſted of Soul, Body and Spirit, he was that form of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How now <hi>R.C.</hi> What, is the form of a ſervant, and the form of God all one? And is the form of God a circumſcribed form? Haſt not thou learned this of <hi>Lodow. Muggleton,</hi> that falſe witneſs and notorious blaſphemer? (that ſaith <hi>God is but the bigneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a man</hi>) whoſe ſteps thou art treading, and whoſe end will be thy end, except thou repent.</p>
            <p>And then again concerning the Blood that ſaves and does away ſin; hear what <hi>R. C.</hi> in his 11 page ſaith, <hi>My Brethren, you are bought with a Price, not of blood of Bulls, and Goats, nor Heifers of a year old, but by the Blood of God.</hi> But in his 13 page he is of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother opinion, and ſaith quite contrary; theſe are his words, viz. <hi>Which blood being the blood of his humanity, as he was creature,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46210:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was that which did with God expiate for ſin.</hi> So now which of theſe two Doctrines ſhall we believe, that we are ſaved by <hi>the blood of God,</hi> or <hi>blood of</hi> the <hi>Humanity?</hi> or ſhall we ſuppoſe them to be both one, and ſo God to be humane, and ſo the Doctrines indifferent?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R. C.</hi> will do well to clear up theſe things, or own his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon his folly and preſumption; for its unlike he ſhould ever be reconcil'd to the People of God who is ſo at odds in himſelf in this manner. Alas <hi>Robert!</hi> Doſt thou not yet ſee whither thou art gone by going from the Light, and now ſtaggers and reels, and doſt not know whither thou goeſt? Oh! that a day may be yet found for thee and thine, and that thou mayſt come to bow down to that, which thou now kick'ſt and ſpurn'ſt againſt.</p>
            <p>And in page 21 thou ſayſt, <hi>If the Light in Conſcience be Chriſt, then ſo many men as are in the world, ſo many Chriſts.</hi> Why ſo, <hi>Robert,</hi> Haſt not thou thy ſelf anſwered this in confeſſing that one Chriſt hath with his Life ſerved to lighten every man that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world, and what need is there then for every man to have a diſtinct Chriſt, ſeeing he is the Chriſt of God thou ſayſt that lightens them all. And thou ſayeſt in this ſame page, That <hi>Chriſt, as he is the Word and Maker of all things, is not the Light in Conſcience</hi>; but in the next line or two thou ſayſt, <hi>But the Word that was God, &amp;c. in him was Life, and the Life is the Light of men, and he lightens every man.</hi> How doſt thou mean by this? Doſt thou not mean that he lightens them in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? Or where elſe?</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Soul of Man</hi> thou ſayſt in thy 4 page, That <hi>it is a ſpark of God's eternal Nature, coagulated into a Spiritual ſubſtance for a centre of his inſenſitive life; and as thus compacted is a creature of an eternal being, of an own ſelf-ſubſiſting conſiſtency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. R.C.</hi> hath here deſcribed a creature that ſubſiſts of its ſelf contrary to the Scripture, that ſaith all things are upheld by the Word; and beſides this <hi>eternal creature,</hi> as he calls it, this <hi>ſpark of God's eternal Nature,</hi> this <hi>coagulated ſubſtance</hi> (he ſaith) was to be <hi>a centre</hi> for God's <hi>inſenſitive life.</hi> What <hi>Robert!</hi> Had it not a centre before? But if this <hi>coagulated ſubſtance</hi> ſubſiſts of it ſelf, then not by the life that centers in it; and if the Soul
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46210:6"/>
be <hi>a ſpark of God's nature,</hi> how comes it to be created? And if it be his nature, how comes it to be corrupted in the life time as thou ſayeſt it is? and how can a ſpark of God's eternal nature let into its ſelf the poyſon of the Serpent and ſo die? Where is its <hi>own ſelf-ſubſiſtency</hi> now? Is this thy explaining the matter? Or, where is its being a centre for that inſenſitive Life of God? And further in thy 5th page thou ſayſt, <hi>This ſpark, this coagulated ſubſtance, this own ſelf-ſubſiſtency dieth:</hi> and in another place ſpeakeſt of its periſhing; and yet talks of an <hi>eternal creature.</hi> But <hi>R. C.</hi> what life of time is that which corrupts the ſoul, and how came it to have its abode in an infectious life of time, ſeeing its an <hi>eternal creature</hi> as thou ſayſt? But what man's Soul, or the Soul of Jeſus either is, thou knoweſt not; for if thou hadſt, thou wouldſt not have thus befool'd thy ſelf, to ſay man's Soul was a <hi>ſpark of God's eternal nature,</hi> and yet ſay the Soul of Chriſt was but of <hi>the properties of nature made by generation</hi>; nor yet have affirmed that to be the Seed of Promiſe which came by <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of, and from the properties of</hi> Mary: Is not that the Seed of Promiſe mentioned in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. who is called, <hi>The Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace?</hi> And what is <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God? This will pleaſe the Papiſts well; and is this the way <hi>to ſettle Chriſtians, and preſerve the young ſprouts of the Nation from corruption?</hi> And where is thy Scripture to prove that Jeſus, the Saviour, was created, as in thy 6 page thou ſayſt? But Oh! this darkneſs and confuſion that thou mayſt ſee it, and be aſhamed of it.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>Robert Cobbet,</hi> in his 26 page, ſaith in plain words, <hi>That Chriſt and his Spirit are not one:</hi> and his Argument is, That Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I go away, but I will ſend you a Comforter.</hi> Which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſufficient to prove, that Chriſt, the Meſſias and Saviour, is one with the Spirit of Truth, and not diſtinct. If one ſhould ask <hi>R. C.</hi> how many were mentioned in that text, where he ſaith, <hi>He that now is with you, ſhall be in you</hi>; would he anſwer that there was more than one He; if not, then here is no more (to wit) Chriſt and his Spirit which eternally are one.</p>
            <p>But that he may ſufficiently manifeſt his folly, he tells us in the ſame 26 page, <hi>That the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, are all One, both in reſpect of conſent in their Teſtimonies, and alſo in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46210:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reſpect of their eternity of being</hi>; ſo which of theſe ſhall we believe? that Chriſt and his Spirit are One, or that they are not One? <hi>R. C.</hi> will do well to tell People which he will ſtand by.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>R. Cobbet</hi>'s pleading or hoping, <hi>That the Powers will keep up a Charity to us, upon the account that thouſands of us do (he hopes) believe his narrative of God</hi>; and his deſire altering the matter for a corporal form into a nature for production of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſpeaking forth the modal by his word, &amp;c. page 26. Truly we need not <hi>R. C.</hi> to ſet forth an account of our Faith and Belief in theſe things, neither can we own it, or him; for if we ſhould, we ſhould ſoon be brought under the judgment both of God and Man. And for his pleading, That <hi>in the ſoundest Bodies, there ſometimes breaketh forth a Boyl.</hi> Truly if he aims at us by this Body (as I think he doth) we do confeſs, that ſo far as ever he was of us, ſo far he is that <hi>Boyle</hi> which we confeſs is now broken forth: but they that know him in particular, know how little he was of us, and how little while he profeſt himſelf to be of us; ſo his breaking-out and running like <hi>a boyle</hi> or ſore, the corrupt matter that was in him, is no great diſparagement to the Body; for the body is ſounder without him than with him: and whilſt he was amongſt us, he was often breaking out with his whimſeys and imaginations, ſo that he became naucious unto us, but not in ſo groſs a manner as now.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>R. C.</hi> ſaying, That <hi>ſome of us knew that he counted our language but a cant language.</hi> We know that from the firſt of his coming among us, he was far enough from our language or life ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but it is no great matter for him to call our Language a Cant, who replyes to our words thus, <hi>viz.</hi> when we ſaid, <hi>The Lord is one, and his Name one</hi>; he anſwers, <hi>Friends, do not caper,</hi> as in his 2d page. And he ſaith in his 31 page, That <hi>he is no</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; of which, all that ever ſaw or heard any thing of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Books or Doctrines, will bear him witneſs; for never did <hi>Quaker</hi> appear in ſuch a heap of confuſion as <hi>R. C.</hi> hath done; and yet that malicious ſaying of his in this 31 page, That <hi>to be a</hi> Quaker, <hi>is to deny his Lord and Maſter,</hi> God will judge him for; if by Lord and Maſter he means the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as I think he doth. But he that really and truly is his Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prince of the air that rules in the hearts of ſuch diſobedient Children
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46210:7"/>
and Apoſtates as he is; He, I confeſs, he muſt deny more than ever yet he hath done, before he can become a <hi>Quaker,</hi> or have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with them, who are ſcornfully ſo called.</p>
            <p>But why doth <hi>R. C.</hi> in his 30 page come with a kiſs, <hi>Judas</hi>-like, and ſay, <hi>Brethren, I will ask you a queſtion, &amp;c.</hi> when as the matter he intends there to inſinuate to his <hi>Reader</hi> is, That we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that Chriſt that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to be Chriſt: Is not this on purpoſe to betray us, and beguile his <hi>Reader?</hi> and that with a Lye; for we never yet denied him that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilato,</hi> to be the Lord and Saviour. But indeed we never did believe him to be <hi>produced by coagulation</hi> as <hi>R.C.</hi> doth; nor by <hi>generation of and from the properties of Man in</hi> Mary; for then ſome might have declared his generation, which the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Who can do?</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we believe him to be the Eternal Son of God. But if <hi>R. Cobbet</hi>'s Doctrine be true, then he was not before <hi>Mary</hi>; but his ignorance of Chriſt is ſufficiently manifeſted to all that have an eye opened.</p>
            <p>And as to his ſaying, <hi>That the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.1, 2, 3. <hi>That the Sufferings of Christ is the Power of God and Goſpel, by which we are ſaved:</hi> That's falſe, and a belying the Apoſtle and Scripture too: for all that reads the text may ſee, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of his Sufferings but as one part of many of that Goſpel which he had preached; but it was the Reſurrection of Chriſt he moſt of all pointed at, as the principal thing, they muſt come to feel the power of; as in <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Many more of <hi>R. Cobbet</hi>'s Abſurdities and Contradictions I might note down, as alſo thoſe noted in the Anſwer to his firſt Book, which yet remains unanſwered, nor ſo much as an attempt made thereof; he (it may be) diſpairs of ever reconciling them in the ſight of rational men: But theſe, at preſent, may ſatiſfie the ingenious <hi>Reader,</hi> what ſpirit it is in <hi>Robert Cobbet,</hi> that hath taken in hand to ſettle People in theſe <hi>erring dayes, and to preſerve the young ſprouts of the Nation from corruption.</hi> And ſo let <hi>Robert Cobbet</hi> mind (if he writes again) to keep more within the bounds of moderation, and not to let his envy againſt the Light, ſo captivate his reaſon, as to bereave him of the uſe of it, as it hath done; for truly is that Scripture fulfilled in him, <hi>He that walketh in darkneſs ſlumbleth, and knoweth not whither he goeth.</hi>

               <salute>Friend <hi>Eliz. Atkinſon,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have taken ſome notice of thy abuſive ſlanderous Pamphlet againſt the Quakers, whom thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to have walked nine years amongſt: And is this the fruit of thy nine years Travel? A pack of Lies, Feignedneſs, and Deceit, which diſcovers more Impudency, than Modeſty or Sobriety on thy part; as alſo apparent Nonſence and Contradictions to thy ſelf, as will briefly appear in what follows; though blaſphemouſly and impudently thou fathereſt thy Work upon the conſtraint of the Love of God: But thou haſt been led by a lying ſpirit to blaſpheme againſt the Truth, nine years profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thee; and yet thou art fain to make uſe of many words and phraſes thou haſt learned amongſt the Quakers, though to a wicked end, and to thy own confuſion. Thou now pretendeſt to declare againſt our Principles and Practice; but what thou ſayeſt as to our Principles, reacheth very few of them; but the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in chiefly, thou, in thy darkneſs, ſmiteſt againſt, though to the diſcovery of thine own folly and contradiction, as will appear.</p>
            <p>And as to practice, thou ſayeſt, <hi>Thoſe that for a time practiſed Honesty in their Callings, are now turned Deceivers; and thoſe that formerly were content with their own Wives, are now turned Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, luſting after other mens,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:46210:10"/>We anſwer, Both theſe Accuſations are general, and do reflect upon all of us that have practiſed Honeſty, who are now accuſed with Diſhoneſty and Adultery; wherein thou haſt appeared both impudent and wicked, thus to bring forth a general charge to aſperſe a whole Body, whoſe Principle is againſt all ſuch Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and againſt all unrighteouſneſs; and herein our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is juſtified, as that which led to practiſe Honeſty, and to live in Chaſtity and Faithfulneſs to our own Relations; and now how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any have apoſtatized from, or abuſed this Principle of Truth and Righteouſneſs amongſt us, their falling is not chargeable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Principle, for the Truth ſtands intire ſtill, and the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders muſt bear their own burthens. Our righteous Principle is not to be accuſed, either becauſe <hi>Eliz. Atkinſon</hi> or <hi>R. Cobbet,</hi> or others, have turned their backs of it, after ſo many years being amongſt us: If any ſhould revile the Quakers, becauſe ſhe is turned treacherouſly againſt them, in a light airy ſpirit, with a parcel of fained expreſſions, this were unjuſt in them, as well as in her. It were a great wickedneſs for any to accuſe the true Prophets or Apoſtles, becauſe of the falſe Prophets and falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles that roſe up againſt them, who turned from the Counſel of God and Truth. And it is as wicked in <hi>E. A.</hi> to accuſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God now, becauſe probably ſhe knows of ſome diſorderly perſons that walk not according to the <hi>Principle</hi> and Doctrine of Godlineſs w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have received; as it's probable ſhe being falſe and perfidious her ſelf, might have more knowledge of (or intimacy with) ſuch diſobedient and diſorderly Spirits and Walkers than ſome of us have. But however, her accuſation being general, it's moſt unjuſt and impudent. For firſt, We are not onely prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled againſt all wickedneſs, filthineſs, and abominations, as that of <hi>Cheating, uſing Deceit and Adultery,</hi> with all other wickedneſs, which we Judge and Teſtifie againſt, both in the ſpirit and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and ſuch as are guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſecondly, We alſo endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as much as in us lieth, to clear the Truth and Gods people of all ſuch ſcandals, and of all ſuch as give any occaſion thereof; by bringing juſt Reproof and Judgement upon the Offenders, and endeavouring to ſuppreſs and caſt out that looſe, diſobedient, and unclean mind and ſpirit, which either doth tempt or lead any into diſorders or wickedneſs: So that indeed a modeſt woman or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46210:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would have been aſhamed to publiſh ſuch a general Charge of wickedneſs and impiety againſt us, as thouſands that are not of us, know many of us to be both of better ſpirits and principles, than in the leaſt to countenance or admit of ſuch groſs wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as Cheating or Adultery; under which ſhe has included ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny innocent perſons: for her words [<hi>Thoſe that practiſed Honeſty, and thoſe that were contented with their own Wives,</hi> &amp;c.] are general terms, and may be conſtrued that all amongſt us that were ſo, are now contrary, for here is no exception made. Who but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent perſon would thus groſly and ſlanderouſly have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have defamed a people whom ſhe confeſſes to have walked nine years amongſt, wherein ſhe has brought Reproach upon her ſelf.</p>
            <p>And now (<hi>E. A.</hi>) what haſt thou againſt our principles, more than that thou tellſt us, <hi>That we preached a Light within that ſhewed you good and evil, and that thou knew was in thee:</hi> (So herein thou knew the Truth was preached amongſt us.) And that <hi>we ſaid if you would mind that, it would lead you out of all evil: Thus</hi> (ſayeſt thou) <hi>we ſet you to feed upon the Tree of Knowledge, which indeed was good, but not for food; but the ſubtile twining Serpent called it the Tree of Life,</hi> (thou ſayeſt:) <hi>Thus by hearkening unto them, waſt thou deluded and blinded, to forſake thy firſt Love,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus like a ſilly ignorant Woman, perverted with prejudice, haſt thou blaſphemouſly accuſed the Light, as being but the Tree of Knowledge; and perverted the Truth, which directed thee to it, as being but the ſubtilty and deluſion of the Serpent, and yet thou knows ſuch a Light was in thee as ſhewed thee Good and Evil; which Light, hadſt thou lived and waited in it, would have kept thee out of evil and backſliding which thou art fallen into. Its ſhewing the evil, was, that thou mighteſt forſake ſin and evil, and not that thou mighteſt either feed upon it, or upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the evil, by partaking thereof. Did not the Light give the Saints a diſcerning between Good and Evil? And things that are reproved, are manifeſted by the Light; and the Light that did ſhine in their hearts gave them the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. and Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Believe in the Light, that you may be the Children of the Light</hi>; and this was not the Serpent that thus directed, as blaſphemouſly thy words
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46210:11"/>
import, againſt the Light and the Miniſtry of Truth amongſt us, which directs to it. But we need not ſay much in anſwer to ſuch ſilly ignorant ſottiſh blaſphemous ſtuff, as thou haſt here uttered: for like a drunken perſon, thou haſt reeled and ſtaggered both ways, and haſt ſufficiently anſwered and confuted thy ſelf in what follows in thy own words, on the behalf of the Light within.</p>
            <p>As in page 2. thou ſayſt in the beginning, <hi>God made the World by Christ the Word, and the bright ſhining of his Life was the Light of Men; and this Chriſt is indeed the true Light that enlightens every one that cometh into the World; and by this Light Man knew the Will of his Maker; but being diſobedient thereunto, he fell into the wrath of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here take notice, <hi>That the Life of Chriſt was the Light of Men,</hi> and this was not the forbidden Fruit: And ſecondly, That every one that comes into the World is enlightened by Chriſt: Thirdly, That Mans diſobedience to the Light, was his Fall; and this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience the Serpent led into; therefore it is not the Serpent nor his deluſion that directs people to the Light within, as blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly and contradictorily thou haſt implied.</p>
            <p>Again, Thou confeſſeſt that <hi>Chriſt came to be a Sacrifice for ſin for the whole World, if they will believe in him; and that theſe things by the Light within are ſhewed to us:</hi> (By which thou haſt juſtified the Quakers Doctrine, though to thy own confuſion.) And in p. 3. thou adds, <hi>The Light within is but the manifeſtation of him that is the Saviour:</hi> A large confeſſion! And muſt not people look to the manifeſtation of their Saviour, or that which ſhews them Chriſt to be a Sacrifice for ſin?</p>
            <p>Again, Thou ſayeſt <hi>we deny the Fountain, becauſe we have had a little taſte from the Stream; and tells of the Plant being refreſh'd by the beams of the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So here again thou haſt falſly charged us, but juſtified our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: for in thy ſetting thy Light as the Stream, and as the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, thou haſt contradicted thy former accuſation againſt it: for they that follow the Stream, do not deny the Fountain which it leads to; neither is the vertue of the Sun denied, where its Beams or Rays are felt and acknowledged; for the Suns vertue and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is felt in the Beams.</p>
            <p>Again, P. 4. thou confeſſeſt <hi>the Light within, which ſhews good
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46210:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and evil, to be a glance from him who came to be Salvation:</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that <hi>we may refreſh our thirſty Souls in the Stream, but we muſt go unto the Fountain to be cleanſed, in the City of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So then, if the Light within be this refreſhing Stream, it is not the Tree of knowledge forbidden, neither are we forbidden to drink of the Stream, for it comes from the Fountain: and ſurely people may waſh in the Stream. And why doſt thou ſuppoſe the Stream not to be in the City? Whereas <hi>there is a River the Streams whereof make glad</hi> (or refreſh) <hi>the City of God,</hi> Pſal. 46.4. And ſurely ſeeing the Light gives the knowledge of our duty, &amp; ſhews ſin and evil, if the Light be obeyed, or truly improved, it will lead out of evil, and guide man in his duty to God, &amp; ſo preſerve him from the puniſhment: And by this Light we were firſt called, and are in it, and need not thy Exhortation, who art a treacherous Backſlider from it.</p>
            <p>P. 5, 6, 7. And if <hi>hearkning diligently to the Voice of Chriſt, be the the condition joyned to the Covenant, and that the Law is manifeſst within, and we muſt wait upon him that has called us, with earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that experience is to be had in the Myſtery, and Life, and Salvation, not in the Scripture; and that the Creature is to retire it ſelf in ſtillneſs, and not to take part with the Enemy,</hi> &amp;c. as thou haſt largely confeſt; What muſt we wait in, hearken in, receive Life and Salvation in, or experience the Myſtery? And to what muſt we retire? And by what ſhall we know the Voice of Chriſt, and pray, if not in and by his Light within? For thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that <hi>the ſpirit of the Wicked one worketh in the Children of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to do evil, ſo the Spirit of Chriſt doth work in the Believer to do well,</hi> [which is Trurh, but againſt thy ſelf.] <hi>As alſo thoſe that have been faithful to their Captain, though never ſo little were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their trust, ſhall enter into the poſſeſſion.</hi> And p. 8. thou tells us of ſome <hi>that were deceived by not keeping humble and low to follow the Lord; and how hard it will be for theſe to be renewed, except they hearken to the Voice of the Lord behind them! and O that we may never forget to wait upon the Fountain of Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. Thou art one of thoſe that art exalted, thou haſt not kept in humility, thou haſt not followed the Lord, thou haſt grown wanton, and kick'd againſt his Light within; thou haſt not waited for his Counſel as thou oughteſt, but haſt luſted after evil, till leanneſs is entred into thy
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46210:12"/>
Soul, till groſs darkneſs is come over thee, and confuſion is thy ſnare; thou haſt made lies and falſehood thy refuge, like an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, immodeſt, hard-hearted Woman. Who did help thee to compoſe and word thy lying Pamphlet? We hear <hi>Ro. Co.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it: Was he thy Patron? An angry dark conceited man, who glories in his folly, and yet thinks he is wiſe, though he is as full of nonſence and confuſion as thou art; but his and thy clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lying Tongues God will cut off, and ſtop your Mouths. In p. 4. thou tellſt us, <hi>That the Diſciples whom Chriſt called Brethren, did not call themſelves the Seed:</hi> This is thy blindneſs, for were not the Children of the Kingdom called the good Seed, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Promiſe counted for the Seed? Were they not of one holy Seed and off-ſpring; ſeeing he that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one? And were not they a Royal Seed, a holy Prieſthood? And who were the Remnant of the Seed of the Woman, that kept the Commands of God? And it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that though thou haſt often belied us, yet in p. 1. haſt confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, That we, the people called Quakers, of a truth God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us out of the broad way of wickedneſs, and many Jewels were we adorned with: So then, we were a people called and adorned of the Lord, and not with the Jewels of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which falſly thou haſt inſtanced in the Caſe. Beſides, we are in the ſame Way, Truth and Principles, which God at firſt called us into; though ſuch perfidious Backſliders and Apoſtates as thou thy ſelf, and ſome others are, have abuſed the Truth, rejected his Call, and caſt his Law behind your backs, to your own condemnation and deſtruction, if you do not return and repent.</p>
            <p>Here follows a Collection of ſome of thy Lyes and Slanders in thy Book againſt the Choſen people of God called Quakers, which are rejected, and returned back upon thee.</p>
