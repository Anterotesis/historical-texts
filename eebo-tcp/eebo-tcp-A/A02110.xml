            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This caused not his Noble men to cease fro their sutes, but they daily followed the chase, insomuch, that the house of <hi>Sydaris</hi> was a second court, some offred hir large possessions for hir dowrie, other, as great reuenues, some were caualiers, and men of great value. Thus euery way was she hanted with braue men, that poore <hi>Alexis</hi> durst not come néere the sight of the smoake that came out of the chimney, past all hope of his <hi>Rosamond,</hi> thinking wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aymed to be supremes, that they prise gold before beauty, and wealth before loue, yet he houered a farre off, while the Courtiers fell together by the eares, who shoulde haue most fauour, in so much, that there arose great mutinies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the King fearing some manslaughter would grow vpon these amorous conuents, and that <hi>Rosamond</hi> like a second <hi>Helena</hi> would cause the ruine of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> thought to preuent it thus: he appointed a day, when all the Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, with the countrie swains of his land, should méet,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18985:11"/>
and there before him take their corporall oath, to be content with that verdicte <hi>Rosamond</hi> should set downe, which amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest them all to choose for hir husband, he to possesse hir, and the rest to departe quiet. Uppon this they were resolued, and sworne, and <hi>Rosamond</hi> set vpon a scaffolde, to take viewe of all, the King charging hir to take one, and, quoth he, if it bée my selfe (swéete heart) I will not refuse thée. Here <hi>Rosamond</hi> dying all hir face with a Uermillion blush, stoode, and viewed all: the King in his pompe commaunded all the Realme, and asked her if she woulde be a Quéene, and weare a Crowne: but she thought ouer high desires had often hard fortunes, and that such as reached at the toppe, stumbled at the roote, that inequalitie in marriage was ofte enemy to Loue, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, howsoeuer yoked, would ouerlooke al beasts but his phere, and therefore the meane was a merry song. Beautie, though she is but a flash, and as soone as that withers, the King is out of his bias, I must be loathed, and he must haue another lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Then she looked lower amongest the Lords, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered how swéete a thing wealth was, that as riches was the mother of pleasure, so want and pouertie was a hatefull thing, yet quoth she, all is but trash, I shall buy Gold too déere, in subiecting my selfe to so high a husband, for if I anger him, then shall he obiect the basenesse of my birth, the newenesse of my parentage, and perhappes, turne me home into my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer estate, then the higher was my seate, the sorer shall bée my fall, and therefore will I content me with meane desires, as I was borne, to lowe fortunes. Thus she surueyed them all, séeing many braue youths, and lusty Caualiers, that were there present for hir loue. But as she looked round about hir, a farre off on a hill sawe she <hi>Alexis</hi> sit with his pipe laide dawne by him, his armes folded, as a man ouergrowen with discontent, and vpon his arme hung a willow garland, as one in extreme dispaire to be forsaken, séeing so many high degrées, to snare the thoughts of his <hi>Rosamond,</hi> his lookes were such as <hi>Troilus</hi> cast towards the Gréekish tents to <hi>Cressida,</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for fauour with teares, and promising constancie wyth coutinuall glaunces, so sate poore <hi>Alexis,</hi> expecting when <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samond</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:18985:11"/>
should breathe out the fatall censure of his dispayring fortunes. <hi>Rosamond</hi> séeing hir louer thus passionate, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him thus. She tolde the King that she had taken a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall view of al the Thessalians, that Loue with hir alluring battes had presented hir with many shews of Beautie, and Fortune had there sought to inuegle hir with the enticing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of dignities: but sir, quoth she, my parents are base, my birth low, and my thoughts not ambitious, I am neither tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with enuie, nor disdaine, as one that can brooke superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours with honor, and inferiours with loue. I am not Eagle flighted, and therefore feare to flie to nigh the Sunne: such as will soare with <hi>Icarus,</hi> fall with <hi>Phaeton,</hi> and desires aboue fortunes, are the forepointers of déepe falles. Loue, quoth she, is a queasie thing, and great Lordes hold it in their eies, not their hearts, and can better drawe it with a penseil then a passion. <hi>Helena</hi> shall be but a hang-by, when age <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beautie is momentanie, and such as haue onely loue in their lookes, let their fancies slip with time, and kéepe a calender of their affection, that as age drawes on, loue runs away. Séeing then high estates haue such slipperie fancies, let honors and dignities goe: <hi>Venus</hi> holdes the néedefull, but not necessarie, and welcome the meane estate, and the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards loues, who count it religion to obserue affection: and therefore séeing I must choose one, and of al these but one, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Well, home went the King with his traine, and <hi>Alexis</hi> a proude man garded with the Shepheards, went towards the house of <hi>Sydaris,</hi> where with great feasting the match was made vp. <hi>Alexis</hi> remaining thus the possessor of the fairest Nymph of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> went to his cottage, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining with himself when the wedding day should be.

thrée of you would vouchsafe so friendly to come and heare a Gentleman and a straunger companie, now I haue no other meanes to requite you, but thankes, and such simple cheare as you haue taken paines to prouide, but where so euer I come I shall make report what fauourable intertainement I haue found in this place, and giue me leaue to seate you. The eldest straying backe a little, before she sate made this reply: I am glad sir if any waies we haue wrought you content, but sir I pray you thinke it not a common fauour that we vse to euerie straunger thus to beare him companie, for our custome is to attend belowe, and to be séene little aboue, especially altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in such equipage: if your fortune be better then the rest, then say you came in a luckie houre: but we are not so blinde but we can discerne of cullours, and though they be both chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stallaine, yet discouer a Diamond from a Saphir, and so sir I will take you this night for mine Hoast, with that she and both her sisters sate downe to supper. <hi>Philador</hi> séeing these, thought on the thrée Goddesses that appeared to <hi>Paris</hi> in the vale of <hi>Ida,</hi> and though he were passing hungry with long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, yet had fedde his eyes with beautie, as well as he did his stomacke with delicates, so that euery sense for supper time was occupied.

Now Gentlewomen doe I finde the olde Prouerbe true, better fill a mans belly then his eye, for your sauorie vituals hath staied my stomacke, but mine eye restlesse, takes such gréedie suruey of your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as I feare by long looking he will surfet, but I am in good hope, if I should fall loue-sicke, I might finde you fauourable Physitions.

               <p>I Hope sir (quoth she) you expect no Rhethoricall insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor no curious <hi>Circumquaque</hi> to fetch my <hi>exordium</hi> in with figures, onely you consider I am a woman, and therfore looke for no more but bare reasons without Sophistrie or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Such Philosophers generally as haue written <hi>de sensu</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other Naturalistes, or such Physitions as by anotomizing haue particularly set downe the partes of man, affirme that the sight is the most pure, quickest, and busiest of all the senses, and therefore most curious in the choice of his obiect: and so precious a sense it is that nature to comfort it made all thinges vpon the face of the greene, because the sight aboue all, delighteth in that cullour. The eye being the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayour of all exteriour obiects, pleaseth himselfe in those that are most beautifull, and coueteth that euery superficies be faire and pleasing, commending it straight to the phantasie as a thing of worth. For in flowers it alloweth with fauour of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18985:15"/>
the fairest as the Carnation, the Rose, the Lyllie, and the Hia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynth. In trées the eye liketh of the tail Cedar, before the low Béech, and prayseth the stature of the Oake, before the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of other plantes. So in stones the Diamond is preferd before the flint, the Emerauld before the Marble, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir highlier estéemed for the hue, then the Porphuer for his hugenesse: and so by consequence in humanie creatures, loue being of all the passions in man the most excellent, allotteth her selfe to the eye of all the partes the most pure, thinking that the fight will be soonest imi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By these premises sir then I inferre that the eye is loues Cator, and who so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his eye contenteth his affectes, then why should not I choose a beautifull man to my husband, whose exquisite perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion euery way may content my fancie, for if the eie finde any blemish in deformitie, straight loue begins to waxe colde, and affection to take his farewell. A beautifull man why he is a pearle in a womans eye, that the lyneaments of his feature, makes her surfet with delight, and there can be no greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then to enioy a beautifull and comely personage: and in my opinion by so much the more are well proportioned men to be loued, by how much the more they excell she deformed. In all things the perfection of the inward qualities is knowen by the exteriour excellence, the rose being the fairest of flowers, hath the most precious sauour, the brightest Diamonde the most déepest operation, the gréenest herbe the most secret ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: nature hath euer with a prouident foresight harboured the most excellent qualities in the most beautifull carkasse: <hi>Diogenes</hi> had a deformed bodie, so had he a crooked minde: <hi>Paris</hi> welfauoured and full of courtesie. <hi>Thirsites</hi> ill shapen, and none (sayth <hi>Homer</hi>) full of more bad conditions, <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> comely and courteous: if then sir, the more a man be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, the more he is vertuous:

The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen séeing the foole caught, thought to be quicke Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and therefore spared for no good cheare, and the more daintely they fared, the more he thanked them, so it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent his young Mistresse, on whose fauour depended his whole felicitie, he was not content in gluttonie to spend his patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but sent for such copesmates as they pleased, who with their false dice, were oft sharers with him of his crownes.

What shall I doe, shall I home? will my father vouchsafe of such a prodigall sonne, who in so short a time hath consumed so large a portion: can he looke on him with fauour that hath committed such folly, or receiue him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his house, that hath despised his counsaile.

Then will I home to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and say to him, father, I haue sinned against heauen and before thée, &amp; am no more worthie to be called thy sonne, make me as one of thy hired seruantes: with this hee fell into bitter teares, and in this resolution continued, and taking leaue of his master hied him home towardes the lande of <hi>Hauilath,</hi> by the way trauersing many Countries, and noting the maners of men, he sawe howe folly had wrapt many in the snares of weomens beauties, amongest the rest one day as he lay in a thicke to shrowde him from the heate of the sunne, hearing a great noyse, he heard the complaint of a forsaken louer, who exclaymed against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crueltie of weomen, that denyed to grant loue for loue, and grew so far into passions, that pulling foorth his rapier, there he resolued both to ende his loue and his life.

Sir, maruaile not that so meane a man hath dared to stay you from so bad a déede, for to this I am compeld by manhood, desperation is a double sinne, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall impenitence hath no remission.

The Gentleman hearing such a sensible induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did straight coniecture that whatsoeuer his present estate was, his nourture had béene good, and there looking him in the face, and leaning on his rapier, he beganne to discourse vnto him how long time he had béene a votarie vnto <hi>Venus,</hi> and a seruant vnto loue, that he was snared in the beautie of a yong Damsell, who the more she perceiued him passionate, the lesse she was pittiful, and by how much the more he sought to shew manifest signes of his affection, by so much the more she made little regard of his fancie: in so much that wearied with loue, and séeing no hope of fauour, he thought with a momentarie death, to ende those passions wherein still to linger were worse then any death. At this <hi>Philador</hi> sell into a great laughter, and after into these tearmes: what (quoth hée) art thou so madde to die for loue, or so fonde to grieue thy selfe at the frowne of a woman. I tell thée sir (quoth he) if thou knewest howe Fortune fauours thée, and howe the starres agrée to make thée happie, thou wouldest count thy selfe not the most miserablest, but the most fortunate of all men: ah my friend diddest thou as well as I knowe the effectes of loue, and the wyles of women, thou wouldest say:
<q>
                     <l>O me felicem quantis me periculis fortunae mea eripuit.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If she be faire whom thou louest, first consider that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is a flower to day fitte for the eye, to morrowe withered and to be cast into the fornace: that loue which growes from such a fading obiect is momentarie, and subiect to euery acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: besides beautie bringes with it suspition, feare, and gelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, séeing euerie mans eye will féede on a faire face, and euerie mans thought will séeke to be partner in thy fancies, and how weake vesselles weomen be, especially if they be beautifull: I referre thée to <hi>Helena</hi> and <hi>Cressida.</hi> But thou saiest she is coy, ah my friend, weomens faces are not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christals of truth,

nor their wordes Gospell, what she hates in outwardly, shée likes inwardly, and what she thrustes away with one finger, she will pull againe with both her handes: but as long as thou fawnest vpon her, she will be froward, but be but a litle absent and she wil wish thy presence: weomens thoughts are like ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies fancies, that will and will not, proffer them meate, and they refuse it, offer it to an other, and they crie after it, so weane thou thy selfe but from hir for a while, and frequent the companie of some other as faire as she, and so eyther shalt thou drawe her on to be fonde, or else by such absence, shake off thine owne follie. But suppose loue and fortune fauour thée, that thou hast her loue, diddest thou knowe what a worlde of woes thou doest enter into by taking a wife, thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest say, fie on loue, and farewell to weomen. Be she neuer so faire, thou shalt finde faultes enough in her face shortly to mislike: and besides, the fairest flower hath oft the most infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious sauour, the Cedar is beautifull, but beares no fruite, the Christolite of an orient hue, yet of a deadly operation: and so in the fairest proportion shalt thou finde oft the least perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the swéetest face, the most preiudiciall qualities. Who was fayrer then <hi>Venus,</hi> but such a wanton as shee would neuer want one. <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> beautifull, but a gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot. I tell thée sir they are sullen, and be <hi>Morosae,</hi> as was <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> the wife of <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> or scouldes as she that ouer-ruled <hi>Socrates,</hi> or froward, as <hi>Marpesia:</hi> deceiptfull, flattering, contentious, sicke with the puffe of euerie winde, and lowring at the shewe of euerie storme. These vices are insident by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though they séeme neuer so vertuous by nourture. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope</hi> had furrowes in her brow, as well as she had dimples in her chinne, <hi>Artemisia</hi> could frowne, as well as shee could smile, and <hi>Lucrece</hi> though she were chast, yet she could chyde. Sir, beléeue me, I speake it by experience, if thou marrie one faire and dishonest, thou weddest thy selfe to a worlde of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if thou marriest one beautifull, &amp; neuer so vertuous, yet thinke this, thou shalt haue a woman, &amp; therfore in despight of Fortune a necessarie euill.
