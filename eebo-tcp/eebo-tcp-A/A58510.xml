            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Introductory Remarks.</head>
            <p>FEW Persons amongst the mighty numbers that have writ, shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>more the Vanity</hi> of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; tho' I hope as few have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it less in <hi>Vain:</hi> The first Design of my putting Pen to Paper, was only to correct the Licentiousness of Paper and Pen, and to supply with a timely animadversion, the Expiration of a temporary Act; 'twas Time sure, 'twas high Time for every Loyal Heart to use his Ink, when they had almost scribled us all into Blood; and to weeld his Pen in the defence of the Government, when the Knife was at our Throats, and their Swords drawn: I know the weakness of the dint of Argument against the power of Steel: And the Impertinence of persuasion where the Law can Compel; but since the Pen has the power of provoking a Rebellion, and that experienced, 'tis as warrantable an experiment to turn its Point; and make the same Wand to lay the Devil that it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and since the <hi>Laws</hi> were almost silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="tcp:46218:4"/>
only with their threatning <hi>Arms:</hi> 'Twas time to animate the dead Letter: To make it know its force and exert its power; and to strengthen a Government: That seem'd but too weak for its self, and unhappily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusted its own security; And that to this purpose the power of the Pen has not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, will appear from these subsequent Observations; Which the comfortable suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess will better justify, than their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rebellion could have been made again Just; and which I'le assure you now 'tis some Comfort to observe: Especially to those that were so bold as to be concerned, that da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to stem the torrent of Schism and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when 'twas but a dangerous Duty; and embarqu'd with the Government, in a storm; when the Waves rose and raged hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly, and the <hi>gathering of the People,</hi> was like the <hi>noise of many Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is observable that upon the first disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the <hi>Westminster Parliament,</hi> that which might be as well called the <hi>healing</hi> one; whose sober debates had superseded the sullen unadvisedness of the subsequent: closed the wounds of an Intestine War, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Government of Church and State; Compact, and firm; for about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years; beyond what the force of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:46218:4"/>
could devide; or Plot and Treachery undermine; That Parliament which they Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, Publisht for Pensionary; only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it would not take pay of the People, where perhaps, they would have been truly paid. That Parliament which with regret they call the <hi>long:</hi> And all honest Hearts resent as too <hi>short;</hi> whose unhappy disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution rivall'd almost the fatality of the late perpetual sitting; whose Prudent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress gave some probability of sounding a Plot: which others inconsiderate rashness hath left without a bottom; if not beyond belief or Foundation, by <hi>proceedings unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable</hi> and bold. 'Tis observable, I say, that then the Serpent of Sedition, that like the Primitive one was curst in the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, forc't to creep on its Belly, and crawle upon the Dust, began first to raise its Venom'd head; and with audacious Libels, spit its Poyson in the very face of Majesty: We know we had Plots before, and that <hi>Oats</hi> his too; not as a Discoverer, but as prime Rebel, and Conspirator; not as an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of Popish ones but a Ring-leader of a Republican: we know we had then too our <hi>Tongues</hi> that were hanged for <hi>Treason;</hi> as well as those that could since get Traytors Hang'd: yet still midst all those unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:46218:5"/>
attempts to Rebel, Sedition never grew fo much and succeeded, that blessed Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of near twenty years quiet, tho oft endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be interrupted, never afforded so much <hi>Treason</hi> from the Press, as for the last <hi>five</hi> years has been Publisht in their Prints; Libels lookt as if they had been Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed for a <hi>Lustrum;</hi> and as if the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Printing Act had expired seasonably, 'twas never <hi>resolved</hi> amongst all their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to be revived; 'twas opposed even when moved, unanimously, that <hi>Treason</hi> too might be Publisht with a <hi>Nemine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente;</hi> 'twas presumed, I suppose, the better Pen-men were their own; and I grant them the more pestilent; that could spread their Contagion as fast as the Plague, and to the Monarchy as mortal; for almost <hi>five</hi> years the Distemper was Epidemick; and the State <hi>Empericks</hi> had poysoned the body Politick almost beyond the Antidote of true Medicine and Art, it Sympathis'd with Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the Natural, almost incurable; reigned most populously in Towns and Cities; and turned every Corporation into a politick <hi>Pest-House:</hi> Appeals, <hi>vox Patriae,</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England;</hi> Fundamental Rights, were exposed in Capital Letters upon every Stall; and that dedicated to Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
<pb facs="tcp:46218:5"/>
and some Penn'd by them too; for the Information of the People; or in a less prepostorous Phrase for their Confusion; Sedition seemed to be countenanced with suffrages, and seconded, as they thought, with the supream power of the Nation. They expected Treason should have been enacted for Law; and Laws repealed that had declared <hi>High Treason.</hi> 'Tis almost prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous and incredible, tho' unhappily too true, that more Sedition was fomented from the <hi>discovery</hi> of this <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> than all the <hi>Jesuits</hi> in Hell could have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, while yet <hi>undiscovered,</hi> we forged out one anothers ruin from the very delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and to fall with harder fate the less to be lamented; by our selvs, and just escapt the <hi>storm</hi> we strove to perish more miserably in the <hi>Port.</hi> Such was the state of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, when some of our Loyal Hearts first ventured to stem the Tide, the fierce influx of an Impetuous Rebellion; that like a true torrent came rolling on with noise and clamor; and threatned ruin from afar: The first that opposed the Great <hi>Goliahs</hi> of their Cause, that defyed too even the Armies of the living God; and the strength of his Anointed; was he who from his Youth had serv'd the Crown, with his Pen as well as
<pb facs="tcp:46218:6"/>
his Sword; and before him too did their Dagon fall; one whom they had designed formerly for a Victim, when they sacrificed, their Prince; whom Providence reserved for their Scourge, and for which since some of them have publickly curst its dispensation, Libelled him in their Emblematical Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, (in which, I consess, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spared their King) breaking his Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like a Dog, and running for his Life and Neck; and that by the very same hands of Villains that had forfeited their own to the Government, and were afterward faster noosed.</p>
            <p>How Zealous were our Popular <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots</hi> against the least animadversion that was made on the most audacious Libel, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Judges themselvs arraigned, for dering to execute those Laws, the meanest villain, could daily dare to violate: How curious to enquire for the least accusation against the worthy Person above described, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because he dared to do his duty; when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> dangerous to do so: It was a pretty sort of expedient, tho the most absurd Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, for the countenancing of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish-Plot,</hi> to bring every one concerned in it, that would not swallow the whole <hi>Mass</hi> of it raw, crude and undigested; and that before
<pb facs="tcp:46218:6"/>
they had cook'd it up with Nartative too; while their <hi>Protestant</hi> rashness at the same time precipitated them but into a <hi>Romish</hi> Doctrin, of Resignation to their Senate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a Church, and believing their house of <hi>Commons</hi> with a Faith implicite; yet this was all done too, and this Gentleman whose Writings only declared him a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in all Ages, it has been allowed to doubt; and by the Great <hi>Des Cartes</hi> the wisest Philosopher as a step to the knowledg of the Truth.) Him 'twas expedient to <hi>Metamorphose,</hi> with the power of an Oath; which was then Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, from an avowd <hi>Protestant,</hi> into a profest <hi>Papist:</hi> I use that poetical Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, because they might as well have sworn him through all the transformations of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> into <hi>Bull, Bear; or Dragon,</hi> born a prosest Son of the Church, conformed through all his Life, to all its Ceremonies; a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for her with his Pen, and with it a publisht Enemy to <hi>Rome,</hi> even in his own Works; having about him Eyes, Nose, Ears: And from Head to Foot all the true shapes of a <hi>Protestant</hi> Humane Creature; but the Spell of <hi>Affidavit</hi> beyond that of <hi>Circe,</hi> turned Him all into the Beast of

            <p>I thank him kindly for his Bit and Knock, which had their Villanies succeeded the one would scarce have been a Morsel of Bread, the other a good thump with a Stone, or their <hi>sanctifyed Flayle;</hi> but there was none found <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>framing</hi> it; nor indeed like to be, when the Jury themselves were <hi>associated</hi> against the Government, and transcribed the very Crime of their Criminal into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; That Jury who by an early Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Guilt, might perhaps have saved the blood of some, their own Darlings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had been so deeply tainted with the Venom of that old Serpent; whom now his

that by <hi>Bernadiston;</hi> that shamm'd off that Treason on the Parliament, as he would have done since the Plot it self on the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrers:</hi> And for which we have Reason to thank him, and not his House of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> It could not have been believed that such a thing could have been offerea in such an Houorable Assembly, had it not been kindly insinuated by their Civil Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but then the Gentleman would have us believe for the sake of his Innocent Jury. They never heard of or saw the thing, till Printed by the Loyal Stationers with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Jigg by Joul,</hi> (as his clumsy Phrases have it) but did ever a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings at the</hi> Old-Bayly. p. 14, 15.</note> Ass forge such falsehood in the face of the Sun, against Evidence as clear as the Lamp of Heaven it self: When the same to a syllable was all read to them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Court, the same that himself insists to be Printed in Collums with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</p>
            <p>I have but one thing more to observe upon him; (if any thing he has said can be worth Observation) not so much in my own defence, as of that which I shall ever be ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend with my last Breath, and my latest Blood; The <hi>Church</hi> whose Ministerial, and sacred Officers, I am sorry should suffer
<pb facs="tcp:46218:13"/>
               <hi>through the Ignorance of such a Sot, and for the sake of one so little related to their Function, and so much their Friend, whom the Wretch Libels thus:</hi> Why he should Hyperbolize in such an hot headed Stile, &amp;c. no Reason can be given, unless it were some young Crape-Gown Levite, that had a mind to be dabling in Gall, and Ink; of those there are two, for among that sort of People there are many for want of Education, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapart to others, and for want of what in them should be most Conspicuous, good Example, and out of a Cruel and <hi>Bonner-like</hi> Disposition, most Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably, uncharitable: And then in the next Paragraph, calls it Pulpit-Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and Crape-Gown Extasie.</p>
            <p>The Warmness of the Stile, which he the more furious Fool is pleased to call hot, certainly was warrantable. When their Zeal was burning, the Fire kindled; and they had already put the Nation in a Flame: When they were ready to turn our flourishing <hi>Sion</hi> again into a perfect <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> a Land of Confusion and Captivity; When in the very Literal Words they cryed <hi>down with her even to the Ground;</hi> Would they have us verify the Desolation
<pb facs="tcp:46218:13"/>
of it too, by hanging our Harps upon the Willows, having only recourse to sadness for our assistance, and only quench their aspiring Flames in our humble Tears? They can't have recourse to Moderation, and pray'r; to avert those Foolish Fears of an easie Government; but Burlesque the very Bible, traduce the Doctrines of all Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christianity, for to warrant an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate</hi> Rebellion; and can such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Souls tax us for want of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> in the <hi>Defence</hi> of an Establisht <hi>Government,</hi> that most <hi>immoderately</hi> blaspheme God and their King for the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining</hi> it?</p>
            <p>The fixing of his pitiful and pedantick Terms on the Venerable Gown explains suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the Veneration he has for the Church, the dulness of his Sense and Stile betrays his very dissenting from it, and his Ignorance the best Evidence of his Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; 'tis the best Argument of his absurdity to talk of their want of being well Educated, who have such Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, so well endowed, for a learned and liberal Education.</p>

            <p>The design of this ensuing Treatise is to examine all those sophisticated drugs of false Opinions; and how they have been continually rectifyed and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with right Reason and Truth; the Treasonable positions of <hi>Buchanan, Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thali, Dolman</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> those Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick and most damnable Quacks of the Kingdom; have been by many, and that by most elaborate pieces consuted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond answer and reply, unless from such as are as much beyond Conviction: The Latter of which, in spight of all his smooth Tropology, the gaudy grinding of his words, had his damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines

And truly in the first place all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians agree that our <hi>English</hi> History was uncertain before the coming of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and without doubt we had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to want the Tradition of it; when needs we must, when we had nothing of Learning or Knowledg to deliver it down; unless we would imagin the silly simple Souls could have left ustheir own Skins for a Chronicle; and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the painted Constitution of their Government in the Colours and Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks of their Bodys. But since that Author owns, and that from the good Authority he quotes, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it was uncertain; but that they <note place="margin">Strabo, Tacitus, Caes. Com.</note> were subject to many <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> which last Expression I fancy was his own, to make it savour more of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick:</hi> which I am confident they were then as Ignorant of as we, truly now, of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Oppression,</hi> which I gather partly from the Constitutions of all Nations at this time truly Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: Since both the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> of the uncivilized World confirms the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Hypothesis, the most probable Conjecture, which is all at this present governed by its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Monarchs,</hi> and

puny <hi>Princes,</hi> tho' some greater <hi>Empires</hi> too than any of ours in <hi>Europe,</hi> no small Argument for the Divine Right of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> by its being so generally embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced only by the light of Nature, whose Creation was, whose Subsistence is the sole Care of Divinity it self.

            <p>The Druids, as may be gathered out of <hi>Caesars Commentaries,</hi> had in those Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant days all the Learning, and the Law; But too little alass to let us know whether their <hi>Princes</hi> were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute <note place="margin">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46218:22"/>
right of Sovereignty, when only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated to obey; far from transmitting to us the frame of their <hi>Monarchy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they had known the <hi>Egyptian</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of writing on the Barks of Trees, and made their Libraries of the Groves in which they dwelt: The <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Monarchs</hi> of their Times were wont to frequent those pious places for Worship and Adoration; and had a Veneration too without doubt, for those reverend Bards that sacrificed; but were far I believe from subjecting their Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to that Divinely <hi>Pagan,</hi> tho' then the sacred Jurisdiction; tho' 'tis report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that upon <hi>Caesar's</hi> invading them, the very power of Life, and Death, and the Punishment for all manner of offences; was in their sacred Breast, and such as would not stand to their award, were forbidden their Sacrifices: which Interdiction then was the same, I believe, in effect, with the modern power of our Church to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate; but besides another reason, and the best too, why we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing delivered from those sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Religion and Law; why the History of those times is still uncertain,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46218:23"/>
and was never transmitted, is because they were expressly forbidden to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing to Posterity, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to Books and Letters, tho some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that sort of Communicating, must be supposed by that Inhibition to have been Imparted to them from the <hi>Egyptians, Greeks, Romans,</hi> those <hi>Eastern</hi> Climes through which Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Letters had their first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress.</p>
            <p>But whether their Ignorance, or such a prohibition were the Causes why nothing descends to us of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our old <hi>Britains,</hi> 'tis granted by all, and by this Author himself, that it was <hi>Monarchical,</hi> that Kings Reigned here <hi>ab origine,</hi> if not <hi>Jure divino;</hi> Though I look on their Antiquity no small Argument of their Divine Right, and for the probability of their Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Succession, which I insinuated above, can, I confess, since we are so much in the <hi>dark,</hi> be only guessed by the <hi>light</hi> of Reason, and that I shall make to warrant the Conclusion, from the present Practise and Constitution of all barbarous Nations, where the next of blood still mounts the Throne, unless
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46218:23"/>
interrupted by Rebellion, and that's but the best Argument of our Author for the Power of his Parliaments; and if only for this <hi>certain</hi> Reason, we have more Authority to conclude it was then Haereditary, then he only from the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of the Story, has to conclude it otherwise.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I see no reason why his Sentiments should determine other Peoples thoughts, and why we should not think that the following Heptarchy of the Saxons, (tho they had their seven Kings) yet still might agree in one rule of Succession, nay tho their Laws were so different too as he would insinuate, which is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to suspect neither; for they being all one Nation, and then but just called from their home by our <hi>British King Vortiger</hi> for his assistance: may probably be supposed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the Main the general Rules and Laws of their own Countrey; tho when divided into those seven King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms they might also make a sort of private by-Laws according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Emergences of particular affairs that occurred in their several Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46218:24"/>
Can he prove that the Succession of the Saxons in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was not Hereditary, when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited in their small Dukedom of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein;</hi> and that consequently they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the same sort of Election, in their new acquired Government here, that they left in their own at home? this he does not undertake to suggest, because not able to prove, there having been a probable <hi>Monarchy</hi> all along He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, if Paternal Right was wont to descend so: for that is proved by most learned Pens, and these Saxons are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have been the relict of the race of <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> that inhabited that <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonese,</hi> so called from its Inhabitants, of whom <hi>Gomer</hi> the Son of <hi>Japhet</hi> was the Original <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ever was their Government before, he allows them to have set up seven <hi>Monarchies</hi> here: only can't think they <hi>agreed</hi> in one <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Succession, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause governed</hi> by <hi>different Laws,</hi> which tho granted, is so ridiculous an Infinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that greater Differences, atpresent, between greater Kingdoms and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, far more remote in Place, far more different in Religion, contradicts the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46218:24"/>
Suggestion; who for the most part, now over the whole World, agree in an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Succession to the Crown; and the Argument would have been as strong, and as apparently foolish (if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd it for a Specimen of his folly,) that since <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain, Sweeden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> are govern'd by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Laws, we can't imagin them to have one <hi>sort</hi> of Succession: Which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rebound of his own Pen wounds his Cause, more than any direct stroak of his Adversaries, for since we see those more different, more distant Nations agree in one Rule, 'tis sure a Logical Inference <hi>a Majori,</hi> that those that were <hi>less</hi> different might.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Changes</hi> and <hi>Consusions</hi> of those Times, which he urges as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of their uncertain Succession: that is in effect, his very <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega;</hi> and his <hi>praefatory</hi> Suggestion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved through his whole <hi>History,</hi> that in times of <hi>Confusions</hi> and <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Succession is <hi>uncertain;</hi> and so is all Property, and Common Right, all <hi>meum,</hi> and <hi>tuum;</hi> all that the Law of God or Man can make his own.</p>

But as obscure as he makes our Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession before the <hi>Romans</hi> came, 'tis not so <hi>dark</hi> and unintelligible, but that we may gather <hi>light</hi> enough from it to have been <hi>Hereditary.</hi> We won't rely on the <note place="margin">How in his Historical reface to <hi>Stow's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for such a story ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all our antient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, for its Authority, and <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Modern.</note> Fable of <hi>Brute,</hi> and the Catalogue of near 68 Kings, that are said to have Reigned Successively here before the coming of the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet allowing it an entire Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we may draw from it this Moral, at least, that a Fabulous Tradition some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times has somewhat of reality for its ground, as the patching up <hi>a Centaure, a Chymera</hi> with a thought, results from several Objects that are simply real abstracting from the compounded Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And tho we might not have 68 Kings successive before the <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, yet that there were several ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and he owns; and I conclude Hereditary, from the common rule in all Barbarous Nations, when ever disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, in which the further back we run in the History of the Old World, the more we are confirmed; as also the more forward we go in discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the New.</p>

            <p>And now we'l begin our <hi>Remarks</hi> on the <hi>Norman</hi> Line, upon which the very first words of <hi>Baker</hi> are these, <hi>There were six Dukes of</hi> Normandy, <hi>in</hi> France, <hi>in a direct Line, succeeding from Father to Son,</hi> and yet this Inquisitive <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch-maker,</hi> lays his mighty stress, his <hi>weighty Consideration</hi> on the single Suggestion of Duke <hi>William's</hi> being a reputative Bastard; be it so, have we not here the Majority of six to one, that succeeded, <hi>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46218:34"/>
Dutchy of <hi>Normandy?</hi> And therefore must we have <hi>another</hi> Natural, and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate <hi>Duke</hi> to wear the Crown of <hi>England?</hi> or was the Suggestion only made because they had such a Duke in Readiness, that had already run the Popular Gantlet of Ambition; and been sooth'd into the Prospect of a Scepter, with the false Tongues of Flatterers and Sycophants? or else was the Nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Normans</hi> to supersede the Fundamental Laws of our Nation; And our <hi>England</hi> a Dependent, a Tributary to that Crown <hi>before</hi> the Conquest? these Paradoxes must be reconciled by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle before such a ridiculous Instance can pass for Reason, or Common Sense, or vindicate the false suggester from Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Impertinence.</p>
            <p>But even here too his <hi>very Assertion</hi> fails him, and this Pretender to <hi>Truth</hi> both abuses his Reader with <hi>false</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and telling a Lye: For this Duke <hi>William,</hi> tho' a Bastard Born, was not <hi>illegitimated,</hi> so as to be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Crown, and <hi>incapacitated</hi> for Inheritance; for it appears, as <hi>Baker</hi> says by many Examples, that Bastardy was then no Bar to Succession, and by

            <p>But tho this might be a warrantable <hi>Donation,</hi> yet you may observe (as if the <hi>donor</hi> had not been in it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Just) so it never at all prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Donee;</hi> the very Gist it self, like <hi>Pandora's</hi> Box, was most fatal to those that received it; a Vice like Virtue is oft a Punishment to it self as that other a reward; the not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Crown to descend by entail; <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed</hi>

            <p>The last <hi>remark</hi> I shall make on this Mans Reign is, but what this malicious Historian has made very <hi>Remarkable,</hi> and that is from an Author that he cites, for saying that this <hi>Robert had discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much of the Cruelty of Disposition, of his averseness to the</hi> English <hi>Nation, and his proneness to revenge,</hi> and this Character must be most Emphatically <hi>markt</hi> out, that they might not miss of his meaning <hi>another</hi> Duke; a Prince to whose Valour and Conduct the Wretch ows his Freedom from a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Yoke, and the Nation her safety and security, and so far does his malice transport the Sot that he falsisies for it the very <hi>Latin</hi> he translates, <hi>Perversus, contrarius et Innaturalis:</hi> He makes cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty <note place="margin">Vid H. de <hi>Knyght</hi> C, 8. 2374.</note> of Disposition, and for <hi>Proneness to revenge,</hi> not one Syllable in the whole Citation, and then besides the words of the Author he cites are the same <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi> which this <hi>Henry</hi> the first used against his Brother, when he makes a Speech to his Nobles, to make him odious, from whom this Author <hi>I believe

            <p>The best remarks that can be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the following Reign of <hi>Harry</hi> the Seventh, are to be found in the Lord <hi>Bacon's</hi> History, the best account of that King, and he tells us he had no less then three Titles to the Crown whatever that <hi>Italian</hi> States-man <hi>Commines</hi> could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to the contrary; first his Title in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> whom he was resolv'd to marry; secondly that of the Line of <hi>Lancasters</hi> long disputed both by <hi>Plea</hi> and <hi>Arms;</hi> thirdly, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest by his own: But the Learned Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an observes the <hi>first</hi> was look't on the <hi>fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi> and <hi>Yorks</hi> line, been always lik't as the <hi>best</hi> Plea in the Crowns descent, and for Confirmation of it the Learned Lord tells us, that this <hi>Henry</hi> knew the Title

            <p>I shall observe another Historical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that a true <hi>lineal</hi> discent was then
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46218:66"/>
taken for the best title, and even in those times had the greatest Influence, which was the Lord <hi>Stanley's</hi> Case, who tho the very Person that plac'd the Crown on this Princes <hi>head,</hi> yet suffer'd the loss of <note place="margin">Vid <hi>Bacon</hi> Hist.</note> his own only for saying somewhat that savoured of his kindness to the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; <hi>and that if he was sure the Children of</hi> Edward <hi>were alive he would not bear Arms against them;</hi> so mightily did the sense of the <hi>right</hi> blood prevail with him that he sacrified all his <hi>own</hi> for it, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than recant what he so well resolv'd, seem'd no way sollicitous for his Life.</p>
            <p>But that which this Historian might have observ'd too, in this Reign as a discouragement to the designs of some of their popular Patriots then afoot, when he pen'd this his presumptuous piece, was the ill success that two several impostures met with in their pretensions to a Crown to which they were not <hi>

            <p>Lastly, I shall conclude my remarks upon this Kings Reign, with an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion upon a Paragraph or two
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46218:66"/>
that conclude his piece, very pertinent to this place, since it relates to the times of which we treat; and that is the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Judges, upon the Case of this their King; that the Descent of the Crown, purged all his defects, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder. This their opinion he refutes <note place="margin">Brief Hist. <hi>p. 17.</hi>
               </note> as <hi>Frivolous, Extrajudicial,</hi> and here <hi>Impertinent;</hi> but I hope to show this Point a most material one, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to be a good Judgment, and their reply much to the present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>First, sure it was a matter and that of a high Nature to know how he was qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd to sit in the House, that was to preside in it as the head: And tho he might in some sense be said to have won the Crown with <hi>Arms,</hi> yet he knew it would wear much Better, sit much Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, if setled, and establish't according to Law; and tho a Conquerer that has the Sword in his hand, can soon capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate himself to sway the Scepter; yet he'l soon find the most regular Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings tend most to the Establishment of his Reign; this made <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh who had a Triple Plea for the Crown, and that one by discent from the <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:46218:67"/>
consult his Oracles of the Law, how far an Attainder past in the Reign ofthe <hi>Yorks,</hi> would still taint his Blood; and make it less Inheritable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, their Resolution that all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding defects were purg'd in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, was a Judgment both equitable, and reasonable; for 'twas sure but equal that an Heir to whom an Inheritance and that ofa Crown was allowed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend should be qualify'd to take too; for if he was a King, no Bill of Attainder could touch him, that was past too when he was none: And if he was no King, <note place="margin">Vid <hi>Dyer</hi> H. <hi>7.</hi> f. <hi>59.</hi> The King is the head of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons but Members. So no more Parliament without a King, than a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a head. It is no Stat. if a King assent not to it. <hi>12.</hi> H. <hi>7.20.</hi>
               </note> all the concurrence of the Lords and Commons cou'd never have made him an Act for his being so; there being no Royal Authority, to pass it into Law, and nothing by the very constitution of our Government can be made a Law without; so that such a resolution cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was highly reasonable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, that that should purge its own defects which no power had perfection anough to purge; wou'd he have a King pass an Act with his two Houses for the reversal of his own Attainder, or the two Houses reverse the Attainder of their King? If the first, the allowing him to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46218:67"/>
pass such an Act, supersedes the end for which it should be past, and makes him <hi>de Facto</hi> capable whom they would ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate, if he allows the Latter then he must an <hi>Interregnum</hi> too; extinguish that Monarchy for a while, of which the very Maxim says the Monarch can't dye, and place that Supream power in the <hi>People,</hi> which all our Fundamental Laws have put in the King.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this Resolution is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the present purpose to which 'tis commonly now apply'd; and that is the <hi>Bill of Exclusion:</hi> But his passion, and prejudice; would not permit him to Examin the little difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p>For certainly that ability that can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge any attainder, is as efficacious for the voiding and nulling any Bill that shall hinder the descent for a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, would have been but a Bill or an Act of the House for disabling the next Heir; And an Attainder can do the same; and is as much the Houses Act; and to distinguish that in an Exclusion the Discent it self is prevented by a Law, makes just no difference, for whoever is Attainted has his Discent prevented
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46218:68"/>
by a Law too, and that antecedently also, before the Descent can come to purge him; so that they only differ in this formal sort of Insignificancy, In an Exclusion, the Discents prevention would be the sole Subject of the Bill, in an Attainder it is by Consequence and Common Law prevented, and so the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability being but the same in both, the defects by the same means may and must be purged.</p>

Case as an Attainder; but was Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the rest, and told that he was not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, but Disabled to hold the Crown, but even that that was void assoon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46218:68"/>
as he came again to wear it; and seem to conclude that then <hi>à fortiori</hi> that an Attaindere would be purg'd away by the Descent; and sure if this was then Law, and that even for the Line of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> who had <hi>Defects</hi> of <hi>Title</hi> to be purg'd besides of <hi>tainted blood:</hi> 'Tis strange to me why a <hi>York</hi> now, and such an one too; in whom both those so long disputed Titles Terminate and Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, should be <hi>Disabl'd</hi> for ever by that Expedient, which was resolv'd unable to prevent the Succession so long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</p>
            <p>For Argument that an Attainder hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Crowns Discent, has this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptious Interpreter of the Law brought the most impertinent piece of Application, that the defect of sense could suggest, and so has as little reason, as <note place="margin">Brief <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </note> Truth, to tell us that this Judges Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution on Attainder, is not to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose pertinent, for that a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is insufficient to purge attainted Blood, he cites the Sense of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Learned advice that was given him to send his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> Because King <hi>John's</hi> Blood was corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but he might as well have told us
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46218:69"/>
because <hi>John</hi> is said to make over his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the <hi>Moor,</hi> we are all now Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the King of <hi>Morocco;</hi> the true reason of the <hi>French</hi> mans sending of his Son, is what will at any time incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Crowns Discent, and that is the Rebellion of the Subjects, and yet those very Barons that Rebell'd never insisted on his corruption of Blood, never made it so much as a Plea for their Rebellious Insurrection; nay themselves thought him so far from being disabl'd by it, that they prefer'd him even to the very right Blood, which was incorrupted in his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Arthur;</hi> but allowing it then Law, this resolution that such Corruption is purg'd, was made long since, and must now be as Legal, tho the Contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been never so much Law, so that here he has only taken the pains to be impertinent and that too for the tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Lye.</p>
            <p>But as his Villanous heart, had falsely forg'd before that the Learned in King <hi>John's</hi> time invited <hi>Lewis</hi> over only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they thought his Attainder had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitated him to take the Crown: when all the while they made nothing but their <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46218:69"/>
the pretence for their Rebellion, and would have been certainly glad of such a suggestion, when they were so well Resolv'd to Rebel, (tho I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Inviting in of the <hi>French-man</hi> rather as a Retribution of a Remarkable Providence, that retaliated on his head the same sufferance from his Rebel Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which his Soveraign and own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had suffered from himself as Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious a Son, who sided against <hi>Henry</hi> the Second with <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> the Succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssor of a <hi>Lewis,</hi> as these did with a <hi>Lewis</hi> a <hi>Philips</hi> Successor.) With the same falsehood and forgery would he have the world believe that the Line of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was so long approv'd, only because that of <hi>Yorks</hi> was Attainted; which when purg'd in Parliament, he says, they then presently forsook the <hi>Lancastrian:</hi> But if he pleases to Consult my Lord <note place="margin">History <hi>H. 7.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Bacon</hi> he'l find that Learned Historian tell him another tale; and that the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi> Line was always the less esteem'd by the people, and how the Parliament could purge the Duke of <hi>York</hi> only by declaring him Heir Apparent I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; for whatever can be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably past by a Parliament to warrant

Obedience, must be what is past into an Act too; unless one of their <hi>Order'd</hi> and <hi>Resolv'd</hi> shall resolve it self into a Law, for such a Statute must, (tho it were for the declaring an Heir Apparent to the Crown,) have the Royal Sanction of some Lawful King, which could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be Consistent here, with this their most inconsistent Declaration; for the granting the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to be their Heir Apparent, in the same Breath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth an Usurper; and the very words that declar'd <hi>York</hi> an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Heir, made him <hi>de facto</hi> their Lawful King; for they must either allow that he was the Crowns Heir, and then that had devolv'd to him long before by Blood and Inheritance from <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Elder Brother to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> from whom the <hi>Lancasters</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or else they declared their <hi>Lineal, Lawful</hi> King, an <hi>Intruders, Vsurpers</hi> Heir it is an unavoidable Dilemma; if the first, then an acknowledgment, of an <hi>irreparable wrong,</hi> done to their Lineal Soveraign that had an <hi>unquestionable right,</hi> if the Latter, then most absur'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory in making him an Heir to the Crown from that <hi>Henry,</hi> that himself
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46218:70"/>
never had the least Title to the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>From whence I conclude, that any such supposed <hi>Act</hi> (and it must be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that if not an Act that then it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing too,) that purged <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> from his Attainder, could never have the <hi>Royal</hi> Assent, unless most absurdly from one that was no King; for either it must be past by <hi>Henry</hi> the fixth, and then the thing he past un-King'd him; or else by the Duke the declar'd Heir, and then but a suppos'd Subject in the very Declaration, or rather a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and allow'd King in admitting him to pass a Bill, and so superseded such a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and Declaratory Act.</p>
            <p>Lastly, even in this very point the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Author supersedes the pains of any Loyal pen for the Confutation of the false Position he would prove, and in the very same Paragraph baffles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to prevent an Answer, and tells us that Richard <hi>Duke of</hi> York's <hi>Corruption</hi>

forc't to fly to the Resolution of Traytors for the defence of the Treason; and proves that the Crowns Discent does not purge Attainder, because this Parliament of an absolute Usurper, rather a pack of Rebels then a convention of States, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd it so.

            <p>But this President if allow'd, would still to the present purpose be as Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as 'tis Treasonable; for the Question is what was Law since <hi>H.</hi> 7. time, and he Labours to Confute it with what was said some three years before; and to Bassle the <hi>Resolution</hi> of all the <hi>Judges</hi> of the

               <hi>Edward</hi> of our Kings took this power upon him is utterly false, from these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral instances. First the very first King of his name, in the Saxon succession, left it so to his Son to succeed: And <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi>

I am so far of this Authors opinion, that I believe it was no way warrantable, but never the sooner for his Parliaments settlement, had it not been at last upon the right Heirs; for tho those Princes of ours here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore took upon them to leave Succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssors by <hi>Will,</hi> they still nominated those that by <hi>Blood</hi> were to succeed without such a <hi>Nomination,</hi> so that the bequest was more matter of Form, then Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; only to let the Subjects know whom they look't upon to have the <hi>right</hi> of Succession, rather than to superadd any thing of <hi>more</hi> right, and that's the reason (or ought to be) that we properly call the next in Blood the <hi>Kings Successor,</hi> but the <hi>Crowns Heir.</hi>

the <hi>Soveraign</hi> Power of <hi>England,</hi> is not in <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> because <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> are not all <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> may not our Monarchy be call'd <hi>Mixt</hi> in Opposition to its being <hi>Absolute,</hi> and Tyrannical; without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a meer <hi>Hotch-potch,</hi> that if our King will have any thing of his right of a Soveraign power, he must put it in Medley with that of his Subject, as our Sisters are oblig'd in <hi>Co-parcenary:</hi> But tho he take his Treasonable Maxim, for <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> without shewing the least <hi>Law</hi> or Reason, I shall shew him from all of them, that it is both <hi>Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Illegal,</hi> and a <hi>Lye.</hi>

            <p>THIS <hi>Disingenuous</hi> Author, with his Hypocritical <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> has just done her as much <hi>Mischief,</hi> as that of Bishop <hi>Jewels sincere</hi> one, did her <hi>Good.</hi> That pious Prelate with his unanswerable <hi>Arguments,</hi> had defended her against all the powers of the <hi>Pope;</hi> and this with his Argument, which he <hi>Answers himself,</hi> has made her all <hi>Popish.</hi> Never did an Hypocrite pretend to so <hi>much</hi> Candor, and Sincerity, that had so <hi>little</hi> Shadow for such a Pretention: His Falshoods look'd as if he designed, and thought, he could have imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Government and his God; and,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:46218:193"/>
in spight of Providence, to have secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself from the Justice of that which was <hi>established;</hi> and at the same time made sure of the favor of those that were for undermining it. The one was to be blinded with his being Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Bishop's Right:</hi> The other imposed upon with his Penning the <hi>Postscript.</hi> But however he deceives himself, the Almighty will still make good his own Word, That he won't be <hi>mock'd.</hi> He has denounced express Judgment against a double Heart, and the Nation now deserv'd Justice, To such a Sycophant. With what Face can such a Rumper tell us in the tayl of his Postscript, that no <hi>Passion</hi> or prejudice perverts him against the State of the Kingdom; when all know that it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus established, not only lost him a place in the Law; but disappointed him of being an <hi>Irish</hi> Judge; and thus the virulency of his <hi>Pen,</hi> betrays <hi>the truth</hi> of His <hi>Passion,</hi> which he would A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologize against with a lye, and that it can rise as high as any Furies, for as deep a resentment of an esteemed Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; when the Government all the while was far from doing him any <hi>wrong:</hi> But
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:46218:194"/>
if it should meet with him now, I dare swear would do him <hi>Right:</hi> And this is altogether Reasonable the World should know, that the best of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Male-contents, tho' they strive to palliate their Passions and Prejudices against their Governors, with a show of being impartial and indifferent; that 'tis but a meer shadow to cloud the Fire that Glows within, while truly still im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, impatient, and impossible to be govern'd, and that those that pretend but with Moderation to discommend many things in our <hi>Monarchy,</hi> have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, but the meer Malice and Spirit of <hi>Republicans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this will appear from his very first Paragraph that provokes my Pen, He lets us know that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is like to fall into that of <hi>Rome,</hi>

That is, (as he must mean by Consequence) for maintaining a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right.</hi> For to this purpose (says he, (Sir <hi>Robert Filmer's</hi> Books were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and others for the same. And truly, I am so far of this Gentleman's

Opinion, that the good man the Pope may very likely call it a very foolish thing, and laugh at the Doctrine of any Kings Divinity, that endeavors to set himself above all Kings, so that unkind even to himself, and his Friends, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters; he unawares ties them up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Tenents of the rankest Jesuits of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors with the self same Arguments and Objections, to set up the <hi>popular</hi> Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, that those Impostures do the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal.</hi> But first only let me beg a postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or two from him that pretends to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> which an <hi>Infidel</hi> or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> won't deny, much less then one that has the Bible, for an asserting it's belief, <hi>viz.</hi> 1.

No Humane Beings, but such as desire to live like Beasts, can well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, 3.

So that taking it for granted which must be, that a power of Government is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us here <hi>below</hi> by the God that Governs this and all <hi>above,</hi> and this so communicated, remains still <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> whereever it is lodged, the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is reduced to this, Whether it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to a Multitude as many, or a Soveraign <hi>Sole,</hi> whether with their St. <note n="†" place="margin">1.

That this Divine Power and Right is in Kings, he has superseded my Labor to prove, by letting us know 'tis the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of most of our Orthodox Divines, and their Sentiments are sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the point, especially in Matters to be proved from the Bible, whose best Explanation one would think must be found amongst those whose Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is to expound, unless you would imagine the Bishops the better <hi>Readers</hi> upon the <hi>Statute.

'tis but an Irreligious Presumption to think the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty should punish his chosen, only because they did not Rebel against his Anointed; when that Rebellion even by the same sacred Text is declared worse than Witchcraft; and that primitive one of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Accomplices was so remarkably punish'd: But I know these Authors will tell us, That <hi>Eliah</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> notwithstanding that <hi>Ahab</hi> their King countenanced their Idolatry; That <hi>Jehoida</hi> the Priest set <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> on the Throne, and not only rebelled against his Mother <hi>Athalia,</hi> but destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to restore the Worship she had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish'd: But in both these Instances they may do well to consider: 1.

does not the Text tell us upon these very Occasions always, <hi>That the Word of God came to his Servants:</hi> 2. <hi>Athalia</hi> here, whom the People resisted, deposed, and slew, had no Title to the Crown, but what she waded through in the Blood of all the seed Royal: Religion was not there the rise of the Rebellion, but the right of the Crown's Heir, which was in the young King <hi>Joas,</hi> whom they set on the Throne of his Father <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and for which Heavens had preserved him; notwithstanding the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In the fourth place they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that even their own Arguments make all such Applications to all ourpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Kings altogether impertinent: For these <note n="*" place="margin">Junius.

and Acts of State, and for that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to the good Author of the <hi>Right of the Commons Asserted,</hi> tho I should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approve of such an undertaking, when endeavored to be done from the tracing the dark and obscure tracts of Antiquity, and the Authority of a <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> than the single Assertion of a <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and the mere Maxims of some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Democraticks, that have no other Foundation for their Establishments, than the new Notions of their Rebellious Authors, and that <hi>ipse dixit</hi> of such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Dogmatists: But I am satisfied too, that this Gentleman who has laboured so much in vindicating the Commons Antiquity, and their constituting an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Parliaments, did design in it much more an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of our Antient Monarchy, and the Prerogative of the Crown, than a mere clearing the dark foot-steps of our Old Chronicle, and a real defence of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and the Truth: And this is too clearly to be prov'd from the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pen-man's, <hi>P-tyts</hi> own Papers, that were publish'd at such a time, when there was no great need of such an <hi>Asserting</hi> the Commons <hi>Right,</hi> when themselves

were more likely to have Usurp'd upon the Crown, and (as Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> and his Associates would have it,) made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and the <hi>People</hi> Judges of their own <hi>wrong:</hi> For to see such a task underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at a time, when we are since satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such dangerous designs were a-foot, looks only like a particular part of that general Plot and Conspiracy that has been since discovered, and that all sorts of Pens were imployed, as well as all Heads, Hearts, and Hands at work, for the carrying on Mr. <hi>Sidney's OLD CAVSE,</hi> (as indeed all this Gentlemans Works tended to,) for which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was supposed so often to have <hi>declared</hi> and <hi>signaliz'd</hi> himself: and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrates only this, That there was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Person qualified for undermining of our Monarchy, either from his Wit or Parts, Boldness or Courage, from his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulency in Satyr, or his Knowledge in History, from his skill in any Science, or Profession, but what some or other of the most eminent was made Servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this Faction, and contributed his Talent to the carrying on the Design, according to the gift and graces that they had in their several Abilities to

promote it; neither can this Gentleman think himself libell'd in this Accusation, unless he would give his own works the Lye; for who but him that had such a Design for the subverting our Monarchy, would, at a season when the Succession of our Crown was struck at in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Vote; a Succession that several Laws of our Land have declared to be Hereditary even by that of <hi>God?</hi> who but one so Seditious, would not only have encouraged such <hi>unwarrantable</hi>

<pb n="576" facs="tcp:46218:312"/>
if their King be never so great a <hi>Delinquent,</hi> (for I think they may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon make their King so, as they did foolishly those that followed him in the late Wars, when the word implies a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting,</hi> and the Law only calls them so <note place="margin">Coke Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton <hi>291.</hi>
               </note> that adhere to the King's Enemies,) then I say, if their Soveraign be never so much a Criminal to the State, upon such a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, they devest themselves by their own Maxims of this power of Judicature, and so put it in the power of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, or the Prince at any time to blast all his Judges in a moment, and dissipate them all with the Breath of his Mouth; and therefore <hi>Mr. Sidney</hi> was so wittily Seditious, as to foresee such a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and for that Reason very reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely does deny what some of our more moderate Republicans will allow, That <note place="margin">Tryal page 26.</note> the King has a power of Assembling, and Dissolving a Parliament: But this piece of pernicious Paradox, a Position so false, that some of them themselves are asham'd to own, has been already refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and prov'd from the very Laws of the Land, to be an absolute Lye, but our Author having plac'd himself, and his People <hi>above</hi> the Law, tho (it was his

            <p>Then in the next place, if this <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> power of this People be delegated to this Parliament, it would have been much to the purpose for some of them, to have shown us from whence this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had this Original Power: Certainly, if any, it must be deriv'd from God, Nature, or somewhat that's Soveraign: But for the Almighty; In all the sacred Texts, there's not a syllable of such a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy left them, but abundance of the
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:46218:313"/>
bequest of it that is made to Kings: For Nature, there is nothing from it more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, than a whole series of Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that to single Soveraignty, (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aside even the paternal among Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Creatures,) almost to be made out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Insects and Animals, Bees and Beasts. And if some King indulged this their People to appropriate to themselves all the Supream Power, (which we never heard of any of ours that did; or to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate part of their Prerogative, which we know many Indulgent ones of ours to their Parliaments have done,) then still this their power can't be <hi>Original,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis derivative; and I dare swear no Prince ever granted them a power of being Superiors, as they must be if they would Judge him, or ever accepted a Crown upon that Condition, supposing it were as they would have it, conferr'd: For the very Act of being such a <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> King, would <hi>absolutely</hi> make him none at all; and therefore those whom the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> compounded withal to be regulated by their <hi>Ephori,</hi> were in effect not so much as the Dictators of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so not to be reckon'd to Reign as Crown'd Heads, or mentioned

            <p>If the People delegate an Original power, and a Natural Liberty to this Parliament; it cannot certainly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended how these Parliaments as now constituted, could commence by the Grants and Concessions of the Prince; and yet all will allow, tho they disagree in the time, that they did begin at first to be so Assembled by the Bounteous Permission of the King, and that all the Privileges they claim, were the result of an entire Favour of the Soveraign, and not the Original freedom of the Subject;
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:46218:315"/>
if they'll call that an Original Power to send Representatives, it must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like that Author's <hi>Secondary Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> we so lately consider'd; and that tho they prescribe to it for this seven hundred year, as well as they cannot for above four or five 100, still it will recurr to this, That this first power was the Grant of the Crown. And these prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as themselves allow, being when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they begun, the result of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns Bounteous Permission; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see why those Immunities may not be resign'd to the same Crown, from which they were once receiv'd, or those Franchises (for prescription it self in this case is properly no more) may not be <hi>Absolutely</hi> forfeited, by those that at best can but be said to hold them on Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

is about Civil Government, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown: In this Case rhere is also a <hi>Convention</hi> (as they call it) of: two Parties; the <hi>Subject,</hi> and he that is to be the <hi>Soveraign;</hi> one upon such a contract, stipulates to Govern, the other to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>And this carrying it by a Majority is against the Nature of their Original Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; for we see that even in all Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Assemblies, and tumultuary Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; every Man would have every thing carried his own way, but the being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Major part; has always been the result of some civil Institution in the Government, that thought it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable things should be so carried for an avoiding of Confusion and Disorder, so our Representatives in Parliament are chosen by the Majority of their Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; and they pass their Bills when ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by pluralities of Voices; but this proceeds from President; Regulation, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, Custom, and Law, and yet we see that many times, notwithstanding these receiv'd Rules, and tacit Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to which all have submitted, they are loth in their Elections to stand to their own accord in such Cases, and that those that have lost the day, or the Cause by some few voices, are restless, tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary; and their natural Liberty that is in herent in every individual, so prevalent,

that what they have lost by Law, they endeavour to compass by force or fraud, and from that has proceeded those Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous forcible Decisions of some of our Elections, those clan destine and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent ones of others, from that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our late Confusions even in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary <note place="margin">Vide per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> Affairs; The Remonstrances of the Army, Excluded Members; the Impeachment and Imprisonment of the Eleven Members, Prides Purge; The Peoples Agreement, Abolishing of Lords House, and at last <hi>Olivers</hi> Dissolution; <note place="margin">Hist. of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</note> for the Independant Faction prevailing in force, would by no means be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Law, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> suffrages were all along the most numerous in the Senate, and by all their Presidents in Parliament, must have carried every Vote by the Majority: This the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant that fill'd not above the third part of the House found to their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, saw themselves still out-voted by Law, and so be took themselves to their <hi>armed</hi> Suffrages, and their Legislative <hi>Swords.</hi>

            <p>And from these Reasonings and Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions (which I submit to Men of more Sense and Reason;) I dare to draw this Conclusion, that even from their own Principles; Their Contract with their King, or as <hi>Sidney</hi> says, The Condition upon which he receives the Crown, he can not possibly be punish'd or depos'd, because 'tis almost <hi>impossible</hi> that every one of his Subjects should concur in

such an Act; and the Major part must by no means determine it, by their own Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims <hi>of Natural Liberty,</hi> even in affairs of les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser <hi>Moment.</hi> 2. Because 'tis no Consequence, that because they have confer'd the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy upon some single Person, that therefore they may reassume it too, tho it were forfeitable even on <hi>Condition,</hi> which l've shown the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, never pretended to, tho their own <note n="†" place="margin">De jure Magistrat. Quest. 6.</note> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocraticks tell us, their very <hi>Lex Regia</hi> was <hi>Conditional;</hi> and <note n="‖" place="margin">Dig. 50. 12. 2.

<pb n="614" facs="tcp:46218:331"/>
like a <hi>Richard</hi> the Second by his own consent.</p>
            <p>I have taken this Course, as the best way for the Confutation of such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; not that I can really grant them the Concessions I have made, for I could assoon believe Mr. <hi>S.</hi> dy'd a Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as be satisfy'd with the positions he has lain down; but I therefore grant them their own <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that they may confute themselves, that they may see their own <hi>Babel</hi> of Anarchy will not be built upon the very <hi>Basis</hi> and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Foolish positions they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; that the work never was, or will be carried on far, without terminating as that of their Fore-fathers, in Confusion; (and by that they mean perhaps a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,) and have I hope in some Measure manifested, that even by their own wicked assertion of the Peoples Divine, Natural and Original power they cannot really pretend toany <hi>Right</hi> of Judging; Punishing, or deposing their King, what <hi>force</hi> can do; we have both felt, and fearfully, to our Terror seen, but in all Arguments of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Question is of the Reason, and <hi>Right,</hi> and not of any Fact that may be
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:46218:331"/>
justify'd by <hi>wrong;</hi> and the refuting them from their <hi>own</hi> Maxims, must be more effectually convincing, then the maintaining of <hi>ours;</hi> for <hi>one</hi> opinion in Politicks, is not absolutely destroyed, because some Persons can maintain <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> no more than the Systeme of <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> was presently <hi>False,</hi> only because <hi>Copernicus</hi> had invented his for <hi>True;</hi> for the bare contradiction, and Clashing of positions, convinces no more than the giving the Lye, but when it is prov'd upon them in <hi>one,</hi> that even from their own Principles and Premisses, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not draw the very Conclusion they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; as it was since in the <hi>other,</hi> that from their own <hi>Hypothesis</hi> they could not solve all the Phrases, and Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons themselves would make to appear, then certainly they must allow that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are in the <hi>wrong</hi> tho they will not Confess their Foes in the Right.</p>
            <p>And now having at <hi>lenght</hi> examin'd their Original <hi>Power</hi> of People; let us a <hi>little</hi> consider how long, and from whence our <hi>Kings</hi> have had their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.

<pb n="616" facs="tcp:46218:332"/>
Contenders about this Origen of Kings have very vainly, and as Foolishly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel'd at; then we must consult our Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tongue; for without doubt till the <hi>Saxons</hi> settled here they had some other appellation; and were only from them call'd <hi>Konyngs</hi> and since Kings, but if we consider the Nature of the Government, it is that which from the <hi>Greeks</hi> we call Monarchy, which from its own Etymology best sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies and expresses the Sense that it bears, which is the Governing part, and the Supream power plac'd in the sole hands of some single Person, and then the Quest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be only this, how long that has obtain'd in the World; by whom first instituted, and in whom it first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd? For the first; 'tis undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that its Original was with that of the World, and God himself gave it by the Name of <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Gen.</hi> v. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Dominion</hi> to his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> he had Created, which in express Terms was given him first over all the Living Creatures, and then over the <note place="margin">4. <hi>Gen.</hi> v. 7.</note> product of his own Loins, his Wife; and after that, (as if Providence did design to prevent the dispute about the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Primogeniture;) it gave in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words, a Superiority to <hi>Cain;</hi> that
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:46218:332"/>
the younger should be in some sense his Subject, that to him should be his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and that he should Rule over him; from whence it was assoon Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Several Heads of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that were the product of their Loins, and so succeeded in a sort of subordinate Government according to the Antiquity of the Tribe, or Family. That this was <hi>then</hi> such Authority, as we <hi>now</hi> call King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is both nonsense to assert; and as great a Folly for any to require that we should maintain, for they may as well quarrel with us, when we say there were Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that there Courts and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, were as Stately and Great, as now they are in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if the Government of those Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, was but Analogous to what we call Kingly <hi>now:</hi> And now that we have brought it both to a right of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture</hi> and a <hi>Paternal Right</hi> from whence will result the <hi>Divine;</hi> we'll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it is, Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates can say against it; and see if there be any such absurdities in it, as they more Seditiously; then with any Sense and Reason suggest; first for the right of <hi>Primogeniture,</hi> that themselves

will allow; but 'tis only because not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to contradict, and besides as they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agin, it makes for them, and their Cause; for by that course of descent, they think our Asserters of a Divine right, are oblig'd to deduce their Pedigree of their Kings form the Creation of the World in a right Line; and therefore Mr. <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid.

               <hi>Sidney</hi> says that such a supposition makes no King <hi>to have a Title to his Crown; but what can deduce his Pedigree from the Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Son of</hi> Noah.

<pb n="631" facs="tcp:46218:339"/>
Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> so much, the power of governing those very Children he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got should be superseded: The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man among his many Melancholy moods, had it seems some pleasant Fancies: For in effect he tells us no more than this, that Coition being an Act of Love to the Mother, the Government over the Child that she bears him, must by no means be call'd a power; and if this be not indeed a puzzl'd, senseless Opinion, I submit to persons that abound with more sense, and if it have the least sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a consequence, I will forfeit all my Right to Reason, might it not be as well infer'd too, that every Father that chastises his froward Child, is an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Tyrant, because that sort of severity savors of <hi>Anger,</hi> and <hi>fury,</hi> but the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration work obliged him never to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it, because that was an Act of <hi>extream Love.</hi>

            <p>But besides that precept in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, <hi>Honouring our Parents,</hi> is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Law of Nature engraven in our Hearts, as well as it was in the two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone, and whereever there is a Natural Veneration; there is at the same time an imply'd subjection, for those we

And Last of all, let me but only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the Excellency of this truly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, venerable, and divine Form of Government, a Monarchy; and then the many Mischiefs that attend the popular one, a Democracy; and then let the most prejudic'd and partial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son judge, not only which of the two has been always reputed most Eligible; but which of them he himself would most affect to Chuse: Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> as Learned an Head-piece per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of the last Age, as any that he hath left behind him in this, a Person rather prejudic'd against <hi>Monarchy;</hi> than bigotted for it, no such Court-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite as the <note n="*" place="margin">Merc. polit.</note>

it; but tells us, that in the beginning the <hi>Fathers</hi> of Nations were then the Kings, and the Eldest of Families the <hi>Princes,</hi> and of such an Excellency is its Form, that it is the clear result of unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd Reason, and most agreeable to the sense and security of Mankind: For as the natural Intellect it self (by which I mean bare humane understanding) when, in the infancy of the World, people were guided more by their own Fancies, and the <hi>Paternal</hi> Power, which then was all the <hi>Regal,</hi> from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness it might be suppos'd to have towards those that were their <hi>natural issues</hi> as well as their <hi>civil subjects,</hi> had indulg'd vice, and been less rigorous in Executing impartial <hi>Justice</hi> on Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; whereby people were left more at Liberty, I say Nature then, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity it self, made them find the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience even of too much Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and made even the most <hi>foolish</hi> fellows apprehend as well as the <hi>wise,</hi> that the Condition of <hi>reasonable</hi> men would be more miserable than that of <hi>brute</hi> beasts; that an Inundation of Anarchy and Confusion, would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm them more than the first Flood,
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:46218:357"/>
Did they not, by a general Consent, submit to Government, and obey those that were set over them to Govern? For they found that when they were most mighty to oppress, others might in time grow <hi>more</hi> so, and do them as much mischief: And those that were <hi>equal</hi> in their strength, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>equally</hi> dangerous and mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous one to another; and that the most unbounded Licenciousness prov'd always, to some or other, the most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Bondage and Slavery. And this natural Reason inclin'd them too to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce under those <hi>Monarchical</hi> Forms, that were then the Government of the Times, and which the <hi>Israelites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves desired in a more special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, tho' they were forwarn'd of its Absoluteness, and told by <hi>Samuel,</hi> that it would be Tyranny it self: for the same necessity, convenience, reason, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural instinct that persuaded them, to submit to Government in <hi>General,</hi> did also suggest to them the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Monarchy in <hi>Particular:</hi> For as by want of all Government, their reason told them they could not long possess any <hi>right,</hi> and that Liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:46218:358"/>
only a License to do what they list, and so left nothing to be <hi>wrong:</hi> So the same reason suggested, that these their <hi>Rights</hi> were best defended, and soonest decided by some single Person, that was Supreme, than when a Multitude had the Supremacy; for in that there being so many suffrages as there are men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly there might be so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral interests and factions; which must both hinder any sudden determination, as well as make the sentence liable to more partiality and injustice, when it is determin'd. This made the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> so tedious always in its deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and the people as uneasie and unsatisfied in their Decrees: Their <hi>Praetores, Quaesitores, Judices Quaesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum &amp; selecti,</hi> some of them having <note place="margin">Sigon. <hi>de Jud. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>de Jure Rom. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</note> under them no * less than an hundred Commissioners, might be said to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Causes instead of determining them. Their <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws that were made for the Division of their Fields, most of them having been <hi>given</hi> by <hi>Romulus,</hi> and the rest of their Kings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd their rights to <hi>them</hi> with <hi>Justice</hi> and satisfaction to the people, while their Kings Reign'd that <hi>gave</hi> them, and
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:46218:358"/>
were the sole Judges of their own Laws.</p>
            <p>But when they were confounded into a Commonwealth, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate set themselves to decide the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of their Commons, and their Fields; what Seditions, Confusions, and Unsettlement did they create? So that the <hi>Reasonable</hi> presumption there is, of a more Equitable and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy distribution of Justice from a single Sovereign, because suppos'd to be less prejudic'd, and less unable to be prevail'd upon by favour or affection, may very well be thought to have recommended at first, a Monarchical Form, &amp; afford us now asmuch reason for the retaining it.</p>
            <p>In the next place, A King being a perpetual Heir to the Crown, insomuch that the Politick Laws suppose him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to dye, and when in a natural sense he does, the Crown still descends to his immediate Successor: This will make him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Publick, whose Administration they must either soon quit, or at last leave to those to whom they no way relate. I allow in most such Communities, there is commonly special provisions made by their Laws, that an abusing that power, with which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted, or a robbing the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of part of its Revenue, shall be punish'd with some grievous Fine, or perhaps made Capital; for which the <hi>Romans</hi> had their several rules and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations for their Magistrates and men in Office: But there being so many ways to be injurious to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that can so easily, by those that administer its affairs, be kept private and conceal'd; it must certainly be concluded, that those that have an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Power of Publick Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as all <hi>Kings,</hi> and they alone have, that their <hi>Interest</hi> obliges them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve its rights inviolate, from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness, that nature it self will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant in them, to injure their own Sons, Successors and Posterity.

About the Year 1559, there was promoted in <hi>France,</hi> a Plot and Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy against their King, and that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the same pretext; so many of ours have been of late in <hi>England,</hi> that is, Religion, but truly fomented by what has been always the spring, the very fountain of Blood and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, discontent and disgust toward the Government: For upon the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and the Succession of <hi>Francis</hi> his eldest Son to the Throne, the Princes of the House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> thinking themselves neglected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, thrust out of Office and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Court, and finding the Family of the <hi>Guises</hi> still prefer'd, whom they always as mortally hated, resolved to revenge themselves upon the Crown, (that is) to turn Rebels. Of these <hi>Vendosme</hi> and <hi>Conde</hi> were the principal Engagers, and drew in the two <hi>Castil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">Gasper de Collign, &amp; <hi>Mr.</hi> D' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot.</note> Admiral and his Brother, who for the removal of the Duke <hi>De Montmorency,</hi> their relation from that Court, to which he had prefer'd them, were as full also of resentment against the Crown, as those that came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them with an invitation to invade

it; and after all their several seditious Assemblies, after all the many Meetings they had made, after all the Treasonable Consultations they had held, no design was look'd upon by them more likely to prove effectual, than the making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Head of the <hi>Hugenots.</hi> And so <hi>hot</hi> were they upon this Project, the pursuit of another kind of <hi>Holy War,</hi> (that among our modern <hi>Crusadoes</hi> has been nothing else but a <hi>Religious Rebellion</hi>) that notwithstanding the <hi>coldness</hi> of the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> they drew in most of the Protesting part of <hi>France</hi> to be truly Rebels, for the sake of their Seducers, while they made them believe they had only engag'd themselves to fight for the Religion of those they had so wickedly seduc'd: And so conducing then were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of a Republick to a Rebellions Plot, that one <note n="†" place="margin">Alias <hi>Godfry</hi> de la.

to suppress them, they were so bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as to refuse Pardon when offered; but in the Battel were Beaten; five thousand six hundred Slain; their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fled, but being found out, was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. In the Year 1535, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> a pitiful Taylor, possest with such Seditious positions, had got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether such a <hi>party</hi> of People, that at last they possest them of <hi>part</hi> of the strong City of <hi>Munster,</hi> set up Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his Sect, taught the People to put down the Magistrates, and establish New Common-wealths; they burnt Churches, spoil'd the Suburbs, till the Bishop they Banisht, Besieged them, forc'd an entrance by Assault, took the Leaders, and hung them in Iron Cages on the City Towers.</p>
            <p>From these Doctrines were the flames of Civil War kindled in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and Tumults and Disorders their daily practice; for at <hi>Valencien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> they would commonly rescue the Prisoners of the State, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye by Legal process; force the Officers to fly for their preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and with a number of two thousand break open the Doors of

The like happen'd at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> upon the Execution of one <hi>Fabricius</hi> a Priest. From these principles it was, that about the Year 1565, that these <hi>Hollanders,</hi> 9 of their <hi>protesting</hi> Lords, not at all Officers of State, conven'd at <hi>Breda,</hi> drew up a form of an <hi>Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> which they call'd too, their <hi>Covenant</hi> (and what has been since so well copy'd by our <hi>English</hi> Rebells) which they all Subscrib'd, and sent about by their Emissaries, through all the several Provinces for Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And as from these Principles, these Tumults and Disorders; Leagues and Covenants were created in the Low Countries: So followed also from them, an entire Defection from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and a Rebellious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the United <hi>Netherlands.</hi> For though Mr. <note n="†" place="margin">

them to Obedience, because of his austerity and cruel disposition; for Rebells that resolve commonly to shew no Mercy, are not reducible to their Allegiance, but with as much severity, I will grant them, that by this Rebellion they laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the flourishing of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion in their new erected Common-wealth: Nay, and will pray that it may long there flourish, as well as under our own Monarchy at Home. But yet I cannot find from all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Bible, or the Schools, that Blood and Treason, Murder and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege (all which were the result of that Defection) could be sanctified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the doing God good Service, or for the sake of his Gospel; nay, though it were for an Apostatizing from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism it self, which my Charity will not permit me (though some Peoples fury may transport them) to bring it in competition with Popery, and the Professors of the same God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. That the Protestant Religion is a <hi>promoter</hi> of such <hi>Seditious</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, none but besotted Pagans, or bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Papists will assert.

in <hi>France,</hi> and these Parts of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> by such <hi>Sedition</hi> it was <hi>promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> my little reason will resolve into nothing less, but that in those Parts it was chiefly propagated by the Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of <hi>Geneva,</hi> a pure and perfect Republick; who, at the same time they infused the principles of a sound Religion, insinuated too the positions of their Seditious Politicks, and mingl'd Poyson, not with common Meat, but their very spiritual Food: For <hi>Luther</hi> sure will be allowed the Name of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, as wel as, and before Mr. <hi>Calvin;</hi> and yet we see the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion flourisht under his way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating it, without any Rebelling for it, unless from that See of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which it wisely Reformed. It was that very thing endear'd it to the Princes of the Empire; and I believe reconcil'd them to receive it the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when they found nothing in it of the positions of a <note n="*" place="margin">His Book burnt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the <hi>Sorbonist,</hi> at <hi>Paris, A.

There was no King, no Parliament, no Rump, and as yet no Protector: The Disciples of Mr. <hi>Sidney's</hi> Doctrine must say, forsooth, The <hi>Supream Power</hi> was then in the People; (but as the Devil would have it) <hi>Cromwel</hi> had got the <hi>supream strength: Strength</hi> and <hi>power</hi> I confess, are mighty different, and just distinguisht by the same Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks the <hi>Scots</hi> put upon the King at <hi>Newark,</hi> when they would persuade him, The Army was one thing, and the Soldiers of it another; but if this <hi>People</hi> had then the <hi>supream power,</hi> why did they not assemble themselves into a Parliament, since there was no Writ from above to call them to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly? But our History tells us, <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> call'd it, and what for? why say our <hi>Republicans, That the People might confer upon him their supream original Power, which he could not assume without their consent;</hi> very good: So <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> was willing this <hi>supream power</hi> should be settl'd upon him by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therefore he calls the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>i.e.</hi> gives it the <hi>supream power,</hi> &amp; they in common Civility could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void to give it him again: But where

but a grain of sense settle this Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in him that <hi>call'd</hi> them to <hi>assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> or in those that were <hi>assembl'd</hi> at his <hi>call;</hi> I confess, if the cunning Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Birds could but contrive, as once they did design, such a rare Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that like the Bird of <hi>Asia,</hi> should rise from the ashes of it's Ancestors, we might have one <hi>then,</hi> not only <hi>long,</hi> but <hi>everlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But even this, tho' <hi>then,</hi> attempted to have been enacted, would have been but Nonsense and absurd, and sit only to have past in that Parliament which he call'd; who made many <note n="*" place="margin">

Cromwel</hi> and his Conspirators foresaw they would be confounded with such absurdities, and they found themselves plung'd into as much confusion; and then, pray, what did they do with this <hi>Sidney's supream original power</hi> that they did not know what to make of, or how to use, tho' it lay upon their hands? why, they surrender it to a single person, from whom they thought they had it, and so the Usurper had his design</p>
            <p>The next Plot was, how they could play the <hi>Knaves</hi> to get that Power again, which they thought they had parted with like <hi>Fools: Cromwel</hi> was cunning enough to hold what he had gotten, and never parted with it but with his Breath; tho' the <hi>Levellers,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Fifth-Monarchy</hi> Men conspir'd for Insurrections, and <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> himself left little undone to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant him.
