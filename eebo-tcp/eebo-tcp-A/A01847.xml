            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

diſcourſe of the three kindes of Peppers, and of
three medicines co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded of the ſame, greatly
commended by Galen in his books <hi>De ſanitate
tuenda;</hi> which being vſed in right order, with
diſcretion, will vndoubtedly bring three waies
commoditie to the continuance of your heath.
For it is certaine that moſt men in this our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
through our maner of feeding, do gather in
<pb facs="tcp:622:3"/>
the ſtomacke and in the first veines many crude
and vndigested humours, which do often occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lacke of appetite, groſſe windines, diſtentions
in the ſides, and many waies greeuous paines; and
ſometimes vnnaturall vomits: which crudities
carried farther into the body, doo breede ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
tympanies, feuers, and other dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
diſeaſes. The due conſideration hereof, may
eaſily inferre how neceſſary to health in this our
region the vſe of pepper is, and what commodity
may accrew by conuenient vſe of the three me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
made thereof. For first the medicine ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>diatrion pipereon,</hi> by conſent of all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
hath facultie to warme the ſtomacke, to dry
ſuperfluous moisture, to further concoction, to
diſcuſſe winde, to ripen crude humours, and is
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended aboue all other medicaments, that in
performing of theſe actions it doth no way ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heate
the liuer, nor distemper the bloud. The
ſecond medicine termed <hi>diaſpoliticon,</hi> keepeth
the belly looſe, and doth carry by the ſtoole, crude,
corrupt, and naughtie humours, cut groſſe and
thicke phlegme, keepeth cleane the belly and
guts. The third medicine termed <hi>diacalamin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi>
hauing more ſubtiltie in ſubstance doth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
farther, and ſo doth concoct and expell
not onely the crudities of the belly and of the first
veines, but alſo doth digest, extenuate, diſcuſſe,
and by vrine carieth the excrementes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:622:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
veines, clenſeth the bloud, and keepeth clean
the habite of the body by ſweate and perſpiration
through the skin. That in very truth Galen had
iust cauſe ſo greatly to commende theſe three
medicines as moſt conuenient to preſerue health.
For I do not reade in all our authors of a more
conuenient meanes to continue health, than the
apte and due vſe of theſe three medicines, which
in propulſing of diſeaſes, and in reforming of the
ſtate of the body, may be reſembled to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umuiri
in the common-wealth of Rome. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I remaine to the almightie a daily ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

               <head>The kinds of Pepper.</head>
               <p>HEer it is to be noted, that many herbs
of our writers are termed by the
name of pepper. For the herbe called in
<pb facs="tcp:622:5"/>
Latin <hi>Perſicaria,</hi> in Engliſh Culrage, is of
ſome named water pepper. The ſeede alſo
of the herbe called Chamelea, is knowen
to the herbarians by the name of hil pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Likewiſe the herbe which we call
Stonecrop, is alſo named mouſe pepper.
And ſom do cal diptander, herbe pepper,
and ſome ſauery pepperwort. So the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
writers ſhew many other herbs vnder
the name of pepper, and vnder pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort.
For they refer to pepper euery kind
of herbe which doth bite the toong as
pepper doth. And beſide the three kindes
of pepper, which are beſt knowen by that
name, we do read in the latter writers of
ſome other kinds vnder that name: and
ſo we read of pepper out of Aethiopia,
which is of the learned rather referred to
that ſpice which is called Carpeſium, than
to any kind of pepper. But properly and
in true ſpeech, this word in Latin <hi>Piper,</hi>
and in Engliſh pepper; is to be vnderſtood
of one of the three peppers in common
vſe, of which one is named white pepper,
the other blacke pepper, the third long
pepper. Of the which three kinds, and not
of the other things falſly named peppers,
that confection ſo greatly commended in
cold affections of the ſtomack, called <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion
<pb facs="tcp:622:5"/>
pipereon,</hi> is made, and kept in our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries
ſhops. So that theſe three
kindes of peppers moſt properly do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
the name of pepper, and are ſo moſt
conueniently called: and the other things
are rather by ſimilitude ſo termed, for
yeelding ſome taſte like pepper, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neuer knowen by the name of pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
without ſome addition, as <hi>Piper monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
Piper murinum, &amp;c.</hi> So that when we
do read in any author this word <hi>Piper,</hi> or
in Engliſh pepper without addition, we
muſt vnderſtand the ſame of one of theſe
three peppers.</p>
               <p>The nauigations in theſe latter yeeres
made by the Portingales into the eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
and by the Spaniards into the weſt
Indians, hath made manifeſt to vs, how
greatly the old authors, I meane Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides,
Galen, Plinie, Auicenna, Serapio,
and other writers of the former time were
deceiued in and about the hiſtorie of pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
For firſt, all the ancient writers in
their monuments haue deliuered to vs,
that the three kindes of pepper in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vſe are all three the fruit of one tree.
For (ſay they) the pepper tree doth bear a
long fruit, like vnto that which doth hang
in haſell nut trees, and birch trees. And
<pb facs="tcp:622:6"/>
they affirme, that this long fruit is the firſt
rudiment of the pepper, which is called
long pepper: after that this fruit being
more ripe is diſcloſed, they take the ſeeds
contained in it to be the white pepper, &amp;
the blacke pepper: ſuch graines which are
not perfectly ripe, they ſuppoſed to be
white pepper, and thoſe which are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ripe, to be blacke pepper. So they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that theſe three kinds were all the
fruit of one tree, and differed only in that
one was not ſo ripe as the other. But by
the nauigations of the Portingals, and of
the Spaniards into thoſe countries, in
which theſe pepper trees do growe, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
and well knowen, that the trees
which do yeeld theſe three ſpices are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
in kind. For the trauellers into thoſe
countries which haue ſeene the trees, and
gathered the fruits, do witnes, that not
one and the ſame tree, but diuers and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
do beare theſe ſpices. And that the
plants which do beare white pepper and
blacke pepper are not trees of any big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
but weake ſhrubs, which do clime vp
by other trees, as an Iuie doth in this our
countrie. And haue leaues like to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
tree called <hi>Malum Aſſyrium,</hi> and do
carrie their fruit in cluſters, like the clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb facs="tcp:622:6"/>
of grapes of vine trees, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
greene vntill they wax ripe. And Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
who liued in theſe parts, writeth, that
the plant which yeeldeth the white pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
doth in kind differ from that which
beareth the blacke pepper, and yet are ſo
like, that no man can know the one from
the other, but they which do dwell there.
For (ſaith he) they do ſo differ, as the vine
tree which beareth the white grape, doth
differ from that which yeeldeth the red
grape: and as we cannot know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of theſe vine trees, but when the
grape is ripe, ſo we cannot diſcerne the
plant which yeeldeth the white pepper,
from that which beareth the blacke pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
and yet (ſaith he) it is certaine, that
the ſame tree, which bringeth foorth the
blacke pepper, doth not yeeld the white
pepper. He ſaith alſo, that the white pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
tree is not ſo common in theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
as the other is, and that the ſame is
not to be ſeene, but in certaine places of
Malauar and Malachae. The ſame Garcia
writeth, that the tree, of which long pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is gathered, doth greatly differ from
the other forenamed pepper trees: and
that long pepper is a fruit depending of
the tree in like ſort, as we ſee things to
<pb facs="tcp:622:7"/>
hang downe in our haſell nut trees, and in
our birch trees: and that this fruit wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
yeeld either white or blacke pepper.
By this diſcourſe we do vnderſtand, that
the pepper tree is not like to the Iuniper
tree, as Plinie writeth in his 12. boke. And
Garcia alſo ſaith, that the roote of the
pepper tree is very little. So that it is not
like to ginger, as ſome beleeued in Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides
time, nor like to the roote of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus
as Dioſcorides writeth. And heerby
alſo we are to vnderſtand that the old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is fabulous and vntrue, that pepper is
made blacke with fire. For the marchants
which brought the peppers, ſaid, that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
and venemous beaſts did vſe much
to be vnder theſe pepper trees, and that
they were driuen to fray away thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
with making fires vnder the trees,
before they durſt gather the peppers, and
ſo the pepper was made black by the fire.
But now we learne by the hiſtories pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the latter writers, that all this is
vntrue, and that blacke pepper is of that
colour by his owne kinde, when it is ripe:
and ſo that white pepper is of his owne
kind, euen of that colour when it is ripe.
As the red grape hath that colour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
when it is ripe, and the white
<pb facs="tcp:622:7"/>
grape keepeth his colour euen to his full
ripenes. Wherefore thoſe writers were
much deceiued, which affirmed, that
white and black pepper were of one tree:
and that white pepper was the fruit not
throughly ripe, and that blacke pepper
was the ſame perfectly ripe. For (ſay they)
as in our country, when we gather apples,
all of the ſame tree are not of like ripenes,
ſome not full ripe, ſome full ripe, ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ripe, and all are gathered at one time:
ſo, ſay theſe men, when the marchants do
gather pepper, ſome graines are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ripe, and they black and wrinkled, ſome
not full ripe, and they whiter in colour,
and ſmoothe not wrinkled. But it appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by that which they haue deliuered to
vs, which haue ſeene and gathered both
theſe kinds of peppers, that they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
of ſeuerall trees, and that ech doth
perfectly ripe in his kind, and ech retaine
his colour: the white graine when it is
ripe keepeth the white colour, and the
blacke pepper when it is ripe keepeth his
blacke colour: Euen as the white grape
being ripe remaineth white, and the red
grape red, and yet ech do come of ſeuerall
vine trees different in kinde. So we are to
thinke of theſe kinds of pepper, that ech
<pb facs="tcp:622:8"/>
doth come of his proper tree, and each ful
ripe retaineth his naturall colour: the
white pepper his, and the blacke his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
as doth euidently appeere by that
which Garcia hath written in his firſt
booke <hi>De aromat. Indiae.</hi>

               <p>That the Greeke &amp; ancient writers did
erre in expreſſing the hiſtory of theſe pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
it is no maruel: for in that their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
were far diſtant from the prouinces
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence theſe peppers came, that they
themſelues could not ſearch out a truth,
but followed the report of marchants,
which tell many vntruthes, they were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
deceiued, and ſo did ſet down in their
bookes for verities many vntrue relations
of the marchants.</p>
               <p>But that the Arabians did commit the
ſame errors, whoſe countrie was not far
diſtant from the places where pepper
doth grow, their groſſe negligence in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the true knowledge of ſimples, can
not be excuſed, who would rather followe
heerein that which was written by the
Grecians, than themſelues ſearch out a
truth.</p>
               <p>Matthiolus in his commentaries vpon
Dioſcorides witneſſeth, that many pepper
trees are ſet to be ſeene at Naples, and
<pb facs="tcp:622:8"/>
at Venice, and diuers affirme, that theſe
trees are planted in diuers places in Spain
and in Portingall. But I could neuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that any pepper tree was at any
time brought into England. I haue often
ſeene at Poole in Dorſetſhire, and alſo in
London, the whole cluſters of pepper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
in brine and in ſalt: theſe cluſters
are long and thin, not ſo thicke togither
as the cluſters of grapes.</p>
               <p>Long pepper is to be ſeene in euery
ſhop: for the whole fruit is brought by
the marchants gathered togither like
ſcales, rough &amp; vneuen, biting the toung
like the other peppers.</p>
               <p>We do read of another kind of pepper
brought out of the Indians, which the
Portingals called <hi>Piemento de Rabo,</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
<hi>Piper caudatum,</hi> and may be engliſhed
taile pepper. Cluſius in his annotations in
Garcia, ſeemeth to haue known this kind
of pepper, and ſaith that it is like to the
cubebs, and that it hangeth in cluſters, is
very ſpicie, and hath a little ſtalke or ſtem.
This kind is not now brought: for the
king of Portingall did forbid any to bring
it, fearing leaſt it might decay the price
and ſale of the other kindes.</p>
               <p>Monardis alſo in his booke <hi>De plantis
<pb facs="tcp:622:9"/>
Indiae,</hi> maketh mention of another kind of
long pepper, different from the common
long pepper, and is much hotter than the
common long pepper, and more pleaſant
to the taſte than black pepper. Where
the latter writers in the hiſtorie of pepper
do diuide long pepper into the garden
and wild, this kind written of by Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis
is ſuppoſed to be the wilde long pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and the common long pepper, the
garden or domeſticall.</p>
               <p>The latter writers in the hiſtorie of
pepper, do write of another kind of pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which they call <hi>Piper corniculatum,</hi>
ſome call it <hi>Siliquastrum,</hi> which may bee
engliſhed, Codded pepper, bicauſe it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his graines in a cod or huske: and
they deſcribe this kinde to haue leaues
like to the herbe called Nightſhade, a
ſquare ſtalk of colour greene, ful of ioints,
white flowers, and after them commeth
the cod, at the firſt greeniſh, and after red,
with a perfect ſmoothnes and ſlikenes:
within that cod are flat graines, whitiſh,
yellow, more biting in taſte than pepper.
Theſe cods are not alway of one forme:
for in ſome of the plants they are greater
and longer, in ſome leſſer and ſhorter: and
the leſſer kind they call pepper of Braſilia:
<pb facs="tcp:622:9"/>
the greater they call pepper of Calecut,
named after the countries from whence
they are brought. The herbarians of our
time do witnes, that this plant is ſet in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
places in Italie, Spaine and Portingal:
for that it is a goodly plant and faire to
the eie, and the graines are vſed for pepper
all the yere, and are thought to commend
meates condited with them, better than
common pepper. I did neuer ſee the
plant, but the cods are common in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries
ſhops. It is ſuppoſed of many,
that the olde Greeke authors haue not
written any thing of this plant, but Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius
ſeemeth to ſpeake of this kinde of
pepper, vnder the name of <hi>Capſicum.</hi> Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
in his commentaries vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dioſcorides
affirmeth, that this kinde of pepper is that
which Auicen in 2. tract. lib. 2. cap. 746.
called <hi>Zinziber caninum.</hi> Thus much of the
true hiſtorie of pepper, as well out of the

               <head>How to chooſe pepper.</head>
               <p>DIoſcorides writing of three kinds of
pepper, doth giue ſignes and notes
to chooſe onely blacke pepper: for that
as it ſeemeth in his time deceit was onely
<pb facs="tcp:622:10"/>
vſed in that kind of pepper. For Dioſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
writeth, that amongſt blacke pepper
are found certaine ſeedes or graines light,
and emptie, which he calleth <hi>Breſma,</hi> and
Plinie ſaith they are termed <hi>Brechmaſis,</hi>
which word doth ſound, ſeeds vttered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their time. For (ſaith he) by vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
time the graines ſometimes do wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſo are emptie, hauing in them
no ſubſtance. But Garcia ſaith, that while
he did dwel among the Indians, he inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
&amp; could not learne of any ſuch name,
yet acknowledgeth, that ſuch graines like
to pepper are often found amongſt pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and are not eaſily knowen from pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but that they are light, and broken
do yeeld no ſubſtance as pepper doth.
Wherfore as in Dioſcorides time, ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this our age, we ought to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in the choiſe of pepper, and to haue
ſome notes or ſignes to chooſe the good
from the bad, and to know the beſt pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Dioſcorides commendeth pepper
when the graines are heauie, full, whole,
not much wrinkled, new, not full of duſt.
And Galen in 4. <hi>De ſanit. tuend.</hi> adddeth,
which hath not a very thinne, nor yet a
groſſe and thicke skin.</p>
               <p>Serapio praiſed white pepper, which
<pb facs="tcp:622:10"/>
hath a white colour, and the latter writers
ſay, the whiter the better, which is ſmooth
and not wrinkled. Galen in 4. <hi>De ſanit. tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end.</hi>
ſaith, that thoſe grains are beſt, which
are fulleſt and greateſt.</p>
               <p>Serapio alloweth of long pepper, which
when it is broken, doth ſhew his ſubſtance
compacted, and his graines thicke ioined
togither, which do bite the toong with
ſenſible heate. Galen in the ſaid booke <hi>De
ſanit. tuend.</hi> addeth, that long pepper muſt
be whole, and not haue any holes in it,
and not ſophiſticated. For (ſaith he) the
marchants do bring two ſorts counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited,
the one is the bud of an herbe, the
other is made in Alexandria by art. And
in his booke <hi>De theriaca ad Piſonem,</hi> he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the maner of making of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet
long pepper. They forme it (ſaith
he) of the length &amp; bignes of this pepper,
and then caſt to it the powder of the root
of <hi>Pyrethrum,</hi> or of muſtard ſeed, &amp; ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the taſte. But theſe deceits are eaſily
bewraied: for by taſte you may diſcern the
right pepper from the buds of that herb,
which are in form like to long pepper, but
not in taſte: and ſo by taſting, you ſhal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. For whoſoeuer
wil with diligence obſerue the taſt of pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb facs="tcp:622:11"/>
he ſhall eaſily iudge that pleaſant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
which it yeeldeth with the biting.
And Galen ſheweth how to diſcerne the
counterfeited fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right, by putting it
into water. For the counterfeited will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
in water, and ſo the right and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
will not diſſolue. Wherefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth,
that if it hath the true taſte of
pepper, and doth not diſſolue in water,
nor hath holes in it, then that is good
pepper. All writers do make this for a
ſigne of good long pepper, when it hath
no holes: for in deed this pepper is moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
than any other kinde, and therefore
will ſooner mould and waxe muſtie than
the other, and ſo will quickly be woorme
eaten, and full of holes.</p>

               <head>Of the temperament of Pepper.</head>
               <p>DIoſcorides and Galen do yeeld to all
the kinds of pepper a faculty to heat
and to drie, but neither of them do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
in what degree they do heate and
drie. After that Auerrhois in <hi>lib. Simplie.</hi>
had pronounced long pepper to be moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
than the other: And that white pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was not come to his ripenes, and that
black pepper was full ripe: He concludeth
<pb facs="tcp:622:11"/>
both kinds to be hot in the third degree,
and as ſome ſay in the fourth degree. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicen
in lib. 2. tract. 2. intreating of white
and blacke pepper generally, affirmeth
pepper to be hot and drie tending toward
the fourth degree. And in the very next
chapter handling of long pepper, he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that it is hot in the third degree, and
drie in the ſecond. Dioſcorides doth not
appoint the degrees of heat and drines to
euery kind of pepper, yet handleth each
very diſtinctly, ſaying, that long pepper
doth more ſtrongly bite: and bicauſe it is
taken from the tree before it is ripe, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it remaineth a little bitter. Blacke
pepper, bicauſe it is perfectly ripe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is well ſauored, ſharper than white
pepper, &amp; ſo more pleaſing to the mouth,
and more profitable to condite meates.
The white pepper remaining a little bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is not ſo ſtrong as the blacke. By this
Dioſcorides concludeth, that blacke pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is the hotteſt, and beſt of all; next to
it is long pepper, and that the weakeſt is
the white pepper. Galen doth ſeeme heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to diſſent from Dioſcorides. For Galen
in 8. <hi>ſimpl. med. facult.</hi> doth put long pepper
to be moiſter than the reſt, bicauſe it is
the yoong fruit, and therefore doth ſoone
<pb facs="tcp:622:12"/>
waxe woorme eaten. And after affirmeth,
that white pepper is more ſharpe and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
than the blacke, and giueth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his aſſertion: for that blacke pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is euer heated and dried with the ſun
by long tarrieng vpon the tree: for heerby
many of his hot and fierie parts do breath
out, the rather bicauſe pepper is of a thin
ſubſtance, that his hot parts will quickly
conſume and breath out: and ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth,
that bicauſe white pepper is not
ſo heated and dried by the ſun, but doth
retaine and keepe al his hote parts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is the hotter, more biting, and the
beſt pepper, contrarie to Dioſcorides aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.
Braſſauolus Muſa going about to
reconcile this controuerſie in Galen, by
diſtinguiſhing of the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
For in that white pepper hath plentie
of moiſture in it, therefore it biteth ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and leaueth the ſharpe and biting
qualitie to continue longer: and in that
reſpect it may be ſaid to be hotter than
the blacke pepper, hauing little moiſture,
and that much extenuated by the heate
of the ſunne, doth bite quicklier, deeper,
and ſharper: but bicauſe the heate of his
biting doth not ſo long continue, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ſeemeth not ſo hot as the blacke,
<pb facs="tcp:622:12"/>
and yet for that it biteth deeper, therfore
Dioſcorides writeth, that it is hotter and
ſtronger than the blacke. And if to trie
the truth heereof, a man will taſte both
kinds of pepper, ſurely he ſhall manifeſtly
perceiue the difference of them both. And
ſo in the one ſenſe white pepper may be
ſaid to be hotter and more biting, as Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
writeth: and in the other ſenſe blacke
pepper may be thought to exceede the
white as Dioſcorides affirmeth. But where
Dioſcorides ſaith, that white pepper is
weaker than long pepper and black pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
bicauſe it not being ful ripe is acerbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or more tart: ſurely his argument is
not perfect. For as he putteth white pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
not ſo ripe as blacke, ſo he maketh
long pepper not ſo ripe as white pepper.
And ſo it muſt follow after his opinion,
that long pepper ſhould be weaker than
white, and white than blacke pepper. So
Hippocrates is deceiued in his owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning.
But in that it is now certaine, that
theſe kinds do not differ, that the one is
riper than the other, but each is ripe and
perfect in his kinde: theſe arguments of
more or leſſe ripenes, do take no place,
and are of no efficacie: bicauſe that by
taſte it is euident, that white pepper doth
<pb facs="tcp:622:13"/>
bite the toong more, and the biting doth
continue longer: therefore we may iuſtly
ſay that white pepper is the hotter. And
for that Galen lib. 9. <hi>De compoſit. ſec. loc.</hi> in
the medicine of Philo affirmeth, that
white pepper is better for the ſtomacke
than blacke pepper. And in 4. <hi>De ſanit. tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end.</hi>
he ſaith, that white pepper doth ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the ſtomack aboue the other kinds.
Surely the Friers writing vpon Meſue do
truly counſell Apothecaries when pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſimply is read, to take white pepper.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding in ſome affects long
pepper is to be preferred before the other
kinds, as Galen witneſſeth lib. 4. <hi>De ſanit.
tuend.</hi> where he counſelleth to giue long
pepper to them which haue their ſides
blowen vp with wind, and which do turne
all they eate to wind. For (ſaith he) long
pepper doth diſſolue the groſnes of wind,
&amp; caſteth downe by the belly ſuch matter
which doth ſtay in the ſides.</p>
               <p>By this diſcourſe it appeereth, that the
Arabians did truly ſet white and blacke
pepper in the vttermoſt point of the third
degree of heate and drines, or in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the fourth degree. And Galen
confirmeth the ſame when he doth write,
that white and blacke pepper do ſtrongly
<pb facs="tcp:622:13"/>
heate and drie.</p>
               <p>And with good reaſons the ſame Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bikes
do ſet long pepper in the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of heate, and not beyond the ſecond
degree of drying. For in that by all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
conſent this kind is moiſter than the
other, therefore it cannot drie ſo much as
the other: for the drying qualitie muſt
needs be ſomwhat obtunded by the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
which is in this kind. And therefore
long pepper taſted doth not by and by
bite ſtrongly, but after it is a little chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and then the biting doth laſt longer.
And we may heerby alſo gather, that long
pepper is not ſo ſubtill of ſubſtance as the
other kinds are.</p>
               <p>Garcia writeth, that Emperikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Arabians &amp; Perſians do hold
opinion, that pepper is cold: which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
doth alſo preuaile amongſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſort in this our countrie. For it is a
common ſaying, that pepper is hot in the
mouth, but cold in operation. But for as
much as we do trie the qualitie of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
by taſte, theſe men do ſhew their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
in calling that cold in operation,
which is hot in the mouth.</p>

do recite and number manie
vertues and medicinal properties of theſe
kindes of peppers, which I leaue the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to peruſe in their books. The cheefeſt
vſe of peppers is in cold affects of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
and of other parts which do ſerue
for nutrition. For euery kind of pepper
doth greatly helpe concoction, diſcuſſe
wind, and doth occaſion all groſſe and ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
humors to diſcend ſooner. And to
this purpoſe many medicines deuiſed by
phyſicians of theſe kinds of peppers are
kept in Apothecaries ſhops, but amongſt
other Galen in his 4. booke <hi>De ſanit. tuend.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:622:14"/>
doth chiefly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend three ſorts. And the
medicine termed <hi>Diatrion pipereon,</hi> in that
it is confected of the three kindes of pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
beareth the bell, and is reputed in the
firſt place. And then he commendeth the
medicine called <hi>Diacalaminthe:</hi> &amp; thirdly,
that which is vſed vnder the name of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſpoliticon:</hi>
notwithſtanding each of theſe
medicines is not good to the ſelfeſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
neither are they in like ſort &amp; times
to be vſed. Touching <hi>Diatrion pipereon,</hi> it is
famous for to help concoction, to diſcuſſe
wind, and to do good againſt cold affects
of the ſtomacke, and yet not to heate the
liuer or the blood, wherin conſiſteth a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
propertie of this medicine. For it is
agreed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by all authors, that the heat of
this medicine is extinguiſhed in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the firſt veines, &amp; is not carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the whole bodie, as the heat of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
called <hi>Diacalaminthe</hi> is; ſo termed,
for that it receiueth the herbe called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminth,
as Gal. writeth in the ſaid booke
<hi>De ſanit. tuend. cap.</hi> 10. where he affirmeth,
that <hi>Diatrion pipereon</hi> is to be giuen when
crude and ſlimy humors are in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
and firſt veines, yea both before and
after meate. The vſe of <hi>Diacalaminthe</hi> is,
when we meane to warme further into the
<pb facs="tcp:622:15"/>
bodie, and haue an intent to cut &amp; make
thin groſſe humors in the veines. For <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaminthe</hi>
doth thinne groſſe and ſlimie
things, breatheth out by the skin, prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vrine, and the monethly ſicknes in
women. Therefore neither this medicine,
neither <hi>Diaſpoliticon</hi> ought to be vſed after
meate, bicauſe they two haſten diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo do hinder concoction: whereby
we may conclude, that the medicine <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion
pipereon</hi> may with moſt ſafetie be vſed
after meate to helpe concoction. And to
this intent Galen doth counſell to haue
in a readines this medicine prepared in
two maner of waies: the one ſimple, as
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting of feweſt things; the other more
compound: the ſimplier is ſooneſt conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
the other by reaſon of the number
of ſimples is harder to be digeſted. And
therefore the ſimplier is beſt for them
which do not well concoct their meate,
and do finde ſome cold temperament in
the ſtomacke and bellie, and ſo do gather
much ſlimie flegme: and the other by
reaſon of many ſimples in it, is harder to
be altered of nature, and ſo doth remaine
longer in the ſtomacke when it is taken.
So Galen doth beſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the frequent
vſe of <hi>Diatrion pipereo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> to remoue crudities
<pb facs="tcp:622:15"/>
in the ſtomacke and firſt veines. The other
which is more compound, hath his beſt
vſe in fluxes from the head to the breaſt.
In theſe our daies the medicine <hi>Diatrion
pipereon</hi> is in vſe, made in both waies. In
compounding the ſimplier, our Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries

For Galen in that place doth recite by

of ammios. And where our authors do
differ in opinion, what is the right Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,
and all writers do agree, that we
haue the right ammi: I adiudge it better
in theſe daies to put in this receit the
ſeeds of ammi, according as Galen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth,

               <p>In this compoſition, perſley ſeeds, ammy,

in the deſcription of Galen. Some learned
men of our time do commend this receit
of Nicolaus before that of Galen, bicauſe
it hath mo ſimples: but for my part, I
do rather allow of that receit of Galen,
which for the paucitie of ſimples, is with
leſſe labor concocted of them, which do
take it, and to the intent of the medicine,
it receiueth a ſufficient number of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
ſo that they which are inſerted by
Nicolaus, ſeeme ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>Galen appointeth a proportion of the
beſt and choſen honie, therewith to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde
<pb facs="tcp:622:18"/>
this and the other medicines,
which he willeth to be ſcummed with
great diligence: and if the quantity of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be increaſed, the medicine ſaith he will
be more pleaſing. And he here ſetteth a
rule which the apothecaries are to follow
in compounding of medicines, to make
them ſo pleaſant to the taſte as they can,
without weakning of their ſtrength, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
of their vertues. In theſe daies
the moſt part of medicines are made vp
with ſugar in ſteade of honie, for ſugar
is more gratefull to the taſte, and many
can not well away with honie. And honie
is ſooner conuerted vnto choler than ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
               <p>Touching the maner of making theſe
medicines, Galen doth admoniſh, that
they are not to be compounded in one
and like ſort, for in ſome reſpects the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are to be pounded finely, and ſerſed
with a fine ſerſer. For ſaith he when things
are finely beaten, they paſſe quickly into
the whole body, things groſely powdered
do ſtay longer in the belly, for the ſame
cannot ſo eaſily paſſe through the little
veines and ſmall pores of the body. In
which reſpect things groſely powdered
do more looſe the belly: when they are
<pb facs="tcp:622:18"/>
brought into fine powder, they go ſooner
into the body, and prouoke ſweate, and
better mooue vrine, but do leſſe mooue to
ſtoole. Therefore in compounding of the
medicines called <hi>Diacalaminthe</hi> Galens
counſell is to bring all the ſimples into
fine powder, that the ſame may the better
paſſe into all parts of the body, for the vſe
of this medicine is, when we haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to concoct and digeſt the crude and
rawe humours in the inner veines and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
of the bodie, and ſo to euapore them
by the pores of the skin, when we meane
to prouoke ſweate, vrine, and the courſes
of women, And therefore he will not haue
this medicine often vſed after meate. In
the medicine called <hi>Diaſpolitico<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> al the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
muſt be pounded in groſſe maner, for
ſo the medicine will more looſe the belly,
and by ſtaieng longer in the ſtomack, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concoction, if the things be finely
powdered into duſt: as the medicine will
little or not at all make the belly laxatiue,
ſo it will prouoke vrine and ſweate, to the
intention of this medicine.</p>
               <p>The like manner is to be obſerued in
confecting of <hi>Diatrion pipereon,</hi> that if an
intent be to haue the medicine ſtay in the
ſtomacke and guts to warme thoſe parts,
<pb facs="tcp:622:19"/>
to digeſt crude humours in them, or to
looſe the belly, the ſimples muſt be poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
groſſely: but if we haue a purpoſe to
open obſtructions, to warme the inner
veines, to prouoke vrine or ſweate: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
muſt be beaten into fine powder.
By which diſcourſe that queſtion is eaſily
anſwered, which ſome latter writers do
moue about the beating of the kindes of
pepper, whether the ſame ought to be
beaten finely or groſly. For ſome do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that pepper is alwaies to be beaten
groſly, for ſo it will remaine longer time
in the ſtomacke, and will the leſſe heate
the liuer and the blood. Some other doo
maintaine a contrary opinion, and that
by Galen himſelfe, who in the 5. booke
<hi>De ſanit. tuend. cap.</hi> 8. After meats which do
bread ſtoppages in the body, take (ſaith
he) the medicine called <hi>Diacalaminthe,</hi> and
if you haue not it ready, take <hi>Diatrion pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereon:</hi>
and if that be not at hand, take
white pepper beaten into fine powder, &amp;
diligently ſerſed, &amp; mingle the ſame with
the meate, and ſprinkle it to your drinke.
And in the ſame booke the 10. cap. Galen
preſcribeth a ptiſane in which the duſt or
fine powder of white pepper is mingled.
And in the 6. booke <hi>De ſanit. tuend. cap.</hi> 14.
<pb facs="tcp:622:19"/>
Galen giueth pepper alone, as finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as may be. By theſe counſels of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
theſe men do conclude that pepper
ought alway to be beaten into fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by Galens doctrine. Neuertheleſſe,
theſe men in mine opinion, do not with
diligent care co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider Galens intention in
theſe and the like places, neither well haue
marked the ſcope and cauſe why Galen in
theſe places doth aduiſe to pound pepper
into fine powder: for if they had well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
that Galen writeth: they might
haue vnderſtood, that he giueth pepper ſo
finely beaten, to remoue the obſtructions
and ſtoppages, for ſo before he did admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
that things beaten into thin powder
paſſe into the body better, and ſooner
do remoue obſtructions: and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that which is groſly beaten, doth
ſtay in the belly longer, and better warme
thoſe parts, better digeſt crude and rawe
humors gathered in them, and do more
effectually diſcuſſe wind: to theſe latter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
pepper is to be beaten groſly, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in this our country, in which men
commonly do ſeed vpon groſſe and ſlimy
meats, and ſo do heape in the parts of the
belly and firſt veines, manie crude and
groſſe humors, that pepper ought in this
<pb facs="tcp:622:20"/>
region to be beaten moſt groſly, that it
may therby be occaſioned to ſtay the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the belly, ſo to warme the ſame the
better, and the better to concoct and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
ſuch groſſe and crude humors, for
the heat of this medicine (as Galen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
is founded in ſo ſubtil a ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that
the ſame is extinguiſhed before it can
come to the liuer: then if you ſhall beate
the medicine finely, the heate wil ſo ſoone
be exhauſted and ſpent, that it will neither
ſufficiently warme the belly, neither in
good ſort concoct thoſe crude and rawe
humors. Wherefore I do thinke it verie
needfull for our apothecaries to pownd
pepper alway groſly in the medicine <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion
pipereon.</hi> For if we ſhall need withall to
open obſtructions, we may preſcribe the
medicine called <hi>Diacalaminthe,</hi> and ſo we
may mingle it to <hi>Diatrion pipereon,</hi> or as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſerueth giue it alone: wherefore I
hold it beſt to follow Galen his precept,
which is, that alway things be powdered
finely and in ſubtill manner when our
purpoſe is to remoue obſtructions, or to
digeſt, cut, and abſterge crude, rawe, ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and groſſe humors, which are in the
inner veines and habite of the body, or
meane to prouoke ſweat or vrine; but if
<pb facs="tcp:622:20"/>
our meaning be to increaſe heate in the
parts of the belly, to concoct humors
there, and in the firſt veines, or to make
the bellie looſe, then things are to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in groſſe powder.</p>

care is to be had leſt the ſame be carried
farther into the bodie. In this caſe <hi>Diatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pipereon</hi> ſimple, is with moſt ſecuritie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
And it is not enough to giue it once
or twiſe euery day, but it muſt be taken
often, in the morning before meate, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meat, &amp; when they go to bed, a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
at a time, and ſo to yonger folke and
which haue leſſe need, the leſſer quantity:
to elder and to them which haue more
need, the bigger quantity, ſo to the mean,
<pb facs="tcp:622:22"/>
the meaner quantitie is to be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>When crude humors are heaped in the
inner veines, and in the habit of the body,
the ſame are to be concocted, and alſo to
be expelled by breathing the ſame tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the pores of the skin, and to theſe
intents there is not a more conuenient
medicine knowen than <hi>Diacalaminthe,</hi> for
it hath propertie to extenuate thicke, and
ſlimy things, and then mooueth the ſame
to be expelled by breathing out at the
skin, and by vrine. And this medicine is
not vnpleaſant to be taken, if a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of honie be boiled with it, but
where ſome do not like of ſweet things,
and do abhor honie, to ſuch you muſt put
the leſſe honie, yet oftentimes euen in this
caſe it is good to boile good ſtore of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
ſo you boile it well, for then the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
will not be ouerſweet, and the honie
well boiled doth leſſe offend the ſtomack.
And the vſe of this medicine is in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
after frictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before exerciſe, &amp; before
bathing. And you may vſe this medicine
dry in powder without honie in ſteede of
ſalt for ſauce to your meate, and you may
put of it in a Ptiſane in ſteede of pepper.</p>
               <p>This medicine is vſed not onely dry in
<pb facs="tcp:622:23"/>
ſteede of ſalt, but alſo when honie is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for euen ſo it may be vſed with meate,
and ſo is it pleaſing to the taſte. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this, neither any other medicine
which hath ſtrong facultie to further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution,
is to be taken after meate. For
at that time nature goeth about concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of meate taken, and not to diſtribute
the ſame, therefore immediately after
meate, endeuor muſt be to further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by giuing <hi>Driatrion pipereon</hi> ſimple,
or to put ſome pepper powdered into
your drinke.</p>
               <p>If ſuch crudities hap to be not onely in
the belly and firſt veines, but alſo in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
veines, yea in the fleſhie parts of the
bodie: in this caſe at the beginning of the
cure, it is beſt to vſe <hi>Diatrion pipereon,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſo much of the ſeeds of perſley grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a drie &amp; ſtonie ground, as is put of
aniſe ſeedes, thyme, and ginger, and after
the firſt day, or rather after the ſeconde
day, you may put a little of <hi>Diacalaminth,</hi>
and then in a while after mingle both, I
meane <hi>Diatrion pipereon,</hi> and <hi>Diacalaminth,</hi>
in equall parts, and in proceſſe of time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the <hi>Diacalaminthe,</hi> ſo at the latter
end of the cure, you may vſe <hi>Diacalaminth</hi>
alone. So it is to be concluded in this, as
<pb facs="tcp:622:23"/>
in all maner of diets, when the effects are
equall, the medicines to cure, are equally
to be mixed, yet ſo that at the firſt grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
care be had of the crudities in the firſt
veines, and at the latter end, of thoſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
which are in the other veines and
habit of the bodie, in the middle time
both are equally according to the effect
to be mingled. Thus far Galen in his 4.
