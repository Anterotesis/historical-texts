         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Scope</hi> of this Text (which

is this, to ſtir up all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                  <p>The Text is ſhort, but the Leſſon
is long (that is) to live ſo now, as we
may die well at laſt, and, by our good
works, ſpeak when we are dead.</p>
                  <p>The Parts are two, which do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
two States of Man.</p>
                  <p>1. The ſtate of Death, <hi>[He being
dead]</hi> which is the privation of the
life of nature common to all men,
(on which frail life moſt men doat ſo
much, becauſe they have no care for,
nor hope of a better life.)</p>
                  <p>2. The ſtate of a Life after Death,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50117:7"/>
that is, the Life of Glory, implied in
theſe words <hi>[He ſpeaketh]</hi> for Speech
is the evidence of a living man: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
Abel</hi> though dead in the Body, yet
is ſtill alive in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is a Corroſive to the ſtate
of Nature, but the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second</hi> comes in as a Cordial to all
thoſe who are in the ſtate of Grace.</p>
                  <p>This Text appears much like the
Iſraelites Guide in the Wilderneſs;
'twas <hi>a Cloud,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 20. with Hebr. 12. E.</note> and that no ordinary
Cloud, but ſuch a Cloud as was <hi>Dark</hi>
on the one ſide, and <hi>Light</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, <hi>dark</hi> towards the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
but <hi>Light</hi> towards the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi>
Even ſo is <hi>Death,</hi> dark and ſad to the
Unbelievers and Impenitent, but
lightſome and welcome to all true
Penitents and Believers.</p>
                  <p>1. To begin with the firſt, <hi>The
ſtate of Death;</hi> Man in the ſtate of
Innocency was created capable of
three Lives; the Life Corporal, Life
Spiritual, and Life Eternal.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>the Life of Nature,</hi> a
Tranſitory Life.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is <hi>the Life of Grace,</hi> a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50117:8"/>
Life permanent upon condition of
perſeverance in uniform obedience
to God.</p>
                  <p>The third is <hi>Life Eternal, the Life
of Glory,</hi> the Life of the Saints Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant,
of the Elect Angels, yea
<hi>the Life of God himſelf,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 18.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Life immutable, interminable:</p>
                  <p>2. Two of theſe three Lives [the
Life natural and ſpiritual] man had
then in preſent <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> and the third
in a ſure <hi>reverſion</hi> after the expiration
of but one Life, and that a ſhort one
too, but a ſpan long; this preſent
life is no more, by King <hi>David</hi>'s juſt
meaſure:<note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold thou haſt made my
days, as it were a ſpan long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Man by his Apoſtaſie from God,
through the firſt original ſin of will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
incogitancy, and through pride,
did ſoon deprive himſelf of all theſe
three Lives at once, and ſo according
to the juſt ſentence of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
upon man aforehand (for a
fair warning) <hi>Morte moriêris,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou
ſhalt die the Death,</hi> man was juſtly
precipitated from that high ſtate of
Innocence into the baſe and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50117:8"/>
ſtate of ſin and miſery, whereby
every man, none excepted, (but the
God and man Chriſt Jeſus) is now by
original ſin become ſubject to a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Death, Firſt, <hi>Corporal,</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Spiritual,</hi> and thirdly (without
Repentance) <hi>Eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Death Corporal,</hi> which
is a total (but not final) ſeparation
of the Soul from the Body [the ſad
Real Text before our Eyes.]</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is <hi>Death Spiritual,</hi> a far
worſe kind of death, a ſtate of ſin,
which is a ſeparation of the ſoul from
the Grace and Favour of God which
is life it ſelf,<note place="margin">Pſal. 30. 5.</note> without which we are all
by nature,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,
Children of wrath,</hi> no better.</p>
                  <p>The third and worſt of all, is
<hi>Death Eternal,</hi> and therefore called
in Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">Revel. 20. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>The great Death,
the ſecond Death;</hi> becauſe it is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
total and eternal ſeparation of
both Soul and Body, from the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preſence, Beatifical Viſion, and
admirable and unſpeakable Fruition
of God himſelf; whom as to ſerve
here on Earth is the <hi>Life of Grace,</hi> ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50117:9"/>
to enjoy in Heaven is the <hi>Life of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
which is life everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>4. The firſt of theſe three <hi>[Death
Temporal]</hi> none of us can avoid; die
we muſt, die we ſhall, God prepare
us all for it: But as the thing, Death,
is certain for the matter, ſo for the
manner, <hi>how</hi> we ſhall die, in, or out
of our wits, as in Frenzies, <hi>&amp;c. where</hi>
we ſhall die, amongſt Friends or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Foes; <hi>when</hi> we ſhall die, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in youth or in old Age; how
we ſhall die, whether by a ſuddain,
violent, or painful Death (which
God in mercy avert from us all)
none of us all knows: and therefore
our beſt courſe is, while we may (by
a lively faith, timely repentance, and
real amendment of life) to prepare
for Death;<note n="*" place="margin">St. Aug.</note> and then come Death
in what ſhape it will,<note place="margin">de Diſcipl.</note> and welcome,
we ſhall not die unprepared.<note place="margin">cap. 2. non poteſt malè mori qui benè vixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Audeo dicere, non poteſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lè mori qui benè vixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> Yet it
concerns us all frequently and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to think of theſe great <hi>Quatuor
noviſſima [Death, Judgment, Heaven</hi>
and <hi>Hell.]</hi> 'Tis <hi>Moſes</hi> his paſſionate

                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Since 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for all men once to die, and
after that comes Judgment.</hi> The Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Tranſlation renders it <hi>ſtatutum
eſt,</hi> Death is an univerſal Statute,
Law to all mankind; and ſo it is both
for authority of coaction, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of execution, for it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon two of the greateſt Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of God, which are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God's infallible Truth;</hi> for the
Commination was directed unto man,
and that alſo in mercy, to forwarn
him that he might not ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God's exact Justice,</hi>
which requires the execution of the
Divine Sentence, to be done upon
the ſame nature that had ſinned.
Man did ſin, therefore man muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that is, man muſt die; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> was the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
Root, and General Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
of all mankind <hi>(Adam</hi>'s off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring)
therefore all men muſt die
(pray God we all may die well) or if
they live to the end of the world,
yet they muſt ſuffer <hi>a Change</hi> at the
leaſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 51.</note> at the laſt, which Change what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50117:10"/>

of the event of Death, drew

for the ſurviving noble Relations

that, if they could, with their
wiſhes and tears, waft him over back
from Heaven to labour again on
Earth, they would not do it, if they
loved him indeed, and not rather
themſelves. 'Tis an excellent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of <hi>Iſidore Peluſiota</hi> (he lived

on theſe words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's

                  <p>12. We paſs now to <hi>the Doctrinal

but we know that dead men are
ſpeechleſs, and that ſpeech is both a

a <hi>Speech Analogical,</hi> by ſuch a Figure

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Abel being dead, yet

                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>4. He was <hi>Vice-Chancellour</hi> of that
Univerſity <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. when he had
the honour to ſend the publick Plate
to the King, then in his Receſs, to
ſupply in part his Princes neceſſity
for the preſent; and then alſo I had
the honour to be admitted Doctor of
Divinity between his hands, and with
his Benediction.</p>
                     <p>5. He came to be <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>

and Allegiance, to become a <hi>Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
Man</hi> for near upon 20 years.
Here by the way, I may inſert an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi>
(it may be called a <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)</hi>
that as I am informed, Doctor
<hi>Eaſedale</hi> in the year 1636. gave him
ſome ſmall thing upon condition he
ſhould pay a greater ſumm when he
were made a Biſhop: Such was the
expectation men of underſtanding
had then of his future greatneſs. For,</p>
                     <p>6. Upon the Kings wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration,
He was by His Majeſty
firſt <hi>deſigned Dean of Durham;</hi> but
upon the Kings Gracious Reflection
on his conſtant Attendance and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
beyond the Seas, he was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the King, of a Dean intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to be the Actual <hi>Biſhop of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
His immediate <hi>Predeceſſour</hi> was
that great Luminary of our Church,
Bleſſed <hi>Thomas Morton,</hi> famous for his
Holy Life, ſolid Learning, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
works of Charity and Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and for his manifold learned
Works againſt the Adverſaries of the

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50117:33"/>
and on the left; as for the Doctrine
againſt Hereticks, ſo for the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
againſt the Schiſmaticks of his
time, beyond any ſatisfactory Anſwer
to any of his Works unto this day:
To whoſe Memory I ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful,

that I had for above an

                     </p>
                     <p>To be <hi>Biſhop of Durham</hi> is no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

it includes the <hi>Temporal</hi> Power
of <hi>Count Palatine of Durham and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge;</hi>
a ſingular <hi>Synaſtria,</hi> as I may

that we are all

them not, they
do ſo ſtill, as by their

of the moſt High now Biſhop

that other (which is to come) eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
in the Heavens, and which by
the mercy of God ere long I hope to
obtain, and humbly praying for the
ſalvation of my own Soul, that
through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt,
the Son of the living God, our only
Redeemer and Mediator, all mine
offences be forgiven me; being of a
ſound mind, out of a ſincere heart, do
make, ordain and conſtitute this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
containing my Laſt Will, in
this form as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, I heartily thank our
Lord God Almighty, that he hath
vouchſafed me to be born in this life
of faithful and vertuous Parents; and
that it hath pleaſed him that I ſhould
be Regenerate (and born a new in
his Church) unto Life Eternal by the
holy Laver of Baptiſm, which he hath
inſtituted; and that he hath inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me from my Youth in ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and hath made me partaker
of his Saints, that he hath imprinted
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50117:68"/>
in my mind a Faith not feigned nor
dead, but true and living, together
with a firm confidence, that hereafter
I ſhall be brought unto eternal life;
which Faith doubtleſs conſiſts in this,
That we adore and worſhip one God,
and believe in him, and in him whom
he hath ſent, his moſt beloved Son
the Eternal Word, begotten before
all Ages, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; who
for us and for our Salvation took fleſh
of the moſt bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (the
Holy Ghoſt over-ſhading her) in this
life, and was made man, afterward
was born, ſuffered, was crucified,
dead and buried, and after he had
deſcended into Hell, roſe again from
his Grave, and leading captivity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
aſcended into Heaven, where
ſitting at the right hand of God, he
reigneth for ever; but ſent from
thence the Holy Ghoſt (in whom we
ought equally to believe) proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Father and the Son, by
whom he moſt bountifully gave gifts
unto men, and founded his Catholick
Church in the Communion of Saints,
in the Divine Sacraments, in true
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50117:69"/>
Faith, ſound Doctrine, and Chriſtian
Manners; together with the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Sins, to be conferred on all
the Godly, and that in the ſame
Church bring forth fruits meet for
Repentance; to whom alſo when in
the laſt day of the world he ſhall
come from Heaven to raiſe the dead
and judge all, he will give eternal
happineſs; but to the reſt that are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
or that have lived according
to the fleſh, and would not repent or
be converted, he will inflict eternal
puniſhment. In this Faith, which is
the ſummary and moſt abſolute A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement
of all the Holy Scripture
<hi>(Jude</hi> verſ. 3.) <hi>once delivered to the
Saints,</hi> and which the Apoſtles and
their Succeſſors have ſpread abroad
and derived down even to us, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
my ſelf to live, and that I may
perſevere in it conſtantly without
doubting unto my laſt breath is my
daily prayer; in the mean time ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after Unity by preſerving the
bond of Peace and Love with all
Chriſtians every where, who among
the great Evils, Diſtractions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50117:69"/>
of the Church (which truly
I cannot but heartily bewail) entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive this Faith, and call no one
part of it in queſtion. I hope alſo
through the goodneſs of God and
Chriſt, God and Man our Saviour,
that all they that have together with
us ſincerely believed theſe things
that are revealed and delivered from
God, and have lived a Godly life,
ſhall be ſaved in the great day of the
Lord: who although they are not
able to give an account, or explain
the manner of every of them, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
the queſtions raiſed about them,
and though perhaps when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
it they cannot avoid ſome
miſtakes, and be altogether free from
errour.</p>
                  <p>But whatſoever Hereſies or Schiſms
heretofore, by what names ſoever
they be called, the antient Catholick
and Univerſal Church of Chriſt with
an unanimous conſent hath rejected
and condemned, I do in like manner
condemn and reject; together with
all the modern Fautors of the ſame
Hereſies, Sectaries and Phanaticks,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50117:70"/>
who being carried on with an evil
Spirit do falſely give out they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
of God: The Hereſies and
Schiſmes, I ſay of all theſe, I alſo as
moſt addicted to the Symbols, Synods
and Confeſſions of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> or rather the Catholick
Church, do conſtantly renounce, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
and reject. Among whom I
rank not only the Separatiſts, the
Anabaptiſts and their Followers,
(Alas) too too many, but alſo the
New Independents and Preſbyterians
of our Countrey, a kind of men hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with the ſpirit of Malice,
Diſobedience and Sedition, who by
a diſloyal attempt (the like whereof
was never heard ſince the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan)
have of late committed ſo many
great and execrable Crimes, to the
contempt and deſpite of Religion,
and the Chriſtian Faith, which how
great they were without horrour
cannot be ſpoken or mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Moreover I do profeſs, with holy
aſſeveration and from my very heart,
that I am now, and have ever been
from my youth altogether free and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50117:70"/>
averſe from the corruptions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
new-fangled or papiſtical
(ſo commonly called) ſuperſtitions
and doctrines, and new ſuperadditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Ancient and Primitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and Faith of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
ſo Orthodox and Catholick
Church, long ſince introduced, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Holy Scripture, and the
Rules and Cuſtomes of the ancient
Fathers.</p>
                  <p>But in what part of the World ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
any Churches are extant, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the name of Chriſt, and profeſſing
the true Catholick Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
worſhipping and calling upon
God the Father, the Son and the
Holy Ghoſt with one heart and voice,
if any where I be now hindred actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to be joyned with them, either
by diſtance of Countries, or variance
amongſt men, or by any other let
whatſoever; yet alwayes in my mind
and affection I joyn and unite with
them; which I deſire to be chiefly
underſtood of Proteſtants, and the
beſt Reformed Churches; for where
the foundations are ſafe, we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50117:71"/>
and therefore moſt friendly, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
and peaceably ſuffer, in thoſe
Churches where we have not Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
a diverſity as of Opinion ſo of
Ceremonies about things which do
but adhere to the Foundations, and
are neither neceſſary or repugnant
to the practice of the Univerſal
Church. As for all them who
through Evil Counſel have any way
inveighed againſt, or calumniated
me, and even yet do not forbear their
invectives, I freely pardon them, and
earneſtly pray to God, that he alſo
would be pleaſed to forgive them,
and inſpire them with a better mind.
In the mean while, I take it to be
my duty, and of all my Brethren,
eſpecially the Biſhops and Miniſters
of the Church of God, to do our
utmoſt endeavours, according to the
meaſure of Grace which is given to
every one of us, that at laſt an end
may be put to the differences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or at leaſt that they may be
leſſened, and that we may follow
<hi>Peace with all men and Holineſs;</hi>
which that it may be accompliſhed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50117:71"/>
very ſpeedily, God the Author of
Peace and Concord grant, whoſe
infinite Mercy I humbly beſeech,
that he would cleanſe me, who was
conceived in Sin and Iniquity, from
every ſpot and corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailty; and that through his
great clemency he would make me
who am unworthy to become wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
and that he would apply to
me the Paſſion and infinite Merits
of his moſt beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt
our Lord, to the expiating of all
mine Offences; that at the laſt hour
of my Life, which I daily look for,
I may be carried by his Holy Angels
into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and being
placed in the fellowſhip of his Saints
and Elect, may fully enjoy Eternal
Felicity.</p>
                  <p>Having now declared what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to my Religion, and the
State and Salvation of my Soul,
which I have now delivered
here in Latine: The reſt that
belongs to my Burial, and the
diſpoſal of my Temporal Eſtate,
