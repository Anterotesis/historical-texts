         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Entreat You, by the Common Principles of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
that You would ſeriouſly Peruſe what
I have here written, Conſidering that within a
ſhort Time both You, and I ſhall be Call'd out of this
World, to give Account of all our Doings, to the
<hi>Maker of all Things, and Judge of all Men.</hi> Since you
Profeſs, you believe all the Sayings of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
I pray conſider theſe ſacred Words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8.
<q>Bleſſed are the pure in Heart, for they ſhall ſee
GOD.</q> I ſuppoſe You will not Deny, but that <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Heart</hi> conſiſts in the True Love of God, and
our Neighbour. It ſeems to me, that you are Guilty
of great Irreverence towards the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> in
that You throw out ſuch Words as theſe at every
Turn: <q>Good God! But Good God then, &amp;c. Bleſs me!</q>
again and again. You ſhew your ſelf to be moſt Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly

<q>In plain Terms, ſay you, the Prieſts of all ſorts

               <q>The Prieſts of all Ages have rather ſtrove, as a
Faction of Men, to raiſe themſelves Great, than to
ſeek through Self-denial, and Humility for the truly
Glorious and Incorruptible Crown.</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe

he cannot but Reflect upon the Reproach you
caſt upon the Prieſts of all Ages, with the greateſt
Abhorrency, and Deteſtation. This Black Turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency

It is very ſuitable to your impious Boaſting, in
calling what you write in your Second Sheet, <q>
                  <hi>A clear
Confutation of the Trinity.</hi>
               </q> Before we Reflect upon

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Are there no Texts in the Goſpel, where
Chriſt himſelf Preacht up the Father to be the One,

himſelf, Pray repeat them, if there be.</p>
               <p>

            </q>
            <p>Theſe words do no

               <q>To
ſay of Three Perſons each ſeverally God, that they

Three Men are One.</q>

is as manifeſtly Falſe, as it is to ſay, There is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between an <hi>Infinite,</hi> and a <hi>Finite Nature,</hi> or
Eſſence. I ſhall here recite ſome of the words of my
brief Animadverſion on <hi>The Naked Goſpel.</hi> 
               <q>Is there
any thing more Reaſonable, than to conceive, that
in God, the One Infinite Eſſence, there may be a
Certain <hi>Trinity,</hi> which cannot in any wiſe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to any Three Perſons of a <hi>Finite Nature?</hi> Can
there ever be a more Impious Abſurdity than this,
to Deny the Truth of that which the Almighty, and
Incomprehenſible GOD, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy
Ghoſt,</hi> in whoſe Name we are BAPTIZED, has
Reveal'd unto us concerning Himſelf, becauſe we
cannot find any thing like it, even amongſt the Beſt
of his Creatures? To ſay, that we ought not to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
any thing, but what our Reaſon can <hi>Fathom,</hi>
or <hi>Comprehend,</hi> is in effect to ſay, We ought not to
Believe there is a GOD, it being <hi>Eſſential</hi> to the
<hi>Deity</hi> to <hi>Be</hi> infinitely beyond the <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> of
our Reaſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In your <hi>Dialogue</hi> you ſay, that our Saviour is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

You, as you believe there is a God, and that theſe
words which you recite, were written by <hi>Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,</hi>

Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?

               <p>8, But unto the Son he ſaith, Thy throne, O God,

ſceptre of thy kingdom:</p>
               <p>9, Thou haſt loved righteouſneſs, and hated iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;

Son is God, and the Holy Ghoſt is God; and yet they are
not Three Gods, but One God,</hi> becauſe the Onely Wiſe
God himſelf in the Holy Scriptures has Reveal'd it unto
us. <q>Our Trinitarians would tell us, ſay you, that
God is the moſt pure and ſimple Being; and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
they can ſay, That he is Three Perſons, and has
Three Wills, and Three Underſtandings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
Nothing can be more Falſe than to ſay, That we hold
that God has Three Wills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we grant, that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a Contradiction to ſay, There are not <hi>Three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
Numerically Diſtinct, where there are <hi>Three
Wills,</hi> and <hi>Three <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings,</hi> as in Three Men we
affirm, That The Father, The Son, and The Holy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109237:5"/>
Ghoſt, as they have One Divine Nature, have but
One Will, and One Underſtanding: But God the Son,
as he has Two Natures, the Divine, and Humane,
has Two Wills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but his Humane Will is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
united to the Divine Will in all things: It was
ſo in all his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> which were the Objects of his
<hi>Averſion,</hi> being conſider'd as in themſelves, but of his
<hi>Volition,</hi> being conſider'd as the Effects of the <hi>Divine
Will.</hi> This calls me to an Animadverſion on thoſe
words, which I tremble to recite. I am confident,
no truly Learned ſincere Chriſtian, that was to write
in Confutation of the Religion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> would
pour out ſuch <hi>Contumelious</hi> Speeches againſt <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
and his Followers, as you do againſt the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
Our LORD, and Our GOD, and againſt Us, his
Followers, Your <hi>Preſent Myſtery-men, and Metaphyſical
Mad-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sometimes, ſay you, by a kind of <hi>Ventriloquy</hi> they
make Chriſt, as God, to be able to tell us all things,
but by, and by again, as Man, they attribute Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to him. So ſometimes again, they make him
Omnipotent, and yet by, and by again <hi>Hocus pocus,</hi>
we muſt have an Angel to comfort him againſt his
Sufferings. Good God! ſhall we never be deliver'd
from theſe Labyrinths.</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do not attribute
Ignorance to Chriſt, as the word Ignorance ſignifies
Imperfection, <hi>viz.</hi> Any <hi>want of Knowledge,</hi> but as it
ſignifies ſimply, <hi>Not knowing all Things.</hi> Such Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
the moſt Perfect Finite Underſtanding muſt be
ſubject unto: And Chriſt's Underſtanding, as Man,
is Finite. Upon ſuppoſition that He ſubjected Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to Sufferings, where's the Abſurdity that he ſhould
be Comforted (by an Angel) in that Nature, in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109237:5"/>
which he ſuffered? But, ſay you, <q>What! Did only
the Man dye? Was only the Man Tempted? Chriſt
then was but inhabited by the God-head; and when
the Man was in his ſtreights, God left him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
himſelf, but where is the Room for the Merit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

and Sufferings of the God-head then?</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God
the Son <hi>Aſſum'd,</hi> or United to himſelf the <hi>Humane
Nature,</hi> that ſo he might be capable of Suffering, to
Demonſtrate that the HOLY ONE hates Sin, with
an infinite Hatred, and loves Men, tho' SINNERS,
with an infinite Love. In which Demonſtration of
the <hi>Divine Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> towards <hi>Men,</hi> is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the greateſt <hi>Efficacy,</hi> that can be to bring <hi>Sinners</hi>
to <hi>Repentance.</hi> So that the Onely Cauſe that any
<hi>Sinner</hi> does not <hi>Repent,</hi> is the <hi>Perverſeneſs of his own
Will,</hi> in that he <hi>Shuts his Eyes</hi> againſt this Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
and ſo <hi>Rejects</hi> the Offer of the Onely <hi>Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Remedy</hi> for all his Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>I beſeech Almighty God by the Death and Paſſion
of the <hi>Holy Jeſus,</hi> who together with <hi>The Father,</hi>
and <hi>The Holy Ghoſt</hi> is Worſhipped, and Glorified, to
have Mercy upon you, to give you true Repentance,
and his Holy Spirit, that you may be <hi>Reconcil'd unto
God,</hi> before you ſhall <hi>Go from hence, and be no more ſeen.</hi>

VINDICATION
OF THE
DOCTRINE
OF
Mr. RICHARD HOOKER, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Anti-Trinitarian</hi> tells the World, and that
truly, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith, <q>That the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of God with this Property <hi>To be of
None,</hi> doth make the Perſon of the Father; The
very ſelf-ſame Subſtance in Number with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
<hi>To be of the Father,</hi> maketh the Perſon of the
Son; The ſame Subſtance having added to it the
Property of <hi>Proceeding from the other Two,</hi> maketh
the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt. So that in every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
there is imply'd both the Subſtance of God, which
is One, and alſo that Property which cauſeth the
ſame Perſon really and truly to differ from the other
Two.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On theſe words of the Excellent Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> this
Diſputer maketh this Animadverſion. <q>Now to be of
none, to be of the Father, and to proceed from both,
are but other words for this Senſe, <hi>To Beget, to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109237:6"/>
and to Proceed.</hi> But that Father of Modern
O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thodoxy, <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> denies that theſe before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
are Properties in the Subſtance of God,
or that they can belong to it: He ſaith, <hi>Eſſentia n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
eſt Generans, nec Generata, nec Procedens, i. e.</hi> The
Subſtance of God neither Begets, nor is Begotten,
nor Proceeds. 'Tis impoſſible to make this conſiſt
with Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who expreſly aſcribeth thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
to the Divine Subſtance, or Eſſence, and ſaith
that being in the Divine Subſtance they make it to be
Three Perſons.</q> To this I anſwer, That Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
does not Contradict <hi>Peter Lombard:</hi> For 'tis Evident
his meaning is this, That the Divine Subſtance, or
Eſſence, as in the Father, <hi>is of None,</hi> as in the Son,
<hi>is of the Father,</hi> as in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>is of the Father,
and of the Son.</hi> The Property belongs to the <hi>Perſon,</hi>
and not to the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> as Communicable to Three
Perſons. <q>In every Perſon, ſays Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> there is
implied both the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of God, which is One;
and alſo that <hi>Property,</hi> which cauſeth the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
really and truly to differ from the other Two.</q> It
is a moſt palpable Falſhood which this Man delivers in
theſe words: <q>Here is the ſame Subſtance Unbegot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and Begotten.</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Perſon of the Son is
Begotten, in that he hath his Subſtance, or Eſſence of,
or from the Father; he would ſeem to <hi>Obviate</hi> this
Anſwer in theſe words: <q>They will ſay, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
doth not affirm, that the ſelf-ſame Subſtance is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and Unbegotten; this indeed were a ſlat
Contradiction: But he ſaith, That as 'tis in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
'tis Unbegotten, as in the Son, 'tis Begotten</q>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a moſt notorious Falſhood: Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
does not aſſert, That the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> as in the Son, is <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:109237:7"/>
but that the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the Son is <hi>Begotten,</hi> in
that he hath his Eſſence of, or from the <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now conſider what a <hi>Faſt Friend</hi> this <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter</hi>
is to the <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> i. e. The Deſpiſers of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
has ſo judiciouſly and irrefragably Defended. <q>What
ſhall we do here, ſays He, ſhall we ſay Reverend
<hi>Hooker</hi> has miſtaken, and miſ-led his Sons (who are
all the Church of <hi>England</hi>) into an Error concerning
the Trinity? Hath he aſcrib'd to the Divine Eſſence
Properties which he calleth Perſons, that are not in
it? To give up <hi>Hooker,</hi> is to diſhonour the Church of
<hi>England</hi> it ſelf; to part with Father <hi>Hooker,</hi> is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangerthe
very <hi>Surplice,</hi> and even the <hi>Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi>
nay that Book of Books, the Common-Prayer. If Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi> could Err about the Trinity, what will the
<hi>Phanaticks</hi> and <hi>Trimmers</hi> ſay? Will not they be apt to
pretend too, He may have Erred in his profound
Diſſertations, and Diſcourſes for the Rites and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I appeal to any Perſon of common Ingenuity
in the whole World to Judge, whether I had not Juſt
Cauſe to Publiſh that Paper Entitled, <q>An earneſt Call
to thoſe Non-conformiſts, who really Believe the
Doctrine of the Holy Bleſſed, and Glorious Trinity,

the Chriſtian Faith, they may Confound the Devices
of thoſe <hi>Gain-ſayers,</hi> whom by their Separation they

            </p>
            <p>I cannot imagine how 'tis poſſible, that any <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt,</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>The

ſound more Heavenly in the Ears of Faithful Men,
are now reckoned as ſuperfluities, which we muſt in
any caſe pare away, leſt we cloy God with too
much Service. Is there in that Confeſſion of Faith
any thing, which doth not at all times edify, and
inſtruct the attentive Reader? Or is our Faith in the
Bleſſed Trinity a matter needleſs to be ſo oftentimes
mention'd and open'd in the principal Part of that
Duty which we owe to God, our Publick Prayer?
Hath the Church of Chriſt from the firſt beginning
by a ſecret univerſal inſtinct of God's good Spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
tied it ſelf to end neither Sermon, nor almoſt
any Speech, which hath concern'd matters of God
without ſome ſpecial words of Honour, and Glory
to that Trinity, which we all adore; and is the like
Concluſion of Pſalms become now at the length an
Eye-ſore, or a Gauling to their Ears that hear it?</p>
                  <p>Againſt which Poiſon (<hi>Arianiſm</hi>) if we think that
the Church at this Day needeth not thoſe ancient
Preſervatives, which Ages before us were ſo glad to
uſe, we deceive our ſelves greatly. The Weeds of
Hereſy being grown to ſuch Ripeneſs, as that was,
do even in the cutting down ſcatter oftentimes thoſe
Seeds, which for a while lay unſeen, and buried in
the Earth, but afterwards freſhly ſpring up again,
no leſs Pervicacious than at the firſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing here of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Opinion of
the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> having ſaid enough of it
elſewhere: But I muſt Aver to all the World, that this
<hi>Perſon of Quality</hi> deals moſt Ingentilely, and Diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly
with the Learned <hi>Animadverter,</hi> in Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to Perſwade the Reader to Conceit, that this
Worthy Perſon wou'd <hi>Enjoin</hi> him to Believe any thing
concerning the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> but what every Man,
that Profeſſeth himſelf to be a Member of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> (if he do not ſwerve from all the Principles
of common Honeſty) does really Believe. The <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter</hi>
does not deſire, that any man ſhould Aſſent
to what he ſays againſt Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> in the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> any farther than as he
may be Convinc'd by the Force of his Arguments.
Here I think it my Duty to wipe off one of the fouleſt
Aſperſions that have been caſt upon the <hi>Animadverter,
viz.</hi> That he is the Firſt Man amongſt all the Sons of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that ever ſhewed ſuch a Diſlike
to Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Book Entitled, <hi>A Diſcourſe of the
Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as if he did it meerly out of
Spight, having no rational Inducement thereunto. I
am certain that about Eight Years ſince, there was
ſent to Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> from a Divine of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> (whom the worſt of his Enemies will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be far enough from any <hi>Prieſt-Craft</hi>) a large
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109237:11"/>
Letter, containing a Refutation of ſeveral of the groſs,
and moſt deteſtable Errors in that Book. Some Part of
that Letter I ſhall here recite. <q>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was
not a Faith in Chriſt, ſay You: But the holy Apoſtle
ſays expreſly, that <hi>The Goſpel was preached unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
Now if <hi>Abraham</hi> Believ'd the <hi>Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
unto him, did he not Believe in <hi>Chriſt?</hi> The
words of our Saviour, which you recite, do moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
Prove, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was Faith in
Chriſt: <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 56. Your Father <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoiced
to ſee my Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was not of your
Mind; his words on this Text are theſe: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.
The ſame Truth is At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
by St. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> 
               <q>Hunc Vidit Abraham in
iſto Sacrificio. Hujus Paſſionem Aſpexit: Et ideo
ipſe Dominus ait de eo, Abraham Diem meum Vidit,
&amp; Gaviſus eſt.</q> Let us now return to our Hiſtorian:
<q>'Tis very obſervable, ſays he, <hi>p.</hi> 99. that <hi>For real
Hereſies of the Fleſh</hi> there are no Inquiſitions ſet up,
nor any particular Perſecutions; not for Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or Whoredom, or other Vices: They increaſe
as much by Temptation and Example, as thoſe ſort
of Vices can; and yet were never made Objects of
the (pretended) pious Zeal, or of any Perſecution.</q>
I cannot give a ſofter Term to this, than that of a
Notorious LYE: For can any Engliſh Man, that
knows any thing of the <hi>Proceedings of our Eccleſiaſtical
Courts</hi> be ignorant of this: That at the Biſhop's Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
all Parſons, Vicars, and Curates; at the Arch-Deacon's
Viſitation, the Church-Wardens are Bound
to <hi>Preſent</hi> Drunkards, common Swearers, Fornicators,

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109237:11"/>
LAUD never ſhew'd himſelf more Zealous in any
thing, than in the Proſecution of a Great LADY, for
Living in Adultery. I ſhall here relate the whole Story
as I find it in <hi>Cyprianus Anglicus,</hi> p. 266.</p>
            <q>The Lady <hi>Purbeck,</hi> Wife of Sir <hi>John Villers,</hi> Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Purbeck,</hi> the Elder Brother by the ſame <hi>Venter</hi>
to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> had been brought into
the High Commiſſion, <hi>Anno</hi> 1627. for Living open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Adultery with Sir <hi>John Howard,</hi> one of the
Younger Sons of <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Firſt Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi>
of that Family, Sentenc'd among other things to do
Penance at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, ſhe eſcap'd her Keepers,
took Sanctuary in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and was from thence
convey'd away by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador. The Duke
being dead, all further Proſecution againſt her dyed
alſo with him; which notwithſtanding the Proud
Woman being more terrified with the fear of the
the Shame, than the ſence of the Sin, vented her
malice and diſpleaſure againſt the Arch-Biſhop (who
had been very ſevere againſt her at the time of her
Tryal) when he was come unto his Greatneſs, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Tongue upon him in words ſo full of deep
Diſgrace, and Reproach unto him; that he could do
no leſs than cauſe her to be laid in the Gate-Houſe:
But being not long after deliver'd thence by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of <hi>Howard</hi> aforemention'd, <hi>Howard</hi> was ſeiz'd
upon, and laid up in her Place; which Puniſhment,
tho' it was the leaſt that could be lookt for, he ſo
highly Stomach'd, that as ſoon as the Arch-Biſhop
was Impeach'd by the Houſe of Commons, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Cuſtody by the Lords (which happened on
Friday <hi>Decemb.</hi> 18. 1640.) he Petition'd for Relief
againſt the Arch-Biſhop, and ſome others of the high
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109237:12"/>
Commiſſioners, by whom the Warrant had been
ſign'd. The Lords upon the reading of it, impos'd a
Fine of 500 <hi>l.</hi> on the Arch-Biſhop, and 250 a piece
upon <hi>Lamb,</hi> and <hi>Duck,</hi> and preſt it with ſuch cruel
Rigour, that they forced him to ſell his Plate to make
Payment of it, the Fine being ſet on <hi>Monday</hi> 21 of
<hi>December,</hi> and Order'd to be paid on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> after.</q>
            <p>Let any ſincere Chriſtian in any Part of the World
that has ever heard this Story be Judge, whether this
moſt Reverend Prelate were not <hi>Perſecuted for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
ſake.</hi> Moſt certainly the <hi>Wrath of God</hi> ſhall
Burn throughout all Generations againſt the Poſterity
of his <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> if they Approve the MURTHER,
which their <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> Committed, and againſt all
others, who ſhall ever undertake to Vindicate that
<hi>Diabolical</hi> falſe Pretence of Juſtice. I pray God that
all the Enemies of Truth, and Goodneſs, particularly
the <hi>Anti-Trinitarians,</hi> may know and feel the Power
and Efficacy of theſe ſacred words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 44.
