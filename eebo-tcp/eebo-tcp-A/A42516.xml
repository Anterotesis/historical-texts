         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IT muſt be granted, That the Publick
have been juſt in the kind Reception
they have given to the LETTERS
of Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> now the Right Reverend Biſhop
of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> concerning his Voyage to <hi>Italy.</hi>
The Truth of his Relations hath been own'd
by all thoſe who have had the Curioſity to
Viſit thoſe Countries, and given occaſion to
the Learned, to make curious Reflections
upon them. But above all I have obſerved,
That the Paſſages He hath inſerted by the
By (about ſome of their Religious Practices)
have particularly pleaſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation,
who (above all) abominate <hi>Popery.</hi> 'Tis this
Conſideration at firſt, that begat a Deſire in
me to publiſh many other Particulars on this
Subject, eſpecially upon the Lives and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of <hi>Romiſh Priests</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:57009:5"/>
were known to me, as having been a <hi>Secular
Prieſt</hi> of the ſame Church, and could not
come ſo eaſily to the Knowledge of others.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why I was ſo Inquiſitive, is
ſet down at the Beginning of my Firſt
LETTER: I ſhall only add, That thoſe
who are acquainted with the Spirit of <hi>Rome,</hi>
will find no difficulty to believe the Matters
of Fact here related, and much leſs to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their Credit in denying them, ſince
they are ſtill expos'd to Publick View; and
as many as go thither, may be ſo many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of them.</p>
            <p>If at any time I make uſe of ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
which may ſeem to have too much
<hi>Lightneſs</hi> in them, I deſire my Reader, to
attribute this to the <hi>Subject;</hi> and to conſider,
That as Serious Things ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
in a <hi>Jocular Style;</hi> ſo neither is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to utter Ridiculous Matters with a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Gravity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do I believe, That the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will
have any reaſon to Complain of me, as they
commonly do of thoſe that Leave them;
ſaying, <hi>That they make it their chief buſineſs,
to Expoſe them without Bounds or Meaſure.</hi>
For the Truth is, I have ſtill Matter enough
<pb facs="tcp:57009:5"/>
in ſtore, to fill another Volume as big as
this, which might ſerve for a <hi>Second Part:</hi>
But I chooſe to ſtop here, and give them an
occaſion rather of Commending my Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
than of Complaining of my doing
Too much.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Foraſmuch as thoſe <hi>Obſervations</hi>
made in my <hi>Travels,</hi> have much conduced
to the Change of my <hi>Religion;</hi> ſo (I truſt in
God) the Publication of them will have a
good effect upon others, by Opening the
Eyes of the People of the <hi>Roman Church;</hi>
by Diſcouraging thoſe that Seduce them;
and by putting <hi>Proteſtants</hi> upon Rendring
hearty Thanks to God, for having delivered
them from ſo Miſerable a <hi>Slavery.</hi>

               <p>YOU have not forgot, Sir, that in the laſt
Converſation we had together in <hi>France</hi>
upon the account of Religion, I made
you acknowledge, That the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi>
was more ſuitable to Reaſon, than the <hi>Romiſh,</hi>
which you profeſs. It is true, that by an evaſion,
more ſubtle than ſolid, you was pleaſed to call that
Reaſon, <hi>Human Reaſon,</hi> ſupported by Senſe, which
you ſaid, was the Rock on which the purity of
Faith commonly ſplits and ſuffers Shipwrack;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57009:10"/>
and that you deſired Faith to be the Foundation
of your Religion, with excluſion of every thing
elſe; and as you, with your Divines, freely owned
an hundred ſeveral Miracles in Tranſubſtantiation,
you were pleaſed to tell me, That that was a
Myſtery of Faith, which ought rather to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
adored, than raſhly pry'd into. Whereupon,
when I took the liberty to tell you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That in the
mean time, foraſmuch as my Reaſon was given
me by God, to make uſe of it in the ſearching out
the Truth, I could not but think it hard, to reject
the Light it offers, ſeeing that without it I was
like one, who being fallen into a deep Water, and
finding no bottom to foot upon, is drown'd and
loſt. You Reply'd, That if I inclin'd to follow
Reaſon, you would ſoon furniſh me with Guides
able to ſatisfie an honeſt Mind; and that I
needed only to caſt my Eye on ſo many Learned
Men, both Monks and Prieſts, who are the Light
of the World, the main Props and Pillars of the
Church, who by the Integrity of their Life, and
the Purity of their Doctrin, uphold the Temple of
God here upon Earth; That it was morally
impoſſible, that ſo many Learned Men ſhould all of
them be involved in Error; and that the agreeing
Conſent of ſo many Excellent Spirits, appear'd to
you a ſufficiently firm Foundation to eſtabliſh and
fix a Reaſonable Mind. You proceeded to ſpeak
to me with earneſtneſs, of the Modeſty that
becomes thoſe who have only a mean Capacity;
which you know, I was ſo far from being offended
at, that on the contrary, as being better than any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57009:10"/>
one elſe acquainted with my own Mediocrity,
I thank'd you for your Advice; adding, That
how uſeful otherwiſe it might be, yet ought it not
to ſtop me in my ſearch after Truth. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as ſome time after, partly out of Devotion,
and partly out of Curioſity, I hapned to undertake a
Voyage into <hi>Italy,</hi> and upon that occaſion calling
to mind, how in my Scruples about Religion you
had referred me to your Prieſts and Monks, I
made it my buſineſs, more than otherwiſe I would
have done, to examine their Life and Conduct, to
try whether I could find them a ſufficient and
rational Foundation, as you pretend, to aſſure and
confirm a perſon, who already began to doubt of
the truth of your Principles. And it ſeems indeed,
That God took a particular care, to diſpoſe all
things towards my full and ſatisfactory Information
herein during the whole courſe of my Travels.</p>
               <p>At my ſetting forth from <hi>Paris,</hi> I aſſociated my
ſelf with a <hi>Benedictin Monk</hi> of a Reformed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
a Man of ſufficient Learning, and
whoſe Wit and other good Qualities, had ſo far
recommended him to the Religious of his Order,
as to ſend him a ſecond time in quality of their
Procurator, and Solicitor General, to the Court of
<hi>Rome.</hi> His Perſon and Port were very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous,
and he had a ſubtle Wit, very proper to
humour the Cardinals, and to inſinuate himſelf with
the Pope; and on this deſign it was, that he
now undertook this Journey. We took our Way
through the Country of <hi>Brie,</hi> and ſo through
<hi>Burgundy;</hi> and upon the Road we called at ſeveral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57009:11"/>
Monaſteries of his Order, where we were received
and treated very civilly; and where I had an
opportunity of making ſome Obſervations, which
I thought not unworthy of your knowledge; and
therefore have made them the Subject of this
Letter, after which, I intend with the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
in caſe I find, Sir, that theſe prove welcom
to you, to impart ſome other Matters I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
ſince my entring into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We arrived, the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> at a little
Town on the Confines of the Country of <hi>Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erre,</hi>
called <hi>Flavigny.</hi> It is a place of little
conſideration at preſent, tho' very famous by
reaſon of a Pilgrimage which has been continued
there a long time ſince, in honour of a certain
Sainteſs called <hi>Reine,</hi> and very infamous for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
and Impoſtures which were in their vigour
when we paſs'd that Way. The Hiſtory in ſhort
is this: An holy Woman, named <hi>Reine,</hi> ſuffer'd
Martyrdom about <hi>Aliſe,</hi> a little Village a League
diſtant from <hi>Flavigny;</hi> and the Ground of that
Country generally abounding with Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſome conſiderable time after the Monks of
<hi>Flavigny</hi> made a ſearch for the Body of this Saint,
and informed the People, That when ſhe was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
at the very place where her Head lighted
on the ground, a Spring (known by Experience
to be much conducing to the Healing of the Sick)
bubbled up at that very inſtant, for a perpetual
Miracle, in witneſs of Gods approbation of the
Confeſſion of Faith made by his Handmaid. This
Error being afterwards carried on for many Ages
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57009:11"/>
in the Minds of the People, and become the more
incurable for its long ſtanding, it hapned ſome
years ſince, that the Fathers, <hi>Cord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>liers,</hi> who are
Religious of the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> a ſort of
People ſubtle and very crafty, obtained leave of
the Biſhop of the place, to build a little Chappel
about the ſaid Spring, whereof they took poſſeſſion,
to the great regret of the Monks of the Order of
St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> who had been all along the ancient and
peaceable poſſeſſors of all the Relicks of St. <hi>Reine,</hi>
who ſoon found how dangerous it was, to have
ſuch ſly Fellows for their Neighbours; and the
falſe Step they had made, in neglecting to make
themſelves Maſters of a Spring of Water, ſo
fruitful in Bleſſings, and which was not above a
League diſtant from their Monaſtery. Indeed the
<hi>Cordeliers</hi> knew much better to improve this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
than the <hi>Benedictins</hi> had done; inſomuch
that the Devotion very ſenſibly increaſed, in a ſhort
time, to the conſiderable profit of theſe good
Fellows, who not contenting themſelves with being
the Maſters of the Miraculous Spring, but reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to draw to themſelves the entire Devotion of
that Pilgrimage, they pretended to have a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part of the Body of that Saint; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
they expoſed to publick View, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
a whole Arm of her; by which means,
within leſs than a Leagues ſpace, the monſtrous
ſight was to be ſeen of a Saint with Three Arms,
to the great aſtoniſhment and ſcandal of the People
thereabouts, and of an infinite number of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Pilgrims, who reſort thither from all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57009:12"/>
Parts. Would to God that this Impoſture, as well
as ſo many others every whit as ſtrange, had the
power to open the Eyes of thoſe poor People, to
diſcover once for all, how theſe wretched Monks
do abuſe them; how eaſily then would they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
That not only the Bones they adore are very
uncertain, as reſting only on the Faith of perſons,
who indeed have none at all; but beſides, that that
Spring never was Miraculous, but only an excellent
Mineral Water, as may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ather'd from the nature
of the Soil, and by the conſent of many Famous
Naturaliſts and Phyſicians, who have learnedly
treated on this Subject. I could, Sir, have heartily
wiſh'd you preſent, when the Father (Guardian of
that Convent) who took the pains himſelf to ſhew
us the fair Buildings and Gardens, which were the
product of the Moneys brought in by that Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
entred upon the diſcourſe of his pretended
Relick, which he had the impudence to ſhew us;
for I aſſure my ſelf, you would have ſoon recover'd
of the too favourable Opinion you have conceiv'd
for this kind of Men. He proteſted, not without
an horrid Blaſphemy, That for his part, he did not
more firmly believe the Myſtery of the Holy
Trinity, than he was convinc'd of the truth of his
Relick; notwithſtanding that the Biſhop of the
Place had abſolutely forbid them, to expoſe it any
more to publick View. It would be too ridiculous
to give you a relation of the way and manner by
which he aſſur'd us this Arm had been found by
them, ſo far as to mingle with it the Revelations
of his Brethren the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> and the Miniſtry
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57009:12"/>
of Angels, which is the ordinary way made uſe of
by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for introducing and
authorizing their Superſtitious Worſhip. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Reflection I deſire you to make on this occaſion,
is, That certainly it is a pitiful and lamentable
thing, to ſee that the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who do
not want Men of Wit and Parts amongſt them,
are yet ſo obſtinate, that they will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abus'd,
notwithſtanding they ſee every day many
things ſufficient to withdraw them from their
Error: So that we have reaſon to believe, That
by a juſt Judgment of God, becauſe they render
to Saints and Sainteſſes a Worſhip that is only due
to God, they are ſuffer'd to give the ſame to thoſe
things, which in their own Conſciences do not
deſerve it. The moſt part of their Divines main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
That when a Devotion is once ſet on foot,
notwithſtanding that the Subject in which it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
ſhould be afterwards found to be falſe and
ſuperſtitious, and ſo unworthy of ſuch Worſhip;
yet that in Conſcience the courſe of it ought not
to be ſtopt; becauſe (ſay they) the Scandal which
by this means muſt needs be occaſion'd, would be
a much greater Evil, than that which we deſign
to take away; and becauſe the Simplicity of a
deluded People, whoſe intention is always right
and pure, is much more pleaſing to God, than a
too great cautelouſneſs and fear of being deceived,
which might in the end engage them to call in
queſtion all manner of Relicks and Miracles, which
they look upon as a very great Evil. But the
naked Truth is, This would give a great Stroak
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57009:13"/>
towards the diminiſhing of their Temporal profits,
there being never a Pilgrimage which does not
afford them very conſiderable ones by the infinite
number of Prayers and Maſſes, which are there
procured, and are all ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed at a very high price.
I can give you on this Subject the Reſult of a
Conference, at which I was preſent my ſelf, ſome
time ago, at <hi>Blois</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> upon occaſion of
ſeveral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Relicks kept in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Victor,</hi>
two Leagues diſtant from that City. Theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
were much out of order, in old Wooden-Caſes,
all Worm-eaten and rotten with Age, which
hindred them from being carried in Proceſſion, and
expoſed to publick View. The concern therefore
was to have them more modiſhly accommodated,
and tranſported into New Caſes. To this end the
Biſhop of <hi>Chartres</hi> was petition'd to perform the
Tranſlation, who preſently ſent his Order to the
Archdeacon of <hi>Blois</hi> for that purpoſe; who
aſſembled ſeveral of the Clergy, to conſult with
the Curate and Prieſts of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> about the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions
to be obſerved in that Tranſlation. The
Reſolution was, That to avoid the Scandal that
might happen, if nothing ſhould chance to be
found in the Old Caſes, and to prevent the declining
of the good Opinion and Devotion of the People,
in caſe only ſome few Bones ſhould be found in
them, the tranſportation of them into the New
Ones ſhould not be done in publick, but as private
as poſſibly might be, in the preſence only of ſome
prudent Perſons, who might be ready to remedy
all ſorts of Accidents upon occaſion: I was deſired
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57009:13"/>
by ſome Friends of the Archdeacon, to be preſent
with them; and I can aſſure you, Sir, that the
Reſolution was taken, if it ſhould chance that
nothing were found in the Caſes, to maintain
peremptorily, That the Bodies of the Saints were
there whole and entire. And to allay ſomewhat
the Scruples, that might ſtart by occaſion of this
proceeding, a Canon of St. <hi>Saviours</hi> Church of
<hi>Blois,</hi> a Man reſolute and of ſmall Conſcience,
maintain'd in the Face of the Aſſembly, That no
difficulty ought to be made of aſſerting ſuch a
thing, tho' altogether falſe; that in a caſe where
the Intereſt of the Church was concerned, all
manner of Reſpects and Sentiments whatſoever,
were to be ſacrificed and given up; that the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of the Catholicks were not to be expoſed to
the Raillery of the Hereticks (ſo they call the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi>) who would not fail to mock at them,
as ſoon as they ſhould underſtand, that nothing had
been found in the Caſes of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> which for
ſo long a time had been the Object of the Peoples
Adoration; beſides, That the Devotion of Laicks,
in aſſiſting the Clergy, was already ſo far cooled,
that ſcarce any thing now was to be got from
them, but by ſome pious Fraud, or holy Artifice.
The Archdeacon heard all his Diſcourſe without
contradicting him in the leaſt, and the Curate of
the Pariſh, as being the perſon moſt concerned in the
Caſe, very officiouſly returned him his moſt hearty
Thanks. This done, they proceeded to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Caſes, and the truth is, Bones either of
Saints, or no Saints, were found in them. In the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57009:14"/>
mean time, a Monk of the Abby of St. <hi>Lomer</hi> in
<hi>Blois,</hi> who was preſent, cried out at the very inſtant,
That he ſmelt a very ſweet Odour, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from them, wherewith he was ſo ſtrongly
ſeized, that it was like to overcome him. A young
Religious (his Companion) ſeconded him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
and ſome Country People of the Pariſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
the ſame thing. The Archdeacon and
the reſt of the Company freely declared, that
they ſmelt nothing: Yet foraſmuch as it might be
that thoſe Perſons having ſome more particular
Merit before God, he might think them worthy of
Receiving the like Favours; it was ordered that their
Atteſtations ſhould be received, and ſet in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of the Verbal Proceſs, which was then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of that Tranſlation, the Original whereof was
to be ſhut up with the Relicks in the new Caſes. I
had the Curioſity ſome weeks after, in the time of
<hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tage,</hi> to examine ſome of theſe Perſons, about
the Odour they pretended to have ſmelt, of what
kind it was; whereupon ſome of them ſaid it was
the ſent of a Roſe, others of Jeſſamin, and others
of a Violet: But finding that they faultered in their
Expreſſions and ſmiled withal, I took occaſion to
preſs them more ſeriouly, ſo that at the upſhot they
confeſſed, that the good Opinion they had of the
two Monks, which firſt ſtarted the matter, had
drawn them in, and in a manner forced their
imagination to make them believe that they ſmelt
that, which they never ſmelt indeed. This ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Confeſſion of theirs, made me to ſeek an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to diſcourſe theſe two Monks: I went to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57009:14"/>
ſee the youngeſt of them, and after I had given him
two or three Viſits of Civility, to encreaſe our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
I obtained leave of his Superior for him,
to accompany me to a Country Houſe, where after
friendly Entertainment given him, I put him upon
the matter of the Relicks of S. <hi>Victor:</hi> The young
Monk overcome by my kindneſs, aſſured me he
would open his Heart to me, as to his own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that the truth was, he had not ſmelt any ſuch
Miraculous Odour, which he then atteſted, but that
partly, that he might not contradict his companion,
and partly by a ſudden ſhame that ſurprized him;
leſt he ſhould not ſeem to be as much graced with
Heavenly favours as his Brother, had made him to
depoſe againſt his Conſcience, for which afterwards
he was ſomwhat troubled. But Father, ſaid I, how
can you be at Peace, without unſaying again, what
you ſo openly averr'd and depoſed, and this in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to Truth? The Devil is the Father of Lies,
and you cannot pretend to the quality of a Child
of God, without deſtroying the work of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
whereof your ſelf have been the Inſtrument:
He anſwered, that he had conſulted with his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
about the matter, and that the general Rule
they had given him, to paſs over Scruples of that
nature, was, to conſider whether the thing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
or exerted into act, were oppoſite to the
Glory of God, or the good and advantage of his
Order: That it was not againſt the Glory of God,
to advance the Honor of one of his Saints; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when ſome Circumſtances, that were both Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Profitable to the Order, engaged the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57009:15"/>
doing of it; and that all the evil that could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in the caſe came but to this, To ſay that God
had done, what he might have done, and which he
hath done on many other occaſions, which at the
higheſt could be no more than a ſmall Venial Sin;
as, they ſay, all Lies are, that do not infringe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
that is to ſay, that do no Body any harm.
Having thus got this truth out of him; I had no
more to do now, but to convince the old Monk,
which it was not poſſible for me to do, for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
perſiſted in aſſerting the truth of what he
had depoſed, ay and much more; for he added,
that the Odour had followed him every where, as
long as the leaſt duſt of thoſe ſacred Relicks was
left upon his Cloaths. In the mean time this did
not hinder me from conſidering, that all the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility
of this Miracle was now reduc'd to the
Conſcience of one ſingle Perſon; upon whom the
affirmations of all the other Deponents reſted,
and that when ever theſe Caſes ſhould chance again
to be opened, in which the Verbal Proceſs was ſhut
up (as Superſtition is uſed to get ſtrength by length
of time) this Miracle would come to be believed with
as much aſſurance, as a great many other moſt falſe
and Ridiculous ones are in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
I was the more willing, Sir, to repreſent this to
your Conſideration, as being a thing which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in your Neighbourhood, and whereof you may
fully inform your ſelf, whenſoever you pleaſe; that
ſo finding the Faithfulneſs of my Relation in this
particular, you may be the more diſpoſed to give
Credit to what I ſhall Write to you, concerning
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57009:15"/>
Foreign Countries. I return now to my Voyage.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Flavigny,</hi> we went to <hi>Dijon,</hi> the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis
of the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where I was Eye-witnes
of a horrid cheat, practiſed by the Men of
the Church: I do not relate this paſſage to you ſo
much for its own ſake, but to the end you may
make a reflection upon it, of great importance to
our preſent Subject. We took a walk to the Holy
Chappel, where they ſhewed us many Relicks, that
were indeed very Ridiculous; and amongſt the reſt,
that which they call the Holy Hoſt or Wafer, from
whence they tell us, Blood iſſued in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
after that a Proteſtant had in ſeveral places
Stabbed it with a Knife; that upon his ſo doing the
Wafer was chang'd into an Infant, and from an
Infant to a Wafer again, as it was before. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
entring into Diſcourſe, we at laſt were inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
led to this Queſtion, How it came to paſs,
that at preſent there were not ſo many Miracles to
be ſeen, as in former times? In anſwer to which
the Canon, who ſhewed us the Relicks, told us,
that in the Abby of S. <hi>Benignus,</hi> in the ſame Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
there were almoſt every day Miracles wrought,
at an Altar of the Bleſſed Virgin, where Still-born
Children, were reſtored to Lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for ſome Moments,
till they could be made partakers of the Sacrament
of Baptiſm; which was look'd upon, as a very
great happineſs for them, foraſmuch as according
to the Opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Infants dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that manner cannot be ſaved by the Faith of
their Parents, but go down to a dark place they call
<hi>Limbus,</hi> which is made expreſs for them, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57009:16"/>
where they are to continue for ever, without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the Puniſhment of Senſe, becauſe they have
never ſinned by inducement of the Senſes; but
where notwithſtanding, they muſt undergo <hi>Poenam
Damni,</hi> or the Puniſhment of loſs, which conſiſts
in the privation of the Beatifick Viſion, that being
a Puniſhment due to Original Sin. We cannot
imagin, that any Fathers or Mothers ſhould be ſo
pittileſs and unnatural, as rather to deſire to ſpare
their Mony, than to reſcue their Children from ſo
Deplorable a Condition, by having Prayers and
Maſſes ſaid for them at the ſaid Altar: ſo that this
was the Trade driven by the Religious of that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
We went therefore about 10 a Clock in the
Morning to that Church, where we ſaw the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Image of the Virgin, commonly called the
<hi>Little,</hi> our Lady of S. <hi>Benignus,</hi> and two Still-born
Children, who had already lain there two days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
black and livid, and very noiſom. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
who were of the beſt Families of <hi>Dijon,</hi> had
during theſe two days, procured above 200 Maſſes
to be ſaid in that Church, at a Crown a piece, in
order to obtain from God, by interceſſion of the
ſaid Image, and by the Prayers of the Religious of
that Abby, ſo much life, for theſe poor Infants, as
might be ſufficient for them, only to receive the
Sacrament of Baptiſm. The Monks would very gladly
have deferr'd their Reſurrection for a day longer,
but the Bodies were already ſo far corrupted, that
it was almoſt impoſſible to abide in the Church, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the offenſiveneſs of the ſtench that came from
them: ſo that as it happened we came in the very
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57009:16"/>
nick of time, to ſee the performance of it. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
noon, which was the time of the laſt Maſs,
a young Fryar, who ſerved at the Altar, going
to carry the Maſs-Book to that ſide where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is read, hit with his Arm, either wittingly or by
chance, the Table of the Altar, upon which the
Still-born Infants were laid, which made them
move. The Prieſt who was ſaying Maſs, and who
probably was acquainted with the hour and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this interlude, immediately breaking off
his ſacred Myſteries, (as the Papiſts pleaſe to exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſs
it) pronounced with a loud Voice the Sacramental
Words over the Infants, <hi>Baptizo, &amp;c.</hi> caſting in the
mean time on their Bodies the water, wherewith he
had waſhed his hands. At the ſame time, a great
noiſe was raiſed in the Church, the People crying
out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Miracle, a Miracle! My Eyes could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me, in a caſe I had ſo plainly diſcerned, and I
could with all my Heart have undertaken to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
the poor People; but that I knew how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
it is, to oppoſe the blind Rabble, kept and
entertained in Error, by Prieſts and Monks, who
knowing no other God, but their own intereſt,
would ſoon have ſtirr'd them up, under the pretence
of Hereſie or Incredulity, to have Torn me to pieces.
However I could not refrain, from hinting a Word
of it, in particular to ſome Perſons, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at that action, and who owned they had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the ſame thing. <hi>Burgundy</hi> was always a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
fruitful in Superſtition, and we may ſee the
Signs of it every where; and conſequently alſo,
there be very few Countries where the Prieſts and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57009:17"/>
Monks thrive better, or more abound in Riches. I
beg of you now, Sir, only to make this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Fathers of the Abby, are the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religious of the Order of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
of a Congregation, which you in <hi>France</hi>
have the greateſt Veneration for, as well upon the
account of their Learning, as Duty; both which, as you
have told me, render them equally recommendable:
If then, ſay I, theſe Men, who are ſo Holy and ſo Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
in your Opinion, are ſo able, and cunning to
deceive, and ſuch profligate lovers of outward gain;
what may not we expect from ſo many, Non-reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religious, who live ſo licentiouſly and looſly
to the very Eye, as to make open profeſſion of Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anning
Laymen, by a Thouſand kind of Artifices,
to have wherewith to maintain their Flagitious and
Scandalous Debaucheries? We ſtaied ſome days at
<hi>Dijon;</hi> where I was Eye-witneſs to an abundance
of Ridiculous Devotions, that are in Vogue there,
and which it would be too tedious to relate to
you; as that of our Lady of <hi>l'Estan,</hi> that of S.
<hi>Bernard,</hi> and of the Image of the Virgin kept at
<hi>Talent,</hi> and pretended to have been Painted by S.
<hi>Luke,</hi> and to be very Miraculous. But foraſmuch
as the Devotion paid to theſe ſorts of Images, is uſed
to increaſe or decreaſe, according as the Prieſts or
Monks do more or leſs Dexterouſly manage them;
this laſt mentioned has ſuffered very much, being
well nigh fallen into contempt, inſomuch as the
Curate of that Pariſh, deſpaired almoſt of ever
bringing it into requeſt again. To bring this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
he told us, he knew but one way, which was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57009:17"/>
to publiſh a Miracle, which lately hapned about
that Image, which was a more remarkable one,
than all the Cures it dayly performed: The caſe is
this, ſaid he, having perceived about 10 years ago,
that the Devotion to the Image dayly decreaſed;
I began to enquire into the cauſe of it, and finding
the Picture to be in a very rueful condition, by
reaſon of the moiſtneſs of the place, which had well
nigh rotted the Cloth, and the Rats alſo having
made bold with ſome part of it, and extremely
disfigured the Face eſpecially; I conceived that
this might be the reaſon of the abatement of the
Peoples Devotion. Wherefore to remedy this, I
made the old Cloth to be paſted upon a new one,
and ſent for one of the beſt Painters of <hi>Dijon,</hi> to
draw over the defective places of it, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
done with a great deal of care and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs;
and on a firſt Sunday of the Month, the
Image thus drawn over and imbelliſhed, was ſet up
in its former place with a great deal of Solemnity,
and a great concourſe of People. Since which
time, proceeded he, I have been continually troubled
with the Gout, and moreover the Bleſſed Virgin to
ſhew her ſelf diſpleaſed, that any Painter ſhould be
ſo bold as to put his hand to a piece of work, which
her Servant S. <hi>Luke</hi> had left to Poſterity, in order
to the reſtoring of it to its firſt Luſter; ſhe has
ſome days ſince, made the colours that had been
ſuperadded to it, to ſcale away and fall down, and
thereby reduced the Image to the pitiful eſtate, it
was in before; which however ſhe is much more
pleaſed with, than to ſee her pourtraiture profaned
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57009:18"/>
with ſtrange colours. He added, that he had already
cauſed the Relation of the Miracle to be Printed,
and that he did intend to ſend Copies of it to all
Neighbouring, yea even into Foreign Countries;
and that he lookt upon this as a probable way, to
recal the Devotion of People to his Church. I
had occaſion, Sir, to remind my ſelf of this paſſage,
during my <hi>Italian</hi> Voyage; for being at <hi>Bononia,</hi>
they ſhewed me an excellent piece of Carat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But yet we find that the new paint, laid upon the

                  </gap> colours, falls down in ſcales, and that without a
Miracle too; there being nothing more natural and
obvious, than that new colours, cannot ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate
with old paint, as freſh colours do with
one another. But notwithſtanding the Obviouſneſs
hereof, when Superſtition has once gaind the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of a Mans Spirit, ſhe doth ſo ſtrangly prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
the ſame, that there is nothing ſo common
and ordinary, but appears to them Miraculous.
I have ſeen ſeveral other Images of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
in <hi>Italy,</hi> which they ſay were all painted by
the ſame S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and are conſequently reputed
Miraculous, particularly that of S. <hi>Mary</hi> the greater
in <hi>Rome;</hi> but in truth they are ſo very different
from one another that it is impoſſible they ſhould
have been painted by the ſame hand, or that all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57009:18"/>
of them ſhou'd be the Pictures of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
the Lineaments, Figure and proportions of
the Face and Body, vaſtly varying from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I ſhall give you a more particular account
of them, in my obſervations of <hi>Italy.</hi> For the
preſent, becauſe we have not yet quit <hi>Dijon,</hi> I
will only relate to you what I was Eye witneſs of
my ſelf, in the ſame Abby of S. <hi>Benignus,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Reformed Benedictin Monks, where is
kept the Miraculous Image of the Bleſſed Virgin,
that brings Still-born Children to life again, as we
have already mentioned. I went to viſit one of
my Brothers, who is a Religious of that Abby,
and as I was walking with him in the Garden
after Dinner, another Religious came running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us in great haſte, and told my Brother in his
Ear, that he ſhould immediately repair to the
Church, to ſee ſomething well worth his Curioſity;
and foraſmuch as I was then in my Brothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and well enough known to the Fathers, I
follow'd them to the Church. The buſineſs was
this, The Prior accompanied with ſeven or eight of
his Monks, was about to uncover an old Crucifix,
which was kept in a very fair Chappel, which
thence was called the Chappel of the Miraculous
Crucifix, and had for Forty years been covered
with a Vail of black Velvet; The Story tells us,
that a Religious of that Abby, ſaying his Prayer
one Evening before that Crucifix, the Image of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, which was faſtned to it, ſpake to him,
and ſaid; <hi>My dear Brother, Cover me that I may
no more ſee the Iniquities of my People, and let
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57009:19"/>
no man from henceforwards, be ſo bold to unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me, to behold my Face.</hi> This Monk preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed the charge laid upon him, by adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Abbot and Brethren thereof, who were not
wanting, immediately to carry the News through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole City, which occaſioned that great
Devotion, which continues ſtill to this day. There is
a vaſt concourſe of People to this Crucifix, eſpecially
on <hi>Frydays,</hi> but more particularly on Good-Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
when the whole City gos in proceſſion to the
Image, to Worſhip it, and pay to it the ſame
Honour, as they would to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf.
Now the Prior of this Monaſtery who was an
old ſtander, and well verſed in Monaſtick Intrigues,
was not much ſcared at this threatning of the
Crucifix, being reſolved, coſt what it would,
to ſatisfie his Curioſity about it; as he alſo did, and
in this reſolution he was fain to put his hand to the
work himſelf, ſome of his Monks having abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuſed to do it, expreſſing themſelves extremely
frighted at his undertaking, ſaying, that ſhould they
offer to touch it, they could expect no leſs than
to be conſumed with fire from Heaven. But the
Prior not concerned at their apprehenſions, with
a wonderful courage uncovers the Myſterious and
dreaded Machin. I could not but laugh to my
ſelf, to ſee the poſture of the Monks that were
preſent; Some of them betook themſelves to their
Heels, declaring they would not by their preſence
make themſelves partakers of ſo horrid an attempt
and Sacriledge; others ſhut their Eyes, that they
might not be dazled and ſtruck Blind with the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57009:19"/>

Scrutatores Majeſtatis;</hi> and others proſtrated
themſelves with their Faces on the Ground, that
they might be ſeen by their Divine Maſter, as
they ſaid themſelves, in that moſt profound act of
Adoration and ſelf-abaſement. There were ſcarce
any that kept ſtanding, beſides my Brother and I;
we were very near to the Prior of the Monaſtery,
who was very buſie with uncovering the Crucifix,
and who beginning himſelf to be frighted, or at leaſt
pretending to be ſo, began to repeat the 51<hi>ſt</hi> Pſalm
<hi>Miſerere Meî Deus.</hi> But as it hapned neither the
one nor the other had any great cauſe to fear; for
when the Velvet covering was taken off, they found
nothing but a Linnen Bag, with ſome bits of Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Wood in it, which were the Remains of that
dreaded and adored Crucifix. Amongſt theſe
mouldred Fragments we had much ado, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the Head, where was the Miraculous Mouth,
that had ſpoke to the Monk: In a word, it was
in a pitiful ſtate, being all Rotten and Worm-eaten,
without either Form or Figure, full of dead Flies
and Spiders: Inſomuch that the good Monks that
were preſent being ſomewhat recovered from their
Fright, and perceiving no ſuch Glory as they had
prefigur'd to themſelves, began to diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves, how to reconcile their Story
with the preſent diſcovery; that is, the condition
wherein they found the Crucifix, with their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
concerning the Revelation and Diſcourſe of
the Crucifix with the Religious: For if it were
true, that it had never been uncovered, ſince the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57009:20"/>
time of its ſpeaking, when it was yet fixt to the
Croſs, how could  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t be, that at preſent they found
it in a Thouſand pieces, and in a Bag? The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
concluded very wiſely, that it was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that this Crucifix had of old been had in great
Veneration, and thereby been of great advantage
to the Monaſtery, and that this Monk by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency
or otherwiſe, had let it fall, and broke it
to pieces, and fearing to be ſeverely puniſhed by
his Abbot therefore, had gathered up the pieces into
a Bag, and having faſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> them again to the Croſs,
and covered them with that piece of black Velvet,
had afterwards forged and publiſhed that his
pretended Revelation. However, foraſmuch as he
knew nothing of Certainty concerning the matter,
he choſe rather to ſuſpend his Judgment, than to
paſs a raſh one concerning it; and beſides that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their general Principles, the Devotion
being already fixed, he would by no means be a
hinderance to ſo many good works, as were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
on that occaſion, nor put a ſtop to the
courſe of ſo many Maſſes and Prayers, as were
daily procur'd to be ſaid in the Chappel of the
Miraculous Crucifix. So he pack'd up all again,
and put it in the ſame order as he had found it,
which may ſtill be ſeen, in caſe they will permit the
viewing of it, in the ſaid Chappel, where the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
continues as great as ever. If the Roman
Catholick Biſhops, were a little better ſtocked
with true zeal for the glory of God, or at leaſt
for the Honour of their own party, they would
without doubt more ſeriouſly apply themſelves to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57009:20"/>
the examining of the different Devotions, that are
in vogue in their Dioceſes. I am well aſſured
they would find a great deal of downright im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
covered under the Mask of Devotion.
But ſo far are they from this, that they are the
firſt to authorize and encourage them, by the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
they give from time to time, to the Churches
and Chappels where theſe Devotions are entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and accordingly we find that great abundance
of them have been granted by the Biſhops of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres</hi>
to thoſe who ſhall ſay five <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> and
as many <hi>Ave Maries</hi> in this Chappel of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Crucifix, in the Abby of S. <hi>Benignus</hi> of
<hi>Dijon.</hi> Before I have done with this City, Sir, I
muſt not forget to entertain you a while with a

                  </gap>he great and famous Abby of <hi>Citeaux,</hi>
the Abbot of which, as you know, is the chief and
general of the whole Order, which is without doubt
one of the vaſteſt Bodies of Religious, the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> can boaſt of; <hi>France, Italy, Spain, Poland</hi>
and <hi>Portugal,</hi> being throngd with the Monaſteries
of that O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>der, who all of them own this Abby of
the <hi>Citeaux</hi> for their Mother. I had very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
acquaintance with the Prior of the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who was a young man of the City of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
who invited me to come and ſee him. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
ſent two of his Coaches, with ſix Horſes, to
fetch ſome of his Relations, whom he had invited
to dine with him, and with whom I had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to joyn my ſelf. All the diſcourſe we had on
the way from <hi>Dijon</hi> thither, was about the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57009:21"/>
end of Monſieur <hi>Bourre,</hi> a Gentleman born of
one of the moſt Noble Families of <hi>Dijon,</hi> and a
Religious of that order, who a little before had
been publickly executed at <hi>Dijon,</hi> for Poyſoning
his Abbot, becauſe he went about to make an enquiry
into his Crimes; the fact being evident that he had
Debauched ſome of the Nuns of a Monaſtery, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Abbot had ſent him in quality of their
Director or Confeſſor. As ſoon as we were come
near to the <hi>Citeaux,</hi> I could not but admire the
ſtately Avenues of that Magnificent Abby: This
place which formely was nothing but a horrid
Wilderneſs, when S. <hi>Robert</hi> the firſt Abbot of that
Order, did inſtitute it, is now at preſent by the
Voluptuouſneſs and Luxury of the Monks, become
an Earthly Paradiſe, abounding with all manner
of delights. The Hiſtory tells us that that Abbot,
being a lover of Silence and Solitude, retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with ſome of his Diſciples into theſe parts,
which at that time was nothing elſe, but a thick
Wood, and lying out of the way of almoſt all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Converſe. Here it was they began to Build
themſelves Cells, with the Branches of Trees;
and ſome amongſt them digged themſelves Caves
underground, without either Art or Form, like to
the Dens of Ravenous Beaſts. The Herbs and
Roots, that grew in the Wood, ſerved them indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
without diſtinguiſhing the good from the
bad, for Nouriſhment; and all the precaution they
uſed was this, that after they had boild them, they
firſt gave ſome of them to a Dog, or other dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Animal, which if it did not immediately dye,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57009:21"/>
or appear'd diſtempered, they took it for granted,
that there were no Poyſonous Herbs in their Cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whoſe dangerous effects they had reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.
But how prodigious a change appeared
in that place not long after! The People round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
being informed of the aſtoniſhing ſeverities,
and ſtrange way of living of theſe <hi>Anchorets,</hi> came
flocking from all parts to admire them, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their homes, publiſhed everywhere that in the
Wood <hi>de Citeaux,</hi> they had in their days, ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more and greater than either <hi>Elias</hi> or S. <hi>John</hi>
the Baptiſt. And as in that Age of the World, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were much more compaſſionate and tender than
they are at preſent, towards perſons, who for the
love of God, as they expreſt it, had left all, they
made it their buſineſs, from all parts to carry them
not only Food, but other conveniences of Life.
Theſe good Hermits contented themſelves for ſome
time, to accept of ſome of the courſeſt and meaneſt
of their ſupplies; and afterwards by little and little
the moſt exquiſite and delicate, receiving them, as
by an expreſs order from God, by attributing to
themſelves the promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt made to his
Apoſtles, that having forſaken all for his ſake, they
ſhould receive in this World an hundred fold, and
in the world to come Eternal Life. Thus within a
ſhort time, from a Life of extraordinary Rigor and
abſtinence, and moſt ſignal and remarkable piety,
they chopt about, to a Life as Scandalous and Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute;
and whereof S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his time began
already highly to complain, but at preſent is
advanced to a far more Tranſcendent degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57009:22"/>
Inſtead of a Deſart and Solitude, as it was
before in the higheſt degree, they have now made
it a kind of a City; which within its compaſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
all manner of Handicrafts men, who live
there with their Wives and all their Families: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of that mean and ſpare Diet, to which they
were obliged by a Solemn Vow, made at the foot
at their Altars, and in particular of abſtaining
from Fleſh, all the days of their Life, they have at
preſent, directly contrary to their Vows, introduc'd
the uſe of it to the higheſt degree of Delicacy, as
being always accompanied with the agreeable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Fiſh.</hi> And, for my part, I can
truly aver, That for the Two days that I ſtaid there,
their Table (beſides their common Viands) were
covered with ſeveral Diſhes of Veniſon, followed
by a Service of Fiſh, the Sides of the Diſhes being
garniſh'd with the Tongues and Roes of <hi>Carps,</hi>
and the Tails of <hi>Crabs.</hi> Yea, the Abbot had ſent
to <hi>Diep,</hi> which is above an Hundred and twenty
Leagues diſtant, at an exceſſive Charge, and by a
Poſt ſent Expreſs, who ran day and night for <hi>Soles,</hi>
which were freſh enough, and ſo coſtly a Rarity,
that the Intendants and Preſidents of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Dijon,</hi> durſt not venture upon them in
their moſt ſumptuous Entertainments. The Monks
of this Abby, in the mean time, glorying in this
Exceſs, which ought rather to have confounded them,
vaunted with an unparallel'd Impudence, That in all
that Province, there was not a Man beſides the Abbot
of <hi>Citeaux,</hi> who could bear ſuch an Expence, and
continue it every day. After Dinner, the Abbot
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57009:22"/>
(followed by many of his Officers, and a great
number of Lacqueys in Livery) went himſelf to
ſhew us the New Buildings he was then making in
his Abby, and which conſiſted in Four great Piles of
Building, of a magnificent Structure, all of Hewn-Stone
of a Diamant-Cut, deſign'd for the ſeparate
Lodging of the four Principal Abbots of the Order,
with all their Train, at the time of their General
Chapters. A fifth Building, which he intended for
his own perſon, was a lofty Palace, lifting up its
proud Head above the other Four Buildings, as it
were to overlook and command them, to repreſent
the Authority he had over the other Abbots, in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of their General. After we had taken a View

Geſts and Cutting of Faces, wherein they oblige the
Company to imitate them. This done, they fill your
Ears with the recital of Old Stories and Miracles
of the Days of Yore, wrought in favour of their
Order; amongſt which, they never forget to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Tragedy of ſome Uſurper of the Revenues
of their Monaſtery, or of ſome other that ſpoke ill
of the ſame, who at the upſhot of the Story doth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57009:23"/>
never fail of being ſtruck from God with ſudden
Death by a Thunderbolt, or of having his Neck
broke by ſome Devil or other. I have ſince obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the ſame inveigling Tricks in almoſt all the
Monaſteries and Convents of <hi>Italy,</hi> and in all other
places frequented upon the ſcore of Devotion. They
ſhewed us a large Refectory of the firſt Religious of
their Order, which is a Vaulted Room, and very long,
more reſembling a hideous Cave, than a place to eat
in. And yet (ſaid one of the Religious) this is that
holy <hi>Grotto,</hi> where our Ancient Fathers, the Bleſſed
Founders of our Order, met together every day after
Sun-ſet, wearied with their Handy-labour, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Sung the Praiſes of God, to partake together
of a piece of black Courſe-Bread, with ſome boild
Pulſe or Roots, without either Salt or Butter, or any
other Sawce or Dreſſings, and in ſo ſmall a quantity,
as deſigning rather to keep themſelves from Starving,
than to make them ſtrong and lively; and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
practiſing thoſe ſevere Mortifications, which we
can ſooner admire than imitate. Theſe Great and
Heroick Saints are now in Heaven, and have changed
their aſtoniſhing Severities, with the Eternal delights
of the Wedding-Supper of the Lamb; and 'tis
from that high Station, they with a favourable
Eye look down upon thoſe who Live, or have
Lived for ſome time in this Monaſtery, as
likewiſe upon thoſe who are or have been Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
to it; and we are aſſured by Revelation,
that none of them, nay, tho' they may have lived
a moſt abominable life, ſhall ever die in Mortal
Sin. A Counſellor of <hi>Dijon,</hi> who was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57009:23"/>
with us, ſaid ſmiling, That he wanted but very
little of being perſwaded, to leave all he had to
the Monaſtery, and gently puſhing my Arm, ask'd
me, Whether I was not well pleaſed to Hear a
fat and burly Monk, after having ſo well
Dined, diſcourſing of the Abſtinence and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of thoſe Ancient Fathers, and of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
God hath in ſtore for his Abby too upon
their account, with ſo much energy? But after all,
the plain Truth is, That it is nothing but an
Artifice they make uſe of, to ſtrike the Spirits of
Men with ſome kind of Veneration for their
Orders and Perſons. From this place they led us
to another, which they call the <hi>Old Chapter-Houſe,</hi>
which is a Building after the <hi>Gothic</hi> way,
with many Rows of Pillars like a Church; yet
ſtately enough. The Stones of the Pavement are
cut into Letters, which make up all the Pſalms
of <hi>David;</hi> and near the midſt of this place they
ſhewed us a large Stone, on which of Old they
were uſed to lay the Religious of the Monaſtery
ſome hours before their Departure, where they
were expoſed all Naked upon Aſhes and an Hair-Cloth,
until they breath'd their laſt. But this
Cuſtom (ſaid the Father) has ſince been aboliſhed,
becauſe it was found by Experience, that ſome of
thoſe who were ſo expoſed, having more ſtrength
left than was imagined, continued ſometimes in
that condition, expoſed to the violence of Cold
for Twenty four Hours, or more, before they
died; ſo as thoſe who thus expoſed them, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd,
whether in ſo doing they had not been
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57009:24"/>
their Murtherers. At the preſent (ſaid he ſmiling)
the caſe is alter'd, and we die ſoftly on the Feathers,
after having eſſay'd whatſoever the Art of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
can afford for our Recovery, and which is
every whit as meritorious to us, as that pityleſs
Rigour our Predeceſſors were oblig'd to, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as herein we ſubmit our Wills to thoſe who
command us, and whom we are obliged to obey;
Obedience even in pleaſing and agreeable things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more acceptable to God than all Sacrifices. Thus
gallantly the Father excuſed the Decay of their
Obſervance, endeavouring to make that ſeem a
Vertue, which indeed is nothing elſe but an effect
of their Softneſs and Effeminacy. Or rather, we
may ſay, That by a juſt Judgment of God, theſe
kind of Men having raſhly Vowed, what was not
in their power to perform, are fallen by ſo much
lower, by how much they aſpir'd to fly higher.
'Tis upon this account that we ſee ſo many Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of theſe Religious Orders, and ſoon after
other Reformations of them again, who in a ſhort
time will ſtand in need ſtill of another Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But that which is the ſtrangeſt thing of all
is, That they fall into prodigious Corruptions, and
into thoſe habits of Sinning, which ſtrike the moſt
Worldly men that are with horrour, as may be
ſeen from the hint I gave of Monſieur <hi>Bourré,</hi>
Monk of that Order, and many other Examples,
that fill the World with their Report.</p>
               <p>There is but one only Religious Order in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that can boaſt of its Antiquity,
and of having never been Reformed, which is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57009:24"/>
that of the <hi>Chartreux.</hi> Having ſtay'd two days
at <hi>Citeaux,</hi> we took our Way through <hi>Lionnois,</hi>
and <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> and finding our ſelves not far from
the Monaſtery called the <hi>Great Chartreux,</hi> our
Curioſity invited us to take a View of it. This
Monaſtery is the Chief Head of all thoſe of the
Order of <hi>Chartreux,</hi> and in it their General Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are held. St. <hi>Bruno,</hi> who was the Founder
of this Order, retir'd hither with his Companions
in the Year of our Lord 1080. What is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
related as the Reaſon of his Retirement, is
rather a Fable, than an Hiſtory; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is maintain'd by a great deal of heat, as
a great Truth by the Fathers of this Order, who
have caus'd the Story to be Painted at large, and
hung up in their Cloiſters; but on the other hand,
it is denied by the Doctors of the Famous Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of <hi>Paris.</hi> This Fable tells us, That <hi>Bruno,</hi>
who had a long time frequented that Univerſity,
being preſent at the Interment of a Doctor, who
had been a Member of the ſame; a perſon of an
irreproachable Life, to outward view, and who
died with the odour of Sanctity; when the Office
for the Dead was reciting in the Church for him,
and that they were come to thoſe Words of the
Leſſons, <hi>Reſponde mihi, quantas habeo iniquitates;
Anſwer me, How many Sins I have;</hi> the Dead-Body
raiſed himſelf on the Bier, and ſitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
with a terrible Voice pronounced theſe
Words, <hi>Accuſatus ſum; I am Accuſed:</hi> At which
aſtoniſhing Accident, when all that were preſent
were extreamly amazed, it was thought fit to put
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57009:25"/>
off the Obſequies till the next day; at which
time they began again the Office for the Dead,
and when they were come to the ſame Words,
<hi>Reſponde mihi, &amp;c.</hi> the Dead anſwered with a
Tone much more terrible than at firſt, theſe two
Words more, <hi>Judicatus ſum; I am Judged;</hi>
which increaſing the horrour and amazement of
all thoſe that were preſent, made them reſolve to
delay the Burial one Day longer; at which time
a vaſt Crowd of People being aſſembled, the
Office was begun again, and at the ſame Words
the Dead raiſing himſelf the third and laſt time,
ſaid with a pitiful and mournful Accent, <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus
ſum;</hi> that he was <hi>Condemned</hi> to Hell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Recovery. This ſo ſtrange and terrible a
Spectacle (ſaith the Fable) had that effect on the
Spirit of <hi>Bruno,</hi> that from that inſtant he reſolved
to quit the World, and to retire into ſome Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
place, for to live there wholly to God, ſolitary
and ſeparate from the view of the World; and by
his perſwaſion, engaged ſeven Students of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of <hi>Paris,</hi> his Companions, with him in the
ſame Reſolution; who being all of one mind, went
and caſt themſelves at the Feet of the Biſhop of
<hi>Grenoble,</hi> to beg of him the Deſert called <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treuſe,</hi>
which belonged to him; and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their Requeſt, they retired there, and built
themſelves Cells. The Truth of the matter is,
That this Saint did indeed retire with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
into this place; but all the Story of the
Doctor is evidently falſe, as has been inconteſtably
proved by the Doctors of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris;</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57009:25"/>
there being none of the Contemporary Writers, or
any that were Two Hundred Years after, that
make the leaſt mention of it; and is indeed nothing
elſe but an Invention of the Papiſts, very fit to be
joyned with the reſt of their Stories, concerning
the Apparitions of Souls in Purgatory. Probably,
Sir, your Curioſity will incline you to deſire, I
ſhould give you a deſcription of this Place, and
its Situation, which without doubt is the moſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
place Nature could form; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is at this day become a very pleaſant Seat,
by means of the immenſe Expences which theſe
Fathers, who are extreamly rich, have been at, to
make it more pleaſing to Senſe. Wherefore, Sir, I
ſhall endeavour, in order to your Satisfaction, to ſet
down what comes to my Mind concerning it.
This Deſert, called <hi>Chartreuſe,</hi> which has given
the Name to the Order that is thence denominated,
is a place ſituate in the Boſom of an exceeding
high Mountain, the Top of which parts it ſelf into
Four others, leaving in the midſt of them a place
of a Mile in length, and above a Quarter of a Mile
in breadth, in which ſpace the Cells of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are built. The Waters guſhing forth from
theſe Mountains, make a moſt impetuous Torrent,
which bears the Name of St. <hi>Lawrence.</hi> This was
a place altogether unfrequented, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible,
when St. <hi>Bruno</hi> firſt retired thither, tho'
at preſent, by a vaſt profuſion of Mony, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
of the place have made the acceſs to it not
only eaſie, but pleaſant, having cut out large Steps
in the Rock, and by that means made (as it were)
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57009:26"/>
many Stairs to get up to it. However, ſuch is the
ſituation of the place, that neither Coaches nor
Carts, no nor Horſes neither, can come up to it;
but they make uſe of Mules, accuſtomed from their
Youth to go up and down thoſe Steps, to convey
their Proviſions to them. We got up to the place
by means of the ſame Conveniences, and found the
Snow in ſeveral places lying ſtill on the Eminences
of the Rocks, notwithſtanding that it was in the
midſt of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and that at the Foot of the
Mountain, the Heat was almoſt inſupportable.
The Building of the Monaſtery was not yet quite
finiſhed when we arrived there, having been reduc'd
to Aſhes ſome ſhort time before. There was a
Suſpicion, that the Religious themſelves had been
the Incendiaries, becauſe their Cells diſpleaſed them,
as being too mean and Old-faſhion'd; and beſides,
too much pinch'd of room, ſo that they could not
enjoy themſelves in them with that eaſe and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
they deſired. It hapned at a time when the
Wind extreamly favour'd their deſign, and the Fire
began in a Quarter where ſo much Combuſtible
matter was lodged, and ſo far from the places where
any Fires were made, that it was eaſie to judge,
That it was not a thing hapned by accident, but
contrived on purpoſe. Beſides, the delays and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
ſhewed in quenching of it, gave a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Teſtimony, That the Fryers deſired nothing
more, than to ſee it (with all expedition) burnt
down to the ground. Yea, ſome have averred it
for a certain Truth, That the News of it was known
many days before in Forein Countries, which was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57009:26"/>
related to us by one of the Fathers of that Society
for a Miracle; ſaying, That without doubt the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telary
Angel of the place, foreſeeing what was to
happen to it, had communicated the knowledge of
it to ſo far diſtant Countries. But not to inſiſt on
this any longer, certain it is, that the whole Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was reduc'd to Aſhes, and in leſs than ſix Months,
in a manner quite Rebuilt again; a good part of
the Materials having been prepared before-hand,
and as it were by a Divine Providence, as the ſaid
Father expreſt himſelf, in places adjacent to the
Mountain. It is to be noted, That their General
Chapter having ſome Veneration for thoſe Ancient
Buildings of their Firſt-Fathers, and to prevent
Lay-men from Taxing them with Niceneſs and
Luxury, had refuſed them their permiſſion to Build.
But what is capable to reſtrain the Longing of
Monks, whenas by direct or indirect means, by
Hook or by Crook, they are in a condition to
effectuate it? In a word, Theſe New Buildings
were brought to perfection, with a Magnificence
very unbeſeeming the Modeſty of Hermits, and
more becoming the Palace of a King, than the Cells
of ſuch who pretend to have forſaken the World.
There remain'd only one Building at the Foot of
the Mountain yet unfiniſhed, being deſign'd for the
Officers of the <hi>Chartreuſe,</hi> and which was already
far advanced. As for their manner of Living, I
muſt acknowledge they ſtill retain ſomething of
their firſt Inſtitution, as in particular their abſtinence
from <hi>Fleſh;</hi> but the diverſity and abundance of
<hi>Fiſh, Herbs, Eggs,</hi> and other ſuch like things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57009:27"/>
they are ſerved, is far more pleaſing and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Senſe, than any ſort of Fleſh-meat, and
much more coſtly. The Father-Purveyor of the
Houſe aſſured us, that the Expence of every Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
amounted at the leaſt to Five hundred Crowns
a year. They have a way of extracting the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and as it were the Quinteſſence from ſeveral
great Fiſhes, whereof they make Jelly-Broths, that
are extreamly nouriſhing. Their Bread is of an
extraordinary Whiteneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and the beſt Wine that
can be got for Love or Mony, is afforded them
without meaſure. Beſides this, every Religious has
in his own Apartment a Reſervatory, ſtor'd with
Fruit and other Neceſſaries, ſo that they may eat
and drink whenever they pleaſe, and entertain their
Friends that come to Viſit them, to charm the irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs
of their Solitude. Some amongſt them,
who are of a melancholy Temperament, are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed
in their Solitude, that they abhor all manner
of Converſation, and will not ſo much as ſpeak to
their Superiours: This is no Vertue, but rather a
Savage-humor, that has got the Aſcendent over them,
and makes them almoſt inſupportable to themſelves,
and like <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> they conceive an hatred
againſt all Mankind. The greateſt part of theſe,
in proceſs of time, become diſtracted, loſing the uſe
of their Underſtanding and Reaſon; and accordingly
they have built for theſe a very fair Apartment.
Every <hi>Chartreux</hi> has his ſeparate Apartment, which
conſiſts of five or ſix fair Rooms, very neatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
and adorn'd, with a neat Garden, which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
one Apartment from another; all which Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57009:27"/>
have a Door that opens into the Cloiſter, which
is of a prodigious length, and of a moſt ſumptuous
and magnificent Structure, inſomuch as it doth not
ſeem ſo much contrived for the Convenience of the
ſeveral Cells, as for the imbelliſhment and ornament
of the Place. The great company of Strangers,
who come thither from all parts, either out of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
or Devotion, ſome about buſineſs, others to
Viſit ſome of their Friends or Kindred, has chang'd
this Solitude into a place of great Concourſe, and
conſequently made it appear leſs hideous to Nature;
and particularly in Summer-time many Perſons of
Quality retire thither, there to enjoy the deliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the place, and the cool Air of the Mountain.
Theſe Fathers, to engage the frequent Viſits of
others, and to draw thither their Kindred and
Friends, have eſtabliſhed Hoſpitality in this their
Monaſtery, and entertain every one that comes,
according to his Quality, both Perſon and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
without coſting them a Farthing; and a man
may ſtay their many days, according as they find his
Company either pleaſing or profitable. At the firſt
they had alſo ſome reſpect for the Poor; but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
if thoſe who come there be not men of Faſhion,
and in good order, they are neglected and contemn'd.
That Part where they entertain Strangers, is a moſt
ſtately and ſumptuous Building, containing Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for perſons of Quality of all Ranks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
The Chief Officer of the Kitchin knows
what kind of Entertainment is ſuitable to each
Chamber, which is very exactly obſerved. By this
we may gueſs at the immenſe Riches of theſe Fathers.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57009:28"/>
You would be aſtoniſhed, Sir, to ſee theſe <hi>Anchorets,</hi>
whoſe firſt Inſtitutor, St. <hi>Bruno,</hi> ſhewed himſelf to
be ſo great a lover of <hi>Poverty, Retirement,</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
are now by ſucceſſion of Times, mounted to
ſo high a degree of Riches and Grandeur, and ſo
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rdently deſirous to change their Deſert, of it ſelf ſo
ſolitary and inacceſſible, into a well inhabited Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and more frequented, than the great Roads that
lead to great and Capital Cities. They boaſt, that
they have never been Reformed ſince their firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
but in good earneſt, Sir, think you not
after all this, that they ſtand in need of a Sound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation?
We may conclude from hence, That
all thoſe great Efforts which are made to ſurmount
Nature, which cannot ſubſiſt without a moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Grace and Aſſiſtance from God, which he
vouchſafes to whom it pleaſeth him, when we will
unadviſedly appropriate the ſame, and raſhly make
profeſſion of them, and tye our ſelves up to them by
Vows, do commonly end in ſhameful Weakneſſes;
which diſcovers, that they were rather Artifices of
the Devil, to lift up the Heart of Man, in order to
his greater fall, than the Motions of Grace, which
are wont to humble and abaſe the Soul, in order to
give it the Victory over the World, the Fleſh, and
the Devil. After this, as it were to caſt Duſt in our
Eyes, and to divert us from making any Reflection
upon ſuch extravagant Diſorders, they led us to the
Chappel of St. <hi>Bruno,</hi> which is not above a Quarter
of a Mile diſtant from the Monaſtery, upon the top
of a Rock, ſurrounded with Three great Fir-Trees.
They told us, that this formerly had been his Cell,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57009:28"/>
and that a Spring of moſt Clear-Water we ſaw
there, had been miraculouſly obtain'd by his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which reſtored many Sick perſons to their health,
and though drunk to exceſs, was never known to
hurt any. The <hi>Benedictin</hi> Fryer, who was my
Companion in the Voyage, drunk a great quantity
of it by way of Devotion, but was much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded
thereby in coming down from the Mountain;
which, that he might derogate nothing from the
Miracle, he attributed to the cold and pent-in Air
of the Rocks. This Father aſſured me often, whilſt
we were there, That he felt his Soul pierced with an
Extraordinary Devotion, and a great Senſe of the
Preſence of God; and demanded of me, Whether I
was not ſenſible of the ſame thing? I anſwered,
That I was; but withal, that in all this I did not
believe any thing to be more than what was very
Common; it being very natural for <hi>Grotto's,</hi> Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places,
cloſe and ſhady Foreſts, vaſt Caverns, and
the Sources of Fountains and Rivers, to produce the
ſame effect in us; and not only ſo, but that we often
experience, when we are alone by Night in great
Buildings, Chappels, or Churches, that our Souls are
moved with a kind of Horrour, which calls God to
our Remembrance, as I have often found by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in my Travels. And ſome few days after, as
I paſs'd the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which are very high Mountains,
in Company of this <hi>Benedictin,</hi> when we were come
to a place which was very Solitary, I obliged him
to take notice, Whether it were not indeed ſo as I
had ſaid? Whereupon he ingenuouſly acknowledged,
That he found himſelf no leſs moved, than he had
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57009:29"/>
been at the great <hi>Chartreuſe.</hi> Nevertheleſs, theſe
Fathers make all Strangers, that frequent this place,
to take notice of it as a ſpecial Bleſſing of God,
vouchſafed to this place by the Interceſſion and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of St. <hi>Bruno.</hi> It is an aſtoniſhing thing to ſee,
That thoſe Effects, which God as the Author of
Nature works in us, are for the moſt part by thoſe of
the Communion of <hi>Rome</hi> aſcribed to God, as the
Author of Grace, and Worker of Miracles in their
behalf. So true it is, That it is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ery pleaſing
thing, and extreamly flattering the Pride of Man,
to believe, That God thinks us worthy to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the Common-way, that he may favour
us in a more peculiar manner, not ſticking every
moment (for our ſakes) to countermand the Natural
Courſe of things here below, by Prodigies and
miraculous Operations. We came down from this
Monaſtery, by a very Narrow-way between Rocks,
for the ſpace of near two Leagues, having on our
left Hand the Torrent of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates
it ſelf with a horrid Noiſe from the Top of
the Mountain to the Bottom of it, where is ſituate
the Town of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> from whence it borrows
its Name. All the Neighbouring Country many
Leagues about, belongs to the Religious of this
Monaſtery, and every where are ſeen ſtately piles of
Building, and Houſes of Pleaſure, which they have
cauſed to be built, with Pools and Ponds full of all
ſorts of rare Fiſh, to pleaſe their Palats. We after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
continued our Way towards <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
paſſed the <hi>Alpes</hi> by the Way of <hi>Montſenis;</hi> from
whence we came down into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to a little
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57009:29"/>
Town called <hi>Suſe.</hi> Here, Sir, I intend to ſtop, and
ſhall conclude this Letter with this laſt Reflection,
which I would deſire you to make; which is,
That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo far from having
any Cauſe, to pride her ſelf in her Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and of which ſhe boaſts ſo much, as far
excelling the <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> which has wholly
excluded them, ought rather upon that account
to be humbled; yea, to bluſh for ſhame; ſeeing it
is evident, That this ſort of Men, under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pretexts of Devotion, Silence, and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
endeavour nothing elſe, but to acquire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a great Eſteem in the Minds of people, that
by this means, they may turn them which way they
pleaſe; and Experience makes it appear, That all this
is done for their Temporal Advantage. They begin
with the Spirit in appearance, but always palpably
end in the Fleſh. I have made ſome other more
curious Diſcoveries during my Voyage in <hi>Italy,</hi>
which I ſhall be very willing to communicate to
you, in caſe I find you are not offended with this
my Firſt LETTER; but that you have received
it with the ſame Spirit of Charity and Zeal, which
I ſhall always preſerve for the Spiritual Good of ſo

               </opener>
               <p>FOraſmuch as their is nothing, the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> more ſtrictly forbids her Children,
next to the Reading of the Scriptures, than the
peruſing of thoſe Writings, which diſcover the Lives
and Doctrin of her Paſtors, whom it is her will
they ſhould follow Blind-fold, without examining
either what they ſay or do; I had ſome fear for my

upon it, and the good inclination you expreſs, in
declaring your willingneſs to be further informed
by me on this Subject, may at length conduce to
the opening of your Eyes, to ſee the dangerous
condition you are in. And ſeeing I deſire nothing
more, than to ſerve as an inſtrument to produce

               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:57009:30"/>
Being arrived at <hi>Suſa,</hi> a ſmall Town of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſubject to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
we were told that the Body of S. <hi>Maurus</hi> Abbot
and firſt Diſciple of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> repoſed in one of the
Churches of this place. And foraſmuch as the
Father, that was my Companion in my Travels,
was a Reformed Benedictin, of the Congregation
of S. <hi>Maurus</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> I asked him whether he
would not go to pay his duty to that Relique of
his Bleſſed Founder? But he very freely told me,
that he would take heed of doing ſo, adding that
the <hi>Italians</hi> were great Cheats, who pretended to
have all the Saints of Paradiſe in their Country,
whereas indeed there was nothing more falſe; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as the Body of S. <hi>Maurus,</hi> was preſerved
whole and entire, in one of their Abbies in <hi>France.</hi>
And moreover aſſured me that the Bodies of S. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi>
and S. <hi>Scholaſtica</hi> were there likewiſe, the one
in the ſmall Town of S. <hi>Bennet</hi> on the River <hi>Loire</hi>
near <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the other at <hi>Mans;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the <hi>Italians</hi> conteſted with them about all
theſe Reliques, and a vaſt number of others, of
moſt authentick Authority; and that upon no other
ground, but that of the Popes Bulls, which they
have procur'd, ſaid he, by ſome artifice or other,
for this purpoſe, and which declare them to be true
and lawful poſſeſſors of theſe Reliques, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> clear
contrary to all Evidence drawn from Hiſtory and
Tradition. But Father, ſaid I, do you remember the
diſcourſe you held two days ago, as we paſſed the
<hi>Alpes,</hi> to prove the Pope's Infallibility, which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with ſo much heat and earneſtneſs, not only
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57009:31"/>
to matters of Right, but alſo to matters of Fact?
The queſtion then put was this, how the Popes
could grant ſuch thundring Bulls, fraught with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications
and Anathemas againſt thoſe who
do not believe, that the Houſe of <hi>Loretto,</hi> was
Tranſported from the Holy Land by Angels, to
that part of <hi>Italy,</hi> where it is ſuppoſed to ſtand at
preſent; as likewiſe againſt thoſe who ſhould deny,
that a great Mountain near to the City of <hi>Cajeta</hi>
in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which is open at the
Top, and as it were ſplit in two, was one of thoſe
Rocks, that were Rent at the Paſſion of our Saviour
Jeſus Chriſt. You then affirmed that the Pope on
all ſuch occaſions, was aſſiſted with an Infallible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the Holy Ghoſt; and conſequently,
that it was impoſſible for him to be deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or to deceive others, any more than in matters
of Faith it ſelf; and more eſpecially yet, in a caſe
of giving Religious Worſhip to ſome object of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
as that is, which is given to the Houſe of
<hi>Loretto,</hi> and to the Holy Mountain; and how then
can you now ſay, Father, with reſpect to your
S. <hi>Maurus</hi> and S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> or any other whatſoever,
that thoſe Popes, who declar'd againſt you in favour
of the <hi>Italians,</hi> have been miſtaken? Is not this a
caſe of Worſhip, as well as that of <hi>Loretto?</hi> The
Parity was but viſible, and the good Father muſt
needs have entangled himſelf in a moſt troubleſome
contradiction: Wherefore to avoid the ſhame and
confuſion that thence would have followed, he choſe
rather to turn his anſwer into a piece of Raillery,
ſaying, he confeſſed that he was indeed a very bad
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57009:31"/>
politician, becauſe when he was on the <hi>Alpes</hi> he ſpake
like an <hi>Italian,</hi> but that at preſent he ſpoke as a
<hi>Frenchman.</hi> Becauſe it is true, that the People of
<hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of the Popes Territories, do
own the Popes Infallibility in matters of fact, which
the greateſt part of the Roman Catholicks of <hi>France</hi>
do deny. This diſtinction of ſpeaking as an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
or as a <hi>Frenchman</hi> was indeed very frivolous;
and intruth if it were permitted to utter ones opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſometimes according to the humor of one
Country, and ſometime of another, if our <hi>Bened<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctin</hi>
had ſpoken like a <hi>German</hi> or an <hi>Hungarian,</hi> he
would have reduced the Papal Authority to a very
low Ebb: for I have obſerved in my Travels, that
theſe People, thô for the moſt part they profeſs the
Romiſh Religion, yet have this advantage that they
believe little of it. Without doubt, Sir, it would
much better have become him, to have ſpoke as a
Chriſtian ought to do, <hi>viz.</hi> Like a good and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
man, with a ſincere and unbyaſſed Spirit,
ſtrengthened by Grace, ſupported by Reaſon, and
grounded upon the Holy Scripture, for then would
he never have attributed the title of Infallible to a
mortal man upon Earth, which belongs to God
alone. I was ready to give him my thoughts to
this purpoſe, but I called to mind that I was got
into <hi>Italy,</hi> where one only word might drag me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the cruel and mercileſs Tribunal of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
and therefore thought it more wiſdom to
hold my Peace. However I could not but make
this reflection on theſe procedings of the Religious,
that in caſes wherein the Prieſts or Monks find their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57009:32"/>
advantage, or in things altogether indifferent to
them, they are not wanting with open Mouth to
publiſh the Popes Infallibility; but when his Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
ſeems in the leaſt to claſh with their intereſts,
he is no more than an ignorant and miſtaken man,
who may be bubbled as well as any other. From
<hi>Suſa</hi> we came to <hi>Turin,</hi> which is a very fine City,
ſituate upon the Banks of the River <hi>Po,</hi> and the
Court of the Dukes of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Here it was that
a dawning of the Beauty of the Churches of <hi>Italy,</hi>
preſented it ſelf to our Eies: The greateſt part of
the Pariſh-Churches, Monaſteries and Convents
are very ſumptuouſly built, and moſt Richly adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within. Nothing is ſeen in them, but Marble,
Porphyry, Jaſper Stones, and moſt exquiſite Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and Painting. The Croſſes, the Candleſticks,
Lamps, Statues, and Caſes of the Relicks are all of
Gold and Silver, and almoſt infinite in number and
value. Some good French Prieſts, who had joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves with us, to take a view of the Churches,
were in a ſtrange rapture at ſo dazling a ſight, and
being inwardly moved to ſee ſo many Temples of
the Lord, ſo gloriouſly adorn'd, wept for joy: For
as in their Journy from <hi>France,</hi> they had taken their
way through <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the <hi>Swiſs Cantons,</hi>
where they had ſeen the Proteſtant Churches, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
almoſt of all material Embelliſhments, they
from thence concluded, (how truly I leave you to
judge) that there was no other true Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe zeal for
the Houſe of God, was an evident Witneſs of the
truth of her Faith. I told them that this their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57009:32"/>
ſeemed to me to be built upon very weak
Principles, and that where we had a mind to prove
the truth of any Religion, the Grandeur and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the World were too weak premiſes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a concluſion; and that for my part, if I were
to form a preſumptive Argument in favour of any
Religion, I ſhould ſooner take it from the good life
and manners of thoſe that profeſs it, than from the
ſumptuous Ornaments of their Churches. They
ſhewed us the Church Treaſury, where is preſerved
the holy Shrowd or Sheet, and ſoon after the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and Prieſts entred the Quire, to Sing their
Veſpers and Complins which are the Evening Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They entred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any order and very undecently, talking and
laughing together, and puſhing one anothers El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows.
The firſt come, without expecting till the
reſt were ſeated in their places, began to ſing the
Office: and that which might well have laſted an
hour and half, in caſe it had been ſaid with the
required Pauſes devoutly and modeſtly, as it is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
in the Common Prayer of the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> was diſpatched in leſs than a quarter of
an hour, with a ſtrange kind of precipitation, ſo
that it was ſcarcely poſſible to diſtinguiſh between
one word and another, or between the end and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Verſes. In truth, Sir, were it lawful
to judge of the Conſciences of men, from any thing
that is outward, I might have had good reaſon to
infer from their behaviour, that their Hearts were
much ſtranged from the words of their Lips, and
their Lips and their Hearts yet further from God.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57009:33"/>
They did not much weary our Patience with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them; and the Service being thus roundly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched,
they rather fled, than went out of Church,
every one his own way. The Father that was
with me, perceving that I was Scandalized at it,
told me, as having had ſome former experience of
<hi>Italy,</hi> by a Journy he had before made through it;
that it was not yet time for me to be offended, and
that the nearer I ſhould appear to <hi>Rome,</hi> the more
cauſe I ſhould find for it. I had been told indeed, that
the further I went, the more ſtately Churches I ſhould
find, and the more richly adorned: So that joyning
theſe two together, I concluded, that all this outward
Bravery and Ornament, did not proceed from the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or zeal of the Clergy of <hi>Italy</hi> for the Houſe of
God; becauſe they neglected the chief Glory and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhment
of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the inward, and that ſomething
elſe muſt be the Motive to it, as I diſcovered after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and of which I ſhall give you a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
account upon another occaſion. After we
had viſited the Churches, towards Evening, we
went to view the great <hi>Piazza</hi> of <hi>Turin,</hi> facing
the Palace of his Royal Highneſs. Here we ſaw
many Theaters or Stages of Rope-Dancers, and
Mountebanks, wherewith the Market Places of
the Cities in <hi>Italy</hi> are always well provided, for
the Satisfaction of the Publick. But that which
ſurprized me moſt was, that the greateſt part of thoſe
that aſſiſted as Auditors and Spectators about thoſe
Theaters, were either Prieſts or Monks, who clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
their Hands in Applauſe of the moſt Ridiculous
and Scandalous ſtuff they produced, and laughed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57009:33"/>
with all their might. We ſaw there of all ſorts of
Orders, ſome Father-Jeſuits, that ſeemed the moſt
concerned for theſe Fopperies, ſaluted the Father <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictin</hi>
that was with us; and having underſtood
that he was Procurator general of the Order, they
offered him an Eminent place, near unto themſelves,
which he accepted of. For my part, I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to engage my ſelf in the concern, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
with the two French Prieſts to our Inn. We
had an opportunity the ſame Evening of diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Count <hi>Zamberti,</hi> an Officer of his Royal
Highneſs, whom formerly I had ſeen in <hi>France,</hi>
and we could not keep our ſelves from acquainting
him how ſtrangely we had been ſurprized, to ſee
ſo many Religious at the publick Shews, and ſo
attentive to the lewd Fooleries of <hi>Buffoons,</hi> becauſe
we looked upon it, as very unworthy and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and that no ſuch thing was to be ſeen in
<hi>France.</hi> He told us, that this was not that which ought
moſt of all to ſuprize us, for that in <hi>Italy,</hi> thoſe of
the Clergy who did commonly fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quent the <hi>Piazza</hi> in
the Evening, were the moſt eſteemed of, as being
ordinarily the beſt amongſt them; becauſe the reſt at
the ſame time were for the moſt part either in Whore-Houſes,
or at Taverns, in company of their
Wenches. Here I turn'd my ſelf to our French Prieſts,
and ſaid, well Gentlemen, what ſay you now?
Do you think you concluded well from the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of the Churches of this Country, that
their Religion and Piety muſt needs be the beſt,
becauſe their Churches were the moſt ſtately and
ſumptuous? whereas you ſee that theſe who ought
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57009:34"/>
in a more eſpecial manner, to be the living Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Holy Ghoſt, abandon themſelves to
ſuch execrable Profaneneſs and Debauchery? As to
that which we alledged, that no ſuch lewd deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were to be found amongſt our Eccleſiaſticks
in <hi>France,</hi> the Count very wiſely replied, that for
that, we might thank the Proteſtants, for that it
was only their preſence that mantained the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Modeſty and reſerved Carriage of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and if they once ſhould
be forced to quit the Country, (for the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was already known here) we ſhould ſoon ſee
all Sciences and Vertues exil'd with them. This,
Sir, agrees incomparably well with what ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality of the Roman Communion have of
late freely owned to me, That they begin already
in <hi>France</hi> to perceive, that ſince the Proteſtants
have been Baniſhed thence, and that they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them far enough from them; the burning Zeal
of the Eccleſiaſticks is turnd to Lukewarmneſs, their
Devotion grown cold, and their Application to
their Studies, become very flat and languiſhing.
So that at preſent they are ſeldom found at their
Books, but for the moſt part Ranging from one
Houſe to another, upon pretence of encouraging
and confirming their new Perverts, and boaſting
themſelves for great Doctors, with what they have
learnt, at a time, when they were forced upon by
the learned Writings, and cloſe Arguings of the
Proteſtant Miniſters. I return now to my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
but before I leave <hi>Turin,</hi> becauſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made mention of the Church, wherein is kept
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57009:34"/>
the Holy Shrowd or Linnen-ſheet, wherein they
pretend our Saviours dead Body was wrapt; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you will not take it amiſs, if I tell you in
ſhort what I think of it. They of your Religion
ſuppoſe it to be the ſame Shrowd or Linnen-ſheet,
in which <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> wrapt up and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the precious Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that it was taken down from the Croſs, and that
the Figure of that adorable Body remains Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
imprinted upon it, for the Comfort of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
I intend not to enter the Liſts about the
truth of that Hiſtory, which I never ſearched into;
but I ſhall only tell you, Sir, that there is another
of them to be ſeen in the Cathedral of <hi>Beſançon</hi> in
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> which they maintain to be the ſame
in which <hi>Joſeph</hi> wrapt the Body of our Saviour:
Several Popes according to their diſtinct Fancies and
Humours have granted ſeveral Bulls and Indulgences,
ſome to that of <hi>Turin,</hi> others to that of <hi>Beſançon,</hi>
until that theſe Conteſtations raiſed ſuch extream
Feuds between the Archbiſhops of theſe two Cities,
that at laſt they fell to libelling one another;
whereupon to ſtifle the Flame from ſpreading further,
a way was found out at <hi>Rome</hi> to reconcile them,
by determining (contrary to the expreſs words of the
vulgar Tranſlation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. <hi>&amp; involvit illud
Sindone mundâ,</hi> and wrapped it in a clean Linnen-cloth,
where the word <hi>Sindone</hi> is in the Singular
Number), that there were two, and conſequently
that both the one and the other of them were true.
It cannot indeed be denied, but that there was ſuch
a Shrowd or Linnen-cloth, and it is poſſible that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57009:35"/>
with great care it might have been preſerved till
now; but to ſee the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
of two Biſhops, with ſo much eaſineſs,
boldly to determin that there were two, when the
Scripture ſeems but to ſpeak of one, this is that which
will not go down with men of underſtanding: And
moreover to ordain that the ſame Worſhip and
Adoration be given to them both on <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> which
is given to the Croſs on Good-Friday, which does not
differ at all from what is given to Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
This is no leſs than down right Impiety and
Idolatry.</p>
               <p>After ſome days ſtay at <hi>Turin,</hi> finding my ſelf
within two days Journy of <hi>Genoua,</hi> the curioſity
of ſeeing that Lofty City, made me reſolve to go
thither. However I found ſome ſtrife in my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, becauſe of the Satisfaction I had enjoy'd in
the Company of my <hi>Benedictin,</hi> whoſe Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was indeed very pleaſant and agreeable; as
finding that if I continued my Reſolution, it would
be neceſſary for us to part; for the Letter of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
which he had ſhewed me, of his General,
expreſſed, that he was without ſtop or ſtay to go
directly to <hi>Rome.</hi> I Communicated to him my
Reſolution of going to <hi>Genoua,</hi> whereupon he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
told me, that he was reſolved to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with me, and that he would order the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo, as his Superiors ſhould know nothing of it,
and accordingly in the Letter he wrote to them
from <hi>Turin,</hi> acquainting them, that being not
not yet wholly recovered from ſome Fits of an Ague
he had had, he ſhould he obliged to remain there
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57009:35"/>
ſtill for ſome days, which was juſt the very Time
he took, to go this Journy with me. I found by
this that the moſt reformed Monks, make no great
ſcruple of Violating the Obedience they have Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to obſerve, and to tranſgreſs the Rules they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
upon the leaſt occaſion that preſents it ſelf to
them, of any particular Satisfaction. The uſe of
Meat was alſo forbid him by his Rule, and yet he
no ſooner found himſelf at a diſtance from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries
of his Order, but he made bold with it;
and as ſoon as he met with another, he took up
his obſervance again, as before, deſiring me not to
divulge that ever he had Tranſgreſſed it. And in
the mean time, I can ſay with truth, that I never
ſaw a more Rigorous Cenſor of another mans
actions than he was, when he was in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Monks, who were not Reformed, or who
took more liberty than thoſe of their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he would undertake them in a high manner,
yea with Inſolence it ſelf: He ſaid, he could not
look upon them any better than damn'd Souls,
and worſe than Devils. Neither had he any more
charitable Opinion, for the People, whom the
Monks, by way of diſtinction, term the People
of the World, and Worldlings, with which words
they denote all Laymen in general. It ſeem'd to
him impoſſible for a man that liv'd at large in the
World, to be ſaved, except he took up, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
himſelf to a Convent; yea, and it muſt be in a
Convent of his Order too. If by chance he ſaw
in the Streets a Woman well dreſſed, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
whether her Condition, or ſome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57009:36"/>
might oblige her to it, he immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
a Sentence of Eternal Condemnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her; ſaying, that ſhe was a Victim deſtin'd
to the Flames of Hell; and if he heard ſpeak of
any perſons newly Married, or that had obtained
ſome good Fortune, alas, ſaid he, theſe perſons make
their Paradiſe of this World, but they ſhall burn
for ever in the other for it. And thus without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
any whatſoever, and putting a wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
upon the moſt innocent Actions, he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an inveteracy of Heart, what belongs alone
to God to judge of. What I now ſay, is not only
to be underſtood of this Religious alone, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
almoſt of all ſorts of Reformed Religious,
or thoſe who profeſs a more ſtrict life than others;
and of ſecular Prieſts alſo, who by their little Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
ways, pretend to be quite diſtinguiſhed
from the Common ſort of People: I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that they judge Men without Mercy. Some
have owned to me, that from their Youth up they
have been accuſtomed to theſe Ideas, the World
having been always repreſented to them as a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous
and Raging Sea, whence it is very rare for
any one to eſcape, without being Shipwrack'd, and
that their Monaſteries are the very Ports of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the Havens of Grace, where it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to periſh. Whereas it were much better, to
educate them in a Spirit of Humility, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
them with charitable thoughts towards their
Neighbour, whether they be joyned with them in
the ſame profeſſion of Life, or engaged in another
way, to which we ought Chriſtian-like to believe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57009:36"/>
that God hath called them. This indeed we muſt
own, that it ſeems to be the unhappy Let of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
whatſoever, that engage themſelves in a party,
not to have any conſideration but for thoſe of their
own company, deſpiſing and condemning all the
reſt. It was this conſideration without doubt, that
made our Fathers, the firſt Reformers of Religion
to diſapprove and afterwards to reject all theſe kind
of inequalities, which by dividing men into ſeveral
different States, do ordinarily divide their Hearts
alſo, and by this means ſeparate them from the
Charity of Jeſus Chriſt. But to return to our <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictin,</hi>
who as he was extreamly Rigorous to others,
ſo was he as Indulgent to himſelf. He was naturally
very Comical, and inclined to Raillery, and did
not affect that Monkiſh Gravity, but upon certain
occaſions.</p>
               <p>We arrived at <hi>Genou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> the 1<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>September.</hi>
Being informed that there was a very fair Abby of
his Order in the City, called St. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Genoua,</hi>
he would needs go and Lodge there, in hopes of
being as well Entertain'd, as he had been hitherto in
the ſeveral Monaſteries he had called at. He went
and preſented his Letter of Obedience to the Abbot,
who having read it, took a view of him from Top
to Toe: He asked him, of what Order he was?
He anſwered, that his Letter ſhewed that, and that
he was a Reform'd <hi>Benedictin:</hi> The other reply'd,
That he believed nothing of what he ſaid, becauſe
he was not in the Habit of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> which was
the chief mark which diſtinguiſh'd their Order.
Now, it is to be noted, that theſe Monks in <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57009:37"/>
wear Gowns of Courſe-Cloth, with a Cowl cut
very ſtrait; whereas the <hi>Italians</hi> have extreamly
amplified theirs, and wear Stuffs very fine and
luſtrous; they are very neatly ſhod, wear Silk-Stockins,
fine grey Hats, and are not a whit inferiour
to the Bravery of Lay-men. Moreover, a ſmall
difference in the Habits in <hi>Italy,</hi> makes alſo a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Order. There are about Ten Sorts of the
Religious of the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> which are
only diſtinguiſh'd from one another, becauſe ſome
of them have their Sleeves, or their Cowls, two or
three Fingers-breadth larger than the others. And
yet this makes ſo great a diviſion between them,
that they cannot endure the ſight of one another,
and hate one another mortally. The Monk of
whom I am ſpeaking, was not ſprucely enough
accommodated, according to their Mode, to pleaſe
this nice and curious Abbot; and the concluſion
was, That he very baſely deny'd him entrance into
his Monaſtery. The poor <hi>Benedictin</hi> was put into
ſuch a Rage by this Affront put upon him, that he
could not forbear downright Railing at the Abbot
in his own Monaſtery; telling him, That he was
an Abbot accurs'd of God; that Damnation would
be his portion, and that all thoſe who lived under
his Conduct, might make State to go to Hell with
him; that it was they that had changed the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Habit of the Order; and alter'd it to that
degree, that it ſeem'd at preſent rather contriv'd to
pleaſe and entice young Ladies, than to diſtinguiſh
them from the people of the World; and that they
would ſee one day, but alas too late! what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57009:37"/>
their glorious Patriarch would afford them
in Heaven to that poor Habit which he had upon
his Body, and which they vilified ſo much here on
Earth. The Abbot found himſelf ſo extreamly
netled at this Invective, that he threatned our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Monk, that in caſe he did not that very
Evening depart the City, he would take care to
ſtop his Pipes for him. The poor Monk frighted
and trembling at this Threat, returns to the Inn
where I was, and gave me an account of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter.
This was the Reaſon that I ſtay'd only three
Days at <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ua,</hi> becauſe my Companion, for fear of
being Sacrificed to the <hi>Italick</hi> Revenge, durſt not
ſtir abroad, but was fain to keep himſelf ſhut up in
a Chamber, all the while I ſtaid there to take a
View of the City.</p>
               <p>Revenge is an abominable Vice, and which at
preſent is not without great Reaſon particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to the <hi>Italians;</hi> but certainly amongſt
them all, there are none who exerciſe and act it
with greater Rage and Fury than the Clergy;
who, as they have no Families to care for, their
Attention is leſs divided, and conſequently more
united and concentred, to reſent Injuries done unto
them, and have alſo more leiſure time to deſcant
upon them; and beſides all this, in caſe of any
Accident, they have none but their own perſons to
ſave. Neither do they fear ſo much as others the
Confiſcation of their Goods, as being aſſured, That
whatſoever Country their Lot may caſt them upon,
ſo it be the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, they cannot miſs of
getting a Livelyhood by their Maſſes, and of being
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57009:38"/>
furniſh'd with a full ſupply of their Neceſſities.
This is a Patrimony that follows them whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they go, and cannot be taken away from
them, but with their Life. One thing which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
facilitates the taking of Revenge in <hi>Italy,</hi> is,
the great number of petty Principalities, into which
it is divided; and whereof the Princes are all of
them Independent one of another, and extreamly
jealous of preſerving their Rights, eſpecially of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi>
and <hi>Refuge,</hi> to thoſe who having done ſome ill
Turn, retire themſelves to their Territories. The
King of <hi>France</hi> would ſooner and with more eaſe
obtain a Fugitive perſon from the Emperor, than from
the Duke of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> whoſe Territories do not
extend themſelves to Three <hi>Italian</hi> Miles; becauſe
always the more inconſiderable any Power is, the
more it ſtrives to appear great. The Commonwealth
of St. <hi>Marin,</hi> is but an inconſiderable Hamlet of
about ſome Fifty Houſes of poor Peaſants, who are
govern'd by themſelves: And tho' they be ſhut in
on every ſide by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Territories, which they
call the <hi>Domaine</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> yet they do give
ſuch a reſolute Protection to Prieſts guilty of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or Manſlaughter, that it is not poſſible for the
<hi>Pope</hi> to perſwade them, to deliver up any one of
them. Neither are the Sovereign Princes of <hi>Italy</hi>
only thus jealous of the Franchiſes of their Eſtates,
but alſo all perſons of Quality in general, who will
not permit a Malefactor to be ſeized in their Houſes.
I ſhall here tell you by the by, Sir, that it is this
pretended Liberty, which was the Riſe of the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe
or Liberty of the Ambaſſadors of Crowned-Heads
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57009:38"/>
Heads at <hi>Rome,</hi> and which caus'd the great Diſpute
between Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. and the <hi>French</hi> King:
For ſeeing the Ambaſſadors to diſtinguiſh themſelves
were willing to have ſome priviledge above the
Ordinary Nobility, they did not only pretend to
have an Immunity for their Palaces, but over and
above, an entire Franchiſe throughout all the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
where their Abode was. Now Pope <hi>Innocent</hi>
the XI<hi>th</hi> conceiv'd it an Enterprize becoming his
Glory and Courage, efficaciouſly to endeavour the
final deſtruction of theſe Retreats for Robbers and
Murtherers in <hi>Rome,</hi> obliging the Ambaſſadors for
ever to renounce the Franchiſes of the Quarters, and
to content themſelves, for the Reſpect born to their
Maſters, with the Immunity of their Houſes. But
to ſpeak Truth, To what purpoſe was it for the
<hi>Pope</hi> to be ſo Zealouſly bent, to aboliſh theſe places
of Refuge? Did not he know, that all the Churches,
Monaſteries, Convents, and Colledges of <hi>Rome,</hi>
are ſo many open places, which one meets with
at every turn, where Injuſtice, Inceſt, Robbery and
Murther are protected and ſecur'd? I confeſs, it
ſeems not unreaſonable, that the Churches of God
ſhould be eſteemed ſo Holy and Sacred, as to make
it a kind of Profanation to enter them Armed, in
order to ſeize a Criminal; but what Reaſon is there
to allow the ſame Priviledge to all Cloiſters and
Houſes of thoſe wretched Monks, that are the very
worſt of Criminals? And the compaſs of whoſe
Walls take up ſo much ground, that if they were
all joyn'd together, they would without doubt make
more than a third part of <hi>Rome;</hi> and what is the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57009:39"/>
Sacredneſs and Holineſs of theſe Profane perſons,
for which they are to enjoy this Exemption? For
my part, I cannot imagine any other Reaſon for it,
but that the <hi>Pope,</hi> with the reſt of the Eccleſiaſtical
Princes of that Communion, endeavouring no leſs
to eſtabliſh their Temporal Power, than their Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Tyranny over the Souls of men, will be very
backward of diminiſhing the Priviledges belonging
to the Monaſteries that are amongſt them; leſt
Foreign Princes following their Example, ſhould
undertake the ſame in their Countries; and ſeeing,
that the <hi>Monks</hi> always ſide with the <hi>Pope,</hi> the taking
of this Courſe, would be a manifeſt weakning of
their own Party. Moreover, theſe Monks are of
ſuch mean and intereſſed Spirits, that if the <hi>Pope</hi>
or a <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſend to them, to deliver up any that
have taken Refuge with them, they immediately
comply with the Demand, as being well pleaſed to
have this occaſion, to procure their Favour at ſo
cheap a rate: But if any other Secular Lord comes
to requeſt any ſuch thing of them, then they ſtand
ſtiffly in defence of their Priviledges, and without
a good piece of Mony in hand, will never grant
their Requeſt. Eſpecially if the Criminal be a Monk
or a Clergy-man; and indeed (as was mentioned
before) that which makes them ſo bold in revenging
themſelves, is the aſſurance they have of being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſeconded and aſſiſted by ſome of their Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
For upon any ſuch occaſion they are very
ready to take one anothers part, ſo that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to offend any one of them, without engaging
with a whole party. For either they are Monks or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57009:39"/>
Fryers, and ſo are Fellow-members with all thoſe of
the ſame Order, Convent or Monaſtery; or they are
Secular Prieſts, and ſo make up one Body with all
the other Prieſts of their Dioceſs, Cathedral or
Pariſh, there being never a Church ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that has not at leaſt fifteen or twenty Prieſts
belonging to it: So that when any one Member of
the ſame Body is offended, all the reſt are affected
by Sympathy, and endeavour to revenge it, as done
to themſelves. 'Tis evident, that a Spirit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
does not engage them to theſe courſes; for
Charity avengeth not it ſelf: But 'tis a kind of
Natural pleaſure they take, to make others feel the
effects of their Rage and Fury, that have either
offended them, or thoſe they have any relation to;
and which makes them ſay with one of their Poets,
<q>
                     <l>Dolciſſima, Mortali, é la Vendetta.</l>
                     <l>Revenge is the ſweeteſt thing in the World.</l>
                  </q>
My ſelf, when I was at <hi>Bononia,</hi> counted no leſs
than Seventeen in one Week, that had been ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to this infernal Fury, and who (for the moſt
part of them) had been murthered by either
Monks or Prieſts. The great Provoſt, who there is
called the <hi>Bargello,</hi> having by Order of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Archbiſhop
made ſearch for a Monk, who very
ſcandalouſly kept a publick Stews, was one of the
number of theſe unhappy Victims, being miſerably
maſſacred on <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> as he was coming out of a
Church. One of the moſt dreadful means the Clergy
have to glut their Vengeance, is the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57009:40"/>
which they have introduc'd under the pretext of
Religion; tho' indeed it be the moſt Diabolical
Invention that ever was forged in Hell, and which
they do as dexterouſly manage for the ſerving of their
particular Self-ends. They have made it an Inquiſition-matter
for any to ſtrike, affront or vilifie any perſon
belonging to the Clergy, whether Secular or Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
I will give you an Inſtance how they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
at <hi>Bononia,</hi> againſt an honeſt man of my
Acquaintance, who in the heat of his Paſſion had
called a <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryer, Old Fool of a Monk.
The Fryer immediately went and made his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to the Inquiſitor, who forthwith caus'd the
Young-man to be ſeized, and caſt into the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition-Priſon,
where he continued Ten Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever any enquiry was made about the Cauſe of
of his Commitment. At laſt he was brought before
the Sacred Tribunal; and foraſmuch as he could
not deny, but that he had call'd the Fryer, <hi>Old
Fool of a Monk;</hi> his Indictment was drawn up to
this purpoſe. He who doth not reſpect Church-men,
doth not believe the Eccleſiaſtick State worthy
of Honour, and conſequently is an Heretick: Now
it is apparent, that you have had no reſpect for
Brother <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who is an Eccleſiaſtick; and
conſequently, neither do you think the Eccleſiaſtick
State worthy of Honour, and therefore are an
Heretick. The Defendant pleaded for himſelf, That
it was true he called the Plaintiff, <hi>Old Fool,</hi> but only
with reſpect to his Perſon, without intending the
leaſt reflection upon his Profeſſion. But the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
inſiſted, That he called him <hi>Fool</hi> with reſpect
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57009:40"/>
to his Profeſſion, by joyning the word <hi>Monk</hi> with
that reproachful word, and without adding theſe
words, <hi>Saving your Character.</hi> For true it is, That
if in <hi>Italy</hi> a man chance to affront a Prieſt or a
Monk, by calling them <hi>Knaves, Raſcals,</hi> or the
like, ſo he do but remember immediately to ſubjoyn,
<hi>Saving your Character,</hi> or, <hi>Saving your Habit,</hi> they
cannot make an Inquiſition matter of it; but if by
miſchance this be forgot, he is undone. Thus this
poor Gentleman was found Guilty. As for Striking
any one of the Clergy, in what manner ſoever it be,
whether ſorely or ſlightly, it is always a matter the
Inquiſition takes Cognizance of. And this is that
which makes the men of the Church ſo peremptory
and inſolent throughout all <hi>Italy.</hi> I hapned at
<hi>Rome</hi> to ſee a Prieſt, who fell out with an Officer
in the <hi>Piazza Novana:</hi> The Officer very dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
and freely ſtain'd the Prieſt with his Tongue,
never forgetting at the end of each Injury, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
him with a <hi>Saving his Character;</hi> which
ſo confounded the poor Prieſt, that quite foaming
with Rage, he began to ſay to the People that ſtood
about; <hi>Gentlemen, I must put this Man into the
Inquiſition, for if I be not miſtaken he ſtruck me:
Did not you ſee him give me a ſlight ſtroak?</hi> Indeed,
he could have wiſh'd he had with all his heart,
that ſo he might have had an opportunity to have
proſecuted his Revenge; but none of thoſe that
were preſent having ſeen any ſuch thing, they
could not witneſs againſt him. The <hi>Italians</hi> have
a Proverb, <hi>That he who would live peaceably at</hi>
Rome, <hi>must take heed of offending any Female, or
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57009:41"/>
Priest; becauſe the Women procure their Lovers to
work their Revenge, and the Clergy make uſe of
the Inquiſition to avenge themſelves.</hi> 'Tis true
indeed, That perſons of Rank amongſt them, as
Abbots, Biſhops, and Cardinals, do not ordinarily
make uſe of this means, as appearing to them a little
too troubleſom. They have Servants and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
who for Mony, or to obtain ſome favour,
do voluntarily offer themſelves to be the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
of their Revenge; and if at any time they
chance to be ſeized in the Act, they are but very
little concern'd at it, fully relying upon their Maſters
Power and Authority, who are never wanting, by
all manner of means, to procure their diſcharge and
liberty. As for the Popes, who are no more exempt
from this weakneſs than other men, neither do they
forget, upon occaſion, to make uſe of the Power
they have in their hands; but like other Monarchs,
whenever they are offended, ſhew themſelves to
have long Hands. There is no ſpeaking to theſe
Holy Fathers of Humility or Patience in ſuffering
of Injuries, in imitation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
whoſe perſon they will needs repreſent upon Earth.
They have in a manner rejected all his Vertues, and
their ſtudy at preſent is to repreſent here below, his
Heavenly Glory, <hi>viz.</hi> his Power and Judicature.
The Title of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which is given them, is only
a ſwelling Term they make uſe of to expreſs their
Pride. We have a Signal Example of Revenge in
the Life of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth. He was of a
very mean Extraction, his Father being a poor
Vine-Dreſſer, and his Mother a Serving-maid, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57009:41"/>
he himſelf in his Youth was reduc'd to be a Hog-heard;
and yet by the ſubtilty of his Spirit, in
conjunction with an extraordinary Fortune, he ſtept
over all theſe Difficulties, and mounted the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
Throne. But ſo far was this meanneſs of his
Birth from inſpiring him with an anſwerable degree
of Humility, in the midſt of that Greatneſs to
which he was rais'd, that he could not endure to
hear the leaſt Hint of it; but by a Revengeful
inclination, which was natural to him, he let looſe
his cruel and unrelenting Nature againſt all thoſe,
who either imprudently, or of ſet-purpoſe let drop
the leaſt word of Contempt reflecting that way;
of which the following Story may be a pregnant
Inſtance: The Statue of <hi>Paſquin</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> appeared
one Morning with a very naſty Shirt pull'd over it;
and <hi>Morforius</hi> demanding the Reaſon, <hi>Why for
ſhame he did not ſhift himſelf, and put on a clean
one? Becauſe</hi> (anſwered <hi>Paſquin) my Waſher-woman
is become a Princeſs.</hi> This Anſwer ſtung
the Pope's Siſter <hi>Camilla,</hi> who of a poor Waſher-woman,
which ſhe was before, was by her Brother
rais'd to a Principality. The Pope being enrag'd
at this cutting Satyr, made uſe of all the ways ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to find out the Author; but miſſing the
deſired ſucceſs in this his Reſearch, he betook himſelf
to Craft and Circumvention, but that to one ſo baſe
and unworthy, that the ſole recital of it is ſufficient
to ſtrike a Man with horrour. He caus'd it to be
publiſhed every where, <hi>That he was ſo extreamly
pleas'd with the delicate Poignancy of this piece of
Wit, that if the Author of it would come and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57009:42"/>
himſelf to him, he would be ſo far from
puniſhing him with Death, that he would bestow
upon him Two Thouſand Crowns for a Reward.</hi>
The poor unhappy Wretch, Trepan'd by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Promiſe, makes himſelf known. The
Pope, upon owning himſelf to be the Author of it,
caus'd the 2000 Crowns to be counted out to him,
aſſuring him withal, That he would be as good as
his word, and that he ſhould not be hanged. At
which words, the Wretch overjoy'd, pour'd forth
his moſt humble Acknowledgments to his Holineſs,
for ſo unparallel'd a piece of Grace. <hi>Ay, Ay,</hi> (anſwer'd
the Pope) <hi>I will be as good as my word in all this;
but take notice, Sirrah, that I never promis'd you
not to cauſe your Hands to be cut off, and your Tongue
to be pluckt out of your Head.</hi> And immediately
commanded the Cruel Sentence to be executed in his
preſence, as a pleaſing Sacrifice to his implacable
Revenge. I have ſometimes ſet my ſelf to enquire,
what might be the cauſe of this Spirit of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
which nowadays is become ſo natural to
the <hi>Italians,</hi> whether it proceed from the Climate,
or Nature of the Country, or from ſome other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
and inevitable Cauſe. But having called to
my remembrance the Generoſity, Courage and
Greatneſs of Soul, that ſhone forth ſo illuſtriouſly
in the Lives of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> who inhabited
the ſame Country, and who rendred themſelves
every where as amiable by their Clemency, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
for their Valour; I ſoon found that I was
rather to ſeek for a Moral Cauſe of it, than a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural;
and as far as I can reach it is this, That the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57009:42"/>
greateſt part of <hi>Italy,</hi> in proceſs of time, being fallen
under the Domination of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> they
ſent Prieſts to be their Lieutenants in the ſeveral
Provinces of their Dominions; a ſort of People
equally ignorant in matters of Commerce and War,
which are the two Sinews of State, and without
which the Government is like a Body afflicted with
the Palſy, without either action or motion. This
Idleneſs, joyn'd to the great Heat of the Country,
and to the corrupt Examples of the ſaid Governours,
as being Men that only minded their pleaſures, at
laſt introduced an entire diſſolution and effeminacy.
In <hi>Rome</hi> of old, the <hi>Sword</hi> ſometime gave way to
the <hi>Robe,</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> to <hi>Letters. Cedant Arma Togae.</hi>
But at preſent all veils to the Love of Women. This
Love being exceſſive and unbounded, is the inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Companion of Jealouſie; and the fruit of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,
inexorable Revenge; which are the two great
Vices which do ſtain the Reputation of the <hi>Italians.</hi>
From this great eaſineſs of Revenging themſelves,
when affronted in their Amours, they are now
arriv'd to that point, as not to ſuffer the leaſt Word,

Dominions, has in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Neighbouring Princes, and at preſent miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

<hi>Bononia</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who were the laſt that have
ſubmitted their Necks to the <hi>Roman-Yoke,</hi> have ſince
that time doubled their Revengeful Spirit. But that
which is moſt of all to be condemned in their way
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57009:43"/>
of Revenge is, That they do commonly execute it
in the baſeſt and moſt cowardly manner imaginable;
that is, either by Poyſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or treacherouſly Stabbing
their Enemy in the Back. They deride our Duels,
and ſay, It is the greateſt Folly in the World, to
put the Sword in our Enemies Hand, and by this
means ſtate him in as fair a condition of being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
of us, as we our ſelves are of being aveng'd
of him. When we have an Enemy (ſay they) we are
not ſuch Fools to cry to him at a diſtance, <hi>Stand
upon your Guard;</hi> but endeavour to kill him with
the firſt occaſion, without putting our ſelves to the
hazard of being kill'd by him. However, Sir, tho' the
<hi>Italians</hi> have their Faults, yet on the other hand I
muſt own, they have alſo ſome very good Qualities;
they are very prudent in the conduct of their Affairs,
very diſcreet in their Diſcourſe, civil and handſom
in their Carriage amongſt themſelves, or towards
Strangers; they are good Counſellors, and very
ready to render Service; conſtant in their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and of a very obliging Humor, provided it coſt
them nothing: They are very Witty, and I dare
ſay, that if their Prieſts and their Monks had not
corrupted them in their Morals, and had not ſo
ſtrangely ſpoil'd and chang'd their Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
(as well as the beſt Country in <hi>Europe</hi>) they
would be ſome of the beſt Men in the World. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>Popery</hi> is grown to that prodigious exceſs of
Idolatry, Superſtition, and Folly, that I am aſtoniſh'd
they are ſo backward in caſting off that Yoke. I
know there are a great many amongſt them, that
begin to open their Eyes, and ſee their Errors; but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57009:43"/>
they dare not declare their Minds to any one what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
for fear of falling Victims to the barbarous
and inexorable Cruelty of the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> This
Tribunal was ſet up more particularly, for a Curb
to the <hi>Italians,</hi> amongſt whom many began to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and to debate the Doctrin of <hi>Rome.</hi> And in
order to make it the more fierce and terrible, the
<hi>Popes</hi> thought they could not truſt it in better hands,
than thoſe of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> a cruel and pitileſs
ſort of Fellows, and more than any other Order,
engag'd to maintain the Popes Intereſt. And to
encourage them to a rigorous diſcharge of that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and butcherly Function, they have found it
convenient from time to time, to confer the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Dignity upon the moſt Zealous Inquiſitors, and
even to raiſe many of them to the Eminence of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals.
Throughout all the Dominions of the Great
Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> this Employ has always been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> many of whom likewiſe
have been elevated to Biſhopricks and Cardinals-Caps.
The end in dividing the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> thus
between two different Orders, was only in order to
the more vigorous maintaining of the ſame by the
Emulation of both the Pretenders. The main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
at firſt intended for the erecting of the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi>
was by ways of Blood and Violence, to put a
ſtop to the progreſs of Hereſie, or to ſpeak in their
own Terms, <hi>Contra Haereticam pravitatem, Againſt
Heretical Pravity:</hi> But the Clergy having ſince
conſidered, the great advantage the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> gave
them, above the Laity, have learnt ſo dexterouſly to
ſerve themſelves of it, that at preſent there is ſcarce
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57009:44"/>
any thing, which they have not brought within the
Verge of that Court, in order to bring about their
private Self-ends. If you fail of paying your Tithes,
without troubling them to examine, Whether
you be able or not; they Argue, That the Reaſon
why you do not pay them, is becauſe you don't
believe they ought to be paid, and conſequently,
that you are an Heretick. If the leaſt word chance
to drop from you, reflecting upon the Licentious
Lives of the Biſhops and Clergy, whether Regular
or Secular, they accuſe you as one whoſe deſign is to
viliſie the Epiſcopal Dignity, and conſequently the
Church it ſelf, in the Eyes of the People; that in
ſo doing you have done the Hereticks work for
them, and ſerved their Intereſt, and therefore muſt
be lookt upon as being one your ſelf. If a Man be
known to have an Eſtate, and in the mean time
ſhews himſelf cold and indifferent in contributing to
the Collections that are made for the ſaying of
Maſſes, and other Prayers, for the repoſe of the
Souls of the Dead; tho' it be well known, that there
is never a Prieſt or Monk that will ſo much as ſay
one without Mony, he is preſently accuſed, as one
who doth not believe <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and conſequently a

Advertiſement, That in caſe you ſhould be guilty
again of the ſame neglect, occaſion would be taken
to recommend you to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> there to learn
better Manners. It is not lawful for any to excuſe,
or to intercede (either in perſon, or by ones Friends)

One cannot ſo much as come to ſpeak with them
without an expreſs permiſſion given in Writing by
the Inquiſitor himſelf, which he never grants, but
with a great deal of difficulty, and very ſeldom.
An Abbot of <hi>Calabria,</hi> one of my Acquaintance,
was put into the Inquiſition at <hi>Venice,</hi> for Smiling
at the Story a certain Monk told, about the Apparition
of a Soul in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> After that he had been a
whole Year in Priſon, I underſtood that Sentence of
Death was not as yet pronounc'd againſt him, tho'
he had been ſeveral times put upon the Rack; and
having occaſion to go to the Inquiſitor, to obtain
his Licence for printing of a Book; I took this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to beg leave of him, that I might go and
ſee this poor Priſoner: Who having heard the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
I made him, look'd ſternly upon me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
what buſineſs I had to concern my ſelf
with him? I told him, That nothing made me to
deſire this Favour, ſave only a motive of Charity,
to beſtow ſome words of Comfort upon him. But
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57009:45"/>
the Monk anſwered me in a moſt rude and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging
way, or rather like himſelf, That the
Priſoner was in very good Hands, and did not at all
ſtand in need of any of my Comfort; ſo that it
was not poſſible for me to get to ſpeak with him.
However, I had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing him ſet
at Liberty about Six Months after, through the
charitable Care, and powerful Interceſſion of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
Epiſcopia,</hi> a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> young Lady, of
extraordinary Learning and Merit, to whom my
Friend dedicated his Learned Poems, which
he had Compoſed during the Time of his
Confinement. I have before mentioned, that
it was not lawful to interceed for any, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
by the Inquiſition; but you muſt know, Sir,
that the Inquiſition is much more favorable at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
than it is in other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> That wiſe
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ate Abhorring the Inhumanity of thoſe Monks
that manage it, have erected a particular Chamber,
where ſome <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobles preſide, and take Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of all matters that are brought before the
Inquiſition, in ſo much that the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> are
not altogether the Maſters of it. This Friend of
mine having had the good Fortune to eſcape ſo
great a danger, was ſo ſenſibly touched with the
Cruelties they had made him ſuffer during his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
that he readily concluded from thence;
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being poſſeſt with ſuch a
Spirit of Cruelty and Barbarity, as is never to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
even amongſt the worſt of Heathens, could
never be the true Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt. She might
indeed be allowed the prudence of Serpents, for her
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57009:45"/>
own preſervation, provided it were always in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
with the mild nature of the Dove, that
ſo ſhe might not render her ſelf unworthy of, and
unlike to him, who wills us to learn of him, to
be meek and lowly of Heart. My Friend confeſt
to me, that indeed, before he was caſt into Priſon,
he had ſome doubts about Purgatory and Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation;
but that ſince that they had gone about
to make him believe them perforce, he believed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all of them, and that he was reſolved to
retire into <hi>Switzerland</hi> or <hi>Geneva;</hi> there to enjoy
that Liberty of Conſcience, which would not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him in his own Country. He told me that
never a Night paſt over his Head, in which he was
not diſquieted in his Sleep, with the frightful Ideas
and repreſentations of the Torments he had in their
Dungeons, where they had Rackt all his Members
out of joynt, one after another, Bruiſed all his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and applied plates of red hot Iron to the Soles
of his Feet. And after all this, to make him the
more ſenſible of his pains, they in this Condition
ſhut him up again for ſome days in his Dungeon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him nothing but a poor morſel of brown
Bread, and a ſmall meaſure of Water, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
put him into the Hands of the Executioners of
the Inquiſition, to go through a new courſe of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
They tied him by one Arm, and by means
of a Pully, hoiſted him up into the Air, and there
left him hanging for ſeveral hours, which time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over they let him down again, rather dead
than alive; and to bring him to himſelf again,
they moſt Cruelly and inhumanly Scourg'd him with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57009:46"/>
a kind of a Whip made of ſlender Iron Chains full of
points, as ſharp as needles, and this till he was all of
a gore Blood. And all this, O ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd
Barbarity! to diſcover the Secrets of a
poor Conſcience, and to ſearch the bottom of a
Heart, which God has reſerved to himſelf as his
own Divine Prerogative. The Father Inquiſitor,
who was all the while preſent, to encourage the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excutioners,
and to obſerve, whether they were not
wanting in their Duty, ſometimes would draw near
to the Patient, and with a ſevere Tone demand of
him, Whether he did not believe Purgatory yet,
wiſhing him to think ſeriouſly of it, for that all that
he ſuffered there, was but a ſlight draught of the
Torments of that place, and that it was much more
Terrible to fall into the Hands of the Living God.
This poor Gentleman anſwered nothing, to all this,
ſave only by Sighs and Tears: but he confeſſed to
me, that ſince, he had made a very ſerious reflection
upon this matter, and that he was come to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult,
that it was utterly inconſiſtent with the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Goodneſs of God, to treat thoſe Souls whom he
had deſtinated to his Heavenly Glory, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of himſelf for ever, to ſuch extremities of
Pains and Torments. That all the works of God
being perfect, he ſhewed Mercy to whom he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mercy, that is to ſay, perfect and compleat Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and that it was infinitely more Glorious for him,
wholly to Pardon both Guilt and Puniſhment, than
to reſerve himſelf a miſerable Vengeance, from the
Fire and Flames of their faigned Purgatory, and
that for this very reaſon he did not believe any thing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57009:46"/>
of it at all. The Common Puniſhment inflicted at
<hi>Venice</hi> on thoſe who are convict of Hereſie, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Strangle them in Priſon, or to tie a great
Stone to their Necks, and ſo caſt them into the Sea.
And herein alſo the Inquiſition of <hi>Venice</hi> is much
more favorable, than it is in other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi>
where they either Burn them alive with a ſlow Fire,
or elſe cut off their Members, one by one, which
are caſt into the Fire before their Eyes, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt of all pluck'd out their Tongues, and made
them ſuffer unexpreſſible Torments. Can you ever
believe in good earneſt, Sir, that this is the Spirit of
the Goſpel? Is this the way our Saviour made uſe of
to convert Sinners? Did he ever threaten the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
or unbelievers with Priſons, Racks and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
Has he ever left us ſo much as one Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or Command to Authorize this ſacred Inquiſition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Method? I trow no, and conſequently this cannot
be the Spirit of Chriſtianity. Thus theſe very
means the Popes take to maintain their Tyranny
over the Conſciences of men, might ſerve (and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt will ſo in time) for juſt Motives to pull
it down, if the People would once open their Eyes,
and Vigorouſly oppoſe themſelves to the effects of a
moſt unjuſt and inhuman Violence. Tis Vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

alone, that ſtands in need of no ſupport; but Sin
and Iniquity are always in the ſearch of props and
contrivances to uphold their tottering and crazy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtution;
and what they cannot carry by the ſtrength
of the Lion, they endeavour to bring about by the
Foxes Craft. Thus what the Popes and their Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
cannot obtain by the Inquiſition, they ſtrive
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57009:47"/>
to compaſs by Artifice and Lies. One of the Chief
Fetches they have to keep the People in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
is to ſecure them in the Chains of profound
Ignorance; firſt of the truths of the Goſpel; very
expreſly forbidding them to read the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as a Book very dangerous and pernicious to
their Souls. Their next care is to prevent any
Books of Controverſy, written by Proteſtants, from
coming into their Hands. Tis an Inquiſitional mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to have or read any of them, or to be privy to
any others having of them: Moreover they take
ſpecial care to charge the Preachers in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that in ſpeaking of the Proteſtants, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very well grounded in their Principles, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
be lookt up, as the moſt formidable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has, they be ſure to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
them to their Auditors, as men that have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
renounced the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and
who do no more believe in him, than Heathens and
Infidels. Wherefore alſo, they indifferently call
them Hereticks aud Infidels; or to make uſe of the
<hi>Italian</hi> word, <hi>Queſti non Criſtiani.</hi> So that indeed
all the Common People, yea and the greateſt part
of thoſe that are learned too, are of the Opinion,
that Proteſtants do not all believe in Jeſus Chriſt,
no more than the Turks do. A Canon once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of me in Rome, by way of Curioſity,
What the Infidels did in <hi>France,</hi> and why they were
ſuffered there? I deſired him to tell me what he
meant by that word, which I did not underſtand;
and finding that he ſpoke of Proteſtants, I told him
that they were no Infidels, but believed in Jeſus
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57009:47"/>
Chriſt as well as the Roman Catholicks, only that
they rejected Tranſubſtantiation, the Maſs, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
&amp;c. and in particular the power and infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Pope. And having heard me diſcourſe
at this rate a good while; In truth, Sir, ſaid he, if
the caſe be as you ſay, I perceive that thoſe People
are not ſuch great Devils, as they are repreſented to
us here. I have often heard it declar'd from the
Pulpit, that they were as unbelieving as the Jews
themſelves; and you are the very firſt, I ever heard
ſay, that the Proteſtants believed in Jeſus Chriſt.
But, Sir, ſaid I, it is impoſſible, but that you who
have ſtudied Divinity, muſt needs have heard of the
Opinions of <hi>Luther, Calvin</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> in the
Treatiſe of the Sacraments in general, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of thoſe of the Euchariſt, Penance, the Sacrifice
of the Maſs, &amp;c. I know, ſaid he, that thoſe Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders
of Hereſie pretended not to deſtroy, but to
reform the Church; and as to ſome points, they
have very ſtrong Arguments, which even to this
day we are hard put to, to anſwer. But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
God, who hath a particular care of his Church,
that he might make known to belivers that theſe
men were in a bad way, has ſo ordered it, that their
whole party came to nothing. For as one Error draws
on another, they have ſtill rowled from one Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice
to another, till at laſt they are fallen into the
Abyſs of Infidelity. They at firſt ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the pretence
of Reforming it, but ſome time after their followers,
reduced all to the particular Spirit, which is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what they pleaſe, and that, provided only they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57009:48"/>
do Worſhip one God, whoſoever he be, and lead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

morally good life, that this is enough for them to be

tell a Lye with them is a Vertue, as long as it is but
employ'd, as they think, for a good end. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that a Jeſuit who was lately come from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
boldly Preached in the Church of <hi>Lateran,</hi>
that all Religion there was reduced to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Spirit; and having made an ample deſcription of
the Meetings of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when he
came to ſpeak of their Sighing and Groaning, and
their Women Preaching, he made all his Auditory
break forth into a loud Laughter, and by this means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
without doubt, tho' with a great deal of Injuſtice,
he made many there preſent, conceive very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly
of that Auguſt and Venerable Body of
Proteſtants, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo Zealous
for the Glory of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt his only
Son; ſo exact and decent in the Worſhip and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
ſhe renders to his Divine Majeſty, and ſo
reaſonable in her Orders and Ceremonies. As long
as thoſe vigilant Paſtors, the Biſhops of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and the Learned Miniſters that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, keep their watchful Eyes fixed on the
Flocks committed to their Charge, there is no cauſe
to fear that ever the Romiſh Wolfe, will be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57009:48"/>
to ſnatch ſo much as any ſingle one of them
out of their Hands; nor will any of her <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi>
as ſubtle Theeves as they be, ever be able by night
to ſteal into the Sheepfold to devour or maſſacre
them, as they have already ſo often endeavoured to
do. I have ſince made this Obſervation on this
Sermon of the Jeſuit, which I heard from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the end, and I could wiſh all Proteſtants
might ſeriouſly take it to Heart, <hi>viz.</hi> That to pull
down the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the great ſecret is not,
abſolutely to reject, as ſome do, all that ſhe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth;
but that the beſt way to compaſs her downfal
is, to retain all that is good in her, only rejecting
the evil. If we abſolutely reject all Faſts, becauſe
they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> obſerve ſome of them,
as they deſire nothing more than to blacken the
Proteſtants, repreſenting their Actions in the worſt
Light they can, and always concealing the good that
is amongſt them, they preſently cry with open
Throat, that the Proteſtants are a ſort of People
that love nothing but their Bellies, abhorring and
abominating whatever ſerves to mortifie the Fleſh.
If we reject Epiſcopacy, they hate, cry they, all
manner of Subjection, and love nothing but Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency.
If we refuſe the uſe of Common Prayer,
we are not joyn'd in the Band of Charity, neither is
there any Union amongſt us: If we do not from
time to time conſult the Miniſters in caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
we reduce all to the private Spirit. In a
word, If we celebrate Marriages and Funerals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Prayers or Ceremonies, they ſay that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
go together like Beaſts, and are Buried like
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57009:49"/>
Dogs. At this rate did this Calumniating Jeſuit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with a renowned Malice, from the beginning of his
Sermon to the end, endeavor to make them odious
and execrable. Neither was it a hard matter for him
to obtain his end, in a Country where they are ſo
little known, and where they are never mentioned
but under the notion of Devils, Hereticks, new Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
and Infidels. But the caſe would be much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
if retaining what is good and lawful or only
indifferent amongſt them, as far as may be, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
would ſingly apply themſelves to oppoſe
thoſe points of Doctrin or Practice amongſt them,
which firſt occaſioned the Reformation; for ſo they
would not be able to condemn them in any thing,
but by producing the points of Doctrin and Practice
in Controverſy, with the oppoſitions made againſt
them; which is a thing they are very loath to do,
for fear of diſcovering their own Nakedneſs. An
evident proof of what I here alledge, is the great
care they take, to hinder any Books of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
from coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> not ſo much as thoſe,
which have been Pen'd by the moſt Famous men of
their own Party. I was extreamly put to it, when
I was at <hi>Rome</hi> to meet with the works of Moſieur
<hi>Arnau'd,</hi> which he had dedicated to the Pope, and
which I dont believe, were ever yet Tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Italian;</hi> their deſign herein being to prevent, by
all means imaginable, the true ſtate of the queſtion
from being known; for their Objections are ſo weak,
and the anſwers they make to thoſe of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
ſo pitiful, that any unprejudiced mind,
may eaſily from their own Books perceive, on what
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57009:49"/>
ſide the Truth lies. If ever there was any Author
that ſtraind his Wits to calumniate and blacken the
Proteſtants, it was without doubt Father <hi>Maimbourg</hi>
the Jeſuit, in his Books of <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſm:</hi>
When I was at <hi>Venice</hi> I undertook the
Tranſlation of all his Works; and had already tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
ſeveral of his Volums, when I took in hand
thoſe of <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> and <hi>Calviaiſm;</hi> but I was
not a little ſurpriz'd, when the Inquiſitor of <hi>Venice,</hi>
would not give me leave to continue the Traduction;
and ſome time after I received an Order from the
Pope, forbidding me to Print thoſe two Books, with
another of the ſame Authors, Treating about the
growth of the power of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Title of Biſhop which was given him in this laſt
Treatiſe, in ſtead of the Magnificent Titles of Pope,
and Sovereign Prieſt, together with ſome curious
enquiries concerning the riſe and progreſs of that
prodigious Grandeur, to which the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi>
are mounted at preſent, were a powerful motive to
the Pope to condemn it: But I could not penetrate,
what reaſon he had to pronounce the ſame Sentence
againſt the other two, except it were, as I have
hinted before, to prevent the occaſion, of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the minds of the <hi>Italians,</hi> the ſtate of the
Queſtion between the Catholicks and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.
For notwithſtanding both theſe Books be
fraught with Scoffs, injurious Reproaches, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
coin'd on purpoſe to render a party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
whom they had reſolved by all manner
of means to run down in the conceit of the
People, yet for all this <hi>Innocent</hi> the XIth, did not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57009:50"/>
believe that this beating of them down, would prove
of as great advantage to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
the Publication of ſome Points of Doctrin, that are
there neceſſarily inſerted, might prove dangerous
and miſchievous to it. You can no way imagin, Sir,
the extream precautions the Popes make uſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
any Proteſtant Books, from being brought into
<hi>Italy.</hi> As there is no other way to enter that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
by Land, without paſſing the <hi>Alpes,</hi> they keep
men expreſs at all the paſſages thereof, to examin
the Travellers that come that way, and ſearch them
whether they have any forbidden Books about them;
amongſt which number are accounted all thoſe that
Trat of Controverſies. In a Journy I made from
<hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Lions,</hi> I took my way, in my return to
<hi>Italy,</hi> through the Land of <hi>Valois;</hi> at the entry of
this Country, which is a kind of ſtraight or narrow
paſſage of the Mountain, there is a famous Abby of
the Canons Regular of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> called S. <hi>Maurice.</hi>
The River <hi>Rhôſne,</hi> which is extreamly impetuous and
violent in this place, and which a little lower diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogues
it ſelf into the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> leaves only
a very narrow way, by which one muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
paſs to enter <hi>Italy.</hi> The Abbot of S. <hi>Maurice,</hi>
had built a Gate at this Paſs, and foraſmuch as he
is the Maſter of it, the Popes who know it to be one
of the Keys of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which opens a way to
<hi>Italy,</hi> have charged him to have a careful Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Paſſengers coming that way, that they do not
bring with them any forbidden Books, becauſe <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
which they ſtand in great fear of, is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from it than the length of its Lake. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57009:50"/>
the Pope had made to the Abbot of making
him a Biſhop, in caſe he were found faithful in the
diſcharge of his Commiſſion, had made him very
exact, when I paſt that way. He cauſed all Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to be ſtopt without Exception, thoſe that were
on Foot were ſearched at the Gate by the Guards,
and thoſe on Horſe-back that had any appearance,
were conducted into the Abby, where the Abbot
entertained them very Civilly, and made them Eat
with him, whilſt they were ſearching their Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantels.
The Abbot with whom I diſcourſed after
Dinner for a good while, told me that the Pope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him Mony towards the Entertainment of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
becauſe without that the whole Revenue
of his Abby would not have been ſufficient for it:
And that he had ſent him moſt preſſing Letters to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to him, an extraordinary care of that Poſt,
whence he eaſily conceived how much they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the Books of Proteſtants at <hi>Rome.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf well acquainted with the temper of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
he told me, that if the <hi>Italians,</hi> and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Popes Subjects, might but have the
leaſt Communication with <hi>Geneva,</hi> it might be
greatly feared, they would utterly caſt off their
Obedience to the Pope. Indeed there are none have
more reaſon to know the weakneſs of that God on
Earth, of the ſacred Colledge of Cardinals, and of
other Eccleſiaſticks, than they who are the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes
of it; neither are there any more concern'd,
than they, to caſt off a Yoke, which upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
is ſo inſupportable to them. One can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call to mind the flouriſhing condition of thoſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57009:51"/>
fair Provinces, that conſtitute the Patrimony of S.
<hi>Peter,</hi> without ſhedding of Tears, to ſee them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
Groaning and Languiſhing at preſent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the oppreſſive Domineering of Prieſts, wholly
waſte and deſolate and deprived of their former
Beauty and Ornament. Thoſe famous and ancient
Cities of <hi>Ravenna, Benevento, Spoleto, Peruſa,
Orvietta,</hi> and ſo many more, which heretofore were
the glory of <hi>Italy,</hi> are hardly any thing elſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
but heaps of Rubbiſh, occaſioned by the inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
avarice and rapaciouſneſs of Popes. True it is,
that naturally this Country is the moſt pleaſant and
Fruitful Territory in the World; but withal there
is none more bare of Mony. The immenſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
the Pope lays on it, have exhauſted a great
part of it; and the Legates he ſends thither every
three Years, ſtrive by all manner of Extortions,
during their Triennial Government to ſqueeze out
the reſt, and then return to <hi>Rome</hi> loaden with the
Spoils of that miſerable People, where they are no
ſooner arrived, but they conſume it with as much
Prodigality, as they had hookt it in by Avarice and
Extortion. I will not here entertain you with the
Grandeur and Luxury of the Roman Court; I may
have an occaſion to give you ſome account of that,
more at large hereafter. I ſhall only deſire you to
tell me, whether indeed you do not believe that the
<hi>Italions</hi> have great reaſon, to endeavour to deliver
themſelves from ſo oppreſſive an Uſurpation and
Tyranny, by withdrawing at the ſame time their
Conſciences, from ſo intolerable a Slavery, and their
Eſtates, from the Hands of ſuch mercileſs Extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57009:51"/>
For my part, Sir, I cannot queſtion, but
that if the Learned Writings of the Proteſtants of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> could one day make their
way into this Country, and that they would only
ſo far honour them, as to give them the Reading,
I ſay, I doubt not, but that Popery, whoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
they ſo evidently overturn, would find it
ſelf at an end. Or rather let us ſay, that it ſhall
be thus, when it ſhall pleaſe our great God the
Father of Lights, to enlighten their Minds, towards
an acknowledgment of their Blindneſs, and to warm
their Hearts by his Holy Grace to embrace the
Truth; that then, I ſay, we ſhall ſee all <hi>Italy</hi> turn'd
Proteſtants againſt their own Errors, and compoſing
one Sheepfold with thoſe who ſo many years ago,
ſo courageouſly proteſted againſt them, under the
one and only Sheepherd of our Souls the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. I ſhall not trouble you, Sir, with the
Relation of other particulars and Curioſities, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
at <hi>Genoua;</hi> foraſmuch as my deſign is not,
as I have hinted to you before, to give you an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Relation of my Travels, but only to ſingle out
thoſe Matters, that more particularly have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Religion. This is that I intend to do
from time to time in theſe my Letters, if I find you
continuing to give them the ſame reception, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you have favoured my firſt. It being my great

               <head>The Third LETTER,
Of the Hoſpitals and Pilgrims of
Italy, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>TO continue the Account I have undertaken to
give you, of the Obſervations I made in my
Voyage of <hi>Italy,</hi> relating to Matters of Religion;
I ſhall tell you, Sir, That from <hi>Genoua</hi> we took our
way along the Sea-Coaſt, and in Three days arrived
at <hi>Sestre,</hi> an Epiſcopal See, ſituate on the Sea of
<hi>Liguria.</hi> The Biſhop of the place received us with
a great deal of Civility. We had waved going by
Sea to <hi>Legorne,</hi> becauſe the Father, my Companion,
could not bear that kind of paſſage, and was beſides
very fearful of falling into the hands of Pirates.
None can be imagin'd more Stoical in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of Death than the Monks are, neither are any
more Cowardly and Frightful than they, when they
are in any likelyhood of facing it. This made us
reſolve to paſs the <hi>Apennine</hi> to <hi>Luca,</hi> and from
thence continue our Journy through <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> The
Biſhop adviſed us, to take Guides along with us in
paſſing the Mountain, foraſmuch as otherwiſe, he
aſſur'd us, we ſhould run great hazard of being
Robb'd; that we had a Three days Journy to paſs
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57009:52"/>
through very Deſert and Solitary Ways, where we
ſhould meet with neither Houſes nor Villages, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
only two or three ſorry Inns, at Twelve
Leagues diſtance from each other. There are always
plenty of theſe Guides at <hi>Seſtre,</hi> in a readineſs to
accompany Travellers; being provided with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,
Blunderbuſſes, Piſtols, and Bayonets. The
Cuſtom is to take Two or Three of them, or as
many as one pleaſeth, to paſs the Mountain, paying
them Two Crowns apiece. Two <hi>Genoua</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
intending the ſame Way, joyn'd Company
with us, which made us only take Two Guides with
us, at the Charge of Four Crowns. Our <hi>Benedictin,</hi>
whom one would have thought a former Journy
he had made to <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhould have made more
circumſpect, had a mind to make uſe of his Wits,
and to ſpare the Crown he was to pay for his ſhare
to the Guides we had taken; ſaying, That he would
ſpare that Mony, to make much of himſelf at the
next Inn he ſhould come at; that there was no
danger at all in paſſing the Mountain, and that all
thoſe Guides were a Company of Knaves, who
made it their buſineſs to fright Paſſengers, to get a
piece of Mony out of them; but, that he (for his
part) was reſolved they ſhould have none of his.
Thus having taken Directions of the Way in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
he went his way Two hours before us. For
my part, I remembred the Counſel the Biſhop had
given us, who was a Venerable Old Man; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd,
that if it were only for the reſpect that is due
to Old Age, we ought never (where it may be done)
reject the Advice of ſuch perſons. For this Reaſon,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57009:53"/>
I joyn'd my ſelf with the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> Merchants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to go with them, attended by our Guides.
The <hi>Benedictin</hi> parted from us at Six of the Clock,
tho' with an intent not to make ſo much haſte, but
that we might overtake him, that ſo he might have
an opportunity of falling again (as it were by chance)
into our Company, without being obliged to pay
any thing towards the Guides, we had taken on our
own accounts. But ſo it hapned, that very unluckily
for him, we ſtaid Three hours longer than was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
for we did not leave the City till Eleven of
the Clock. We were extreamly ſurprized, when at the
end of Seven Leagues, upon the Mountain, we
found this poor Monk ſitting on a Stone, in his
Boots, Lamenting and all in Tears, for the Miſhap
that had befallen him. He had been ſet upon in the
ſame place by Five Robbers, who having diſmounted
him, had taken away all his Mony, and all they
found in his Portmantel, except his <hi>Breviary,</hi> which
they had reſtor'd to him; which ſeem'd to vex him
more than all the reſt: <hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>had they but
taken this with the rest, I ſhould at leaſt have been
excuſed from ſaying my Breviary till I came to
Rome.</hi> We made a ſhift to get him on Horsback
again, perſwading one of the Guides to lend him
his; in conſideration of which, the Monk promis'd
to give him his Boots, and we defrayed his Charges
between us, till we came to <hi>Luca.</hi> He aſſured us,
That the Men that had Robbed him, were Armed and
Cloathed in the ſame manner as the Guides; and
that if he were not extreamly miſtaken, he had ſeen
the very ſame perſons in the Market-place of <hi>Seſtre.</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:57009:53"/>
We were told ſince, That theſe Robbers are the very
Guides themſelves, who accompanying Travellers
out of Town, do afterwards by a ſhorter Way get
before them, placing themſelves in Ambuſh near the
Road by which they are ſure they muſt paſs, and
never fail of Robbing thoſe, who have refus'd to
make uſe of them, or any of their Companions.
By ill-luck for our Father <hi>Benedictin,</hi> he had but
lately receiv'd a Letter of Exchange at <hi>Turin,</hi> and
was not to receive another till he came to <hi>Rome.</hi>
This forced us to part Company, becauſe I was not
in a condition to bear his Expence, and my own
too. He reſolved therefore to take his Journy the
beſt way he could to <hi>Rome,</hi> through the Monaſteries
of all ſorts of Orders and Hoſpitals alſo, Neceſſity
forcing him thereto. I ſaw him afterwards at <hi>Rome,</hi>
where I found him not wholly recovered yet from
the Miſeries he had ſuffered ſince our parting. He
gave me a particular and full account of the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
at which he called in his Journy, what they
were, and the Entertainment he had met with in
them. I have heard <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully
object to <hi>Protestants,</hi> That they have
no Hoſpitals amongſt them, to entertain Strangers;
and confounding this kind of puplick Hoſpitality
with Charity, boldly conclude, That they are not
Charitable, and conſequently no true Children of
the Church. 'Tis the mark of a Weak Cauſe, to
lay hold of every thing it meets with to ſupport it
ſelf, which notwithſtanding commonly contributes
moſt to its overthrow. To defeat this pretended
Charity of Catholicks, it will be ſufficient to relate
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57009:54"/>
to you what this Father told me, and what I have
learnt of ſome other Travellers, which I intend in
part to make the Subject of this my Third LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER.</p>
               <p>I ſhall tell you firſt of all in general, Sir, That
all the Ancient Hoſpitals of <hi>Italy</hi> owe their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to the Holy places of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Loretto.</hi>
The Pilgrimages to theſe ſome Ages ago, by reaſon
of a more Univerſal Deluge of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> were
much more in Vogue than they are at preſent; tho'
it were to be wiſhed, they were much leſs than they
are. A Man was ſcarcely reputed a good Chriſtian,
except he had been at <hi>Rome:</hi> And the Popes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
how much this vaſt Concourſe did augment
their Revenues, and rendred their Capital City rich
and wealthy, found a way to oblige Confeſſors to
enjoyn their Penitents, for the Expiation of the
greateſt Sins, ſuch as <hi>Rape, Incest,</hi> and <hi>Murther,</hi> a
Journy thither; ſo that there was no Remiſſion for
theſe kind of Sins, without going to <hi>Rome.</hi> They after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made reſerv'd Caſes of moſt of theſe kind of
Sins, whereof we find ſtill at this day a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in the <hi>Bull,</hi> Entituled, <hi>In Coena Domini,</hi> reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to themſelves alone the power of Abſolving
them; ſo that in theſe Caſes, the parties concern'd
muſt either go to <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe reſolve never to
enter into Paradice. It is true, that at preſent they
have bethought themſelves of a way to ſpare men
this Trouble, which is, of ſending thither a good
Sum of Mony: With this they content themſelves
now; for I am ſure, it is not the Perſon they deſire,
but his Purſe, which at any time will abundantly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57009:54"/>
ſupply his Abſence. And foraſmuch as amongſt the
great number of Pilgrims, that flock'd thither out
of Devotion, or of Neceſſity, for the expiation of
their Sins, there were many Poor people, that had
not wherewith to defray their Charges in publick
Inns; many Rich perſons, moved with Compaſſion
towards theſe poor Wretches, Founded Hoſpitals
for their Entertainment, where they received both
Lodging and Diet; or at whatſoever Hour of the
Day they call'd there, had an Alms given them,
which they call <hi>La Paſſade;</hi> according as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
was more or leſs Endowed ſuch was the
Alms, in ſome places more, in others leſs. We met
with many Hoſpitals in <hi>Italy,</hi> that were founded
towards the end of the 10<hi>th,</hi> or the beginning of
the 11<hi>th Century;</hi> the cauſe of which was a Falſe
Opinion, that was uppermoſt then, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
Day of Judgment was near, grounded upon a
Forged Tradition, which is preſerved ſtill to this
day in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> That Chriſt being
asked by his Apoſtles, How long this outward
World ſhould laſt? He Anſwer'd them, A Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years and upward. So that the moſt part of
Chriſtian Princes, and great Lords about this Time
took a Journy to <hi>Rome,</hi> Founded Hoſpitals for the
Poor and Pilgrims, and ſeveral Abbies, into which
many of them retired themſelves, in expectation of
the dreadful Day of Judgment. As for the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
they Founded, the Care and Adminiſtration
of them was committed to Prieſts, as being the Men
who think themſelves concern'd in all Pious Legacies,
and who very readily take upon them the Care of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57009:55"/>
thoſe places, where they find a plentiful Current
of Devotional-Mony. It was too much their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
not to encourage ſo favourable Beginnings,
and therefore were not wanting, no more than at
this day, conſtantly to frequent the Houſes of
Widows and Rich perſons, to induce them by their
Laſt-Wills to enlarge the Revenues of their Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
of which they were conſtituted the Stewards
and Overſeers; Inſomuch, that in a little Time
theſe Hoſpitals became prodigiouſly Rich. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
now only, that we take a view of the Uſe
which is made of them at preſent, that thence we
may judge, whether from them a good Argument
can be drawn in favour of thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Communion; to prove, that their Charity ſo far
exceeds that of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> as they would fain
make People believe; or, whether indeed we have
not much more Reaſon to infer the contrary? Our
<hi>Benedictin,</hi> by ſad Experience, was in a condition
of giving me ſome Information concerning this
matter: He told me, That after he had parted with
me at <hi>Luca,</hi> which is a ſmall Republick, he took his
Journy on Foot by <hi>Alto Paſſo,</hi> which is a very
ancient and famous Hoſpital, founded by a Queen
of <hi>France,</hi> Eight Miles diſtant from <hi>Luca.</hi> He
could not exactly tell me what were the Revenues
of that Hoſpital; but that this was the Law of it,
That all Strangers, of what Rank or Quality ſoever,
Rich or Poor, were to be receiv'd and entertain'd
there Three days together, according to their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
But that at preſent it admits none beſides the
Prieſts and Monks that paſs that Way, and to other
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57009:55"/>
Travellers they only give a Loaf of Half a pound
weight, and a Pint of Wine at the Gate; and
before they can be admitted to this Favour, they
muſt produce ſeveral Paſſports and Letters, to prove
themſelves Pilgrims, for want of which our Father
was in a great danger of being ſhut out and rejected;
but inſtead thereof he boldly produc'd his Letter of
Obedience. The good Prieſt who examin'd them,
ſeeing that the Letter was writ in Latin, in which
probably he was not over skilful, according to the
Cuſtom of the Prieſts of <hi>Italy,</hi> let it paſs; ſaying,
That he perceived that it was a Travelling-Letter of
the Apoſtolical <hi>Nuncio</hi> at <hi>Turin;</hi> ſo that by this
ſhift he was at laſt admitted. He told me, That his
Entertainment there was very tolerable, and that
upon his Enquiry into the manner of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Hoſpital, an Old Servant of the Houſe
told him, There were Twenty five Officers that
were Intendants over it, ſome of them with the Titles
of <hi>Guardians, Adminiſtrators,</hi> and <hi>Receivers;</hi> and
others with the Names of the Firſt, Second, and
Third Officers of the Pantry and Butlery, which
were all R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h Clergy-men, who divided amongſt
themſelves almoſt all the Revenues of that Hoſpital,
there being but a very inconſiderable part of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
for thoſe few Charitable Deeds, that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
there. From thence he came to <hi>Peſche,</hi> which
is a very fine City, a ſmall days Jonrny from thence,
where there is a vaſt Number of Convents and
Monaſteries. He went and preſented himſelf to
ſeveral of them, to procure himſelf a Lodging;
but every where they ſhut the Door upon him;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57009:56"/>
for the <hi>Italian</hi> Monks are very pityleſs, and never
give any Alms to Strangers. They have an Artifice
amongſt them they make uſe of to refuſe poor
Paſſengers, which is this, All the Monks and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have order to tell them, That they Abbot,
Guardian, or Prior is not in the Monaſtery; and if
you happen by chance to meet with the Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they tell you, That the Steward, Butler, or
ſome other Officer that has the Purſe, is gone abroad.
By this means they make the poor Travellers loſe
all Patience, forcing them to depart without the
leaſt Relief. Our Monk being thus refuſed Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
every where, was fain to ſeek out an Hoſpital,
which he found very different from that of <hi>Alto
Paſſo;</hi> for the bad Entertainment he there met with,
tho' it was with much more difficulty that he was
admitted, becauſe his Letter mention'd, That he
was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> about Buſineſs, and not upon the
account of Devotion. For tho', for the moſt part,
they underſtand but little Latin; yet they are ſo
wiſe as to put Travellers upon ſhewing them theſe
two Words in their Letters, <hi>Ex Devotione.</hi> Two
Hermits of Thoſe <hi>Italian</hi> Vagabonds, who ſpent their
Life in running from one Hoſpital to another, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
perceived that our Monk had been ſomewhat
Rudely uſed by reaſon of his Letter, came to him
after Supper, offering to remedy the matter, and to
ſupply the defect of his Letter, ſo that he ſhould
never run the hazard of expoſing himſelf to the like
Affront for time to come. The way was this, They
promis'd to draw up for him a Letter of <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi>
and to affix to it the Seal of the Archbiſhop of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57009:56"/>
                  <hi>Lions,</hi> which they had Counterfeited. So that the
Queſtion now only was, about a piece of Mony they
demanded of our <hi>Benedictin</hi> for this ſeaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
who having none to give, offer'd them his
his <hi>Breviary.</hi> The one of them abſolutely refuſed
it, ſaying, That that was a bad Implement to carry
with one to Hoſpitals; that it was long ſince they
had been happily Robb'd of theirs, and by this
means were excus'd from a tedious repeating of them,
according to the Decree of the Sacred Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at <hi>Rome</hi> to that purpoſe; <hi>Amiſſo vel ablato
Breviario, non tenetur Presbyter Officio; A Priest
is not bound to the Duty of Saying his Breviary, in
caſe he hath loſt, or is robb'd of it.</hi> They added,
That not long ſince they had ſeen a Prieſt expell'd
an Hoſpital, becauſe having a <hi>Breviary</hi> about him,
he had forgot or neglected to ſay the Office before
Supper. But his Companion accepted of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
ſaying, He would make it his Buſineſs to rid
himſelf of it, the firſt Bookſeller's Shop he came at.
Thus the <hi>Benedictin</hi> at the ſame time procur'd two
Advantages, the one of being rid of the trouble of
Saying his Prayers; the other, of having got a ſure
Key to give him Entrance into all Hoſpitals, and
this by means of a Counterfeit Letter of <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;</hi>
which theſe two Hermits were ready (for
their Mony) to give to any that did deſire it. The
Father being thus provided, boldly proſecuted his
Journy through all the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> till he came
to <hi>Rome,</hi> having been every where received into
the Hoſpitals without any difficulty. But he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
to me, That if it were in his power to inflict
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57009:57"/>
a ſevere Puniſhment upon all the Guardians and
Adminiſtrators of them, he thought that in ſo doing
he ſhould render a moſt acceptable Service to God,
as well as to all poor Pilgrims: Becauſe (ſaid he) it is
a moſt lamentable thing to ſee how they treat them;
what they give them to eat does not amount to
Two-pence Charges for each perſon; and this too;
in ſuch a naſty and ſlovenly manner, that it turns
ones Stomach; whilſt in the mean time, thoſe
Wretched Prieſts engroſs and ſweep all the Mony
into their own Coffers, to maintain their Coach and
Horſes, with the Magnificent Titles they take to
themſelves of <hi>High Almoners, Grand Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
and <hi>Grand Priors</hi> of the Hoſpital. 'Tis an
infamous thing to ſee how they Lodge poor Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
There are about Twenty or Thirty Beds in a
great Room, where they lye Two and Two, or
Three and Three in a Bed, according as they are
ſtock'd with Company. Before they are ſuffer'd to
enter into this Room, they are ſtript ſtark Naked
in another, without ſuffering them ſo much as to
keep on their Shifts: This done, they are all of
them ſhut up together till next Morning. The
Beds are all rotten and ſpoil'd, and crawling with
Vermin, and moſt of them without any Sheets.
The Hoſpitals indeed are well Endow'd; but it is
the malicious Contrivance of thoſe who have the
Care and Adminiſtration of them, to give their
Viſitants the worſt Entertainment they can deviſe,
to turn their Stomachs from ever coming there
again; and indeed, a man muſt be reduc'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Neceſſity before he can reſolve on a Second
Viſit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:57009:57"/>
The <hi>Benedictin</hi> gave me a more particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of an Hoſpital, which is in the Hands of the
<hi>Dominicans</hi> of <hi>Viterbo:</hi> Theſe Fathers employ'd
their utmoſt Endeavours with the Magiſtrates of the
City, to procure the Direction of it, promiſing,
That they would make it their buſineſs, to take a
particular Care for <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> by faithfully employing
the Revenues thereof for their Uſe and Relief;
whereupon at laſt their Requeſt was granted them.
But ſince this, foraſmuch as they never had the leaſt
thought of performing their Promiſe; but to make
uſe of it for their own advantage, they have taken
up all the beſt part of the Building for themſelves,
and Lodge the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> that Viſit them in one of the
Cellars that belong to the Houſe. Our <hi>Benedictin</hi>
arriving here, met with a Company of Seven or
Eight <hi>Pilgrims</hi> beſides himſelf, who were all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lock'd up in that Cellar, without giving them
either Meat or Drink, or Beds to lye upon; and
left them thus ſhut up till Ten of the Clock the
next Morning, at which time the Door was opened
for them. The Fathers <hi>Dominicans</hi> ſeeing them in
great confuſion coming forth from their miſerable
Lodging, Scoffed at them, asking them, Whether
they had lin'd their Inſides well, and been Lodged
at their Eaſe? deſiring them at their Return from
<hi>Rome,</hi> to call that Way, for that all things ſhould
be in a readineſs to give them a very goodly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.
All the World knows, That there is
nothing of more dangerous conſequence in <hi>Italy,</hi>
than to offend a <hi>Dominican;</hi> becauſe, having the
<hi>Inquiſition</hi> in their Hands, they commonly make
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57009:58"/>
excellent uſe of it, to avenge the leaſt Affront is
offer'd them: Wherefore theſe poor Wretches were
fain to ſlink away in ſilence, without as much as
daring to reply one Word, to this their Villainous
Scoffing at them, after having treated them ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly.
The famous and rich Hoſpital of <hi>Loretto,</hi>
to which vaſt and imme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe Donations have been
given in favour of <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> is for all that but little
better ſerved, than that we have juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe I ſhall relate to you a Paſſage,
whereof my ſelf was Witneſs when I was at <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto.</hi>
I was walking in the Great place which is
between the Church and that Hoſpital, with two
<hi>French</hi> Prieſts, who had Lodged there the Night
before. The Guardians it ſeems are obliged to
Ring a Bell, to gather the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> together before
Supper, that none of them may be abſent: But
theſe Wretches, that have no more Religion in them
than Dogs, and whoſe only deſire is, to defraud and
pinch the poor <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> had on purpoſe omitted
Ringing of the Bell, as they often do. The <hi>French</hi>
Prieſts about Six of the Clock retir'd to the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
where they demanded of them, Why they did
not come ſooner, and that Supper-time was paſt?
They Excus'd themſelves by alledging, that they had
not Rung the Bell for them: But they falſly and
impudently maintain'd, that the Bell had been rung;
ſo that it was not poſſible for them to obtain ſo
much as a piece of Bread for themſelves that Night.
The next Morning, theſe poor Prieſts were ſo
fearful of being ſerv'd the ſame Trick, (for in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57009:58"/>
that Hoſpital they are obliged to give their Viſitants
Supper and Lodging for Three Nights together)
that they continued from Three of the Clock in
the Afternoon, until Evening, under the Belfry.
The Guardians ſeeing, that it was impoſſible to
put them by their Suppers, called them ſoftly
(about Six of the Clock) to come into the Hall to
Supper; which they very honeſtly refuſed to do
till they had Rung the Bell, to give warning to
the reſt of the <hi>Pilgrims:</hi> The Guardians, tho' en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
at this, yet durſt not but do it; but avenged
themſelves another way, by giving them very bad
Wine. In other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> they make uſe of
other Devices in their Hoſpitals, to affright <hi>Pilgrims</hi>
from coming at them. At <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Turin,</hi> they
oblige them (all Wearied as they are) to go in
Proceſſion throughout the whole City, in the ſight
of all Men, and to ſing Long Litanies; which
makes perſons that have the leaſt ſpark of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
or thoſe who are naturally more ſhamefac'd
than others, rather expoſe themſelves to lie in the
Streets, yea, or periſh for Hunger, than to Viſit
ſuch kind of Hoſpitals, where they muſt ſubject
themſelves to ſuch odious Laws. Others make it
their buſineſs to ſpoil and deface all the Paſsports of
Strangers with great ugly black Marks they make
upon them, as a ſign they have been entertain'd in
ſuch and ſuch Hoſpitals: Now perſons that are any
thing careful of preſerving their Honour in their
own Country, and to keep their Paſsports neat and
clean, will take care how they preſent themſelves
to ſuch places as thoſe, whoſe Charity is ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57009:59"/>
and ignominiouſly adminiſtred. In the mean
time, by theſe ſcandalous Fetches, they make a ſhift
to reduce their Gueſts to a very ſmall Number;
for the fewer Viſitants they have in a Year, the
greater is their Dividend at the Years end. Others
have the Impudence, to make them gain that by
their own Labour, which was deſtinated for them
out of Charity: And indeed, generally every where,
if they be not there preciſely at the Set-time, which
ordinarily is an hour before Night, they are irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably
ſhut out of the Hoſpital; and it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
either by Prayers or Tears, to procure any
Entrance. Others again treat their Gueſts very
rudely in their Diſcourſe, and with the greateſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
and Contempt imaginable. In a word, Charity
is every where adminiſtred in ſo Uncharitable and
Misbecoming a manner, that if the Benefactors of
thoſe Hoſpitals could once return to Life, and have
the poſſeſſion of their Goods they formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd
to theſe places; I do perſwade my ſelf,
that ſeeing the horrid Abuſes that are there practis'd,
they would take heed of Undertaking the like
Foundations for time to come.</p>
               <p>The Father told me, That he had been in no
place better Treated, than at a New Hoſpital that
was a Building at <hi>Mountefiaſcone,</hi> Three days Journy
from <hi>Rome.</hi> It was about Five or Six years ago,
that the Prieſts of that place had been perſwading
the Nobility and Citizens of that ſmall City, to
contribute to this Foundation. They had already
procur'd a conſiderable Revenue, by the pious Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of ſome Ladies of Quality, and ſome Annual
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57009:59"/>
Rents the City had granted towards it. The <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictin</hi>
ſeeing the good Entertainment they had
given him, ſaid Smilingly to the Prieſts, who had
the Direction of the Houſe, That he was very well
ſatisfied with the good Entertainment he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that he prayed God to preſerve in them this
Spirit of Charity for the Poor; and that he hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſhed for the good of their Souls, that they
might not one day become like others, by ſhearing
the Revenues of the Hoſpital amongſt themſelves,
and neglecting, and abuſing the Members of Jeſus
Chriſt, as they do. Many Pilgrims have aſſured
me, that it is the greateſt miſery in the World, to
take up ones Lodging in any of the old Hoſpitals,
notwithſtanding that they are the moſt Richly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed;
and that in the new Hoſpitals, they
were well enough entertained, becauſe the Prieſts
had not yet divided the Revenue amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
They do like the Gardiners, who ſuffer
the Fruit to hang on the Tree, till it be come to its
full growth and maturity, and then gather it, and
make their profit of it: or like Merchants that Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
in company, who do not divide the Purſe till
it be full. All theſe external practices and ſhews of
Piety and Devotion, viſibly terminating in ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
make it evident beyond diſpute, that they
proceeded from no other Principles than Avarice and
Hypocriſie. You may probably object to me here,
Sir, that the <hi>Italians,</hi> whom I have elſewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to you as men of Wit and Underſtanding,
muſt needs be very ſimple in ſuffering themſelves to
be perſuaded, to beſtow their Goods upon ſuch
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57009:60"/>
Foundations as theſe, conſidering the great abuſe of
them. To this, Sir, I ſhall anſwer, that the Prieſts
in all Countries, have a very powerful Aſcendent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Spirits of the People, and that this joyn'd
with the Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
is, that the Prayers of Pilgrims are of a particular
efficacy with God to deliver Souls out of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and with the practice obſerved in theſe Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
of obliging the Pilgrims at night to make long
Prayers for the Souls of their deceaſed Benefactors,
and cauſing Maſs to be ſaid for them in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
belonging to the ſaid Hoſpitals, is a powerful
motive, conſidering the falſe belief wherein they are
engaged, to perſuade them to it. Moreover theſe
Prieſts are very Dexterous in divulging every where,
that they are very faithful in the Adminiſtration of
their Alms, that they are very careful in giving
good Entertainment to their Pilgrims, even ſo far
as to contribute of their own Mony, to defray the
charges they are at for Proviſions. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
enough that by a mental reſtriction, they muſt
underſtand this of Proviſions for themſelves, tho'
before God they cannot by this means excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from lying. There were formerly many
more Hoſpitals in <hi>Italy</hi> than there be at preſent,
every Monaſtery had its Hoſpital. S. <hi>Odon</hi> Abbot of
<hi>Clugny,</hi> ſeeing that theſe Hoſpitals were all in
vogue, and that it was a kind of Devotion that
made a great noiſe in the World, would not in
this point come behind any Seculars. He divided
the vaſt Revenues of his Abby into three parts;
The firſt, was for the Abbot and the Entertainment
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57009:60"/>
of Strangers of note, that came to the Monaſtery;
The ſecond, for the Maintenance of the Monks,
which was called the Conventual portion; and the
third part for the relief of the Poor, and the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of Pilgrims, whoſe Feet the Abbot himſelf,
as an effect of his Humility, was pleaſed to waſh.
Almoſt all the Abbots of <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
follow'd this Example; and in like manner made
a Tripartition of the Revenues of their Abbies.
But this their abundant Chairty, was not of any
long continuance; for ſoon after, that which had
been given with one Hand, was taken away with
the other. The ſhare of the Poor was loſt, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confounded, with thoſe of the Abbot and the
Monks: At preſent there are no more of theſe Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
to be found in <hi>Italy,</hi> excepting one, at <hi>Mont-Caſſin,</hi>
and another at the Great <hi>Camaldule,</hi>
where they entertain Pilgrims. The <hi>Chartreux</hi>
Monks have alſo another in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi>
at their Monaſtery of <hi>Pavia.</hi> But it is not to their
Charity Strangers are beholden for this Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
but to that of <hi>Galeacius</hi> Viſcount, Duke of
<hi>Milan,</hi> their Founder, who would have this Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
which he had endowed with a vaſt Revenue,
to be a place of publick reception and Entertainment
for all, whether Rich or Poor. The Fathers of this
Foundation have ſince done their utmoſt endeavour,
to rid themſelves of this Hoſpitality, under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pretext, that it was a great diſturbance to their
Solitude. But the Lords and great Men of that
Dutchy, who by the Charter of that Foundation,
are to be Splendidly entertained there with all their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57009:61"/>
Train and Equipage, as often as they paſs that way,
found themſelves too much intereſſed in this their
Petition, and therefore have always oppoſed it with
all the Vigor imaginable; ſo that they are ſtill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to continue the ſame, tho' ſore againſt their
Wills. Tis a thing but too well<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> known in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and Avowed by all, that their Clergy are extreamly
wanting in this great Duty, and diſtinguiſhing
Chriſtian Badge of Charity. Tis an Obſervation
I have made my ſelf, that the Poor, who are over
and above perſwaded of this Truth, by their own
experience, do ſeldom, or never beg any Alms of
them. As for the Regular Clergy, the <hi>Benedictin</hi>
told me, that from the time of our parting, he had
preſented himſelf to all the Monaſteries of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he met with, to obtain a Lodging with them,
but that ſcarce ever they had been willing to receive
him: the Common anſwer he had from them was,
that there was an Hoſpital in the City, to which he
had beſt addreſs himſelf for Entertainment; and
that when he came thither, they abſolutely refuſed
him entrance, telling him there was a Monaſtery of
his Order in the City, and that it was more proper
for him to ſeek a Lodging there. Thus this poor
Monk, ſeeing himſelf ſometimes rejected on all
ſides, lamented his ſad Condition, occaſioned by the
ſcandalous uncharitableneſs of the Clergy, and his
own Brethren of the ſame Order. He added, that
if it were in his power, he would aboliſh all theſe
Hoſpitals, as well as all Pilgrimaging: For, ſaid he,
as theſe Hoſpitals are moſt Scandalouſly Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred;
ſo neither can any thing be imagined more
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57009:61"/>
Abominable, than the perſons that take up their
Lodging in them; amongſt a ſcore of them, 'tis
hard to find one, that is come from his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
with a deſign to viſit the Holy places; being
for the moſt part of them a company of Vagabonds,
who make it their buſineſs, every year to go the
round of <hi>Italy.</hi> They commonly paſs the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
in the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and then begin their Journy in
<hi>Autumn,</hi> ſpend their Winter at <hi>Rome, Naples,</hi> or
in <hi>Calabria;</hi> and in the Spring begin their round a
new, in order to return to their Summer Quarters in
the Mountains. The way they take to Live is
this, They beg in the day-time, go from one
Farm to another, leap Hedges, Rob Orchards,
and ſteal Fowl they meet with on the High-way,
or in the back Courts of Country Houſes, or
whatever elſe they meet with. After this good
days work they retire towards the Evening, to ſome
Neighbouring Village, where they know there is
an Hoſpital. Many of them Travel up and down
thus with their whole Families, trailing their Wives
and Children along with them. Theſe generally
profeſs themſelves to be new Converts; that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they were either Jews or Proteſtants; but
having abjured their Errors, they have thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
themſelves into ſo miſerable a Condition, for
the Love of Jeſus Chriſt. To this purpoſe they
ſhew you very fair and plauſible Letters of <hi>Credence,</hi>
with fair great Seals annexed to them. I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diverted my ſelf with queſtioning this kind of
People, about the Principles of Judaiſm, or the
Faith of Proteſtants; but they were never able to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57009:62"/>
anſwer any thing to the purpoſe. Perceiving this,
I came nearer to them, and demanded of them,
how they came by theſe fair Commendatory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
whereupon ſome of them freely owned to
me, that they had bought them for their Mony, of
an Abbot living at <hi>Turin,</hi> who made a Trade and
Livelyhood of it. That to this purpoſe he was
furniſhed with all manner of Seals, and could Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
all Writing Hands. And as for themſelves,
they ingenuouſly confeſſed they had never been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jews or Proteſtants, but that they made uſe of
this Artifice to induce People to a greater degree of
Charity towards them: Beſides theſe we find many
other ſorts of Hoſpital Haunters, that are never a
jot better than thoſe, I have now mentioned: ſome
of theſe drag great Chains after them, and Iron
Manacles, declaring themſelves to have been Slaves
in <hi>Turky,</hi> from whence they were Miraculouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
by ſome Vows they made to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to
our Lady of <hi>Loretto:</hi> But if any one take them to
task about thoſe remote Countries, they can anſwer
nothing that is Pertinent; and beſides it is Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that they buy their Chains of the Black-ſmiths,
which many <hi>Italians</hi> have aſſured me, to have been
Eye-witneſſes of. Moreover they are a ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſo diſſolute in their Manners, and ſo Debauched,
that were it true indeed, that the Bleſſe Virgin had
wrought a Miracle to deliver them from their Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
ſhe ought by another to return them thither
again. Another ſort of Pilgrims well known in theſe
Hoſpitals, are a kind of Hermits, of the Nature of
thoſe two I mentioned before, who ſpend their time
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57009:62"/>
in Trouling from one place of Devotion to another,
from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Loretto,</hi> and from <hi>Loretto</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi>
leading a moſt ſcandalous Life. Theſe are the men,
who without any Permiſſion obtained from their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
to lead an Hermetick Life, have taken up the
Habit of themſelves. I remember that at <hi>Lions,</hi>
the Vicar General cauſed one of theſe Hermits to
be ſeized, who in Priſon confeſſed, that he himſelf
had given the Habit to Seventeen Vagabond Rgues
like himſelf, for three Crowns a piece, in conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of which he had alſo furniſhed them with
Cloth cut out, and ſowed their Gowns and Cowls
himſelf, and given them counterfeit Letters to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
throughout <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Now it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
that the Guardians of Hoſpitals do commonly
give a better reception to thoſe ſort of Cattle, than
to Paſſengers and Pilgrims, becauſe they know their
Company is very apt to turn other Peoples Stomacks
from coming at them. Theſe are the ſeveral ſorts,
and diviſions of Hoſpital-Mongers, which Houſes
being beſides ordered after the manner I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
you, judge, I pray you, Sir, Whether the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has reaſon to be ſo Huffy and
Proud of her Pilgrims and Hoſpitals, or to Reproach
the Proteſtants for wanting ſuch goodly Ornaments,
and Teſtimonies of their Charity? For my part, I
am firm in the Opinion, that the Proteſtants Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
in this point is by far the better: They have
very wiſely Retrenched theſe ſorts of Pilgrimages,
being convinced that it is much better for a man to
ſhut himſelf up in his Cloſet, there to pray in ſecret
to his Heavenly Father, than to Run up and down
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57009:63"/>
to pray to God, and the Saints in Publick places, as
the Romaniſts do. They know that God has not
ty'd up Holineſs neither to time or place; and that
it is a great piece of folly to found places of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
for Vagabonds, which are for the moſt
part either lazy Droons, or wicked Villains, which
ought rather to be ſhut up in Houſes of Correction,
and made to work for their Living, than to leave
them at their Liberty, which they make ſuch ill
uſe of. As for what concerns Strangers and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
if they happen to fall into ſome neceſſity,
they are not wanting in Proteſtant Countries, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to aſſiſt them in their needs, eſpecially if they
be known to be honeſt People. And as for the Poor
and neceſſitous that dwell in Cities, the Pariſhes to
which they belong take notice of what their wants
are, and take care to ſupply them. This, Sir, as
far as I can judge, is a far better regulated Charity,
and conſequently alſo more pleaſing to God, and ſuch
as was practiſed in the Primitive times of the Church.
It may be, you'l tell me, Sir, that the Pilgrims of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not all of them ſuch pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Wretches as I have juſt now deſcrib'd, but that
there are a vaſt number of Perſons of Quality, of
different Ranks and Conditions, who Travel to
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Loretto</hi> upon the account of Devotion, in
imitation of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Pelagia</hi> and <hi>Euſtochium,</hi>
Noble Roman Ladies, who undertook a <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
Voyage, to viſit the Holy places there, according
to the Teſtimony of S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and that ſuch as
theſe are the Perſons whoſe Zeal your Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
boaſts it ſelf of. I will not deny, Sir, but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57009:63"/>
that indeed I have ſeen many Perſons of Quality
going in Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places of
Devotion that are moſt in Vogue in <hi>Italy,</hi> neither
would I altogether diſapprove of their deſign, could
I find that the objects to which they pay their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
were in any degree worthy of them, and
that they did it in a decent and edifying manner.
But ſincerely to tell you my Opinion; I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſee any thing in all <hi>Italy,</hi> that deſerv'd a mans
putting of himſelf to ſo great charges, except only
to ſee its fair Cities, and the Maſterpieces of Art
and Nature it contains: But in this caſe it is Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and not Devotion, that puts men upon under-taking
that Journy. Beſides, Sir, the manner of your
rich People going a Pilgrimaging is ſo Extravagant,
and ſo fraught with ſtaring Libertmiſm and Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs,
that in truth they had much better keep
at Home, and Honour God in their Families,
than to quit them, as they do, to ſatisfie their Luſts,
under a Cloak of Devotion, to the great ſcandal of
all good and ſober People. I queſtion not but you
will be of my mind, aſſoon as you ſhall have read the
account I intend to give you in my next LETTER,
wherein I ſhall Treat of my Journy to <hi>Loretto.</hi>
For the preſent, becauſe I have not quitted <hi>Luca,</hi>
where I parted with my <hi>Benedictin,</hi> who has given
me an occaſion to Write what I have done of Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals,
I ſhall only tell you, before I part with this
City, without giving you the Deſcription of it, that
being no part of my deſign, that as I was one day
coming forth from my Inn, I was extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
to hear the People in the Street Swearing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57009:64"/>
and Blaſpheming the Holy Name of Jeſus Chriſt.
There was a great throng of People gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
who look'd upon thoſe that did ſo, without
witneſſing the leaſt Horror, for hearing ſuch execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Blaſphemies. I demanded of them with ſome
Indignation, why they ſuffered them to talk at ſuch
a rate? They mildly anſwerd me, that I was miſtaken,
and that they did neither Swear nor Blaſpheme, but
that it was only a particular quarrel, about a piece
of Mony of the value of a Shilling or thereabouts,
which at <hi>Luca,</hi> they call a Jeſus Chriſt. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of this City cauſed this Mony to be Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in Honour of a Miraculous Crucifix, which is
kept in their Cathedral, which, they ſay, did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Weep, or Speak, or Bleed, theſe being the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Miracles of theſe Crucifixes. The Figure of
Jeſus Chriſt hanging on the Croſs, is Stamp'd upon
this Coyn, which therefore they call a Chriſt. By
which means when they are at play, or upon
Quarrels ariſing about payments, the adorable
Name of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,
is not only very frequently taken in Vain, but alſo
outrag'd and blaſphemed, as thoſe Wretches, whom
I have juſt now mentioned, did for one of theſe
pieces, which the one of them reſtor'd to the other
with theſe Horrid words, take there your R—of
a Chriſt. I have ſeen another ſort of Mony at
<hi>Bononia</hi> called a <hi>Madonnin,</hi> that is to ſay, an Our
Lady, or a Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which is of the
Value of Sixpence at <hi>Bononia,</hi> upon occaſion
of which the ſame inconveniences do proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
happen in the like Diſputes. Thus
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57009:64"/>
we ſee, that an imprudent Devotion ordinarily termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
in a great Impiety. The Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi>
having ſeen one of theſe pieces of Mony, ſaid Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to the Cardinal of <hi>Luca, That the</hi> Italians
<hi>would have done much better, to have ſtampt a
Coin, and beſtowed the Name of God upon it;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating,
That <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> were the God of
<hi>Italy,</hi> there being no People in the World that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
it with more Idolatry, and yet that are more
lazy and careleſs in the gaining of it. From <hi>Luca</hi>
I came to <hi>Piſa,</hi> an ancient City of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> ſituate
upon the River <hi>Arno.</hi> Amongſt other remarkable
things, here is to be ſeen a fair Church-yard, call'd
in Italian, <hi>Campo Santo;</hi> it is exceeding large, and
of a ſquare Figure. The Walls and Tombs of it
are all of <hi>Marble, Jaſper,</hi> and <hi>Porphyry,</hi> very arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
wrought. They of <hi>Piſa</hi> had fill'd this place
with the Earth, which in a great number of Veſſels
they brought from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in which the
Dead-Bodies are conſumed in 24 Hours. In a word,
they tell us, that this Holy-Earth is nothing but a
continual Miracle: But for my part, I find no more
of Miracle in the caſe, than there is in the Church-yard
of S. <hi>Innocents</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where Bodies are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
within the ſame compaſs of Time, without
any Miracle at all. In all their Churches they ſhew
us a prodigious number of Relicks of Saints and
Sainteſſes, as in all the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> the moſt of
which are extreamly Ridiculous. I will not ſtop at
preſent to give you a Catalogue of them, but will
paſs on to <hi>Florence,</hi> where I ſhall have occaſion to
entertain you with the <hi>Great Devotion,</hi> that is ſo
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57009:65"/>
much in Vogue and Credit at a Church called the
<hi>Annonciade,</hi> or <hi>Annunciation.</hi> The Original of the
<hi>Devotion</hi> take as follows: A Painter having been
employ'd to make a Picture of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> in
the poſture wherein the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tradition tells us
ſhe was, when the Angel. <hi>Gabriel</hi> was ſent to her,
to acquaint her with the Incarnation of the <hi>Word;</hi>
that is, in her Chamber on her Knees, reading the
Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> The Painter had finiſhed all
other parts of the Picture, except one, to wit, the
Virgins Face, which he had reſerved for his laſt
Task; but being at a loſs what Idea to follow, in
repreſenting to the Life ſo Excellent a Creature;
and deſpairing ever to find any thing in his Art of
ſufficient perfection to reach this height, he in this
trouble and diſcompoſure of Thoughts fell aſleep i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the Church, where he was at Work; and awaking
three or four Hours after, (O ſtrange Prodigy! and
well deſerving the Wonder of all men!) he found
the Thing that had ſo much perplexed him happily
finiſhed, and much better than ever he could hope
to have done it himſelf; whereupon he began to cry
out amain, <hi>A Miracle, a Miracle;</hi> highly averring,
that an Angel ſent from Heaven had done the work
whilſt he was aſleep. The Fryers of the Convent
where he Wrought, finding their Intereſt in the
thing, rang'd themſelves of his Side, ſo that in a
moment the <hi>Devotion</hi> took fire, and the Concourſe
of People to their Church was ſo great, and has
ever ſince continu'd with ſuch extraordinary Succeſs,
as hath made it at this day one of the Richeſt of all
<hi>Italy;</hi> and the Convent of Fryers, one of the beſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57009:65"/>
Endow'd. The Reflections I have made on this
Picture, is, That on many accounts all this might be
no more than a meer Cheat or Miſtake. For firſt
of all, Some unknown perſon, or rather Fryer of
skill in that Art, entring by Chance into the Chappel
where the Painter was at Work, and finding him
aſleep, might make uſe of that opportunity, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
finiſh'd the Work, retire himſelf before the
Painter awoke. Secondly, We may ſuppoſe, that
the Painter, to make himſelf talk'd of, and to gain
himſelf the credit and reputation of a Good Man,
might have invented this Lie himſelf. Or Laſtly,
We may conceive, that the Fryers of the Convent,
upon conſideration of a good piece of Mony, might
have induc'd him to have publiſh'd this Lie, to make
their Advantage of it. What I alledge here, that
might have been, is not done with this intent, as if
I had a mind by all manner of ways to diſgrace and
diſcredit this pretended Miracle, by ſuppoſing it a
piece of Forgery: I know it is the Character of a
diſingenuous and malicious Spirit, to put a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
upon a Matter, that admits a favourable
one, and verily, I would not for all the World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
my ſelf to that Reproach. But the Reaſon of
what I have ſaid concerning this Matter is, That I
am otherwiſe ſatisfied on good grounds, that the
Point in queſtion is a manifeſt and palpable Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
For firſt of all, If it were an Angel, as is
pretended, that had painted this Face of the
<hi>Virgin,</hi> as the Work of an Angel is far more
perfect than that of a Man, it will follow, That
this Picture, at leaſt as to the mixture and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57009:66"/>
laying on of the Colours, muſt have far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd
all the Pieces of <hi>Caratche, Guido, Rhin,</hi> or
any other of the moſt famous Painters of <hi>Italy;</hi>
and in the mean time we ſee the contrary, and that
it does not at all exceed the reſt of the Picture,
finiſhed by the Painter himſelf, which made a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
(who Ey'd it very well) to ſay, That the
Angel-Limner muſt have been but a Blockhead and
Bungler at his Art, to draw ſuch rude and incurious
Strokes. But beſides this, We have another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to convince the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> that this is a falſe
Suppoſition; which is, That this Portraiture of the
<hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> bears no reſemblance at all with
thoſe other Pictures of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have been drawn by the Hand of S. <hi>Luke</hi>
himſelf. The Face here is round, fair, and ruddy,
with lively and brisk Eyes, and a low ſmooth Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;
whereas that painted by S. <hi>Luke</hi> is long and
ſwarthy, <hi>Egyptian</hi> like, with an humble and modeſt
Look, and an high and prominent Forehead, and
which has nothing of that ſo charming Beauty of
the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> they ſo highly magnifie when
they ſpeak of her, being more proper to excite
Senſual Luſt, than any Sentiments of Devotion.
Wherefore we muſt conclude, That either this Angel
was miſtaken, or that S. <hi>Luke</hi> was a great <hi>Ignoramus</hi>
in the Art of <hi>Painting;</hi> which notwithſtanding they
tell us, he was skilful in, to perfection; for, without
doubt, the one or the other muſt have been fouly
miſtaken. To attribute this Miſtake to the Angel,
would be to derogate extreamly, and againſt all
Reaſon, from the tranſcendent Excellence of thoſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57009:66"/>
Bleſſed Spirits; and to accuſe S. <hi>Luke,</hi> would deſtroy
their own Tradition; which they ought not ſo far
to villfie and debaſe, as to make it give way to the
particular Teſtimony of a Silly Painter, who may
be a Liar, as well as ſo many others; I ſpeak of him
who drew this Picture of the <hi>Annunciation.</hi> Laſtly,
It might alſo as well be alledg'd, That the Devil,
for the encouragement and increaſe of <hi>Superſtition,</hi>
might have had a Finger in the Intrigue, as ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
to aſſert, That it was an Angel of Light;
tho' to ſpeak the Truth, this is not very Rational
neither, for the Devil is too cunning to have done
his Work ſo much at random, and would without
doubt rather have borrow'd his Idea from the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of <hi>Sancta Maria Magiore,</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> However
the Popes have declar'd it to be a Truth, they have
approv'd the Matter, and have iſſued their <hi>Bulls</hi> for
the Authorizing of it, and Thunder'd-out their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications
againſt thoſe who ſhould be ſo Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardy
to doubt of it, being the ſame that other Popes
have done in favour of the Picture of S. <hi>Luke.</hi>
This <hi>Devotion</hi> has procur'd vaſt Treaſures to the
Fathers of this Convent, called <hi>Serviti.</hi> The Great
Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> repair'd thither every Evening to
Say his Prayers, whilſt I was at <hi>Florence,</hi> and it is
the common Rendezvous of Strangers, that have a
mind to ſee this Court. He every day gave great
Alms to the Poor at the Door of the Church, who
all of them, (as I was told) were perſons very well
to Live, tho' (to induce people more to Compaſſion)
they keep themſelves cover'd with nothing but
Rags. They have taken ſuch firm poſſeſſion of this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57009:67"/>
Poſt, that they will not ſuffer any ſtrange Beggar
to mingle with them. By occaſion of mentioning
theſe Beggars, and that you may ſomewhat the
better apprehend the powerful Virtue of the Holy
Image, and the Miracles the <hi>Virgin</hi> continually
works in favour of thoſe, who repair thither to pay
her their Adorations, I'le here relate to you a Miracle
which they Cry'd along the Streets of <hi>Florence,</hi> as
a thing that had lately hapned, which Print my
Curioſity prompted me to buy. The Story ſeem'd
to me very Gallant, and tho' it be ſomething long,
yet I hope the Recital will not ſeem tedious to
you.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman of one of the beſt Families of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
was fallen from a flouriſhing condition, by
means of ſome croſs Blaſts of Fortune, to extream
Poverty. That which greatly added to his Affliction
was, That he had two grown Daughters that were
not yet provided for; his only recourſe in this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition, was to the Mother of God. And
to enter himſelf the better into her Favour, he made
a Vow, to continue all his Life long very devout to
her Miraculous Image of the <hi>Annunciade:</hi> To this
purpoſe he Roſe very early every Morning, and
went to Say his Prayers in the Church-Porch, before
the Doors were open'd. After he had continued his
Devotion thus for a long time, the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi>
thought good at laſt to hear his Prayers, and to
ſend him ſome Relief. Accordingly ſhe inſpir'd two
Blind-men, of the number of thoſe who always kept
about the Door of the Church, to Riſe ſooner than
ordinary, to take their Stations in the Church-Porch:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57009:67"/>
Being arriv'd there, one of them began to tell his
Companion, how much he was beholden to the
Miraculous <hi>Virgin,</hi> for that from extream Poverty,
he had in a ſhort time attain'd to competent Riches,
by the Alms he had received there; and that beſides
the Mony in Silver he had left at his Lodging, he
had Two hundred Piſtols in Gold quilted in the
Crown of his Hat. His Blind Comrade having
heard this his Diſcourſe, told him, That for his part
he did not in the leaſt envy his good Luck, as being
much more obliged to the Miraculous Image, and
that he had quilted in his Hat no leſs than Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Piſtols in Gold. The Gentleman who was near
to them at his Prayers, without making the leaſt
Noiſe, that might diſcover him to be there, having
heard them diſcourſing at this rate, and ſeeing ſo
fair an opportunity offer'd him of enriching himſelf,
very ſoftly drew near to the two Blind-men, and
very dexterouſly took off both their Hats at once,
retiring ſome Paces backwards. The Blind-men
being extreamly ſurpriz'd hereat, and each of them
believing his Companion had done the Feat, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
their Hats of one another, and proceeded
to ſuch a Rage, that handling their Crutches, they
diſcharg'd ſeveral hearty Strokes upon one anothers
Heads; and without doubt had kill'd one another,
if People had not come in to part them. Whilſt
they were thus hotly engag'd, the Gentleman went
off, and finding ſome ſcruple in himſelf for what
he had done, he goes the ſame Day to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
Archbiſhop of <hi>Florence,</hi> to whom he told
all that had paſt: The Archbiſhop having heard
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57009:68"/>
the Relation, did fully approve of what he had
done, and told him, That he was not at all obliged
to make any Reſtitution; foraſmuch as it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
That the Virgin had viſibly aſſiſted him
in the whole courſe of that Affair, in conſideration
of the Devotion he bore to her Miraculous Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture,
and Ordered, That for the Comfort of the
Faithful it ſhould be printed and publiſh'd through,
out the City of <hi>Florence.</hi> This ſame Story has
ſince been printed anew, in a Book which is very
Currant in <hi>Italy,</hi> and has for its Title, <hi>L'Utile
col Dolci,</hi> or, <hi>Profit with Pleaſure.</hi> You ſee here,
Sir, a very pleaſant Miracle, wherein the <hi>Virgin,</hi> to
pleaſure one of her Servants, makes a Robber of
him, and who as ſuch ought to be puniſhed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Laws. For by what means ſoever theſe
poor Blind-men might have pick'd up this Mony,
however theirs it was, and had been given them
for Alms. But if we ſuppoſe this, to be a Story
invented at pleaſure, I am aſtoniſh'd, that a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal-Archbiſhop
ſhould ever cauſe it to be printed;
and that the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which in all other Matters
appear ſo exact and ſcrupulous, ſhould Licence the
Impreſſion of it in the Book before-mentioned,
People are ſo cloy'd with Miracles in <hi>Italy,</hi> that
except they contain ſome thing Romantick and
Fabulous, they are ſcarcely taken notice of. This
is that which makes the <hi>Italians,</hi> who not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

out with ſuch rare and ſurprizing, or ſuch merry
and pleaſing Circumſtances, that it is very diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57009:68"/>
to Read them, or hear them Related. I may
have an occaſion to give you a more particular
Account hereof in one of my LETTERS; and
therefore ſhall at preſent paſs over in Silence the
many Miracles of this Famous Church of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciade,</hi>
to give you an Account of ſome Places
of Devotion, which are not far diſtant from the
City of <hi>Florence,</hi> and which I had the Curioſity
to go and Viſit.</p>
               <p>'Tis amongſt the high Mountains of the <hi>Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,</hi>
that we meet with Three famous Deſerts, at
a Days Journy diſtance from each other, where as
many Heads of different Orders had their Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
The firſt of theſe is <hi>Camaldule,</hi> the ſecond
<hi>Valombroſa,</hi> and the third <hi>Mont-Alverne.</hi> Of
theſe, <hi>Camaldule</hi> has by way of preheminence been
called the <hi>Holy Deſert,</hi> and is certainly one of the
moſt Deſert places Nature can produce. S. <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldus</hi>
obtain'd this place of an Earl, called <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule,</hi>
from whence it took its Name of <hi>Camaldule,</hi>
as being a kind of abbreviation of <hi>Campmaldule,</hi>
or the Field of <hi>Maldule.</hi> Hither it was then, that
he retir'd, to lead a Penitent Life; and having by
his Example engaged ſome Diſciples to joyn with
him, he built there a Monaſtery upon a very high
Mountain, in an Interval lying between two Tops
or Prominences thereof; and afterwards being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of a greater Solitude, he retired to one of thoſe
Tops, which is a place almoſt inacceſſible: Where
he Inſtituted a kind of Double Order, one of
<hi>Monks,</hi> and the other of <hi>Solitaries</hi> or <hi>Hermits;</hi>
but under the ſame Habit and Rule, excepting
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57009:69"/>
only ſome particular Conſtitutions to the one, with
reference to the Hermetick-Life; and to the others,
for the Monaſtick. The Monks dwelt in the
Monaſtery he had built below, and the Solitaries
retir'd with him to the Top, which at preſent is
called the <hi>Holy Deſert.</hi> I arrived at this Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
in the beginning of <hi>October.</hi> From <hi>Florence</hi>
it is in a manner a continual Up-hill thither, and from
thence one may diſcover that great and lofty City,
with the Country all about it, which affords a
moſt pleaſing Proſpect. Theſe Fathers have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
preſerved Hoſpitality amongſt them, and to
this Day entertain all Strangers that come thither,
and Treat them according to their Quality for
Three days together. Foraſmuch as there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inn, nor any Houſes near it, I went and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
my ſelf to the Abby, where I was very
civilly received. I found here Three <hi>Florentine</hi>
Gentlemen, to whoſe Company I joyn'd my ſelf,
and at Night we were Served at Table with <hi>Eggs</hi>
and <hi>Fiſh,</hi> without any Superfluity, but with a
Mediocrity well-becoming the Religious State of
theſe Fathers, with which I was much more Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
than I had been at the <hi>Citeaux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
where the Abbot Treated us with ſo much Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and Exceſs. We acquainted them over
Night, That we deſigned the next Day to go to
the <hi>Sacred Deſert;</hi> and accordingly they Called
us up at Five of the Clock the next Morning, and
made us Sit-down to Eat at Six. I was extreamly
ſurpriz'd, to ſee they had prepared Dinner ſo early,
when none of us had the leaſt Appetite to Meat:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57009:69"/>
But they told us, That we muſt force our ſelves
to Eat as well as we could, becauſe the Air was ſo
piercing and cold in climbing up to the Top of
the Mountain, that we ſhould never be able to
bear it, if we attempted it with empty Stomachs.
Moreover, That we were to prepare our ſelves, to
Clamber on Foot for Six Miles together on the
Rocks, and to march through the Snow, before we
could come to the Top of the <hi>Holy Deſert,</hi> and
that there they never gave any Meat to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to avoid diſturbing of their Solitude; ſo that
we ſhould be forced, to come down from thence
by the ſame Way to the Monaſtery, there to take
a Second Refreſhment. We ſuffered our ſelves
therefore to be perſwaded, and after we had Eaten,
we parted from the Monaſtery about Seven of the
Clock, and walked on towards the Top, always
compaſſing the Mountain, in a continued Foreſt of
tall <hi>Fir-Trees.</hi> All theſe Rocks are full of little
Springs, from whence iſſueth a very clear Water,
whoſe Rivulets diſperſe themſelves all over the
Way by which we went; ſo that one cannot
Climb very high without marching in the Water,
which is very troubleſom. Theſe Waters meeting
together form a conſiderable Torrent, which we
paſs'd and re-paſs'd upon great <hi>Fir-Trees</hi> laid over
in the form of Bridges. We arrived about Noon
at the Top, after having marched Two Miles
through the Snow. This was in the Month of
<hi>October;</hi> but the Top of the Mountain is ſo cold,
that when it Rains below, it almoſt continually
Snows here on high. We found the Snow very
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57009:70"/>
high there, and had been ſo for Eight Days; ſo
that at a diſtance we could ſee nothing but the
Upper-part of the Church, and the Tiles or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of the Cells; we counted about Sixty of
them, which are about Twenty Paces diſtant from
one another, and taken all together form a Little
Town: Every Cell hath ſeveral Rooms, and a
Garden. They ſhew'd us that of St. <hi>Romuald,</hi>
which one of the Hermits dwelt in. We asked
them, Why they bore no greater reſpect to the
Cell of their Happy Founder, but left it to one of
their Religious to live in? They told us, That
this was the only way they had to preſerve it
againſt the Moiſture the place was obnoxious to;
and that otherwiſe the Wood would rot, and the
Cell be in danger of Falling-down. They ſhew'd
us the Cell of a Venerable Hermit, who (they
aſſur'd us) had not ſtirr'd thence for Forty Years
together, and who ſtill liv'd there in perpetual
Silence, not ſo much as ſpeaking a Word to any
one. They put in his Meat to him through a
Little Window, which he took with great ſobriety
and moderation. Theſe Solitaries eſteem'd him a
Saint, for they value Silence above all other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
Which gave me occaſion to demand of thoſe
who were ordered to accompany us, what kind of
thing this great Vertue of <hi>Silence</hi> was, and how
they defin'd it? They anſwered, That it was to
be Silent with Men, in order to ſpeak to God.
Whereupon I reply'd, That it ſeem'd to me to be
better defin'd thus; <hi>To be Silent, or to ſpeak when
one ought; and that I could not approve of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57009:70"/>
Uſe they had introduc'd amongst them, of Speaking
to one another by Signs.</hi> We our ſelves indeed had
but newly experienced the Inconveniences of it, at
our firſt Entrance into the <hi>Holy Deſert;</hi> for having
found the Court-Gate open, we went in to rights;
but when we were entred, not knowing which
Way to betake our ſelves, we drew near to ſome
of theſe Solitaries, who were buſie in removing of
the Snow, to make a Paſſage. We deſired them,
to be ſo kind, as to tell us, To whom we might
addreſs our ſelves, for to take a View of the Place;
but not ſo much as one of them opened their
Mouths, to give us a Word in anſwer: Some of
them made Signs to us with their Hands and Feet,
and others with their Brooms and Shovels.
We believed at firſt, that they were Fools,
or that they had a mind to drive us out again;
but at laſt we apprehended, That they made
Signs to us to Return to the Gate, and there
ſpeak with the Porters; with whom we happily
met. I immediately told theſe Porters, That
it appear'd to me very ſtrange, that God having
given to Men a Tongue and a Mouth, wherewith
to expreſs their Thoughts; ſome perſons, inſtead of
acknowledging this Advantage God had given
them above Brute-Beaſts, by a good and diſcreet
uſe thereof, ſhould undertake to make uſe of their
Hands and Feet to expreſs themſelves, like thoſe
that are Dumb-born, or that have their Tongues
cut out. That at the beſt this ſeem'd to me very
improper, and very far from appearing to be a
Vertue, fit to make Men Good and Holy.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57009:71"/>
They Anſwered me, <hi>That theſe were Myſteries
hid and unknown to Seculars, and only revealed
by God to Solitaries and Perfect Souls, who knew
the Excellence of it. The Sins</hi> (proceeded he) <hi>of
the Men of the World, are groſs Sins, ſuch as</hi>
Covetouſneſs, Envy, Luxury, Blaſphemy, &amp;c.
<hi>but as for us, our greatest Sins are, when ſometimes
by Frailty we do break our obſervance of Silence;
to Walk with too much haste and precipitation; to
caſt ſome curious (tho' Innocent) Looks; to be
Slovenly in our Habits; to have preferr'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Vocal, to Mental-Prayer; to have been too
much pleaſed with the Taſte of Heavenly Comfort,
or too Heavy and Caſt-down under Sufferings.</hi>
I ſeem'd to perceive in theſe his Anſwers, ſomething
of Pride and Haughtineſs, and that ſmelt ſtrong
of a Phariſaical, <hi>Non ſum ſicut caeteri hominum;
I am not like other Men;</hi> and which made me
fear, that <hi>Pride</hi> (having been the Sin of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in Heaven) might probably alſo be the Sin of
theſe Solitaries here on the Top of the Mountain.
And indeed, ſo far were all theſe dazling Shews
of Piety from making me conceive any Inclination
for theſe Material Solitudes, which ſeem'd ſo much
to facilitate the Practice thereof, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
it made me conceive a greater Love for an
Ordinary and Humble Life in the World, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with all thoſe Pious Practices, which in ſuch
a Life we have continual Opportunities to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt.
It appear'd to me, That theſe Solitaries plac'd the
whole and main of Godlineſs in ſome trifling
Obſervances, which yet are powerful enough to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57009:71"/>
make them wander from the Paths of that Charity,
they ought to have for thoſe who are engaged in
the Commerce of the World, as looking upon
them no otherwiſe, than as Men that are in the
High-way to utter Perdition, and for whom there
is almoſt no hope of Salvation. Surely ſuch
Thoughts as theſe cannot be ſaid to comply with
<hi>Charity;</hi> for without doubt, ſome Seculars living
in the World, are as acceptable in the Eyes of God,
as theſe Hermits on the Mountains. The Porters
told us, <hi>That Three times a Week, they of the
Monaſtery below brought up Viands, and other
neceſſary Proviſions, for the Suſtenance of thoſe who
lived in the Sacred Deſert.</hi> At laſt, they conducted
us to the Church, which is very Little and Narrow,
all Lin'd and Wainſcoted with Wood, againſt the
Moiſture and great Coldneſs of the place. They
aſſured us, <hi>That ſome certain Winters, the Cells,
Church and all, were wholly buried in the Snow,
and that they were fain to hollow themſelves out
Paſſages below through the Snow, making ſome
Holes to the Top, to let in the Light, for to paſs from
one Cell to another, which then appeared like ſo many
great White-Vaults.</hi> They told us, <hi>That all the
while they live under the Snow, they are very little
ſenſible of the Cold; but to preſerve themſelves
from the ill effects of the Moiſture, they keep good
Wood-Fires, that burn Day and Night, as having
very near them vaſt Foreſts of</hi> Pine, Cheſnut,
<hi>and</hi> Fir-Trees, <hi>which do furniſh them with
Wood in great abundance.</hi> After we had Viſited
the Church, we Returned by the ſame Way
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57009:72"/>
we came, and arrived at the Abby about five
a Clock in the Evening, where we were Civilly
entertained as before. Tis only this Monaſtery that
is ſtill maintaind in good Obſervance; all other
Monks of the ſame Order, who have many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries
in <hi>Italy,</hi> lead a very ſcandalous Life. We
parted thence the next day, after that we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnd
our Thanks to theſe Fathers, and knowing
that the Abby of <hi>Valombroſa,</hi> which is chief of
another Order of Monks, very famous in <hi>Italy,</hi>
was not above a days Journy from thence, we all
of us Travel'd thither. We went down Hill for
ſome Miles, and afterwards Coaſted about the <hi>Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin,</hi>
by a very pleaſant way. We Travel'd a great
way through Woods of <hi>Olive-Trees,</hi> all loaden with
<hi>Olives,</hi> and ever and anon met with ſmall Hills full
of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Citron-Trees,</hi> full hung with <hi>Citrons</hi>
and <hi>Oranges.</hi> Some of them are ſo high that a
Man on Horſe-back may paſs under them, without
touching the Branches. After they have been once
planted, they grow without ſtanding in need of
any Art or Husbandry. All theſe ſides of the
Mountains are exceeding Rich, as abounding with
all ſorts of <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> and at the bottom of every
one of theſe Trees, there is the ſtock of a Vine
that embraceth it, and enterlacing its Branches with
thoſe of the Tree, does at the Seaſon make a very
pleaſant mixture of its Grapes with the Fruit. After
half a days Journy, we were oblig'd to mount the
<hi>Apennin,</hi> for four Miles together, through very
ſtony and rugged ways, until we came to <hi>Valom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſa,</hi>
in Latin <hi>Vallis Umbroſa.</hi> This place is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57009:72"/>
indeed a Valley with repect to the Tops of the
Mountains, that raiſe themſelves a great hight above
it; but if we compare it, with the Level of the
Country that lies beneath, it is a very high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and very cold, for there are no Fruit-Trees
to be ſeen here, except only ſome <hi>Cheſtnut-Trees,</hi>
and a few <hi>Apple-Trees.</hi> The great Foreſts of Pine
and <hi>Fir-Trees</hi> that emcompaſs it, in former times
rendred the place very Dark and Shady, which
was the occaſion of giving it the name of <hi>Valom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſa.</hi>
S. <hi>John Gualbert</hi> made choice of this place
for his retirement. He naturally was a Lover of
theſe kind of places, and in all his Travels, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he met with any Dark Wood, or very Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
place, he caſt in his mind, ſome time or other to
come and fix his Abode there, and to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of a Monaſtery. I am frequently oblig'd in
my Letters, in compliance with the Exigency of
my matter, to relate to you ſeveral vicious and
wicked Actions of the <hi>Italian</hi> Prieſts and Monks;
a thing very contrary to my Natural inclination,
which prompts me to conceal the ill, and to publiſh
only the good. Wherefore a little to refreſh my
wearied Pen, and to comply with the deſire I have
to Honour the Memory of great men, you'l give
me leave, Sir, I hope, to give my ſelf the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Relating to you an Action truly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Memorable of S. <hi>John Gualbert.</hi> This
young Lord had a Brother, whom he moſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loved, who being engaged in a Duel, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
killed by his Rival. <hi>Gualbert</hi> ſuppoſed it
would be an Action worthy of his Honour, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57009:73"/>
great Courage, to endeavour to avenge the Death
of his Brother. To this purpoſe he engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in purſuit of this <hi>Homicide,</hi> who being fled, he
went in queſt of him throughout all the Provinces
of <hi>Italy.</hi> It hapned at length that he met with
him Diſarmed in a way where he could not eſcape
him. The unhappy Wretch ſeeing him come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, with his drawn Sword in his Hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
caſt himſelf Proſtrate on the Ground, Crying for
Mercy; but perceiving by his Thundering Voice,
and his inflamed looks, that there was no Quarter
to be hoped for, laid his Arms a croſs his Breaſt,
in expectation of the mortal Thruſt. <hi>Gualbert</hi>
ſeeing him in this poſture, called to mind our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt hanging on the Croſs, who was ſo far
from Avenging himſelf, that he not only prayed for
his Perſecuters, but died for them. This thought
having quite ſpoild his former deſign, he alights
from his Horſe, and inſtead of Running his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
through, he freely forgave him, kiſſed him,
and embraced him, and tendered him ever after
as his own Brother. If the <hi>Italians</hi> and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
in ſtead of amuſing themſelves, about the
Superſtitious worſhip of their Saints, would once
apply themſelvee to imitate theſe lovely examples
of their Vertues, they would without doubt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
themſelves more acceptable to God, neither
would they be found ſo baſely and abominably A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
themſelves as they do. I return now to
my Solitude of <hi>Valombroſa:</hi> We arrived at this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Abby, where are ſome of the moſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
and Sumptuous Buildings that can be. One
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57009:73"/>
of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Gentlemen that was with me had
a Brother there, who was the chief Perſon there,
next to the Abbot, for whoſe ſake we were very Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
received. The Monks here lead a very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
and Pleaſant Life; when they are weary of
living in this Deſert, they make an enterchange
with the Monks of <hi>Florence,</hi> and thereby enjoy
the pleaſing variety of living one part of the year
in the Country, and the other in the City. They
have cut down for a quarter of a League round
their Monaſtery all the great Fir-Trees that Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
it, to give themſelves more Air, and to
make the place more Healthy. The next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we were led to the Hermitage of S. <hi>John
Gualbert,</hi> which is at about half a Leagues diſtance,
upon the Point of a little Rock, which lifts up it
ſelf in the midſt of the Valley being very craggy
on every ſide. In getting up to it, we went round
the Rock as by a winding Stairs for the ſpace of
about a quarter of an hour, at the end of which, we
found our ſelves at the Top of the Rock, where
the Hermitage is; which conſiſts of a very neat Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
curiouſly Guilt and Painted all over, and a very
hanſome Set of Lodgings, well Wainſcoted and
Painted all within, with a Garden of a moderate
ſize, ſo that the whole is a meer Jewel. There is
no Monument left here of the ancient Cell of this
Saint, all the Buildings being new and Modern:
There is always a Father Hermit, that dwells here
with a Converſe Brother to ſerve him. Whenever
the Hermit dies, the Abbots of the Congregation of
<hi>Valombroſa,</hi> at their general Chapter, make choice
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57009:74"/>
of a Monk, of exemplary Life, and a Lover of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
to reſide there. The great Abby is to furniſh
him, with all neceſſaries of Life: He has a very
fine Library full of choice Books, when he has a
mind to Study, and indeed the Hermit that was
then in Poſſeſſion of the place, was a man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Learning, and appeard to me a very honeſt
man. He made us a very fine diſcourſe about the
contempt of the World, and the advantages of
Retirement and Solitude: Thô indeed there was no
great need of it, for we were already, without all
that, ſo Charmed with the Beauty of this Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage,
that in caſe there had been more of the
ſame cut, Nature, rather than Grace would eaſily

                  </gap>ave perſuaded us to become Hermits, in order to
enjoy an eaſy and pleaſent Life, without either care or
trouble. The Monks of <hi>Valombroſa,</hi> have extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relaxed the ſtrictneſs of their firſt Inſtitution.
They are Clothed in Black, and profeſs the Rule
of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> thô indeed they obſerve but little
of it: The next day we ſet out very betimes in

and where, as they tell us, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Impreſſion of the ſacred Wounds. This
days Journy was exceeding troubleſome to us;
We went up from <hi>Valombroſa,</hi> by the direction of
a Guide we took along with us, to the very Top
of the <hi>Appennin,</hi> and continued our way upon the
ſame, till we came to the Foot of <hi>Alverne.</hi> This
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57009:74"/>
Mountain is diſcovered at a great diſtance, and ſome
maintain it to be the higheſt of all the <hi>Alpennin.</hi>
It hath nothing that is pleaſing or delightful about
it, neither is any thing to be ſeen here beſides bare
Rocks, without either Trees or Verdure: It is ſo
high that it ſeldom or never Rains there, which
was the reaſon we found no Snow here. We got up
to it, with a great deal of trouble and difficulty,
by a very narrow way, betwen extream high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices,
and we could not gain the Top of it, till it
was in a manner quite dark night. Here we found
a large Convent of Religious, of the Order of S.
<hi>Francis,</hi> called by the <hi>Italians Soccolanti,</hi> becauſe
of the Wooden-Socks they wear inſtead of Shoes.
The firſt thing we did was to enquire where we
might Lodge for that night; the Fathers told us
there was an Inn cloſe by, for the Entertainment
of Strangers. Formerly theſe Religious exerciſed
Hoſpitality towards all ſorts of Perſons, that out of
Devotion came to <hi>Alverne,</hi> as the Fathers of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldule</hi>
do to this day, to thoſe who come to viſit
the Holy Deſert, whereof I have ſpoken before;
but at preſent they are weary of this piece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and do employ the Fund deſtinated to that
purpoſe, to their own advantage. By bad hap for
us, there was no body in the Inn, the Innkeeper
with all his Family, being gon to a Wedding, a
days Journy from the place; ſo that we were
obliged to return to the Convent, and entreat the
Fathers to afford us ſome ſhelter amongſt them for
that night, ſince there was no other place for us
to beſtow our ſelves. The Fathers ſeeing no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57009:75"/>
granted our requeſt, but with ſo much Averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ill will, that we could not but wonder to
ſee that perſons, who for the moſt part live upon
the Alms, that are abundantly contributed to them
by Seculars, ſhould refuſe to aſſiſt them upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
They ſhewed us a Chamber where we
might lye, but as for affording us any thing to
Eat, they deſired our excuſe, telling us that they
had none for themſelves; being thus reſolved to
leave us without either Meat or Fire, tho' the
nights be exceeding cold there, upon the pretence
of the trouble they had in getting their Wood, as
being oblig'd to fetch it from the Foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
We deſired them at leaſt to be ſo kind, to
give us leave to enter their Kitchin, for to warm
our ſelves a little at their common Fire: but they
being very loath that we ſhould ſee the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
they had there prepar'd for themſelves, told
us that they could not grant our requeſt, becauſe
they had ſome of their Fathers that were Sick, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Fire, ſaying of their Office. One of the
<hi>Florentine</hi> Gentlemen that was in our Company,
knowing that the Convent was never deſtitute of
Proviſions, broke out into a Paſſion againſt the
Guardian, and reproaching him with his baſe Incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
told him That he conſtantly three times a Week
ſent a good quantity of Bread and Wine to their great
Convent at <hi>Florence,</hi> but that he was reſolv'd to
ſtop his Hand for time to come, and give them the
bag, and that moreover he himſelf would acquaint
them with the Reaſon moving him ſo to do. This
advertiſement made the Guardian preſently change
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57009:75"/>
his note, and having excuſed himſelf for what was
paſt in conſideration of the Benefactor of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
he himſelf conducted us into the Kitchin, where
in ſtead of theſe Sick Fathers, and mumblers of their
Offices, we found there four or five fat and bonny
Fryars, playing at Dice, a great Pot Boyling over
the Fire, beſides ſeveral Joynts of Meat a Roaſting:
One of theſe Fryars ſeeing us come in, very nimbly
ſnatch'd up the Dice and Boxes into his Gown; but
a while after forgetting himſelf, roſe up, and let all
tumble down on the Ground. The Father Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
perceiving the miſchance had hapned, excuſed
them the beſt he could, telling us, that having been
that day a great way off a Preaching, to refreſh
themſelves they had made bold with a little Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
In fine they made us Sup with them, and we
were very well Treated. After Supper they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
us to our Chamber, where we found a very
good Fire. The next day one of theſe Fathers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
us to ſhew us the Holy Places of Mount
<hi>Alvern:</hi> We were extreamly ſurprized to ſee the
ſurface of this Mountain, which we had not had
the time the night before to take notice of, becauſe
it was very late when we arrived. The whole
Mountain is nothing elſe but a company of Rocks
heaped one upon another, and all cleft aſunder,
forming as many hideous Precipices, which cannot
be viewed without Horror. Some believe that
theſe Rocks were Rent aſunder at the Death of our
Lord: S. <hi>Francis</hi> was of this mind, when he pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
upon this place for his Retirement, to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
upon the ſacred Miſteries of the Paſſion. They
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57009:76"/>
ſhewed us the place, where the Hiſtory of his Life
tells us, that Jeſus Chriſt appear'd to him, in the
form of a Seraphim on the Croſs, and imprinted in
his Hands, his Feet, and his Side, the Five wounds
were given him on the Croſs, to the end it might
be ſaid, that S. <hi>Francis</hi> had ſuffered as much as
he: But indeed according to this account he would
have ſuffered much more, for the ſame Legend adds,
that he ſuffred even till his Death, the Pains of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt as ſenſibly, as Jeſus Chriſt felt them,
when he received them on the Croſs; and that
from that time forward the Life he lived was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
by a perpetual Miracle, which preſerved his
Life in the midſt of a continual Death. For my
part, I find this pretended Apparition of Jeſus
Chriſt like a Seraphim with Wings, extreamly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
not to ſay Ridiculous; why not rather in
his human form? He that would not take upon him
the nature of Angels, ſhall we believe that he
would ever take their Figure? And would not this
highly favour the Opinion of thoſe Ancient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
who maintain'd, that the Son of God, had
only taken upon him an Aery and Phantaſtical
Body? And to ſpeak my mind, I believe that this
Impreſſion of the Wounds, was only perform'd in
the ſtrong Imagination of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> much like
ſome others have imagin'd, that they had Feet of
Wax, and a Head of Glaſs. The place where it
is ſaid, that this Miraculous Operation was Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
is under a great Stone, whereof the one end
only is wedg'd into the Rocks, yet ſo as according
to my Underſtanding is ſufficient for its Support.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57009:76"/>
Nevertheleſs theſe Fathers, every where proclaim
this for a great Miracle, and that it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
but that naturally the Stone muſt needs fall.
Near to this they ſhew us a little Pathway very
narrow, upon the Brink of a vaſt Precipice, which
was the way by which S. <hi>Francis</hi> went to
pray, under that Rock. The Devil envying his
great Devotion, Attempted, upon a time to caſt
him down Headlong; but he ſeeing the Enemy
of Mankind coming towards him, leand himſelf
againſt the Rock, which made way for his Body,
ſoftning like Wax to receive him. They ſtill ſhew
this Impreſſion of his Body left in the Rock, but
which may as well have been done with a Chizzel,
as the way they tell us. As for the Devil, ſure
it is that the Roman Catholicks make many pretty
Stories of him, that are not always very Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
I remember to have ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> in the
Church of S. <hi>Colombe</hi> neer <hi>Sens,</hi> a very pleaſant Hiſtory,
repreſented <hi>En relief,</hi> upon an Holy-Water Baſin
Marble, near the Door of the Church, concerning
an Holy Hermit called <hi>Beat.</hi> The Devil being come
on a certain time to diſtract his Thoughts, whilſt
he was ſaying of his Office, the Saint laying hold
of him, lift him up by the Ears, and put him into the
Baſin and having laid his Breviary upon it, kept
him a Priſoner there for ten days together. Nothing
can be imagined more Comical, than to ſee the
Repreſentation of this Devil, who as far as he is
able, lifts up his great Aſſes-Ears, above the Holy
Water, with the marks of an extream Rage in his
Countenance; for, ſay they, he fears the Holy
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57009:77"/>
Water, many degrees beyond the Fire of Hell.
The Monks of this Abby thought good to be at the
charge of this work, <hi>ad perpetuam rei Memoriam;</hi>
But I return to Mount <hi>Alvern:</hi> The Fathers after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſhewed us many other places in the Rocks
where S. <hi>Francis</hi> performed his Religious Exerciſes,
and amongſt others, that where he wrote the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of his Order, whereof I have ſeen the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
writ with his own Hand, at Our Lady of
<hi>Portiuncule,</hi> which is a little Chappel in <hi>Umbria,</hi>
about five Miles from <hi>Aſſiſe.</hi> Here it was, as they
tell us, that he had many Revelations and Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Amongſt the reſt they tell us, of an Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the great Zeal of this Saint for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sinners, granted to him, as plenary an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
as he could give, that is to ſay, an entire
Remiſſion of Guilt and Puniſhment for all thoſe,
who the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſhould viſit this little
Chappel: So that the Grand Univerſal Jubile of the
Holy Year, is not more ſaving to Sinners, than this
of S. <hi>Francis.</hi> Any perſon who on this day goes to
viſit that Chappel, with intention to enjoy the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of this Jubile, with ſaying five <hi>Paſter
Noſters</hi> and as many <hi>Ave Marias,</hi> be he the moſt
Abominable Sinner that lives on Earth, becomes as
Pure and Innocent, as he was when newly Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
and ſhould he die in that Condition, there is
neither Hell nor Purgatory for him, but would go
directly to Paradiſe. And conformable to this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the Roman Catholicks, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of the <hi>Italians,</hi> there is ſuch a prodigious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57009:77"/>
of People on this day from all parts, that it
cauſes a Famin in all the Country thereabouts, and
many are killed in the throng that is at the Door of
the Church, who then go to enjoy the Priviledge
of their Indulgence in the other World. Now ſeeing
all this, muſt not we avow, that either the Roman
Catholicks are very blind, or elſe very negligent
of their Salvation, when in the moſt Important
Affair Imaginable, and the greateſt concern of their
Immortal Souls, the Remiſſions of their Sins, rely
upon the word of a Mortal man? Their S. <hi>Francis</hi>
has told them, that by going to ſuch a place, on
ſuch a day, and there ſaying ſuch and ſuch Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
their Sins, with all the Chaſtiſements due to
them, for the ſame, ſhall be entirely forgiven them,
and that he has received the aſſurance of this from
the Mouth of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who, he ſaith,
appeard in particular to him for this purpoſe; and
without examining the matter any further, they
believe it, they rely upon his word, and caſt behind
their Backs, <hi>O ſtupendous occaecation!</hi> the Sacred
Oracles of the Goſpel, which do ſeriouſly warn
them, that the only way to have their Sins Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
is true Repentance. The Fathers <hi>Soccol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anti</hi>
of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> who are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enriched by means of this Devotion, have built
themſelves in this place a very fair Convent; and
foraſmuch as the Chappel was too little for their uſe,
they have built a great and Magnificent Church
round about it, ſo as the little Church ſtands now
encloſed in the greater. I never yet ſaw any
place of Devotion in <hi>Italy,</hi> which had not ſome
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57009:78"/>
fair Palace, and a good Kitchin for the uſe and
Accommodation of thoſe who make the beſt of it,
which I confeſs makes them ſtill the more ſuſpect
to me. Five Miles diſtant from hence, we met
with <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> which is a pretty Town, Situate on a
Hill: This is the place where S. <hi>Francis</hi> was Born,
and where they ſay his Body repoſeth at the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Convent of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> in a Subterranean Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
under the high Altar. 'Tis ſaid, that his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and that of S. <hi>Dominick</hi> continue there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt Symptom of Corruption, and that they
ſtand both upright on their Feet, Hand in Hand,
without any thing to uphold them: and that it

Lives, ſhould not be ſeparated after Death. This

Indeed, the Reaſon why the Popes do not
Viſit this place, is not becauſe they are afraid of
meeting Death there, but becauſe they are afraid
of diſobliging of one of theſe Potent parties, I
mean the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> or the <hi>Dominicans;</hi> ſince it is
evident, they could not make the Diſcovery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ruining one or other of theſe Devotions, which
would be a vaſt prejudice to theſe Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
wherefore they like better, to leave the People
in Superſtition and Error, than to open their Eyes
at their own Coſt. The Pope is oblig'd to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and improve the Intereſt of the <hi>Monks,</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they ſupport his Intereſt.</p>
               <p>The Third thing wherewith I deſign'd to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
you, before my cloſing of this LETTER
concerning S. <hi>Francis,</hi> is, That amongſt other
things, I ſaw a ſmall Convent which he built him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
with the Aſſiſtance of his Brethren, in a
Deſcent from the <hi>Apennin,</hi> leading to a Town
of <hi>Italy,</hi> called, The <hi>Borough of the Holy
Sepulchre.</hi> He lived in this Convent ſeveral Years,
and deſign'd it for a Model to thoſe Convents of
his Order, that ſhould be built for time to come.
To ſpeak the Truth, I never in my Life ſaw ſo
wretched a Dwelling: The whole Convent is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but a company of Holes or Caves, more
proper to Lodge Bears, than for Men to retire in.
Now, I could wiſh, that Men would a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
this poor Hovel, with thoſe Magnificent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
which his Children, I mean thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to live under his Rule, have built throughout
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57009:79"/>
all <hi>Italy;</hi> to wit, thoſe Grand Convents of <hi>Rome,
Naples, Venice,</hi> and in a word, of all the other Cities.
Have not the moſt Famous Architects exhauſted
their Art, and rack'd their Brains, to form the Model
of them? The moſt Renowned Painters employ'd
their utmoſt Skill and choiceſt Colours, to make all
their Walls a pleaſing and lively Story? The moſt
curious Guilders their fineſt Gold, to make thereof
Ceilings bright and luminous? And laſtly, Have
not the Bowels of the <hi>Apennin</hi> been ravag'd for
the fineſt Marbles, the choiceſt <hi>Jaſpers</hi> and rareſt
<hi>Porphyries,</hi> to form the Pillars that ſupport them,
to Pave their Cloiſters, their Refectories, and their
Dormitories; and to Compoſe all the Doors, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
and Chimneys of their Cells? The <hi>Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Fathers are the only Men that have witneſſed
ſome horrour for ſo extravagant a Pomp, ſo dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically
oppoſite to the Laws of Humility and
Poverty, which they received from their Legiſlato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Building their Convents, which was both very
modeſt and regular; only they have always had a
great Care, to provide themſelves fair Gardens,
with fine Parterres, pleaſant Fountains, and great
Walks of Trees, which are commonly frequented
by the Gentlemen of Cities that are near them, to
take the Air in. The <hi>Capuchins</hi> are at this da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

                  </gap>

               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:57009:79"/>
But we find, that of late they have loſt much
of their Modeſty in Building too: The New Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
they make at preſent are more lofty, more
large; their Cells greater, their Churches more
adorned, and their other Regular places, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
with the Modern way of Building. They
have very fair Convents at <hi>Venice, Florence, Piſa,</hi>
and <hi>Milan.</hi> When I paſſed through the Dutchy
of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> I ſaw at <hi>Dijon</hi> the fine Pile
of Building, theſe Fathers caus'd to be rais'd for
their Sick, which was not in the leaſt inferiour to
the fair Palaces of the Preſidents and Counſellors of
Parliament of that City. And when I paſs'd
through <hi>Germany,</hi> in my Way for <hi>England,</hi> I ſaw
upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> about Half a days Journy above
<hi>Coblentz,</hi> a ſtately Building, which I took for
one of the Palaces of the Elector of <hi>Treves,</hi> but
was indeed a Convent of <hi>Capuchins,</hi> which his
Electoral Highneſs cauſed to be built for them.
Before the Foundations of it were laid, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of them a Model of their Convents, to
have it built by; but the Fathers anſwered him,
That if S. <hi>Francis</hi> were to give the Plane, it
would be very plain and ſcanty; but that foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as his Electoral Highneſs had the Goodneſs
to concern himſelf therewith, it could not well be
blam'd, if the Building did in ſome degree ſuit
with his Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion of all is this, Sir, That whatever
theſe Men may pretend to, as long as they ſhall
make the Chriſtian-Perfection to conſiſt in certain
Phantaſtick, Stoical and Extraordinary ways of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57009:80"/>
Living, a ſhort times Experience will make it
appear they have deceiv'd themſelves; all their fine
Deſigns will vaniſh in their own view. And as the
Principles on which they build are falſe, they will
alway find themſelves reduc'd to the impoſſibility
of practiſing what they have Vowed; and will
be forc'd at laſt to acknowledge, that the great
Axioms of Chriſtian Morality, which are of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Truth, and to which only we ought to tye
our ſelves; are <hi>to avoid Evil, and to do Good; to
love God with all our Heart, and our Neighbour
as our ſelves.</hi> I conclude with theſe excellent
words, and am with all my Heart,</p>

               <p>HAving promis'd in my laſt LETTER, to
give you an Account of my Journy to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto,</hi>
I doubt not but your Curioſity, (to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
about that place of Devotion, which makes
ſo great a Noiſe in the World,) will incline you to
wiſh for the performance of my Promiſe. To the
end therefore that I may acquit my ſelf thereof,
I ſhall begin where my laſt LETTER left me.
After the View I had taken of Mount <hi>Alverne,</hi>
I parted with my Company, who went no further,
and all alone came down the other ſide of the
<hi>Apennin;</hi> and taking my Way through the Towns
of <hi>Foſſombrône</hi> and <hi>Urbane,</hi> I came to <hi>Fane,</hi>
which is a pretty City, ſituate on the <hi>Adri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tick Sea.</hi>
Whilſt I was here, going abroad in the Morning
to look out for ſome Convenience to go to <hi>Loretto,</hi>
I ſaw a great Company of perſons very comically
Mounted, and dreſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, coming into Town. They
were Pilgrims that came from <hi>Bononia,</hi> being about
Threeſcore in number, and all of them mounted
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57009:81"/>
on <hi>Aſſes,</hi> which is a very eaſie and commodious
way of Travelling, and more in requeſt in the
Marquiſate of <hi>Ancone,</hi> than the uſe of <hi>Horſes.</hi>
The firſt place where we meet with this conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of Travelling, is at <hi>Imola,</hi> Half a days
Journy from <hi>Bononia.</hi> Formerly Travellers were
wont to hire their <hi>Aſſes</hi> at <hi>Bononia:</hi> But foraſmuch
as ſome Wits took occaſion from hence to uſe an
Alluſion, which did not over-pleaſe the Scholars
and Doctors of the Univerſity of that City; (for
it was a common Saying, <hi>We will go to</hi> Loretto, <hi>and
take an Aſs at</hi> Bononia) the Magiſtrates for their
ſakes aboliſh'd that Cuſtom; ſo that now theſe Beaſts
muſt be hired at <hi>Imola,</hi> and for the value of about
a Shilling a Man may Travel Six Miles, which is
the Stage thoſe <hi>Aſſes</hi> are wont to perform. They
are furniſh'd with Little Saddles and Stirrups, in
the manner as Horſes; but there is no need either
of a Whip or Spurs, for as ſoon as one is got
upon their Backs, they run continually with all
their might, until they be come to their Journies
end; where being arrived it is impoſſible by all
the Stroaks that can be given them, to make them
advance one ſtep further; but one is forc'd to leave
them there, and take others. Thus theſe Aſſes are
changed at every Six Miles end, till one comes to
the Mountain of <hi>Ancona<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which is not very far
from <hi>Laretto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to our <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and to give you a
further deſcription of them; they were all of them
accoutred in their Pilgrimage Habits, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
of a large Linnen-Veſt, of an Aſh-grey
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57009:81"/>
colour, reaching to the middle of the Leg, with
very wide Sleeves, coming down to the Wriſt;
on the backſide of theſe Veſts, at the Collar, they
have a kind of a large Cowl, which they put over
their Heads, and being pull'd down reacheth to
the Pit of the Stomach, ſo that their Faces are
wholly covered with them. And to the end, that
in this poſture they might have their free Sight and
Breathing, theſe Cowls have openings in them,
anſwering to the Eyes and Mouth, like Masks.
They never draw theſe Cowls over their Heads,
but when they come to places where they have no
mind to be known; for otherwiſe, they let them
hang backwards upon their Shoulders. They gird
this Veſt about them with a Girdle, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
above the Girdle upon their Breaſt, they have
a Scutcheon, repreſenting the Arms of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
Confriery, or Company, which they call in
Italian, <hi>Scuola.</hi> There be ſcarcely any <hi>Italians</hi>
that are not of one or other of theſe Societies.
Theſe <hi>Pilgrims</hi> moreover have a large Row of
<hi>Pater-noster-Beads</hi> hanging at their Girdles, and
a <hi>Pilgrims Staff</hi> in their Hands, which is the chief
mark of their Pilgrimaging. Theſe Staves are
about an Half-Pikes length, with Knots or Protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances
at the Top and middle of them. They carry
them to the Church, to get them bleſt by their
Curates, before their Setting-forth, which Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is performed with many Prayers, and the
aſſiſtance of Holy-Water: As ſoon as they have
received them, it is not lawful for them to ſtay any
longer than Three days at the place of their Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57009:82"/>
and cannot be admitted to the Communion
till they have performed their Pilgrimage, except
they be pleaſed to change the Vow they have
made into a Pecuniary Mulct; for in that caſe
they are very readily diſcharged by the Prieſts.
The <hi>Pilgrims</hi> which I ſaw, upon their arrival at
<hi>Fane,</hi> were all of them dreſt in Veſts of the ſame
Colour, and had already run one Stage on their
<hi>Aſſes.</hi> Their Veſts were all New, and of very
ſine Linnen; and foraſmuch as in all appearance,
they were not mov'd to put on that Garb from a
Penitent Spirit, they had taken care to tuck them
up high enough in ſeveral places, to make their
ſine Cloaths of Gold and Silk, they had under
them, to be ſeen; which made me alſo believe,
that probably they muſt be Perſons of Quality.
Their Girdles were of Silk, of the ſame colour with
their Veſts, and extreamly well wrought. Upon my
Enquiry, Who they were? it was told me, They
were the Company or Society of our <hi>Lady of Life</hi>
of <hi>Bononia,</hi> which is the Name of a very richly
Endow'd Hoſpital, for the Relief of poor Sick.
People, and where the Prieſts have Erected a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
or Society of Noble Perſons, who have
their daily Maſſes aud Prayers there. Upon their
entring into this Society, they oblige themſelves
to aſſiſt the Poor of that place, with their Eſtates
and beſt Endeavours. The greateſt part of the
Gentlemen of <hi>Bononia</hi> are of this Society; they
go every year by way of Proceſſion to <hi>Loretto,</hi>
towards the end of Autumn, when Vintage is paſt;
which is likewiſe obſerv'd by moſt other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57009:82"/>
As ſoon as they were come near to the
Great Church, the Prieſts came out to meet them,
with the <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Banner,</hi> by way of Reception
and bidding of them Welcom, and made a ſhort
Speech to them; to which the Prior of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
being a <hi>Bononian</hi> Earl, return'd an Anſwer
in few words. After this, they entred into the
Church, where they made ſome ſhort Prayers, and
then diſpers'd themſelves throughout the beſt Inns
of the City, whither Orders had been ſent over-Night,
to provide a good Dinner. It was about
Ten of the Clock in the Morning when theſe <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi>
arrived, and near half an Hour after, they
were follow'd by about ſome Twenty <hi>Caleches,</hi> full
of Ladies. Theſe were <hi>She-Pilgrims,</hi> who had
left <hi>Bononia</hi> upon the ſame deſign; and who were
all of them, either Kinſwomen or Miſtreſſes of the
foreſaid <hi>Pilgrim-Gentlemen.</hi> They were all of
them moſt ſumptuoſly Attired, and with an Air
of Wantonneſs and Gaiety, that very ill became
perſons who went a Pilgrimaging out of Devotion
They had Little <hi>Pilgrims-Staves,</hi> faſtned to the
Bodies of their Gowns; ſome of them were of
<hi>Gold,</hi> others of <hi>Ivory</hi> all beſet with coſtly <hi>Pearls</hi>
and <hi>Diamonds;</hi> ſome had them made up of Orange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers,
or of thoſe Artificial-flowers which are in
ſo great eſteem at <hi>Bononia,</hi> and which make the
greateſt part of the Traffick of the Nuns of that
City. Others again had them all wrought of
Needle-work, to that height of Curioſity, that one
of them might probably have been the Work of
many Years: And laſtly, Others had them of other
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57009:83"/>
precious and coſtly Matter. The <hi>Pilgrims</hi> had no
ſooner taken poſſeſſion of their Inns, and given
Order to have all things in a readineſs, but they
went forth to meet their Ladies; and having bid
them Welcom, they conducted them with a great
deal of Honour and Ceremony into the Apartment
prepared for them. My Curioſity to obſerve theſe
Proceedings, prompted me to Return to mine Inn;
where I had already taken notice of the great
Preparations that were making for them: And
finding that the Gentlemen wanted a Chamber
more to accomodate them, I offered them mine;
and in Recompence thereof they very civilly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
me to Dine with them. The Table was
cover'd with many Diſhes, and all Dinner-time their
Diſcourſe was nothing but a continual Raillery
upon their Ladies <hi>Pilgrim-Staves:</hi> It was not any
hitting or pinching Raillery, but ſuch as conſiſted
only of ſome pat Alluſions, full of Wit, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ambiguous Words, which theſe <hi>Italians</hi> knew
to be for the Tooth of their Ladies. As ſoon as
Dinner was done, every one of them put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in order to proſecute their Journy. The <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi>
mounted on their <hi>Aſſes,</hi> and the Ladies into
their <hi>Caleches.</hi> As for my part, I joyn'd my ſelf
with a very honeſt Man, born at <hi>Parma,</hi> who did
not go on Pilgrimage, but Travell'd out of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
We follow'd this Troop of <hi>Pilgrims</hi> at a
ſmall diſtance, being Mounted in the ſame manner
as they, tho' we could not joyn our ſelves in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with them, becauſe we had no <hi>Pilgrims</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.
I demanded of the <hi>Italian,</hi> Why thoſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57009:83"/>
Gentlemen, who were all Perſons of Quality, and
who probably had their Coach and Horſes at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi>
did make uſe of theſe Aſſes in their Journy.
He told me, That ſome made uſe of them out of
a Frolick, and to make themſelves Mirth on the
Road; others, by way of Humility, and to obtain
more Merit: And moreover, that theſe <hi>Aſſes</hi> by
carrying ſo many Devout perſons to <hi>Loretto,</hi> had
by that means obtain'd a very particular kind of
Bleſſing; which was, That never any Miſchance
hapned to thoſe that rid on them; for if by chance
any did fall from them, or were caſt by them into
any Slough, they always eſcap'd very happily,
without receiving any hurt. By this Diſcourſe I
began to perceive, that this honeſt Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
theſe <hi>Aſſes</hi> alſo to be Miraculous. He told
me, That ſome <hi>Algier</hi>-Pirates having lately made
a deſcent in the Marquiſate of <hi>Ancona,</hi> could not
with all their Endeavours overtake a Company of
Travellers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that were Mounted on theſe Holy
<hi>Aſſes,</hi> tho' they purſued them very cloſe, and that
having Fired very thick at them, they neither kill'd
nor wounded any one of the Company. As we
Rid on thus Diſcourſing together, we ever anon
caſt an Eye towards our <hi>Pilgrims</hi> that were before
us, and found, they made it their only buſineſs on
the Road, to divert the Ladies that Rid in the
<hi>Caleches:</hi> Some of them Croſſing the Way before
them, ſtrove to put themſelves into Comical and
Ridiculous poſtures, to make them Laugh; others
fell from their <hi>Aſſes</hi> on purpoſe; and in a word,
as the <hi>Italians</hi> have a very pleaſant and ready Wit,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57009:84"/>
their Behaviour all along the Road was nothing
but Mirth and Comedies. The Ladies without
doubt, were not wanting to beſtow a Thouſand
Bleſſings on the Day and Moment, wherein they
were ſo happy to make a Vow to go to <hi>Loretto,</hi>
foraſmuch as probably they had never in all their
Lives been better diverted. Every Body knows
the Humor of the <hi>Italians,</hi> That no ſooner have
they Married a Wife, but they make her a Slave.
However, their Jealouſie hath never yet been able
to hinder them from going to the Church on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
and Holy-days, or to the places of Pilgrimage,
when they have made a Vow to that purpoſe.
The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have declar'd it a Mortal
Sin, not to go to Maſs on thoſe days, or not to
accompliſh the Pilgrimage one has Vowed, and
hath depriv'd Husbands of the Power to hinder
their Wives from performing theſe neceſſary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
If any Husband ſhould go about to oppoſe
his Wife in theſe particulars, the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> would
take notice of it, and proceed againſt him, as
againſt a perſon who does not approve of going
to Maſs or Pilgrimages, and conſequently is an
Heretick. The Ladies, you may aſſure you,
are not wanting to make good uſe of this their
Priviledge; or to have recourſe, whenever they
think fit, to this laſt Plank of their Shipwreck.
Liberty; <hi>Ultima Naufragae Libertatis Tabula.</hi>
Scarcely ever ſhall you ſee a Lady going to theſe
kind of Devotions, but ſhe has ſome very Devout
Lover following her; and one might judge with
half an Eye, from the Air of theſe He and She
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57009:84"/>
                  <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> I am now upon, what was the principal
Motive that ſwayed them to undertake the Journy.
About Four of the Clock in the Afternoon they
ſtopt at a Village to Refreſh themſelves; which
done, the Gentlemen Rid on before to the next
Town, to Complement the next Church before the
Ladies coming, as they had done in the Morning
at <hi>Fane.</hi> After which, they retir'd with their Ladies
to the beſt Inns of the Town, where they were
not wanting to make good Cheer, and divert
themſelves; and in the foreſaid manner continued
the reſt of their Journy, till they came to <hi>Loretto.</hi>
I'll be judg'd by you, Sir, whether this be not a
very Devout-way of Pilgrimaging, ſufficient to
confound and abaſh the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who reject
them, and content themſelves to call upon their
Father that is in Heaven, without putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the trouble of going to ſeek him either
at <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Loretto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We met with, beſides theſe <hi>Pilgrims</hi> already
mentioned, whom we followed very cloſe, ſeveral
other Bands of them, conſiſting of Merchants and
Tradeſinen, ſome of them going to <hi>Loretto,</hi> and
others returning thence, all of them making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Sport with their <hi>Pilgrims-Staves,</hi> and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Habits upon the Road; and in all the Inns
they came to, treating themſelves with the beſt
that could be had. I have ſince underſtood, that
all Tradeſmen in <hi>Italy</hi> do each of them keep a
Saving-Box, into which they put what Mony they
can ſpare during the whole Year, in order to their
going in Pilgrimage, either to <hi>Loretto,</hi> or to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57009:85"/>
S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> or to ſome other place, at a
further or nearer diſtance, according as they gueſs
that the Mony they have gathered will hold out,
to deſray their Charges going and coming, and
every where making much of themſelves. And, to
ſpeak the Truth, there is nothing more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in <hi>Italy,</hi> than theſe kind of Journies in the
beginning of the Spring, or towards the end of
Autumn, after the great Heat is paſt; eſpecially
when one is in good Company, where there is
never wanting ſome or other, that hath the Gift
of making others Laugh. The <hi>Italian</hi> Females
eſpecially, make uſe of a Thouſand Intrigues and
Inventions, to oblige their Parents or their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
to let them go a Pilgrimaging: There is
no Vow they make more readily. Above all things,
they make great uſe of the Authority of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
to acquaint them, That it is the Will of
God that they ſhould go thither, according to their
Vow. In the mean time, the whole Journy is
ſpent in Fooleries, as I have now hinted; and
the merry Adventures they meet with in them,
furniſh them all the Winter at the Fires-Side, with
pleaſant Stories to divert the Company.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you ſome account of the
<hi>Italian</hi> He and She <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> according to my
Promiſe, which I joyn'd with thoſe that frequent
the Hoſpitals, whoſe Deſcription you have ſeen in
my laſt LETTER, comprehends the whole Set
of <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> from the Richeſt to the Pooreſt.
'Tis to no purpoſe here for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to tell us,
That theſe are only particular Inſtances, which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57009:85"/>
cannot be of any force againſt the Foundation of
their Doctrin; for this Holineſs of Pilgrimages in
general, is no more to be met with, than an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<hi>à Parte rei.</hi> A man indeed may imagine to
himſelf an Univerſal human Nature, yet will he
never be able to find Human Nature, but in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
or Individuals. Beſides, if <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> were
endued with efficacy, to make men Holy, without
doubt we ſhould find many <hi>Pilgrims</hi> ſo qualified;
and the acknowledg'd Truth of the Old Proverb
would be overthrown, which ſaith, <hi>That never did
a good Horſe, or Wicked Man, become better by
going to</hi> Rome. If S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> S. <hi>Paula,</hi> and many
others, went to Viſit the Holy places of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi>
yet it was not this that Sanctified them, or made
them Saints; and without doubt, they might have
done as well to have ſtaid at home. I ſpeak not
this, as if I had a mind to blame them for ſo
doing, no more than I would reprove an honeſt
Man, who out of Curioſity, (yet ſo as not to
neglect his Buſineſs, and without injuring any one)
ſhould take a Journy to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or to <hi>Rome.</hi>
It is even Natural for Men to have ſome reſpect
and veneration for Great Travellers; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but own it, to be a worthy Curioſity to go to
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſee all the Holy places where
Jeſus Chriſt has wrought our Redemption; but
with Reference to our Eternal Salvation, I look
upon it as very unprofitable thing, and I ſhall
never believe that any one is the greater Saint
for having been there: Jeſus Chriſt has not fix'd
our Salvation to any particular places of the World,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57009:86"/>
more than to others; and will never ſuffer, that
thoſe Novel Additions men have been ſo bold as
to joyn to the Goſpel, to accompliſh their Corrupt
Ends, ſhould ſerve as efficacious Means for their
Sanctification. I have converſed with a vaſt number
of perſons that have gone a <hi>Pilgrimaging,</hi> but
never could diſcern any the leaſt Amendment in
their Lives; but on the contrary, I have ſeen many
who have ſeem'd to me, to be much worſe than
they were before. They counſell'd me in <hi>Italy,</hi>
to do as a certain <hi>Genoueſe</hi> did, who was wont
frequently to ask his Butcher, When he would go
to <hi>Loretto?</hi> The Butcher wondring at this his oft
repeated Queſtion, demanded of him one Day,
What might be the Reaſon, why he ſo often asked
him the ſame Queſtion? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Genoueſe)
I have of a long time obſerv'd, that upon your
Return from your Pilgrimage, you never give me
my full Weight; and for this Reaſon, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd,
at your next Return, not to make uſe of you
for five or ſix Months.</hi> And indeed, he had Reaſon
to make uſe of this Caution; for commonly in
theſe Journies they ſpend at a moſt Extravagant
rate, and afterwards, to reimburſe themſelves, they
make no ſcruple, to make uſe of Thieviſh and
Indirect Means. Moreover, as I have already
intimated in my Third LETTER, there be
very few that undertake theſe kind of Journies
from a true Spirit of Devotion; but either out of
Curioſity, or for their own Recreation; or other
ſuch like Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:57009:86"/>
But, foraſmnch as I do not pretend to judge of
the inward Intention of any one by any thing
that is outward, I will at preſent be ſo favourable
as to ſuppoſe, That all theſe <hi>Pilgrims</hi> go to their
ſeveral places with the higheſt Sentiments of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
but yet for all this, I ſay, they are not
excuſable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> God, notwithſtanding their good
Intention, tho' we may pity them for being ſo
fouly miſtaken, as to give the Worſhip which is
due to God alone, to a Creature. <hi>O quam bond
voluntate meſeri ſunt!</hi> This is all the Favour we
can do them: For we can by no means juſtifie
thoſe Adorations they render to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi>
and <hi>Saints;</hi> yea, to the Houſes where they have
Liv'd, and the Inſtruments of their Martyrdom.
But foraſmuch as this Point relates to Divinity, and
my deſign is not to write to you as a Divine, but
only as a Traveller, I ſhall leave it at preſent, and
continue my Diſcourſe about my Journy to <hi>Loretto.</hi>
I arrived there towards the end of <hi>October.</hi> This
Town is ſituate in the midſt of a very fertile and
pleaſant Plain, two or three Miles from the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
Sea. In former Times there were no Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
here, beſides the Chappel; but in proceſs of
Time they built many Houſes about it; and the
Popes, to whom all this Country belongs, have
order'd a Wall with Baſtions to be built round
it: So that at preſent it is a conſiderable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
to ſecure the Eccleſiaſtical State on that ſide,
and more particularly againſt the Landing of
<hi>Turks</hi> and other Corſairs, who formerly did uſe
very frequently to come and Ravage that part
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57009:87"/>
of the Country. This Chappel is by the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
called, <hi>LA SANTA CASA,</hi> that is
to ſay, <hi>The Holy Houſe.</hi> The Roman Catholicks
believe this to be the very ſame Houſe, wherein
Jeſus Chriſt dwelt at <hi>Nazareth</hi> with the Bleſſed
Virgin his Mother, and his Reputed Father S. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi>
for the ſpace of Thirty years, until the time
that he began to Preach his Holy Doctrin, and to
confirm it by his Divine Vertue and Miracles. They
pretend it was Tranſported by Angels from <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi>
where it ſtood at firſt, to the place where it is
at preſent. The Hiſtory they give us of it runs thus;
The <hi>Saracenes</hi> having made themſelves Maſters of
<hi>Paleſtina,</hi> and the Holy places, the Bleſſed Virgin
unwilling to leave ſo great a Treaſure, (as was the
Houſe wherein ſhe had dwelt with her Son Jeſus
Chriſt upon the Earth,) in the Hands of Infidels,
Commanded the Angels to Tranſport it into the
Chriſtian Territories: The Angels in Obedience to
her Command took it up, Foundations and all,
and carried it by night into <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
taking notice of their miſtake, and perceiving
that the People there, were nothing nigh ſo good
as the <hi>Italians,</hi> they took it up again, and another
Night, carried it near to the City <hi>Recanati</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
placing it in a Field, that belonged to two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
where it continued many years, until the
Brothers began to quarrel about dividing the Alms
that were given there; wherefore the Virgin to
puniſh them Commands the Angels to take it up a
third time, and to carry it to the Field of a poor
Widow-Woman called <hi>Lorette,</hi> who was a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57009:87"/>
Worſhipper of her. This good Woman ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in the Morning, and finding a little Houſe,
where there was not the leaſt ſign of any the
Night before, was as much ſurprized as the Brothers
were, to ſee it fled from their Field. In this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
She writes to the Pope what had hapned, who
already was by Revelation made acquainted with
the whole Matter, and immediately beſtowed vaſt
Indulgences upon all thoſe who ſhould go to pay
their bounden Duty to that Holy Houſe. The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Popes have ſince confirmed all this, and have
granted an infinite number of other Pardons:
This place in proceſs of time, by great good luck
for them, is become an inexhauſtible Fountain of
Riches, and ſtill to this day brings them in Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sums of Mony every year. What think you,
Is not this a very Pleaſant Story, and is not the bare
Relation ſufficient to render it contemptible? The
good Angels that carried this Holy Houſe the firſt
time into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> ſure were very ſtupid, and did
not mind what they did. Moreover if the Bleſſed
Virgin was pleaſed to take it away from the two
Brothers of <hi>Becanati,</hi> becauſe they were at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
about it; I wonder how ſhe has the Patience
to leave it at preſent, amongſt a company of Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals
and Robbers, that have Neſted themſelves there,
and who for the moſt part of them are all Sellers of
<hi>Paternoſter</hi>-Beads and Medals; for all that everwere
at <hi>Loretto</hi> know, and are warned before they enter
the Town, that in caſe they deſire to perform their
Devotions there without having their Purſes pickt,
they muſt hold their Beads in one Hand, and their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57009:88"/>
Purſe in the other. I proceed now to the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Chappel, or the <hi>Santa Caſa.</hi> The whole
Building is of Brick, about Twentyfive Foot long,
the length being not proportionable to the breadth
of it: The Wood with which it was Cieled, being
Conſum'd and Rotten by Age, it has ſince been
Vaulted with Brick. It hath two Windows, and
two Doors on the Two ſides of it, and another
Window beneath, by which they ſay the Angel
<hi>Gabriel</hi> entred, to Annunciate to the Bleſſed Virgin
the Myſtery of the Incarnation. They have erected
an Altar, in the very place where they ſay the
Virgin was upon her Knees, when the Angel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;
and upon the Altar is an Image of the Virgin,
of Wood, about Four Foot and an half high, which
is the Miraculous Statue on which they beſtow
their Adorations. She has Changes of Cloaths for all
Worky-days, and for all Holy-days and Sundays;
ſhe has them of all ſort of Colours, and Mourning
Cloaths, for the Paſſion week. They ſhift or change
her Cloaths with abundance of Ceremonies. I was
there one Saturday in the Evening, when the Prieſts
undreſſed her; they took away from her the Suit
of Purple ſhe had on, in order to dreſs her in a
Green Gown, which they performed in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner; They firſt of all took off her Veil,
then her great Robe or Mantle Royal; afterwards
her Gown, and her Upper and Under Petticoats,
and laſt of all, with a great deal of Reverence they
pull'd off her Smock, to put her on a clean one. I
leave to you, Sir, to gueſs what thoughts this may
probably impreſs on the Imagination, as well of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57009:88"/>
thoſe who perform the Ceremony, as of thoſe who
are the Aſſiſtants and Spectators. True it is that the
Statue is not made Naked; the Workman it ſeems
that wrought it, having been more modeſt than ſo, and
repreſented her as Cloth'd: But this action of clothing
and unclothing the Figure of a Woman, is a thing that
offends the Minds of thoſe that are never ſo little
Chaſte or Modeſt. I acknowledge indeed that they
perform this Ceremony with a great deal of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Reſpect, if it may not more properly be called
Idolatry; for they kiſs every part of the Apparel
they take off from her, bending their Knees to the
Ground before the Statue, and Adoring it. The
People that are preſent upon their Knees, all the
time the Ceremony is performing, Beat their Breaſts,
and nothing is heard throughout the Chappel, but
Sighings and Groans, with interrupted Words and
Ejaculations; <hi>Holy Virgin of</hi> Loretto <hi>help me!
Mother of God hear me!</hi> and other ſuch like As
ſoon as the Image is quite Naked or Undreſt, theſe
Sighs and Groans are doubled, but decreaſe again
by degrees, as they dreſs it. I cannot imagin what
ſhould be the cauſe of this change of their Tone,
except it ſhould be this, that when the Statue is
quite undreſt, it more ſtrongly affects their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and makes them believe they ſee the very
Virgin in Perſon, and that this therefore is the nick
of time, for them to Pray with the greateſt fervour of
Devotion. They dreſſed her in a Green Suit of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
extreamly rich, being a Flower-work upon a
ground of Gold. The Veil they put upon her
Head was yet more coſtly; for beſides that it was of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57009:89"/>
the ſame Cloth of Gold, it was all Powder'd with
great fine Pearls: After this they put upon her Head a
Crown of Gold, thick beſet with Precious Stones of an
ineſtimable price: Next they put on her Neck-Jewel,
her Pendants and her Bracelets of Diamonds, and
many great Chains of Gold about her Neck, to
which were faſtned abundance of Hearts and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
of Gold, which are the Preſents that Queens
and Catholick Princeſſes have beſtowed on the
Image out of Devotion, in Teſtimony that they
were reſolved to be its Slaves. The whole Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Furniture of the Altar was equally Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Magnificent, nothing being to be ſeen but
great Pots or Veſſels, Baſins, Lamps and Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
all of Gold and Silver, and beſet with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones; all which by the light of a vaſt
quantity of Wax Candles that burn there Day and
Night, afforded a luſtre whoſe Beauty Raviſh'd the
Soul through the Eyes. It is no wonder to me
that many do aver themſelves to be ſenſible of an
extraordinary Devotion in this place: For beſides
that one cannot enter there without thinking of God,
becauſe one's Imagination is already foreſtall'd with the
thought, That it is the Chamber where the Eternal
Word became Incarnate; it is certain that it is the
property of all Bright and Luſtrous Creatures, to
raiſe our Hearts to the Creator, more than dark and
common ones uſe to do; and eſpecially when their
Splendor is ſeconded with Novelty. When we lift
up our Eyes to the Firmament in a clear night
when the Sky is full of Stars, this ſight powerfully
raiſes our Souls to God, and makes us ſay, <hi>Quam
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57009:89"/>
Augusta eſt Domus Dei! How Glorious is the Houſe
of God!</hi> In like manner thoſe Perſons, who are not
wont to ſee ſo many Lights, ſo much Gold, Silver
and Precious Stones, which Mutually exalt each
others Glory, as ſoon as they enter this Chappel of
<hi>Loretto,</hi> where they meet with all theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
cannot but naturally be moved with thoughts
of Devotion. Naturaliſts obſerve that Precious
Stones are for the moſt part extreamly friendly and
ſympathiſing with the Heart of Man, and that they
Recreate and make it light and Merry by a ſecret
Sympathy they have with the Vital Spirits; now
there being an almoſt infinite number of all ſorts of
theſe Precious Stones in this Chappel, who can
doubt but that they muſt make a Correſponding
great Impreſſion on the Hearts of the Raviſht Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors?
This natural effect being by ſome Simple
and Ignorant People ſuppoſed to be a particular Grace
of God appropriated to that place, makes them take
it for no leſs than a continual Miracle: but the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies
continually committed here are a ſufficient
Argument againſt this weak and ungrounded Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
They kiſs the Walls all round about the
Chappel, they lick the Bricks with their Tongues,
they rub their Beads againſt them, they take Thread,
and having compaſſed the Chappel with it, as if they
pretended to take the Meaſure or Compaſs of it, they
afterwards make a Girdle of it, which they ſay is very
Efficacious againſt Witchcraft, and all manner of
Ills. The Prieſts in the mean time are not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of their Gain; they have perſons placed every
where in the Chappel and great Church, who preſs
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57009:90"/>
the People to give Alms, and to have Maſſes ſaid for
them, to our Lady. They pay a Crown apiece
for every Maſs, and the Prieſts promiſe to ſay them
all at our Ladies Altar, that is in the Chappel.
Tis certain that the Prieſts receive Mony for the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of above 50000 Maſſes every year; and yet it
is as ſure that it is impoſſible for them to ſay above
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0000 in a year at that Altar; ſo that all the reſt
who have given their Mony for that purpoſe, muſt
needs be fruſtrated of their intentions and chouſed
of their Mony. Thoſe that are Rich and Wealthy
beſtow great Preſents upon the Wooden Statue of
the Virgin that is in the Chappel, which without any
Addition or Modification, they call <hi>the Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
of</hi> Loretto; They preſent her with Necklaces,
and Bracelets of Pearls and Diamonds, Hearts of
Gold, Medals, Candleſticks, Lamps Emboſt,
Pictures of Gold and Silver of a Prodigious Weight
and Bigneſs. Many preſent her with Rings, and
moſt Precious Jewels, as a Token of their eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her; ſhe hath above Fifty Gowns, all of
them of an Ineſtimable Price; inſomuch as ſhe is
at this day the Richeſt Pupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t that is in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
and the piece of Wood the moſt Sumptuouſly
dreſt, that is to be found in the whole World.
Tis to this Image that thoſe famous Litanies which
are ſo much in vogue with the Church of <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
have been addreſſed, which are commonly called
<hi>the Litanies of the Virgin,</hi> or <hi>the Litanies of our
Lady of</hi> Loretto, wherein ſhe is termed <hi>the Queen
of Angels; Mother of Divine Grace; the Gate of
Heaven; the help of Chriſtians; the Refuge of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57009:90"/>
&amp;c.</hi> However, neither all theſe coſtly Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or Glorious Titles have been powerful
enough to divert the Worms from exerting their
Activity upon this ſo highly Adorned and Adored
Statue; for I obſerved as they were a changing
its Cloathes, that the Wood was all Rotten and
full of Wormholes. Thus we ſee that this piece of
Wood, which is ſuppoſed to hear the Prayers of
ſo many Idolaters, carries its own Condemnation
with it, in that it is not able to reſcue it ſelf from
Corruption. The Popes who draw more Gold
and Silver from this place, than from any other in
the World, have accordingly favoured it with the
greateſt Stock of Indulgences. They have granted to
this Chappel all the Priviledges appertaining to
their S. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Grand Penitentiaries
and Confeſſors, which are all Jeſuits, do here ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
all ſorts of Caſes, even of thoſe the Popes
have reſerved for themſelves: For ſeeing it is a
place in the Popes own Territories, 'tis very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to them, whether they be abſolved there
or at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe their profit is the ſame: But I
queſtion not, ſhould the Angels think ſit once more
to take the pains to Tranſport this Chappel into
the Eſtate of ſome ſtrange Prince, they would
ſoon Revoke and Cancel all their Pardons, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as then the caſe would be altered. They are
very careful to preſerve this Chappel whole and
entire; to this end they have darted all the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts
of the <hi>Vatican</hi> againſt thoſe who ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
take to looſen the leaſt Stone of it, or ſo much
as to ſcrape the Walls; it is lawful to lick them,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57009:91"/>
but not to bite the leaſt particle off from them.
The reaſon of this is, becauſe according to the
Principles of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Part is taken for the Whole:
Thus if they have but a Finger, or ſome other
ſmall part of a Saints Body, tis the ſame thing as
if they had it all entire: Whence it follows, that if
any one could get but a little piece of Brick of the
<hi>Santa Caſa,</hi> he might go and Build a Chappel in
a ſtrange Country, and having encloſed the Bit
of Brick, make the place as conſiderable, as this
of <hi>Loretto,</hi> and by this means ſpare ſo many People
the labour of going ſo far in Pilgrimage. By this
you may conceive how great a damage this would
be to the Popes, and how much it is their intereſt
to affix, as they do in all places within and without
the Chappel, and the great Church which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth
it about, the <hi>Anathemas</hi> and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they have pronounced againſt thoſe, who
ſhould be ſo unadviſed as to take away the leaſt
particle thereof. However being miſtruſtful of
the Efficacy of their Thunderbolts in this caſe,
and not believing them ſufficient to ſecure this their
vaſt Treaſure; they have had recourſe to ſubtilty
and cunning, and have falſly publiſhed that God
hath puniſhed many perſons with ſudden Death,
who had been ſo bold to take away ſome of the
Bricks thereof; that others have been deprived of
Motion, until they had Vowed to reſtore what
they had ſo Sacrilegiouſly Stolen; and laſtly, that
Angels had come and Snatched the Bricks out of
the Hands of thoſe, that had Stolen them, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to fix them where they were before. Amongſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57009:91"/>
the reſt they ſhew us two Bricks, which are faſtned
to one of the Walls of the Chappel, with two
pieces of Iron, to diſtinguiſh them from the reſt;
the one of which a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentleman had carried away
with the deſign of having a like Chappel to that
of <hi>Loretto,</hi> built in his own Country: They tell
us that by an Inviſible force he was ſtopt in his
Journy, and deprived of all Motion, and by this
means was forced to ſend back the Brick he robb'd,
to <hi>Loretto,</hi> which he had no ſooner done, but his
Immobility being taken away, he was in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to continue his Journy. The other was taken
by a Spaniſh Lord, with the ſame intent, who
being on his Journy home-ward, the Angels
purſu'd him, and after having Bang'd him hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly,
took away the Brick from him, and carried
it to <hi>Loretto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Miracles, (and many others of the ſame

printed and affixed in ſeveral places of the Church,
that Strangers may Read them, and beware. For
my part, Sir, I can aſſure you, that all theſe are
no better than great ſtaring Lies, forged and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the Popes, whereby they craftily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to perſwade their <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> That
they have the <hi>Santa Caſa</hi> whole and entire, and
that there is not the leaſt Scrap of it in any other
part of the Habitable World. That which makes
me aſſert this with ſo much confidence, is, That I
my ſelf, who Write to you, did looſen a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
piece of this Wall of <hi>Lorette,</hi> and carried it
away with me, without being Bang'd by the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57009:92"/>
Angels, or made immovable by ſome Inviſible
Power: And if the Guardians of the Chappel
have not taken care, to ſtop up the Hole again, I
am ſure it may be there ſeen ſtill to this day.</p>
               <p>They begin to Say their Maſſes every day at
the <hi>Virgins Altar</hi> by Two of the Clock in the
Morning, and I repair'd thither about Three, and
finding but a very few Perſons in the Chappel, I
kept in the Entry, where I could not be taken
notice of by any, the People being all before
me, and none on either ſide of me, or behind me;
at which time, with an Iron-Inſtrument I had, I
broke off a piece of the Wall, and carried it away
with me; ſince which I have Travell'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all <hi>Italy;</hi> I have been in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>Germany</hi>
neither hath any the leaſt ill Accident befallen me:
Until at laſt being weary of carrying this Stone ſo
long in my Pocket, and looking upon it as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Burthen, I caſt it away in the Fields by
way of Contempt, and out of a kind of Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in that it had received ſuch Adorations as are
due to God alone. I muſt own, that about Two
days Journy from <hi>Loretto,</hi> near <hi>Tolentin,</hi> in my
Way to <hi>Rome,</hi> there hapned to fall a very great
Rain for Two days together, whereby the Brooks
ſwell'd to that degree, that they drown'd a great
part of the Country; and paſſing over an Old-Bridge,
one of the Arches ſhaken with the Tread
of my Horſe, fell down with an horrid Noiſe into
the Water at two Steps from me, upon which
ſwiftly Turning my Horſe, I got over the other
Half of the Bridge behind me as faſt as I could,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57009:92"/>
and at the ſame Moment the Brick I had taken at
<hi>Loretto</hi> came to my mind: I deliberated with my
ſelf, whether I ought to go back and return it to
the place again; but taking Reaſon rather than
the preſent Accident to be my Counſellor, I made
theſe following Reflections.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I conſider'd, That if indeed God were ſo
Jealous of preſerving that Chappel whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
in every part of it, he would never have
ſuffer'd the Ceiling thereof, which was a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part thereof, to Rot and Fall-down; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
which Defect, (as I hinted before) they have
Arch'd it over. In the ſecond place, I conſider'd
with my ſelf, That the <hi>Manger</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and
the <hi>Holy Sepulchre,</hi> were not inferiour in Dignity
to this Little Houſe of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
God had been pleaſed to leave them in the
Hands of Infidels; and that conſequently the Story
told concerning the Tranſportation of the <hi>Santa
Caſa,</hi> and the Motives of it, could be no better
than a Fable. And laſtly, as I my ſelf had been
an Eye-witneſs of ſo many Cheats and Lies, which
the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> invent to increaſe their Gains,
this ſerv'd for a convincing Argument to me, Not
to give the leaſt Credit to all theſe pretended
Miracles, which are only invented either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Chappel of <hi>Loretto</hi> in the Popes Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories;
or at leaſt to diſpoſe the Minds of the
People, that in caſe upon occaſion of War, any
ſtrange Prince ſhould cauſe the ſame to be carried
to his own Country, they might notwithſtanding
believe, that the Angels had brought it back again
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57009:93"/>
to its former place; and conſequently might boldly
deny, that this ſuppoſed Prince had the True
<hi>Santa Caſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this made me conclude, There was nothing
extraordinary in the Fall of this Bridge, as hapning
by reaſon of the Age and Weakneſs of the Bridge,
or becauſe the violent Torrent of the Waters had
undermin'd its Foundation. Being thus ſatisfied,
I went to ſeek another place for to paſs the Water,
and ſo continued my Voyage, Thanks be to God,
very happily. Had I gone back to reſtore the
Stone, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to be ſure would not have been
wanting to cry out, <hi>A Miracle, a Miracle!</hi> and to
publiſh the ſame every where; a Picture would
preſently have been drawn of this Accident, which
they would have added to the great Number of
that kind, which are faſtned to the Walls of the
Church, and the piece of Brick would have been
diſtinguiſh'd with a piece of Iron, to be taken notice
of by Pilgrims and Strangers, as an Evidence of the
ſaid Miracle: Whereas Experience and Time have
ſince fully convinced me, That God never concern'd
himſelf in the caſe, and that the Fall of the Bridge
was meerly Caſual. Before I take my leave of
<hi>Loretto,</hi> I will tell you in general, That the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
preſerv'd there is altogether ineſtimable. A
Pope being informed, That ſome had acquainted
the <hi>Turks</hi> thereof, and that they were projecting
to make a Deſcent there, cauſed the Town to be
Fortified with ſtrong Walls and Baſtions, where he
planted abundance of Great Guns; He appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
it ſeems, that the <hi>Angels</hi> would not be ſo
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57009:93"/>
zealous, to preſerve the Treaſure that is there kept,
as they had been to ſecure the Bricks of the <hi>Santa
Caſa.</hi> And to ſpeak the Truth, the Caſe is very
different; for it is an eaſie matter to reſtore the
Bricks, where any are wanting, and then declare,
That the <hi>Angels</hi> have return'd them to their places;
but ſhould the <hi>Turks</hi> come once to take away
the precious Stones of that ineſtimable Treaſury,
'tis to be fear'd they would be to ſeek for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
to reſtore them. The <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are very
vigilant of getting into poſſeſſion of the beſt and
moſt advantagious Poſts, have obtain'd all the
Confeſſors places of this Church, and at certain
Hours of the day they repair thither for to hear
Confeſſions in all ſorts of Languages. They have
a very peculiar and wonderful dexterouſneſs to
ſqueez Mony from Strangers; they beg ſome of
all thoſe that come to Confeſs to them, on pretence
of aſſiſting poor <hi>Pilgrims</hi> therewith; but indeed
keep all they get for themſelves, except only ſome
few Pence they give them now and then, making
uſe to this purpoſe of their mental Reſtriction, as a
<hi>Jeſuit</hi> (who had quitted their Society) told me:
for ſeeing they have made a Vow of Perſonal
Poverty, that is, of never poſſeſſing any thing in
particular, but all in common; they pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be the firſt and chiefeſt Poor, and <hi>Pilgrims</hi>
too, foraſmuch as every Man is a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> upon
Earth. Thus they beſtow the Alms given them
upon themſelves, and believe, that by this means
they abundantly anſwer the intention of thoſe,
who have truſted them with the Diſtribution of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57009:94"/>
them. A poor Prieſt of <hi>Savoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> who was reduc'd
to a very pitiful Condition, coming to me to beg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an
Alms, I ſent him to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who I knew
had that Morning received Threeſcore Crowns of
a Rich Man, with whom I had ſpoke my ſelf.
The <hi>Jeſuit</hi> told him, he was very ſorry he was not
in a condition to aſſiſt him, for that of a long time
he had not been entruſted with any Charities, and
ſo ſent him away without giving him any thing.
Which way ſoever a man turns himſelf in this
Holy City of <hi>Loretto,</hi> he meets with perſons that
Beg Mony of him: The Prieſts ask it, to ſay
Maſſes for you; The <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> to give Alms to the
Poor, as I have told you; an infinite number of
Box-Carryers, that gather in Mony for the uſe of
the Chappel, are continually a Dunning you, as
well in the Streets as the Church, to put ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
into them. The Shopkeepers of the Town,
who are all of them Sellers of Bead-Rows and
Medals, deaffen your Ears on every ſide, to come
and buy their Trumperies; a vaſt number of Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds,
in the Habit of Pilgrims, flock about you
to beg the <hi>Paſſada,</hi> and cut your Purſe if they
can: An laſtly, The Vintners and Inn-keepers
ſell their Proviſions at a moſt exorbitant Price;
alledging for their Excuſe, That the Pope lays
ſuch vaſt Impoſts upon every thing that enters
<hi>Loretto,</hi> that it is impoſſible any otherwiſe to ſave
themſelves harmleſs; inſomuch as all being well
weighed, the Pope proves to be the greateſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actor
of all. And is not this now, think you, a
place ſufficiently qualified with Holineſs, to make
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57009:94"/>
it the Darling City of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin?</hi> And
are not theſe well-choſen People, for whom
God ſhould work ſo many Miracles, to keep them
in the ſecure poſſeſſion of this Houſe, which the
Papiſts pretend, to be the very ſame wherein the
<hi>Eternal Word</hi> became Incarnate? All the Walls
of the Great Church are full hung with a vaſt
number of Little Pictures, in which are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the Miracles the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> hath wrought
in favour of thoſe who have Vowed to go thither in
<hi>Pilgrimage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall take occaſion here, to acquaint you in
what manner Miracles are ſtill wrought every day
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and what they are. I have obſerved
Three chief Cauſes of them; The firſt is, the
<hi>Covetouſneſs of the Clergy;</hi> the ſecond is, the
<hi>Cunning of ſome Beggars;</hi> and the third is,
<hi>Popular Error,</hi> joyn'd with a Cuſtom the Prieſts
have introduc'd of ſending <hi>Pictures to the Churches,</hi>
repreſenting the Dangers that any have eſcaped.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, which is the <hi>Avarice</hi>
of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Religious,</hi> which are the two
Orders that divide the whole Clergy, there can be
no better Invention to ſatisfie the ſame (next to
<hi>Purgatory)</hi> than this of publiſhing from time to
time ſome Miracles, they pretend to have been
wrought in their Churches. I ſay, next to <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
which indeed is to them an overflowing
Source of Riches, becauſe the thing is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
All Men muſt die, and all the Elect (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Doctrin) muſt at leaſt paſs through
the Flames of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> for ſome Hours or ſome
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57009:95"/>
Days; Neither was there ever any (ſay they) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> who by a peculiar Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
has been exempted from it. This is the
Reaſon, why there is not a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> to be
found who doth not give Mony for Maſſes and
Prayers to be ſaid for his Deceaſed Friends and
Kindred; or, who doth not make Legacies or
Foundations, for to have the ſame ſaid for himſelf,
after his Death: But as for <hi>Miracles,</hi> theſe only
happen in particular Caſes. Nevertheleſs, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the Life of Man is ſubject to many ſad
Accidents or Diſaſters, Men would be very glad
to be ſure of a Miracle to relieve them in time
of need or danger: This is that which makes
thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh Communion,</hi> to whom their
<hi>Prieſts</hi> promiſe no leſs at every moment, upon
condition they will ſignalize their Devotion at the
Chappel of ſuch a Miraculous Saint, which they
pretend to have in their Church, or joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſome of their Confraternities, ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
eaſily to be perſwaded, to give them what
Mony they ask of them. In the mean time, they
find it neceſſary from time to time, to awaken and
excite the Peoples Attentions by the ſtarting of
ſome New Miracle, which they know how to do
with a great deal of Addreſs and Cunning. The
moſt common way they make uſe of is this;
When they go to Viſit the Sick, they carry along
with them either Wine or Water, or ſome Rag of
Linnen, which they have bleſt in the Name of
ſuch an He or She-Saint: If the Sick perſon, who
has made uſe of any of theſe, chance to Recover,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57009:95"/>
which very Naturally may happen ſo, becauſe we
have Inſtances every day of perſons that Recover,
after that they have been given over by Phyſicians,
then the Prieſts are ſure to attribute the Recovery
of their Health to the Saint of their Church:
They demand an Atteſtation of it from him who
was Sick; they make a great Noiſe with it through
the City; and the next Sunday, they publickly
proclaim the Miracle from the Pulpit. In like
manner, If any perſon be ready to undertake a
Journy or Voyage, they go to him, and perſwade
him to make a Vow to ſome Saint of their Church;
and if afterwards it happens, that this perſon meet
with ſome bad Accident; as a dangerous Storm at
Sea, a Fall from his Horſe, or the Overturning of
his Coach, and that he eſcapes with his Life and
Health, as it often happens to the worſt of Men;
in this caſe he never fails aſcribing it to the He or
She-Saint of ſuch a Church: Immediately upon
his Return he acquaints the <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Monks</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
who begin anew to Toſs it abouts, Crying,
<hi>A Miracle, a Miracle!</hi> And that nothing can be
of greater force againſt Storms and Tempeſts at
Sea, or Miſchances by Land, than to apply ones
ſelf to the Saint of their Church, and to procure
Prayers and Maſſes to be ſaid for them there, as
the perſon who is lately Return'd from his Voyage,
and to whom this Miracle has hapned, did upon
his Setting-out. Others, who are endowed with a
larger Conſcience, and who believe it is lawful
for them to Lie, to enhance the Honour of their
Saints, take the boldneſs to ſuppoſe and invent
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57009:96"/>
Miracles, and to produce themſelves for Examples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
declaring, That they have had Revelations, or that
the Saints themſelves have appeared to them, or
have Healed them of their Infirmities. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who ſuffer themſelves to be gull'd by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Appearances of Godlineſs of thoſe ſorts of
Men, do not trouble themſelves to ſearch any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the Matter, but rely upon their Word.
There are ſome Men, who from Natural Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
know two or three days before what kind
of Weather it will be: Thus there are ſome, who
by the Pains they feel in their <hi>Corns,</hi> will tell
you whether we ſhall have Fair or Foul Weather.
A certain Father of the Order of the <hi>Servits</hi> at
<hi>Viconza,</hi> a Man of a wicked and debauch'd Life,
who Entertain'd Three Lewd Women at <hi>Venice,</hi>
by whom he had had several Children, being
ſeized with a Diſeaſe not fitting to be named,
never fail'd of feeling Exceſſive pains two or three
Days before Rain. Now there hapned an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Drought for Three Months together,
which cauſed extream Damage to all the Fruits
of the Earth; but at laſt, the Seaſon being about
to Change, the Father was not wanting to have
the ſad Anvertiſements of it. He was the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi>
or (as we corruptly ſpeak it) <hi>Sexton</hi> of a
Church called <hi>Madonna del Monte,</hi> or <hi>My Lady
of the Hill,</hi> which is about Half a League diſtant
from the City of <hi>Viconza,</hi> ſituate upon a pleaſant
Hill, where is kept a Miraculous Image of the
<hi>Virgin.</hi> And foraſmuch as he perceived, That the
Devotion of People was already much abated,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57009:96"/>
which he was very ſenſible of by the ſlackneſs of
his Purſe, he thought of kindling it again. To
this purpoſe, making uſe of the preſent Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
he ſent to the <hi>Podeſta,</hi> or Governour of the
City of <hi>Viconza;</hi> acquainting him, That being
at Prayer in the Night time before the Image of
the Virgin, whoſe <hi>Sacristan</hi> he had the Honour
to be, ſhe had told him with an intelligible Voice,
and a pleaſant Smile, <hi>That ſhe had a great deal
of Compaſſion on the Afflictions of her People, by
reaſon of the great Drought, which ſpoil'd all the
Country; and that in caſe the Inhabitants of</hi>
Viconza <hi>would within Three Days make a General
Proceſſion to his Church, She would open the Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
of Heaven, ſo that there ſhould be Rain in
abundanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> The Governour hereupon immediately
cauſed an Order to be publiſhed for a Proceſſion
againſt the Time the good Fryer had ſignified; at
which Time the Weather did not fail to change
and favour his Wiſhes: For ſcarcely was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
advanced Half-way, but there fell ſo furious a
Shower, that all thoſe who aſſiſted at it, were almoſt
overthrown, and had much ado to get to the
Church, where they Sung Hymns of Thanks to the
Virgin for that high Favour. This Miracle being
rumour'd abroad throughout the Country, for Two
Months together drew a great Number of People
to this Miraculous Image. The Devout <hi>Sacriſtan</hi>
finding his Purſe well Lin'd, repair'd the next
<hi>Carnaval</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> to divertize himſelf there,
and to make his Miſtreſſes partakers of his good
Fortune; and frankly acquainted them with the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57009:97"/>
Succeſs he had had, and how cleverly he had
gull'd the Unthinking People: But ſome time after,
one of them Falling-out with him, like another
<hi>Delilah</hi> betray'd him, and diſcover'd his Impoſture.
Had it been in any other Country, he would hardly
have eſcaped without bearing the Marks of it; but
in <hi>Italy</hi> theſe things are eaſily excuſable, with
ſaying, <hi>That nothing was intended in all this, ſave
only the Advancement of the Bleſſed Virgins Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Fetch of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> is ſomething of
my own Diſcovery, and which I do not know that
ever any one before me has taken Notice of; and
it is this, They are us'd to entertain Children with
an infinite number of falſe Tales and Stories, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
at random, concerning Apparitions and
Miracles, that never were. To explain this further
to you, you may take notice, That in <hi>Italy</hi> the
Children are Catechized every Sunday and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
throughout the Year in all their Churches, at
One of the Clock in the Afternoon: To make
them the more ready and willing to come to be
Catechized, the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> after that they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
ſome one Point of Doctrin, they tell them
for a Concluſion ſome pleaſant Story, before they
ſend them home. The Little <hi>Italians</hi> liſten to it
with the greateſt Attention imaginable, and as ſoon
as they are come home, tell it to their Mothers. I
have obſerv'd, That theſe <hi>Priests</hi> do commonly
take, for the Subject of their Story, ſome Miracle
or other, which they pretend to have been wrought
in their Church. I entred once into a Chappel,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57009:97"/>
where one of theſe young Catechizers was Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his young Scholars; the Chappel was Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to S. <hi>Martin.</hi> They ordinarily Paint this
Saint on Horſeback, and with his Sword cutting
off the Half of his Cloak, to give it for an Alms
to a poor Beggar. 'Twas in this poſture his Statue,
which was of a very pure White-Marble, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him on the Altar of that Chappel. When
the Catechizing was over, the Prieſt began to tell
theſe Children a very pleaſant Story concerning
this Statue: He told them, <hi>That a Good Curate of
that Pariſh, had often ſeen him very fairly come
down from the Altar, and Running a full Gallop
out of the Church; that one day having taken the
liberty to ask him, Whither he was a going?
S.</hi> Martin <hi>told him, That he was hasting to the
Aſſistance of a very honest Man, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
many Maſſes to be ſaid at his Altar, and
being at preſent fallen into the hands of Robbers, in
the midſt of a Wood, was in great danger of his
Life; but that he hop'd to come timely enough for
his Relief; and that at his Return, he would give
him an Account of the Succeſs of his Enterprize.</hi>
The Catechizer flouriſh'd his Diſcourſe with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
ſo extravagant and ridiculous, that it was
impoſſible to forbear Laughing. For he gave a
very particular deſcription of S. <hi>Martins</hi> whole
Journy, upon his Horſe of <hi>Marble,</hi> how he Rid
a full Gallop over Trees, Rivers, Cities, and all.
The poor Children all this while Liſtned to him
with profound Silence and Attention. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of all, and the Cream of the Jeſt was, <hi>That
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57009:98"/>
every one that bore a great Devotion to that
Chappel, and procur'd Maſſes to be ſaid there, in
honour of S.</hi> Martin, <hi>might aſſure themſelves never
to periſh on the High ways, by the hands of Robbers.</hi>
The next day I had occaſion to ſpeak to my young
Clergy-man, and put him in mind of his <hi>Marble
S. Martin,</hi> whom he had made to Ride Poſt, for a
Diverſion to his Scholars. He anſwer'd me Smiling,
<hi>What would you have one do, Sir? 'Tis the Cuſtom
of this Country, to entertain the Children that come
to be Catechized, with ſuch Stories as theſe; becauſe
without this we ſhould have none of their Company.
It is impoſſible to tell them always True ones, and
therefore we are ſometimes fain to be beholding to
our Inventions for them. Things are only ſo far
Evil, as they produce ill Effects; but theſe ſorts of
Stories cannot but in time bring forth very good
Fruits, as that of inſpiring them with great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the Saints, and obliging them to Pray,
and cauſe Maſſes to be ſaid in Honour of them.</hi>
What think you? Is not this an excellent piece of
ſound Morality? And are not theſe Children, think
you, well Taught? They are call'd to the School
of Truth, and yet they teach them nothing but
Lies. In the mean time, there is nothing capable
of making a greater impreſſion on our Spirits, or
of fixing a thing more laſtingly in our Memory,
than what we learn in our firſt and tender Youth:
All theſe Fooliſh Diſcourſes do not fail of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
very great effects, and of paſſing at laſt
for currant Truth in the Minds of the <hi>Papists,</hi>
who, beſides this, are accuſtomed very glibly to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57009:98"/>
ſwallow a great number of Abſurdities and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
in the Point of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi>
which they ſo ſtiffly maintain; and this is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
that has ſo over-run <hi>Italy</hi> with Fables, and
impertinent and ridiculous Stories. Yet theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are ſo infatuated therewith, that in caſe any
Honeſt Man and Lover of Truth, ſhould ſeem too
curiouſly to enquire after theſe Matters, or in the
leaſt to diſapprove them, he would paſs for no
better than an Heretick. Thus a certain perſon
was caſt into the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> for ſaying, That <hi>He
did not believe what was told of the Aſs of S.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
<hi>of</hi> Padua, <hi>that kneeled down to worſhip the
Host, to confound the Protestants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this firſt Cauſe of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which is the
<hi>Covetouſneſs of the Clergy,</hi> I proceed to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
which is the <hi>Slight and Cunning of certain
Beggars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poverty is a Well-ſpring of Great Bleſſings to
thoſe who do bear it patiently, taking it as from
the Hand of God, and making good uſe of it;
but withal, it is no leſs a Gulph of all Miſery and
Unhappineſs, to thoſe who receive it with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Spirit; and I don't believe there is any
Wickedneſs comparable to that of a Wicked Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
A Wicked Beggar hath no Conſcience; he
is diſpos'd to undertake any thing in order to rid
himſelf from the wretched Circumſtances of his
deſtitute condition. There be many of this ſort in
<hi>Italy,</hi> who Live by their Wits and Invention:
There are ſome that have the Patience, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
themſelves Cripples, Blind, or ſtruck with the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57009:99"/>
Palſie for Five or Six Years together, to make the
World at leaſt believe, that a <hi>Miracle</hi> has been
wrought upon them, attributing their Recovery to
ſome Image of the Virgin, or to ſome Saint. The
Profit which accrues to them by this is, That the
People being informed of the <hi>Miracle</hi> that hath
been wrought for them, preſently believe them to
be very Good Men, and Great Friends of God, as
having receiv'd ſuch Signal Favours from him:
This makes them to beſtow Liberal Alms upon
them, to have a ſhare in their Prayers: Yea, it oft
happens, That ſome Rich and Devout perſons
take care of, and make ſuch Proviſion for them,
that they never want all the Remainder of their
Lives. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Monks</hi> alſo afford
them an Allowance, when at any times by this
means they bring any of their Chappels in Vogue
and Requeſt, ſo as they receive conſiderable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
thereby. I have been ſhewn many of theſe
Beggars in <hi>Convents</hi> and <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> who Live
there amongſt the Domeſticks in great Eaſe, and
without doing any thing.</p>
               <p>The Third Spring from whence <hi>Miracles</hi> iſſue
in <hi>Italy,</hi> is a <hi>Popular Error;</hi> which is crept in
amongſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at preſent has taken ſuch deep
root, that it is in a manner impoſſible to pluck it up.
'Tis this, Upon the leaſt Accident, that happens to
the <hi>Italians,</hi> and the leaſt Sickneſs or Indiſpoſition
that ſeizeth them, they make a Vow to ſome Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
or Image of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> or of ſome Saint, to be
deliver'd from it. Now it is evident, that all Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
do not prove Fatal to Life, neither do all
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57009:99"/>
Diſeaſes terminate in Death, ſo that many times
they eſcape and are reſtor'd to Health again; which
by a ſtrange Superſtition, inſtead of attributing
the Glory thereof to God alone, who is the Sole
LORD of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> they attribute the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of their Health, or their Deliverance from
Danger, to the Statues or Images to whom they
have made their Vows: To make their Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the Favour they have received the
more Authentick, in compliance with the ill Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
introduc'd amongſt them, they cauſe a Picture
to be Drawn, wherein is ſet forth what hapned to
them, and themſelves, in the Act of imploring the
Aid of the ſaid Statue or Image, which to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is repreſented in one of the Corners of the
Picture, and towards which they ſtretch forth their
Arms or Folded-Hands with theſe Three Letters
underneath P. G. R., which ſignifie in <hi>Italian
Pro Gratiâ Ricevutâ; For a Favour or Grace Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Vow'd Pictures we generally find in all
the Churches of <hi>Italy;</hi> neither is there any of them
without ſome Miraculous Image, which receives the
Honour of all thoſe Deliverances and Favours, and
to whoſe Glory thoſe Shipwreck-Tables are hung
up. There is no need of any Tapiſtry or Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in theſe ſorts of Chappels; for theſe Small
Pictures are ſo thick hung, that they cover all the
Walls. There are of them of all Sorts: Some of
them repreſent perſons purſu'd by Murtherers;
others, that have been Wounded; and others,
Beaten at Sea by Furious Tempeſts. Yea, there
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57009:100"/>
are not wanting ſome of them that are very Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous;
for we find amongſt them Coaches full of
Gentlemen and Ladies overthrown, and they
tumbling over one another; Young Women that
are forced by their Lovers, and Women in Child-Bed,
repreſented in their Beds in a very wanton
and indecent manner. An <hi>Italian</hi> Lord told me,
<hi>That he very willingly went to hear Maſs at thoſe
Altars, that were beſt hung with ſuch Pictures as
theſe; becauſe meeting in them with ſomething for
his Imagination to feed upon, the Service of the
Maſs did ſeem leſs tedious to him.</hi> Theſe <hi>Pictures,</hi>
which are no more than Simple Vows, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
ſo great Credit in the Minds of the People,
that they paſs at preſent for Real Miracles: And
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> who write the Hiſtories of
the Places of Devotion, which belong to them,
make no difficulty to alledge them as ſuch. So that
now in <hi>Italy,</hi> they count the <hi>Miracles</hi> by theſe
<hi>Pictures;</hi> and the more of theſe any Statue or
Image hath about it, the more Miraculous it
is.</p>
               <p>I will take this occaſion to tell you of a <hi>Picture,</hi>
which ſome young <hi>Monks</hi> of the Abby of S. <hi>Victor</hi> in
<hi>Milan</hi> caus'd to be made whilſt I was there. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
which hapned to them was this: They were
Gilding the Roof of one of the Lower-Iſles of
the Church. Theſe <hi>Monks,</hi> out of Curioſity,
whilſt the Work-men were gone to get their Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
did climb up the Scaffold to the number of
Seven or Eight of them, to View their Work;
where one of them leſs heedful than the reſt,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57009:100"/>
Treading upon a Board that was not well faſtned,
fell down upon the Floor of the Church. All the
reſt being affrighted at this Accident, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that the whole Scaffold was coming down,
betook themſelves to Ladders, and let themſelves
ſlide-down by them, without receiving any hurt,
except only the poor <hi>Monk,</hi> who Fell down with
the looſe-Board; who was much Bruiſed. They
took him up in this pitiful condition, and was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to keep his Bed Two or Three Months before
he was fully Recovered.</p>
               <p>I was preſent when the Accident hapned, and
could ſee nothing in all this, but what was very
Natural. He who fell, hurt himſelf proportionably
to the Height from whence he came down, and
the Reſt receiv'd no hurt at all, becauſe they ſlid
down by the Ladders: In all this there appears
nothing of a <hi>Miracle;</hi> however, becauſe the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
was erected before the Chappel of S. <hi>Bernard</hi>
of <hi>Sienna,</hi> the Monks concluded, That without
doubt this Saint had helped them. Accordingly
they got a <hi>Picture</hi> drawn, repreſenting their Fall,
in one Corner whereof the Saint was Painted,
Stretching forth his Hands for their Safety. They
publiſh'd every where throughout the City, That
this Saint had upheld them in their Fall from
receiving any Harm. The Cardinal-Archbiſhop
was immediately acquainted therewith, and every
one did Congratulate them, for being ſo much in
Favour with that Saint.</p>
               <p>From this Example, and what before I have told
you upon this Head of <hi>Miracles,</hi> you may eaſily
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57009:101"/>
conceive, how far we are to give credit to thoſe
fine Legends, of the Lives of the <hi>New Saints</hi> of
the <hi>Romiſh Church;</hi> and of what weight that
Great Liſt of <hi>Miracles</hi> ought to be with us, which
are the chief ſtuffing and garniture of them. There
is not one of them that has not Reſtored Sight to
the Blind, Hearing to the Deaf, Speech to the
Dumb, and a clever uſe of their Limbs to Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
and in a word, They have preſerv'd from
all ill Accidents, and Cured all manner of Diſeaſes.
But when one comes to an Enquiry into Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
all this vaniſheth in Smoak, and the whole
of the Matter is reduc'd to ſome <hi>Pictures,</hi> which
ſome Superſtitious Ones (who without Reaſon have
imagin'd themſelves, to have receiv'd Favours
from them) have caus'd to be made. However,
when theſe <hi>Legends</hi> are ſent to ſtrange Countries,
that are of the <hi>Romiſh Communion,</hi> they make
a great Noiſe, and are all lookt upon as <hi>Miracles,</hi>
ſufficiently confirm'd by Authentick Proof and
Evidence. 'Tis a common Reproach caſt upon
Proteſtants, <hi>That no Miracles are done amongſt
them;</hi> and they will needs have this to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Argument, to prove they are in an Error,
A <hi>Jeſuit</hi> in a Latin Oration, pronounc'd in the
Cathedral of <hi>Strasbourgh,</hi> ſoon after that the
<hi>French</hi> had taken poſſeſſion of it, exclaim'd in
theſe words; <hi>Quid dubitamus de falſitate Religionis
eorum, apud quos ceſſavit Propheta &amp; Sacerdos,
&amp; Miracula periêre? What do we doubt any
longer of the Falſneſs of their Religion, with
whom both Priest and Prophet are ceaſed, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57009:101"/>
Miracles are loſt?</hi> The Proteſtants might very
well have Anſwer'd him with Truth, <hi>That there
can be no reaſon of doubting, but that a Religion
ſo fraught with Superſtition and Counterfeit Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as the Papists Religion is, muſt needs be
Falſe.</hi> The Profeſſion of a Good Chriſtian is, to
live according to the Goſpel; but not to confirm
it by Miracles; this is the Work of God alone, and
therefore we ought not to reproach one another
upon that ſcore. We ſee every day, that Juglers,
(tho' we know they deceive us, and tho' we Eye
them with all the Attention imaginable, for to
diſcover their Artifice,) are notwithſtanding ſo
dextrous at their Tricks, that they gull us before
our Face; and ſhall we blindly believe all the
<hi>Italian</hi> Prieſts and Monks tell us, who have the
Gift of Cheat and Invention? <hi>Sic notus</hi> Ulyſſes?
For my part, conſidering the Times in which we
live, I will never believe any Miracle, as long as
my Reaſon tells me, the Thing was feaſible by
Men.</p>
               <p>'Tis commonly held, That the Body of S. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>
of <hi>Bar,</hi> in the <hi>Pouille,</hi> is Miraculous; and
that from his Tomb there continually diſtils an
Oil very Salutiferous, and proper to reſtore the
Sick to Health; but it is enough for me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
this Miracle; becauſe I know, that Men
may eaſily convey the Oil thither, and ingeniouſly
make it to diſtill down. I have ſometimes ſeen
ſome poor <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> who returned from that Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
and who had little Bottles full of this
Oil, which had coſt them Mony enough, who
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57009:102"/>
would afterwards fain have given it for a piece
of Bread; but could find no Cuſtomers to take it
off their Hands. Which makes it evident, That
the <hi>Italians,</hi> for all their Bigotry, had no Belief
in it themſelves. In like manner at <hi>Naples,</hi> the
<hi>Prieſts</hi> make ſhew of a Bottle, which they aver
to be full of the Blood of S. <hi>Januarius,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of that City: When at firſt they bring
forth this Blood to be ſeen, it appears all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd;
but as they approach it to the Body of
this Saint, it diſſolves by degrees. As to this alſo;
it is ſufficient ground for me not to believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I know that this Liquor may be congealed;
in the manner as they make <hi>Sorbets,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
diſſolve by the Heat of the place where they
ſhew it, or by the heat of the Hands of thoſe
who handle it. At <hi>Padua</hi> is to be ſeen the Tomb
of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> which ſends forth a very
ſweet Scent between that of <hi>Ambergris</hi> and <hi>Musk:</hi>
The Fryers of that Convent tell us, That this
Odour proceeds from the Bones of that Saint,
which are ſhut up there: But the Teſtimony of
theſe Fellows, who are ſo byaſs'd by their Intereſt,
does not give me any ſatisfaction, as long as I
know that they may eaſily anoint it with Odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
Quinteſſences, as it is certain they do; becauſe
that this Odour is the very ſame with that of the
perfumed <hi>Pater-noſters,</hi> that are Sold in the Shops
at <hi>Padua.</hi> In the ſame place they ſhew us, in a
very fair Chryſtal, ſupported by a ſtately Pedeſtal
of Gold, extreamly well wrought, the <hi>Tongue</hi> of
the ſaid Saint, which they ſay was found in his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57009:102"/>
Tomb, being endued with the Priviledge of <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ption,</hi>
all the reſt of his Fleſh being conſumed.
They have the Impudence to aver, That this
Tongue, for having been a Laſh to the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians</hi>
of his Time, has been preſerv'd thus
ſound and whole, without the leaſt Taint of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
that as a perpetual Miracle, it might bear
witneſs to the Truth of the Doctrin of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi>
The greateſt part of the <hi>Romiſh Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends</hi>
tell us, it is as freſh and lively as when the
Saint was alive; but that is very falſe, for I have
ſeen it, and it is dry. Thoſe who have the Art
of Embalming Bodies, may preſerve a Tongue in
this manner for many Years, yea, many Ages, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing extraordinary, or ſo much as bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
upon a Miracle.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you a View, Sir, of the
moſt Famous and Avowed Miracles of <hi>Italy,</hi> which
the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> pretend to be ſo palpable and
ſenſible, that they cannot be deny'd, without
giving the Lie to Senſe and Reaſon. I will add
to theſe, Three Bodies of Saints, which have been
preſerv'd without any Taint of Corruption, and
which I have ſeen all Three: The one is, the Body
of S. <hi>Roſe</hi> of <hi>Viterbo;</hi> the other of S. <hi>Clara</hi> of
<hi>Monfaucon;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the third of S. <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia.</hi>
Theſe Bodies have been preſerved whole
and uncorrupted; but without any the leaſt Beauty,
being altogether dryed up, and as hard as Paſt-board,
and very black; they are very frightful to
behold, notwithſtanding they have dreſt them in
very rich Habits, and adorn'd them with more
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57009:103"/>
Jewels, than Queens are embeliſh'd with on their
Coronation-days. Some have a great Eſteem for
theſe incorrupted Bodies, and ſo ſhould I too, in
caſe they enjoyed their former lively Tincture
and Natural Colour; but to be ſo dry, ſo black,
and ſo ghaſtly, it were more eligible in my mind,
to return to the Univerſal way of all Fleſh, than
to be made partakers of ſuch a kind of Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
neither can I ſee that God herein hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
any great Favour upon theſe Bleſſed Saints,
by preſerving them in a condition proper to terrifie
Nature, and affright Mankind. The Works of
God are all perfect, he never beſtows a Favour by
halves, and if he were pleaſed to grant Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Bodies, he would alſo probably preſerve
them, with all the Natural qualities belonging to
them. Wherefore I don't believe, That the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Incorruptions of the Bodies of theſe Saints
can truly be aſcribed to any thing elſe, but the
dexterity of thoſe who have dried or embalmed
them.</p>
               <p>We ſaw at the <hi>Chartreuſe</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> the Body of
a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> which being Embalmed, has
been preſerved whole and entire for above an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years. This perſon was never accounted a
Saint, and yet I found his Body much fairer to the
Eye, than were thoſe of the Three Saints now
mentioned, tho' it be much more diſregarded and
neglected than they are; for they have left the
Body in an old Wooden-Coffin, which does not
ſhut cloſe, and where all thoſe that go to-the
<hi>Chartreuſe</hi> do view it and touch it; whereas the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57009:103"/>
Bodies of theſe Saints are kept in very dry Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,
where the great Wax-Tapers, that burn Day
and Night, purifie the Air, and clear it of all
moiſtures and impurity. I have alſo ſeen in <hi>France,</hi>
at <hi>Vandoſme,</hi> in the Collegiate Church of the
Caſtle, the Body of <hi>Jane d' Albret,</hi> who died a
very zealous <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> above an Hundred years
ſince; her Body hath been very well Embalmed,
and if at preſent one would take it up from the
place where it lies, and dreſs it, and keep it in a
very dry place, it would undoubtedly appear much
fairer, than that of theſe Religious: And yet I am
very well aſſured, the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> will never
ſay, ſhe was a Saint.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch as I am now upon the Chapter
of theſe Saints, I ſhall acquaint you, That I have
often Read the Hiſtory of their Lives, and of many
others in the <hi>Legends</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
but never in all my Life did I meet with any
thing more ridiculous: And I have obſerved, that
theſe are thoſe Propheteſſes of which the <hi>Jeſuit</hi>
ſpoke at <hi>Strasbourgh,</hi> and which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are
depriv'd of, <hi>Apud quos ceſſavit Propheta; who
have no Prophets amongſt them.</hi> In a manner, all
their Religion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> (after that they are arrived to the
State of <hi>Perfection,</hi> as they call it) take upon them
to Propheſie. For the better underſtanding of this,
you may take notice, That at <hi>Rome</hi> they have
diſtinguiſh'd or divided the Spiritual Life into
ſeveral States; as an Houſe hath many Stories, the
Lowermoſt, the Middle, and the Higheſt or Upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.
There is one State they call <hi>Active;</hi> this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57009:104"/>
is the Loweſt, and conſiſts only in Action, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
orderly regulation of the Senſes, according to the
Law of God: The ſecond is the <hi>Contemplative
State,</hi> which conſiſts in the Meditation of thoſe
things which have no Communication with the
Senſes: The third is a State <hi>Extatical,</hi> abſtracted
and purely <hi>Paſſive;</hi> in which the Soul does nothing
but by a ſimple Application, Adhaeſion, and Union
with the Divine Eſſence; receives (without any
Action, Affection, or Contemplation on her part)
Impreſſions from God. There are but few that
arrive to this Uppermoſt Story; but when any are
once got thither, whatever Word they utter, or
Action they do, 'tis no more they themſelves who
Act or Speak, but God that Speaks and Acts in
them; for as for them, they never depart from
this their intimate Union with God. Whatſoever
they Say or Speak in this State, is very carefully
heeded, as being all Divine: If they ſpeak of
Things paſt, they are <hi>Revelations;</hi> if of Things
to come, they are all <hi>Prophecies.</hi> 'Tis by this Door
ſo many New Notions are entred into the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they believe as firmly as the
Goſpel, tho' they have no other Foundation, but
the over-heated Brains of theſe Saints. Many of
theſe have themſelves Pen'd their own Revelations,
as S. <hi>Brigit,</hi> S. <hi>Melchilda,</hi> S. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Sienna,</hi>
S. <hi>Gertrude,</hi> and many others. By means of theſe
Sainteſſes, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath attain'd the
knowledge of all the Particularities of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Paſſion; how many Stroaks he received at
his Whipping; how often he fell to the Ground,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57009:104"/>
under the heavy burthen of his Croſs; how many
Thorns pierc'd his Sacred Head; and how many
times they Spat in his Holy Face. By the ſame
way they have diſcover'd whatſoever hapned in
the Manger at <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> how the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi>
took the Veil from her Head, and made Clouts of it for
her Little <hi>Jeſus;</hi> what ſhe ſaid and did, before ſhe
was Deliver'd of him; and a vaſt Number of other
Particulars, which are not to be met with in the
Goſpel. By this means they were informed of the
Great Myſtery of the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed
Virgin;</hi> when ſhe aſcended up to Heaven in Soul
and Body, the Diſcourſe ſhe had with the Apoſtles,
how ſhe by degrees mounted up into the Air,
beſtowing her Bleſſings all the way ſhe went.
In a word almoſt all the new Doctrin of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
is derived from this over-flowing Spring,
which is not yet dryed up, nor ever will as long
as there are any of theſe Propheteſſes left in their
Church. To give more weight to theſe new Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
theſe Saints, aſſured, that Jeſus Chriſt
appeared to them very often, and was become very
Familiar with them, that he talk'd with them as a
Bridegroom does with his Bride, and that they took
occaſion in theſe Familiarities, to ask him whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they deſired to know. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf
taught S. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Sienna</hi> to read, he came and
did blow the Fire for her, he ſwept her Chamber,
as may be ſeen in the Hiſtory of her Life, by which
means ſhe had an occaſion of Diſcourſing him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
Others of them received Viſits from Jeſus
Chriſt, who came and Viſited them, accompanied
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57009:105"/>
with his Mother and his Apoſtles; where they had
great Conferences together, and theſe Sainteſſes
that heard them, diſcovered many ſecrets and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
in their Diſcourſe, which they afterwards
Communicated to the Popes and the Church; and
this is that which at this day, in a great Meaſure,
makes the difference that is between the Doctrin of
the Papiſts, and that of the Proteſtants. <hi>Apud
quos ceſſavit Propheta,</hi> who have no Prophets to
boaſt of. There is never a Convent of Nuns in <hi>Italy,</hi>
that has not ſome Propheteſs, which is always
ſome old Mother, that hath been twice or thrice
Superior of the Convent, and who not being in
a condition of doing any thing elſe, applies her
ſelf to the Unitive Life.</p>
               <p>During the long ſtay I made at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> I
often went to Viſit the Abbeſs of the Nuns of S.
<hi>Thomas:</hi> I upon a time enquired of her concerning
the State of her Nuns, who told me that ſhe had
Forty four that were in the Active Life, three in
the Contemplative, and one only in the Myſtical or
Unitive. A young Counteſs, who was in the ſame
Convent, and who was Viſited by four or five
Galants, who came to ſee her at the Grate, was
got no further yet than the Active Life. I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
my ſelf no further at preſent in entertaining
you, about the Nuns of <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe probably
I may have an occaſion to do it more at leiſure.</p>
               <p>I return now to my ſhe Saints, whoſe Bodies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
Uncorrupt. They were all three of them
arrived at the Unitive State, and have all of them
left Prophecies behind them: S. <hi>Roſe</hi> of <hi>Viterbo,</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:57009:105"/>
did for a long time importune the <hi>Dominican</hi>
Nuns of that City, to receive her amongſt them,
and to give her the Habit of their Order; but the
Nuns knowing ſhe was extreamly poor, and that
ſhe could not, as the reſt did, bring Mony to the
Convent, refuſed her company, and would not ſo
much as receive her into the Number of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
Siſters. The Saint underſtanding this their
rejecting of her, told them, That tho' they would
have none of her now ſhe was alive, yet they
ſhould be very glad to have her, when ſhe was
Dead. This Prophecy prov'd true; for <hi>Roſe</hi> being
deceaſed with the Odour of Sanctity, and many
Miracles, after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner, being wrought
at her Tomb, theſe ſame Nuns deſired her Body,
which was granted them. The great Number of
Maſſes which are procur'd to be ſaid to her, and
the abundance of Alms that Travellers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
do leave there, makes them conſider this
Body at preſent, as their greateſt Treaſure. This
Prophecy of S. <hi>Roſe</hi> was very eaſy to be made;
ſhe knew ſhe was already far enough advanced in
the good Opinion of the People, for to make them
eſteem her a Saint after her Death. She knew more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that the Bodies of ſuch are always very gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that the Nuns of that Convent, as well as
others in <hi>Italy,</hi> were very Covetous; and that by
Vertue of a Vow ſhe had made to S. <hi>Dominicus,</hi>
they would not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to demand her Relicks, as of
right belonging to them, and ſo was in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Prophecy on a ſure ground. The Saint
whoſe Body is to be ſeen at <hi>Monte Faucon,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57009:106"/>
with ſomething that is very remarkable;
they ſhew you all the Inſtruments of the Paſſion of
our Saviour, which, they ſay, were found in her
Heart after her Deceaſe; they are all of dryed
Fleſh, like as her Heart is; They are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
neither are all of them ſufficiently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable
or Diſcernable. They ſhew you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
three little round Pellets of Fleſh, which
they ſay, were likewiſe taken out of her Heart.
One of theſe Pellets being laid in a pair of Scales,
weigh as much as all the three together, and all
the three weigh no more than one alone. This
makes them ſay, That God was willing to Imprint
in the Heart of this Saint, a Reſemblance of the
moſt Holy Trinity: for in like manner, as theſe
three Pellets, tho' different in number, yet make
but one weight, and that the weight of one alone,
is no leſs than that of all the three together; ſo
likewiſe tho' there be three Perſons in the Holy
Trinity, yet there is but one Eſſence; and one of
theſe Perſons, is no leſs in Divine Perfections,
than the other two. I have ſeen theſe three Pellets,
but ſo far are they from ſuffering one to try the
Experiment, that they will not ſuffer you to touch
it with your Finger, to feel whether it be Fleſh or
no. Every one knows that a ſtrong Imagination
is capable of producing ſtrange effects in the Body.
We ſee every day Children that come into the
World bearing the Marks of their Mothers Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which are the effects of their Imagination.
It may be that this Saint did ſo ſtrongly Imagin the
Inſtruments of the Paſſion, as to leave them En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57009:106"/>
in her Heart; but it ſeems to me, that this
is a Violence done to Nature, which can no way
be pleaſing to God, who is the Author of it. As
for S. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Bononia,</hi> ſhe more particularly
render'd her ſelf famous by her Abſtracted Life.
The Hiſtory of her Life tells us, That ſhe was in a
continual Union with God. Doctor <hi>Molinus</hi>
was no ſtranger to this Unitive Life, for this is
that he calls his Prayer of Reſt: I doubt not at all,
but that one day he would have been one of the
Saints of <hi>Rome,</hi> had not Obedience to Superiors
and particularly to the Pope been concerned in the
caſe. The Pope will ſuffer you to Unite with God,
as much as you pleaſe, provided always that this
Union do not hinder you from obeying him, more
than God himſelf. I doubt not indeed but that
there may be even to this day perfect Souls amongſt
them, that are Raviſhed even into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
but theſe are extraordinary Graces, which
do not depend on any Natural endeavour we can
exert to obtain them. But when I conſider that
the Roman Catholicks have made a fixed State of
this Union, that they preſcribe Rules to attain it,
and it is ſufficient according to them, to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the Hands of one of theſe Myſtical or
Unitive Doctors, and follow their Directions,
in-order to arrive at this State. When I conſider
this, I ſay, I cannot but condemn their Error.
Tis a piece of Impiety to make the Divine Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
dependent on the Humours of Men; to give
Rules for the obtaining of that by way of Merit,
which is the meer Gift of Grace, and to make one's
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57009:107"/>
ſelf the Diſpenſer and Diſpoſer of the Gifts of
Heaven, as theſe ſorts of Doctors pretend to do.
Moreover the ill Conſequences that follow from
hence are very Pernicious to Souls. Firſt of all,
this aſſurance only, received from theſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Maſters, of once being advanced to the Unitive
Life, whilſt ſo many others are left behind in the
Contemplative and Active Lives, which are ſo far
below it, is very proper to inſpire the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
with Pride and vain Glory. Secondly, This
may prove a very great Diſcouragement to thoſe,
who are neceſſarily engaged in an Active Life, to
conſider that there are ſuch perfect States beyond
them, which it is impoſſible for them ever to attain
to, becauſe theſe Doctors do not think them fit to
be admitted thereto. Thirdly, This opens a Door
to manifold Superſtitions and Errors; for they who
are engaged in the Active Life, never take the
pains to examin what the Contemplative ſay; nor
theſe, what the Unitive or Myſtical do alledge for
Truth: So that the two firſt do both of them rely
upon theſe laſt, who for the moſt part are perſons
of weak Brains, and moſt extravagant Thoughts,
who believe, that whatſoever they ſpeak or act is
from God. It is evident that the Opinion of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation
is only an effect of their Whimſeys,
by the Impropriety, Abuſe and Confuſion of the
Terms they make uſe of to explain themſelves.
For in like manner, as they call their Myſtical
Life ſometimes Union, Unity, Identity, Confuſion
or mingling of the Soul with God; ſometimes the
Loſs of the Soul in God; the pure ſight of God;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57009:107"/>
Peaceable poſſeſſion of God; and many more which
may be in the Books that Treat of the Myſtical
Life, whereof ſome are very Falſe and Impious,
as thoſe of Unity, Identity, Confuſion and Loſing
of ones ſelf in God, and all the others do only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Future Life: Now in like manner, ſay
I, as they make uſe of theſe Terms to ſignifie a
ſimple adherence, complyance and acquieſcence of
our Souls in the good pleaſure of God, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
produce Identification; ſo of old Times they
called the Holy Supper, The real Union of Jeſus
Chriſt with our Souls, and the Bread we partake
therein the Truth, Reality and Subſtance of the Body
of Jeſus Chriſt, which notwithſtanding is only
there in a Figure: And afterwards, when this Errour
had taken good Rooting, it brought forth this
big word of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which at this day
makes the chief difference between Papiſts, who
maintain it Tooth and Nail, and the Proteſtants
who oppoſe it. Neither is it any great matter of
wonder that an Error of ſuch Conſequence, is crept
into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without making any
great Noiſe; for in the firſt place, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it contradictory to the Popes Authority:
And again it was not lawful for the People to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
what the Myſtical Tribe aſſerted; inſomuch
that even to this day in <hi>Italy,</hi> if you chance in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with a Contemplative or Unitive perſon to
contradict them in any thing, they tell you very
freely, That theſe are Matters too high for your
Capacity, and that you are to believe them in the
things they aſſert, as being better acquainted than
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57009:108"/>
you with the ways of God, and as having already
ſpent a conſiderable time in tracing the Myſtical
Paths of a Spiritual Life. I have ſcarce ever ſeen
any of theſe Myſtical perſons, but were very
Proud: They look upon themſelves as Eagles who
take their Flights in the higheſt part of the Air,
and upon other men, as Beaſts creeping upon the
Earth. A common and humble Life, full of Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
Benignity and Sweetneſs towards ones
Neighbour, ſhall always be more deſirable to me,
than all theſe great Sublimations of Spirit, which
are apt to inſpire Men with ſo much Pride: And if
ever it ſhall pleaſe God, to raiſe me to the high degree
of Contemplation or Union, it ſhall be His work,
and not the effect of any Rule or direction, which
Men can afford me. In <hi>Italy</hi> they make a kind of
Trade of it; and if a Man doth not put himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Hands of ſome of theſe Myſtical Doctors,
who pretend to be old Travellers and throughly
well acquainted with the Way to Heaven, and
who profeſs the Art of Guiding Souls thither, he
can never hope of arriving there. Theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
are ordinarily old Jeſuits, old Capuchins,
or old Fathers Miſſionaries, who being no more
able to Scout it up and down in ſtrange Countries,
in <hi>Holland</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> to pervert Proteſtants,
apply themſelves in their Convents, to play the
Seraphick Fathers, to the end they may be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Company of He and ſhe Votaries, whom
they Diſcourſe to Morning and Evening in their
Churches. When they are met together in their
Aſſemblies, you hear nothing but Sighs, Groans, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57009:108"/>
ſome broken words, at another gueſs rate than the
<hi>Qaukers</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and certainly in this reſpect,
they have nothing to caſt them in the Teeth with.
The Director is ſeated in his Confeſſional Chair,
in the midſt of all theſe People, whom he calls his
Sons and Daughters; and there as from a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
or Throne he determines, without Appeal of
their Sighs, and of their Poſtures, whether they
proceed from God, the Devil, or Self-Love: Young
Women or Married are ſeldom found at theſe ſorts
of Aſſemblies, becauſe commonly they are kept in on
Working-days, on which days the <hi>Italians</hi> keep
them ſhut up under Lock and Key; but they are
commonly Widows and old Maids, who have no
perſons to command them. They call them in
<hi>Italy, Beati,</hi> or Bleſſed Ones, Good Siſters, Devout
Women, and ſometimes by way of deriſion,
Bigots. The Father Directors are very Zealous of
their Advancement in the Myſtical Life, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave them, till they have ſo wholly diveſted
them of all Love for the good things and Riches
of this World, that to be delivered from the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of them, they ſettle them on their Convent:
Then it is they are arrived at perfection. They call
them Siſters, and tell them that having made a
Gift of their Goods to their Monaſteries, 'tis the
ſame thing, as if they had profeſſed amongſt them.
They beſtow upon them pieces of their Habits,
they call them Little Scapularies, which they wear
under their Bodies: By Vertue of which Bits of
Cloth, they are made partakers of all the good
Works they do, and of all the Graces, Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57009:109"/>
Bleſſings and Indulgences granted to their
Order: When they are Dead they Bury them in
their Churches, and they endeavour, if they can,
to make them paſs for Saints, for an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to others. And indeed it is very eaſy for
them to do it; to this purpoſe they have but this
courſe to take; the firſt Sick Perſon they go to viſit
they amply diſcourſe, about the high State of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to which Madam ſuch an one was arrived,
who was lately Buired in their Church; That they
do not doubt in the leaſt, but ſhe is a great Saint,
and that if the Sick Perſon can reſolve to Pray to,
and call upon her with full aſſurance, they que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
not but ſhe will work a Miracle in favour of
him: Yea, they oftentimes offer to Bleſs ſome
Wine, Syrup or ſome other Liquor in the name of
this Saint, or to Dip it in ſomething or other that
in her Life time ſhe uſed to wear, as her Diſcipline,
or <hi>Pater Noſter:</hi> And having done this, they offer
this Liquor to the Sick party to Drink, who if
they chance to recover, the Saint hath wrought a
Miracle; they cauſe a Picture to be drawn of what
has hapned, which they carry to the Saints
Tomb. But if it happen that the Patient Die,
or that the Sickneſs continue very long, there is
not a word made of it, but all huſh'd in hopes of
a better opportunity for the future. Thoſe who
are any thing acquainted with the State of Affairs
in <hi>Italy,</hi> know that in all this I advance nothing
but what is very true. Hence it is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by what means ſo many new Saints are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57009:109"/>
Altars are Erected. It is to no purpoſe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
here, the great Precautions they take at <hi>Rome,</hi>
in examining matters of Fact in the Verbal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
they make of their Canonization; ſo that it
is impoſſible for any thing to eſcape the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of thoſe, who have the charge of it. Alas,
it is but too well known, how great a power Silver
and Gold have at <hi>Rome;</hi> and it is certain they
never Canonize any Saint, but it brings them in
Immenſe Sums of Mony. In caſe any difficulties
be ſtarted, 'tis only to get the Mony doubled.</p>
               <p>My Deſign at firſt, was only to give you ſome
account of the <hi>Italick</hi> Pilgrimages; but the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of mentioning theſe three Saints, whoſe Bodies
are preſerved in Incorruptions have put me upon
this Digreſſion. Wherefore to make an end in few
words of what I have yet to ſay of my firſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
you may take notice, that all other Pilgrimages
of <hi>Italy,</hi> beſides thoſe of <hi>Loretto, Rome</hi> and S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
of <hi>Padua,</hi> are very inconſiderable. Some
Pilgrims go to S. <hi>Michael,</hi> which is at Mount
<hi>Gargan</hi> in the <hi>Poville,</hi> others to S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> of
<hi>Bar;</hi> but the moſt that go to theſe places are Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,
becauſe the way thither is very troubleſom
from the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> lying all over high
Mountains, and the Inhabitants of that Country
are almoſt all Robbers: The <hi>Italian</hi> Lords are very
backward to lead their Ladies a walk thither, with
their Pilgrim-Staves all ſet with Diamonds. The
Delicious March of <hi>Ancona,</hi> is much more proper
and ſecure for this ſort of Pilgrims: The Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> in the Pleaſant <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:57009:110"/>
Country, is for the ſame reaſon much more
ſuitable to them. There be very few <hi>Italians,</hi> who
do not take this Journy every three years; and
ſome of them go Regularly every year. This
Saint has gain'd ſo great Credit in <hi>Italy,</hi> that he is
of equal eſteem with the Virgin, yea, with God
himſelf; ſome with a great deal of reaſon have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him the God of <hi>Italy, Italiae Deus.</hi> When an
<hi>Italian</hi> has Sworn by S. <hi>Antonio,</hi> 'tis the greateſt
Oath he can Swear: And whereas in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
they are wont to ſay, I intend to go to ſuch
or ſuch a place at ſuch a time, if God preſerve my
Life; or 'Ile do this or that, if it pleaſe God; 'tis
their cuſtom to ſay 'Ile go thither, or do this, if
it pleaſe the <hi>Virgin</hi> and S. <hi>Anthony.</hi> Their moſt
common Interjection when ever they are in any
danger, ſurprize or admiration, is to Cry, <hi>Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Santiſſima!</hi> or S. <hi>Antonio!</hi> And by a ſtrange
kind of Blaſphemy, tho' they make it a great
Point of Devotion, they have the Impiety to ſay,
<hi>I hope in S.</hi> Anthony, <hi>that I ſhall never Periſh.</hi>
They call him the Saint, by way of Emphaſis, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Santo,</hi> which is a great Honour, but of right due
to God only, to whom the Angels Cry continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<hi>Holy, Holy, Holy!</hi> There is never a Church
in <hi>Italy,</hi> where there is not an Altar Dedicated to
S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua.</hi> They make their Addreſſes
in particular to this Saint for all things that are loſt,
to which purpoſe they tell you this following
Story:</p>
               <p>A Rich <hi>Venetian</hi> Merchant being at Sea, by
Miſchance let a Diamond of a very great price
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57009:110"/>
fall into the Sea, who immediately upon his return
to <hi>Venice</hi> went to <hi>Padua,</hi> and betook himſelf <hi>al
Santo;</hi> he deſired the Fryars of that Convent to
ſay Nine Maſſes for him, and to joyn their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with his, for the recovery of his Diamond.
The Ninth day after his Nine Maſſes were ended,
the Merchant deſigning to Treat all the Monks of
the Convent with a Dinner, he bought amongſt
other things a very large Fiſh and ſent it to them;
the Fryar Cook having opened and gutted this
Fiſh, found the Diamond in the Intrails of it, which
the Merchant had dropt into the Sea; which was
immediately reſtor'd to him, and Thanks return'd
to the Saint, who had heard their Prayers.</p>
               <p>This Story is related at large in the Legend of
his Life: But does it not ſeem to you, Sir, to be
contrived or invented of theſe good Monks, to
perſuade Men to ſend them in good Dinners, and
to get them to ſay Maſſes for them?</p>
               <p>They tell another pleaſant Story, which however
they were very Cautious of inſerting in their Legend.
The Fryars <hi>del Santo</hi> go without contradiction for
the moſt Debauched that are in all <hi>Padua,</hi> and who in
this quality out-vie the Scholars themſelves of the
Univerſity. One of theſe Monks having for ſome
Months Sollicited a young Woman to comply
with his Luſt, ſhe at laſt fell under the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but ſoon after was ſo extreamly grieved for
the Sin ſhe had committed, that ſhe was ready to
Deſpair. The Fryar perceiving it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what was paſt, made a ſhift to perſwade her, that
in caſe ſhe would give him ſome conſiderable Sum
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57009:111"/>
of Mony, for Maſſes to be ſaid to S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> that
Saint ſhould reſtore her the Virginity ſhe had loſt.
Thus beſides the ſatisfying of his Luſt, he got Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of her wherewith to glut his Luxury elſewhere.
I will not oblige you to believe this Story, having no
ſufficient Warrant to believe it my ſelf: However
ſure I am, that theſe Jolly Monks under the Cloak
of their S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> play many Tricks not a whit
inferior to this.</p>
               <p>I may poſſibly have occaſion to entertain you

               <p>I Met with nothing conſiderable in my Journy
from <hi>Loretto</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſave the Accident that
hapned to me in paſſing of a Bridge, whereof I
gave you an Account in my Laſt LETTER. I
arrived there about <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> and continued in
that City all the Holy-days, and the <hi>Lent</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
until <hi>Easter.</hi> My principal Employment, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my ſtay here, was to frequent their Feſtivals,
to hear their Sermons, and to be preſent at their
Confraternities; which accordingly I do intend
ſhall be the Subject of this preſent LETTER.</p>
               <p>This Word <hi>Feaſt,</hi> or <hi>Feſtival,</hi> in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> properly ſignifies thoſe Days of the Year,
which are more Religiouſly obſerved than the reſt,
in honour either of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> or of ſome Myſtery
of the Goſpel, or of ſome Saint, which we in
<hi>England</hi> call <hi>Holy-days.</hi> Some of theſe <hi>Feaſts</hi> are
Univerſal, others only Particular. The <hi>Univerſal
Feasts</hi> are thoſe, that are generally obſerv'd in all
Countries that profeſs the <hi>Romiſh Religion;</hi> and on
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57009:112"/>
theſe Days they are bound (under pain of Mortal
Sin) to go to <hi>Maſs.</hi> The <hi>Particular Feaſts,</hi> are
ſuch as are only kept in certain Provinces, Cities,
Pariſhes, or Chappels. Thus, foraſmuch as at <hi>Rome</hi>
there is a prodigious Number of Churches and
Chappels, it is every day <hi>Holy-day</hi> in divers parts
of that City.</p>
               <p>But they have another ſort of Feaſts in <hi>Italy,</hi>
which for diſtinction ſake I may call, <hi>Feaſts of
Gallantry:</hi> Theſe are, When ſome Noble or Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Perſons, do at their own Coſts and Charges,
undertake to have the Firſt and Second <hi>Veſpers,</hi>
together with the <hi>Maſs,</hi> Sung in Muſick, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of ſome He or She Saint: I give them the
Name of <hi>Gallant Feaſts;</hi> not ſo much for the
Muſicks ſake, (that is to ſay, for the admirable
Sympathy of Voices, and Concerts of Inſtruments,
which are ſo great a part of them;) but with
reſpect to the Ladies, who are Invited to them, or
who do commonly frequent them.</p>
               <p>After that I had for ſome Days reſted my ſelf at
<hi>Rome,</hi> I went abroad, to take a View of the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
and Antiquities of that Great City. As I
was Walking one Evening on the <hi>Piazza Navonna,</hi>
I paſſed by a very fine Church, called <hi>De la Pace:</hi>
The Porch, which of it ſelf was a moſt exquiſite
piece of Architecture, of the faireſt White-Marble,
was over and above magnificently Embeliſh'd and
Adorn'd with moſt curious Pictures, and a multitude
of Figures made of ſmall Sheets of Silk of different
Colours, of the <hi>Bononia</hi> faſhion. This gave me
the Curioſity of entring into the Church, where I
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57009:112"/>
ſaw a very fine Company of Gentlemen, who had
cauſed a kind of a Throne to be made for them in
a part of the Church, from whence they could very
Commodiouſly view thoſe who either came in or
went out. It was one of theſe Gentlemen, as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
afterwards, at whoſe Appointment and
Charges this Feaſt was Celebrated in Honour of
S. <hi>Agnes;</hi> thô it was not the day of the year which
is Conſecrated to her, <hi>viz.</hi> the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>January;</hi>
But there was another Myſtery in the caſe, which
we ſhall preſently diſcover.</p>
               <p>Theſe young Lords had each of them, in their
Turns appointed the Celebration of their Miſtreſſes
Feſtivals: they were Eight of them in all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Four firſt had already kept theirs in other
Churches, and this was the Feaſt appointed by the
Fifth of them. He was of the Family of <hi>Carpegna,</hi>
and his Miſtreſſes Name was <hi>Agnes Victorini.</hi>
The Church <hi>de la Pace,</hi> that is, of Peace, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
well Adorn'd; it is Guilt and Painted all
within in like manner, as almoſt all the Churches
of <hi>Rome</hi> be; however the more to exalt its Beauty,
and to add ſomething peculiar with Relation to the
Feaſt, now to be Solemniz'd there, there were
ſeveral Triumphal Arches erected in the Middle
of the Church, which afforded a Lively Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of the Hiſtory of S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> who by her
Conſtancy Triumphed over all the Torments which
Tyrants could inflict upon her.</p>
               <p>This whole Hiſtory was repreſented to the Life,
with little Scrowls of Silk: Theſe are of different
Sizes, and of all ſorts of Colours. They know the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57009:113"/>
ſet Price they are to pay for an Hundred Ells there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ready wrought, and every one chuſeth what
pleaſeth them beſt. There are a ſort of Men at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> who are called
<hi>Addobbatori,</hi> or <hi>Adorners of Churches;</hi> theſe Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the Silk themſelves, and are extreamly Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
and Artificial to Fold and Form them, in all
manner of Shapes and Figures. They had been
three Weeks a preparing theſe Ornaments I am
ſpeaking of: There were two Theaters erected on
each ſide of the Quire, which were Embelliſh'd
all over with Hiſtories Repreſented in the foreſaid
Silken Figures; the one being deſigned for the
Vocal Muſick, the other for the Inſtrumental, each
conſiſting of Fifty Muſicians: Beſides theſe there
were in a little Box near the Altar, Four Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
called <hi>Sing-alones,</hi> which were ſaid to be Four
of the beſt Muſicians that were in <hi>Rome;</hi> who
were to ſing by themſelves, the one after the other.
They never go any where to Sing, but they are
paid 40 Crowns for each <hi>Motet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Italians,</hi> more than any other Nation of
the World, Love Conſorts of Muſick, and thoſe
amongſt them, that have good Ears follow theſe
excellent Muſicians to all places, ſo that there was a
vaſt concourſe to this Church. When I entred,
the Muſick was not yet begun, and I took my
place near to the Throne, where theſe Gentlemen
were ſeated. They ſeemed to be ſomewhat reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
to have <hi>Veſpers</hi> or Evening Song begin, for it
was already near ſix a Clock, and all the Wax Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
had already been Lighted above a quarter of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57009:113"/>
an hour, and the Muſicians were all at their Poſts.
Some Boys that had counted the Wax Tapers,
ſaid there were Four Hundred and Forty of them,
of an extraordinary white Wax. However, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
all Impatient as they were, durſt not order
the beginning of the Ceremony, becauſe the Fair
<hi>Agnes,</hi> for whoſe dear ſake all theſe Preparations
were made, was not yet come: And foraſmuch as
they were willing not to be underſtood, they made
uſe of the little <hi>French</hi> they had Learnt, to talk
to one another. The Principal, (who was at the
Coſt of this Feſtival, ſomewhat to quiet the mind of
his Companions) told them, he was aſſured his
<hi>Agnes</hi> would quickly be there; that he had ſent
one of his Lackeys, to come and give him notice,
as ſoon as he ſhould ſee her ſet forth from home;
that ſhe preciſely knew the hour, and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to be there, ſhe would certainly be as good
as her Word. <hi>Some of them anſwer'd him,</hi> That
they feard leſt her Mother, who was very Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and Humorſom, might keep her at home;
and adviſed him to ſend another Lackey to acquaint
her Mother, That if ſhe would not ſuffer her
Daughter to come, <hi>ſhe ſhould repent it.</hi> But juſt
as they were in Conſultation about this Point, in
comes the firſt Lackey, and tells his Maſter that
the long look'd for <hi>Agnes</hi> was coming, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
very near the Church. Whereupon, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
a Signal was given to the Muſicians to be
in a readineſs, and at the very Moment ſhe ſet
her Foot in the Church, upon another Signal given
them, they Thundred away the firſt <hi>Anthem</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:57009:114"/>
of the Common Even. Song for the Feaſt of
Virgins, beginning thus, <hi>Haec eſt Virgo Sapiens &amp;
una de numero Prudentium. This is a wiſe Virgin
and one of the number of the Prudent ones.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
our Gentlemen in a trice changed their reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
into an exceſs of Joy and Satisfaction,
which might eaſily be read in their Faces. I heard
them ſay, That Ladies often took Pleaſure to make
their Lovers wait for them, to make their Preſence,
after a long Attendance the more acceptable and
welcom. I ſhould never have known this fair
Idol, amongſt thoſe throngs of Ladies, that entred
every Moment, if the young Gentleman, who had
prepared all this Incenſe for her, had not gone to
meet her, and lead her to her place. She ſeem'd
to me very Modeſtly Dreſt, having her Head co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with a large Black Scarf, which almoſt
reach'd down to her Feet: Her Face was wholly
cover'd, according to the Cuſtom of the Romiſh
Ladies, whenever they go abroad: Her Mother
follow'd her, the Cuſtom of the Country being for
the Daughters to go before, and the Mothers after.
Near to the Throne where theſe Gentlemen were
ſeated, there was prepared for her a <hi>Reading-Desk,</hi>
cover'd with a very fair Carpet of Blew Velvet ſet
round with a deep Golden Fringe, and great
Cuſhions of the ſame Richly Embroider'd, whereon
ſhe and her Mother Kneel'd down. I was very
near her, and obſerv'd that as long as the Muſick
laſted, ſhe did her utmoſt endeavour, under pretext
of Sticking ſome Pins about her Head, to diſcover
ſome part of her Face, in favor of thoſe Gentlemen,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57009:114"/>
who had their Eyes almoſt continually fix'd upon
her; ſhe made a ſhift to ſend them ſome Smiles,
and to make Signs to them with her Eyes: Her
Breaſts were Scandalouſly expoſed to View, for
there being nothing to cover them, ſave only that
part of her Veil, which hung down over them, ſhe
knew ſo dexterouſly to play with it, that every
one, who was not depriv'd of his Eye-ſight, might
at times have a full View of them. In the mean
time the Muſick was Incomparable and Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all the Anthems that were Sung, thô
for the moſt part they were taken out of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi>
were more applicable to this young <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ady,
than to S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> whoſe Feaſt they pretended to
Celebrate. Whilſt I was here, I chanc'd to caſt
an Eye upon a Picture of this Saint, which was
placed upon the Altar, at which the Maſſes were
to be ſaid the next Morning, and I eaſily percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it to be the very Face of <hi>Agnes Victorini,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
only, that it was ſurrounded with Rayes, as
the Saints are uſed to be, and that they had Painted
a little Lamb by her, as is Cuſtomary in all the
Repreſentations of S. <hi>Agnes.</hi> I ſaw by this, that
the young Gentleman had forgot nothing that
might manifeſt his Devotion to his Lady, having taken
care to place her upon the very Altars, there to be
Ador'd by every one. About the middle of the Even-Song,
two of theſe Gentlemen took a great Charger,
full of Flowers, with an intent to preſent all the
Ladies there preſent, with Noſegaies made of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natians,</hi>
Knops of <hi>Roſes,</hi> and <hi>Orange Flowers</hi>
mix'd together, (for at <hi>Rome</hi> you may have any
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57009:115"/>
ſort of Flowers at any Seaſon of the year,) they
were tied together with a Golden-Twiſt, to which
was faſtned a fair Knot of about three or four Yards
of Riband; ſo that each Noſegay could not be
worth leſs than two Crowns, or thereabouts. The
firſt of theſe was preſented to the Fair <hi>Agnes;</hi> and
I took notice, that there was a little Note convey'd
between the Flowers, which ſhe immediately took
thence and put into her <hi>Hours,</hi> or Book of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to peruſe it. It was not poſſible for me to
diſcern the Contents, and tho' I was very nigh to
her, I could not diſcover any more than theſe two
words, <hi>Mia Diva; My Goddeſs.</hi> No ſooner were
theſe Noſegays diſtributed, but there came flying
from the upper Galleries of the Church a vaſt
quantity of Printed Papers, which the People ſtrove
to catch. Theſe Prints contain'd Sonnets in the
praiſe of St. <hi>Agnes,</hi> but which really and indeed
reach'd the Lady, much more than the Saint, for
the Poem was almoſt a continual alluſion to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories;
being a ſufficient hint they were calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
for her, whoſe Name was <hi>Victorini.</hi> This
Concert of Muſick laſted almoſt four Hours, and
it was very late before all was over; however, ſo
exceeding charming and delightful was the Muſick,
that it ſeem'd to me I had not been above half an
Hour in the Church.</p>
               <p>The next day I return'd thither again, and was
preſent at the whole Service; which was celebrated
with all the Pomp and Solemnity imaginable. All
the Morning they celebrated a great number of
Maſſes, and many Abbots (to honour the young
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57009:115"/>
                  <hi>Carpegna</hi> and his Miſtreſs) came and ſaid Maſs at
the Altar, but now mention'd, before the fair Image.
At the beginning of High Maſs, they threw down
from the upper Galleries other Sonnets; ſome of
them in praiſe of S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> and others in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the young Gentleman, who was the
Maſter of the Feſtival: For the Prieſts of this
Church finding themſelves much oblig'd to him, for
that he had been pleaſed to make choice of their
Church for this Solemnity (whence they always
reap a conſiderable Profit) had cauſed this Poem
to be made in praiſe of his great Devotion and
extraordinary worth. There are a ſort of Men in
<hi>Italy,</hi> whom they call <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> or <hi>Poets,</hi> who make
a livelyhood of Praiſing others; that is, of making
Encomiaſtical Songs or Poems. Neither is it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penceful
to make uſe of their Wit; for if you do
but give them the Subject, they furniſh you with
a good one for a ſingle Crown; ſo that you are
at no further Charges, ſave only that of printing
it.</p>
               <p>It was One of the Clock in the Afternoon by
that time the Morning-Service was ended, when the
Ladies retir'd to their own Homes, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with the Prieſts to an Apartment near the
<hi>Church of Peace,</hi> whither they had taken care to
ſend abundance of Proviſions, to make a ſumptuous
Dinner. The Muſicians retired into the Sextry,
whither ſome Hours after they ſent in to them
ſeveral large Diſhes of Meat, abundance of all
ſorts of Wine, with Sugar'd and Cooling-Waters.
The Notes, diſtributed to that purpoſe, ſpecified,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57009:116"/>
That the ſecond Even-ſong was to begin about
Three in the Afternoon; wherefore I made it my
buſineſs to be there about that time; but I found
I was come too ſoon, for the Muſicians had not
Din'd yet, more Diſhes of Meat being ſtill ſent
in to them, neither did Service begin till about
Five of the Clock; and the ſame Order was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
as at the former Even-ſong, except only that
the Verſes and Anthems were chang'd, and that
the Ladies (before they departed) were not only
preſented with Noſegays, as before, but with great
Chargers of Sweet-meats, with which they fill'd
their Handkerchiefs, and ſo return'd home laden
with Flowers and Fruits. The young <hi>Carpegna</hi>
not a little proud and pleas'd, for having ſo mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently
diſcharg'd all the parts of that Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
receiv'd the Congratulatory Applauſes of all
his Companions; and another of them (whoſe
Turn was next) appointed the next Sunday for a
like Feſtival to be celebrated at the Church of
S. <hi>Andrew of the Valley,</hi> where he had ordered all
things to be prepared for the ſolemnizing of the
Feaſt of S. <hi>Catharine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was willing, Sir, ſomewhat to enlarge my ſelf
in the deſcription of the Particulars of this Feaſt;
not as if it were a thing rare and extraordinary,
(for indeed, what I have here related is but as
One of a Thouſand that I have ſeen, and which
it wou'd be very ſuperfluous to repeat to you,
there being indeed nothing more common in <hi>Italy;</hi>)
but my deſign was only to give you a more diſtinct
Idea of this thing, when you ſhall chance to hear
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57009:116"/>
any diſcourſe concerning theſe <hi>Italian</hi> Feaſts. I
have liv'd Seven years in that Country, and in all
that time, never did a Week paſs over my Head,
in which I was not preſent at ſome or other of
them; wherefore I have reaſon to be able, to
ſpeak with good ground concerning them. I ſhall
only add one thing, which may well make the
<hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> bluſh; <hi>viz.</hi> That it is at theſe
ſorts of Feaſts, that young Women are debauch'd
and corrupted.</p>
               <p>There are Bawds, who (by their Emiſſaries) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with the places where any of theſe
Feaſts are to be kept, whereupon they never fail
to reſort thither in Troops, very Laſciviouſly dreſt:
And as for other Women and Maidens, as the only
pretext they can have to oblige their Parents or
Husbands to let them go abroad, is that of going
to Church; they continually ſigh and long for
theſe ſorts of Feaſts, to have ſo fair an opportunity
to go abroad and divert themſelves. 'Tis at theſe
Feaſts, I ſay, that Meetings are appointed, and
Notes ſecretly convey'd; here it is they learn to
make Love with the Eyes, and to diſcourſe one
another by Geſts and Signs; and in a word, here
it is, O ſhame! that their lewd and infamous Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
are made. Neither do I aſſert ought in all
this, but what is fully confirm'd by their own
Proverb; which tells us, <hi>Chi manda la ſua figliuola
ad ogni Feſta, in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oco Tempo ne fa una Puttana;
That he who ſends his Daughter to every Feast,
will make her a Whore in a ſhort time.</hi> The
Young and Married Women ſeat themſelves on
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57009:117"/>
each ſide of the Church, and the Gentlemen walk
in the midſt, whereby they have an opportunity
to look them in the Face. They Puſh one another,
they Laugh, they Talk aloud, and entertain one
another with Diſcourſes, very unbecoming the
Sacredneſs of the place where they are. The Holy
Sacrament, which they believe to be the True
living Body of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, is for the
moſt part expoſed upon the High Altar, or in ſome
particular Chappel, to make the Solemnity the
greater; but they have ſo little reſpect for it, that
they turn their Backs upon it, to face the Ladies
and Muſicians. Whence it is evident, That they
do but very ſlightly, if at all, believe that main
Point of their Doctrin, or at leaſt, that their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
gives their Faith the Lye. The Prieſts reap
a conſiderable advantage from theſe Feaſts; for all
the Ceremonies they officiate, and the Maſſes they
ſay, are very dearly paid them, and are highly
Feaſted into the bargain.</p>
               <p>But more particularly, we meet with theſe kind
of Feaſts very frequent in Convents or Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
the Religious whereof may be diſtinguiſh'd
into three ſorts, either ſuch as are endowed with
Means for their Subſiſtence, as generally all thoſe
call'd <hi>Monks</hi> are; or elſe they live partly of their
Incoms, and partly of Alms, as are all thoſe who
are called <hi>Frati,</hi> or <hi>Fryers;</hi> or laſtly, they are ſuch
who live wholly upon Alms, as the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and
other <hi>Mendicant</hi> Orders. Now each of theſe are
very ambitious, and do their utmoſt endeavours to
have of theſe Feaſts made in their Churches.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57009:117"/>
The Monks deſire it, to make a ſhew of their
Riches and Grandeur; the whole Ceremony is
carried on at their own Charges, and the Feaſt
they make is called a <hi>Pontifical,</hi> and is indeed the
moſt pompous and magnificent Show, that can be
ſeen.</p>
               <p>I will endeavour to give you here the moſt exact
Deſcription of it, that poſſibly I can. To this
purpoſe I will take for my Subject one of thoſe I
ſaw in the Famous Abby of S. <hi>Michael</hi> in <hi>Boſco</hi>
of <hi>Bononia,</hi> where I Taught for Two years
together, the Monks whereof are of the Order of
Mount <hi>Olivet.</hi> The Abbot is not Commendatory,
but Regular, and has the power of officiating Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifically.
He caus'd his <hi>Pontifical</hi> to be publiſh'd
in <hi>Bononia,</hi> Three Weeks before the Feaſt of S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
Founder of their Order, which hapned to
be on a Thurſday; and accordingly the firſt Even-Song
began on Wedneſday in the Evening. The
Church of this Abby is a meer Jewel of a thing,
for the extraordinary curioſity of the <hi>Marble,
Jaſper,</hi> and <hi>Porphyrie</hi> Stones, that do in part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and embelliſh it; the Guilding and Painting
that adorn it, are of an ineſtimable price; the
Roof and all the Walls of the Church are Guilt;
the High-Altar, as well as the other leſſer ones of
the Chappels, are all of Precious Stones. All the
Seats of the Quire are of In-laid Work, wherein
the whole Life of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and many Hiſtories of
the Bible are repreſented; the Balliſters of Iron,
that ſhut the Quire and Chappels, are all Gilt, and
very delicately Wrought; the Pavement is of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57009:118"/>
black and white Marble; inſomuch that there is
not the leaſt part in the whole Church, that ſtands
in need of any ſuperadded Ornament. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this, the Abbot ſent for the moſt
dexterous Adorners of Churches to ſet it forth,
with the Silken Machins of <hi>Bononia,</hi> with which all
the Windows and Walls of the Church were fill'd,
affording various Hiſtorical Repreſentations; tho',
to ſpeak the Truth, this was a very needleſs Coſt,
becauſe what was hid by theſe Silken-Figures was
more curious and coſtly, than the Figures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
He order'd Arms of Silver to be fixed
round the Church, and Candleſticks of the ſame,
to be placed on all the Corniſhes and Pillars of
the Church, to ſupport a prodigious number of
white Wax-Candles, which were to burn all the
time of the Service. The High-Altar was ſet as
thick as it could hold with Plate, brought out of
the Treaſury of that Abby, to make a ſhow of it
to all Men. About Three of the Clock in the
Afternoon, the Abbot (accompanied with all his
Monks) and many Gentlemen of his Relations and
Friends following him, marched forwards towards
the Church. He was Apparel'd in the Habit of
his Order, being diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt of the
Monks by his Ring, his Hood, and his four
Corner'd Cap. The Monks of this Abby are wont
to enter into the Church by the Gate of the
Cloiſter which is near the Choir; but for the more
State, and to make a greater ſhow of their Abbot
in all his Pomp and Majeſty, they choſe this time
to come out of the Monaſtery, and to take a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57009:118"/>
Round, in order to their Entring the Church by
the Great Gate, at the Weſt-end of it. As ſoon as
they entred, the Bells, Organs, and other Muſical
Inſtruments ſounded a March; and as for the
Monks, they gave forth ſuch an Air in their going,
as diſcover'd rather the Vanity of their Hearts, than
that Majeſty which becomes the Miniſters at the
Altar.</p>
               <p>When they were come into the Church, the
Abbot made a Halt before the Chappel of S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
which is at the Lower-end of the Church,
and kneeled down upon Cuſhions of Violet-colour'd
Velvet, very richly Embroidered, which
were laid upon a Desk, cover'd with a Carpet of
the ſame, garniſh'd with a rich Golden-Fringe.
And at the ſame time the Muſicians ſung an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them
in praiſe of that Saint. After this the Abbot
was conducted to his Throne, which they had
erected at the Right ſide of the Altar. It was
cover'd on high with a magnificent Canopy of
State, and ſurrounded with ſeveral Seats, very
richly Adorn'd, for all the Officers that were to
officiate at the <hi>Pontifical.</hi> Being arrived here, he
ſeated himſelf, having two Abbots of his Friends
on each ſide of him; and immediately Fourteen of
his Monks, in their Surplices, went and took the
Ornaments that were laid on Tables placed near the
High Altar, wherewith he was to be inveſted; and
having each of them taken what belong'd to their
place, they rang'd themſelves one behind another,
making a long Row. The firſt of them carried in
a large Silver-gilt-Charger the <hi>Abbatical Buskins;</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:57009:119"/>
the ſecond, in another like Charger, the <hi>Abbatical

Linnen, Lac'd round about, and at the Hands, with
a very curious <hi>Point de Venice</hi> of a Foot deep;
the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h follow'd with a very coſtly <hi>Girdle</hi> of
white Silk woven and wrought to admiration; the
ſixth carried the <hi>Stole;</hi> the ſeventh and eighth,
each of them a <hi>Tunicle</hi> of white Taffety; the
ninth had the <hi>Cap,</hi> which like the <hi>Stole</hi> was of
Cloth of Gold, the Edges of it being rais'd by
Embroidery into ſeveral curious Figures, compos'd
of Seed-Pearl, and furniſh'd with Golden Claſps;
the tenth carried the <hi>Little Croſs</hi> of <hi>Diamonds,</hi>
valued at Two Thouſand Crowns; the eleventh,
in a great Charger gilt and enamel'd, carried the
<hi>Abbatical Gloves;</hi> and the twelfth, the <hi>Abbatical Ring,</hi>
being an <hi>Amethist</hi> of an extraordinary ſize; the
thirteenth follow'd with the <hi>Mitre,</hi> thick ſet with
Pearls and precious Stones; and the fourteenth and
laſt, carried the <hi>Croſier</hi> or <hi>Paſtoral Staff.</hi> Every
one of theſe in order, as they drew near to the
Abbot (ſeated on his Throne) bowed the Knee
before him; and after they had deliver'd their
ſeveral Charges into the hand of the Aſſiſtant
Abbots, who were to Attire their Prelate, having
firſt worſhip'd him with another Genuflexion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
again in good order. At every Ornament
that was put upon him, there were particular
Prayers which the Aſſiſting Abbots repeated, and
the Officiating Prelat read himſelf in the Pontifical
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57009:119"/>
Book, which was ſupported by two Monks; and
two others, in their Surplices and Tunicles, held
Wax Candles to light him, whilſt the Maſter of
Ceremonies turn'd the Leaves for him.</p>
               <p>The Abbot being Accoutred with all theſe Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and having the Mitre on his Head, ſeated
himſelf on his Throne in the midſt of the two
Abbots Aſſiſtants; and immediately all the Officers,
who were to officiate at the Ceremony, ranged
themſelves near to him. Theſe Officers were four
Chaunters in their <hi>Rochets</hi> and <hi>Hoods,</hi> four Sub-Chaunters
in their <hi>Surplices,</hi> two Deacons in their
<hi>Stoles</hi> and <hi>Tunicles,</hi> two Sub-Deacons in their <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi>
two Taper-Bearers to hold the <hi>Candlesticks,</hi>
and two Incenſe-Bearers, dreſt in <hi>Surplices</hi> and their
<hi>Silver Cenſers</hi> in their Hands; beſides another
Officer to hold the <hi>Croſier-Staff,</hi> and the Maſter of
Ceremonies with his <hi>Rod</hi> or <hi>Wand.</hi> All theſe
were only to Officiate till about the middle of
Even-ſong; at which time, as if they had been
extreamly tired with the Attendance they had
given, they were relieved by others, yet more gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly
Apparel'd, who were to Officiate till the
Service was ended. Their Muſick was very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and choice: The Abbot ſung the firſt Verſe
of Even-ſong, which was continued by the Muſick
and Singing-men with abundance of Ceremonies,
which I ſhall not inſiſt upon at preſent, that

Biſhop or Archbiſhop that Officiates, the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
is much greater; and if it be a Cardinal or
Pope that celebrates the Feaſt, theſe Ceremonies
are carried to the higheſt point of Elevation and
Grandeur imaginable.</p>
               <p>I remember to have Read ſomewhere in an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Author, the Commendations and
Elogies he beſtows upon thoſe of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
in this Point of Ceremonies, ſaying, <hi>That
in this only they are Praiſe-worthy and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
that they ſpare nothing that may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Coſtlineſs and Solemnity of their Feaſts.</hi>
For my part, I have very induſtriouſly apply'd my
ſelf, to ſearch out the Principle from whence ſo much
falſe Luſtre doth proceed, which they make uſe of
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to dazle the Eyes of the
inconſiderate and unthinking People; and I have
found, That it is not their great Zeal for the
Houſe of God that is the Motive of it, but only
Intereſt, Vain-glory and Self-love, as I abundantly
diſcover'd upon this occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Even-ſong ended, about Six of the Clock
in the Evening; after which, the Abbot and his
Officers, having put off their Ornaments, went
into the <hi>Sextry,</hi> where they found great Tables
cover'd and thick ſet with dry and wet Confects,
Neats-Tongues, <hi>Bononia</hi>-Sauſages, and ſine Paſtry-meat.
All the Ladies and Gentlemen of Quality,
that were in the Church, were deſired to enter; and
as for my ſelf, having a free acceſs to that Abby,
as being in a manner one of the Family; becauſe
I publickly taught there the Liberal Arts, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57009:120"/>
had a good Allowance, beſides the Abbots Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
I entred into the <hi>Sextry</hi> with them, and
had moreover the Priviledge of bringing ſome
Frenchmen of my Acquaintance in with me, which
are now in <hi>London.</hi> The Gentlemen and Ladies
were not wanting to beſtow great <hi>Encomiums</hi> on
the Abbot, each declaring how admirable well his
Pontifical Habit did become him, and how grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
he did Officiate. In the mean time the Monks
apply'd themſelves to the Ladies of their Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and entred into cloſe Diſcourſe with them,
but what it was, I could not be Witneſs to; only
thus much I can aver, That their Beauty had ſo
far charm'd them, that for a whole Month after it
was the great Subject of their Diſcourſe. It ſeems
they had ſo well ſtudied them, during the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
they had with them, that they could give
an exact account of the Cloaths, Ribands, and
Laces they had on.</p>
               <p>The Abbot (during the Entertainment) Addreſt
himſelf to two Ladies of Quality, the one a Lady
Marqueſs, and the other a Counteſs; and demanded
of them, Whether they had not found a deſire
ſtirring in them, to perſuade ſome of their Children
to become Religious of his Order? The Lady
Marqueſs Anſwer'd, <hi>She would conſider of it.</hi> But
the Counteſs very frankly aſſur'd him, <hi>That ſhe had
been ſo extreamly ſatisfied with the</hi> Pontifical,
<hi>which had been celebrated with ſo much Pomp and
Majeſty, that it had even Raviſh'd her; and that
ſhe was abſolutely reſolv'd, her Son ſhould take the
Habit of the Order.</hi> She told the Abbot, <hi>That</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:57009:121"/>
the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> did their utmost Endeavours, to draw
him over to them; but that ſhe would be ſure
to break all their Meaſures, and hop'd that her Son
would behave himſelf ſo well in the Monaſtery,
that one day ſhe might have the Joy and Comfort,
to ſee him made Abbot of the Order, and Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically
Officiating.</p>
               <p>All our good Natur'd Monks, in the mean time,
notwithſtanding all the pains they had taken in
aſſiſting at the Church-Ceremonies, were very
ready to wait upon the Fair Ladies at Table, and
to keep them Company, as being in this regard a
Thouſandfold more happy, than other <hi>Italian</hi> Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who have not the Priviledge of making
Feaſts, to get a Sight of their Ladies, and who can
ſcarcely ever meet with an opportunity of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
them the like Services. I cannot deny, but
that ſome of theſe Ladies were of Kin to them;
but however, it muſt needs be a great ſatisfaction
to have an occaſion of Treating them ſo ſplendidly
out of the publick Stock of the Abby, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done, but in thoſe ſorts of Ceremonies: For
at any time, if they deſire to do it, it muſt coſt
them a Round Sum of Mony. The Ladies, in the
mean while, were in ſo a good Humor, and ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
well pleas'd, as well with their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
in the Church, as in the Sextry, That they
very freely ask'd the Abbot, When they might expect
to come to another <hi>Pontifical?</hi> Who promis'd
them, to celebrate another on the Day of S. <hi>Francis,</hi>
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>

It is impoſſible, Sir, you ſhould not take notice
in all this I have related to you, concerning the
Solemnity of this Feaſt, what indeed were the true
Motives of it. The Abbot hereby pleaſed his
Vainglorious humor, by appearing in a Pontifical
Dreſs, with ſo many pompous Ornaments, amidſt
ſo many Adorations and ſo many Incenſings as were
preſented to him. Beſides this, he made alſo his
Advantage of it; for from hence he took occaſion
to ſollicit Perſons of Quality, after he had dazled
their Eyes with the magnificent Splendor of his <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical,</hi>
to perſuade their Children to take the Habit
of the Order. I know very well how gainful it
is to the Abbot and other Principal Officers of the
Abby, when the Children of Perſons of Quality
take upon them the Habit. They never admit them
to the Profeſſion, till their Parents have preſented
them very liberally, beſides the Annual Penſion
they are bound to allow their Son; and the more
Honourable the Perſons are, the more conſiderable
ſtill are the Preſents that are made them. The reſt
of the Religious find their pleaſure and ſatisfaction
in theſe Feſtivals; their Eyes are feaſted with the
ſumptuous Adorning of their Churches, and their
Ears with the ſweetneſs of the moſt choice and
exquiſit Muſick; neither is the Feaſt that concludes
the Solemnity, and the Ladies company, the leaſt
Charm to make them deſirable: So that in a word,
the Glory of God, and the Zeal of his Holy
Temple, are at the beſt, and to ſpeak moſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably,
but the more remote Object of theſe Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Solemnities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:57009:122"/>
I have already told you in one of my LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS,
That I fear'd to paſs for a Severe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
in your Judgment, who takes pleaſure to put
a rigorous Senſe upon Actions, otherwiſe capable
of a favourable Interpretation; and for this Reaſon,
I always back what I ſay with the Reaſons that
induce me to paſs theſe ſorts of Judgments; and I
queſtion not in the leaſt, but that if you will be
pleas'd well to weigh them, you'l find that I have
us'd abundance of Moderation in my Expreſſions.
To apply this therefore to the preſent Subject, I
ſhall proceed to tell you, That the Feſtival of
S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> approaching, on which Day
the Abbot had promis'd the Ladies another <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical,</hi>
Preparations were made for greater Pomp
and Splendor, than before had been at the Feaſt
of S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> They had ſent for Muſicians from
<hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> who two days before the
Feaſt were arrived at the Abby, where they were
very ſplendidly Entertain'd. The Evening before,
the Abbot and the Monks pray'd heartily for fair
Weather; and the Air being at that time very clear
and ſerene, there was all the appearance imaginable
that it would continue ſo; which Hopes fill'd them
with unutterable Joys. There was only one good
old Convert Fryer amongſt them, who being
better inform'd than all this, by the Twitches his
Corns gave him, very peremptorily aver'd, It
would Rain the next Day. Upon this ominous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation,
the Abbot himſelf went out after Supper,
to Star-gaze what Weather they were like to have
the next day; and ſeeing the Sky ſo very clear
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57009:122"/>
and full of Stars, declar'd, There was no need to
fear, but they ſhould have a fair Day on't, and
that the Old Fryer was a <hi>Turba Feſta,</hi> a meer
<hi>Trouble-Feaſt</hi> to talk ſo at random: Upon this
Aſſurance the Monks retir'd to their Apartments
that Evening with a great deal of Joy. But foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is not for Men to know the Times and
Seaſons, which God has reſerv'd in his own power,
about Midnight the Weather changed, and the
next Morning there fell ſo furious a Shower, that
it was impoſſible to ſtir abroad without being wet
to the Skin. This Tempeſtous Weather continu'd
till Night, which ſeiz'd the Spirits of the poor
Monks with a ſtrange Conſternation. The next
Morning they appear'd all Pail-fac'd, and gave
evident Proof, how great a Change croſt Deſires
are able to produce in the Body of Man. Some of
them openly murmur'd againſt Heaven, becauſe
that almoſt every Year it diſturbed or diſappointed
their Feaſt of S. <hi>Francis;</hi> others of them retain'd
ſtill ſome hope, that the Rain might hold up
within few Hours; but alas! their Hopes were all
in vain; the Heavens were too reſolv'd, and the
Storm was ſo far from ceaſing or diminiſhing, that
it increas'd more and more. The Abbot perceiving
there was no Remedy, ſent word to the Sexton, to
ſhut up the Ornaments of the <hi>Pontifical;</hi> however,
he order'd the Muſick ſhould Play, becauſe the
Muſicians were preſent, and that moſt of them
were paid before hand; but he forbad the great
Rows of Wax-Candles to be Lighted, which had
been diſpoſed of round the Church, or to burn
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57009:123"/>
the Incenſe that had been prepared for the Altars:
So that, excepting only the Muſick, the Office was
very ſimply and plainly celebrated after the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner. The Abbot did not appear at it
himſelf, and all this great Pomp and Solemnity
vaniſh'd in Smoak.</p>
               <p>Now I deſire you, Sir, only to draw a rational
and obvious Conſequence from all theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Can you perſuade your ſelf, that God or
the Saint were the Object or Motive of all this
ado? God is Immenſe and Infinite, every where
preſent, whether it be fair or foul; and the Saint
alſo is ſuppos'd to be always the ſame in Heaven:
How came it to paſs then, that the Solemnity was
chang'd, and put off; but becauſe the Gentlemen
and Ladies that had been Invited, and for whoſe
ſake the Feaſt was intended, could not come?
<hi>Sublatâ cauſâ tollitur effectus; Take away the
Cauſe, and the Effect ceaſeth.</hi> Or can we draw a
more juſt Conſequence, or more proper to ſtop the
Mouths of our Adverſaries of the <hi>Romiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
who object to us their Divine Service, as
celebrated with ſo much Pomp and Magnificence,
and who find ſo much fault with the Simplicity
and Modeſty of ours? When they celebrate their
<hi>Mattins,</hi> or <hi>Morning Service,</hi> or their greateſt
Holidays before Day-light, they ſcarcely Light
Two Wax-Candles on the Altar, (<hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſay
they, <hi>no body frequents them</hi>); whereas in the Day
time, when there is abundance of Company, they
Light a matter of Three or Four hundred. May
we not therefore with great Reaſon reproach them,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57009:123"/>
That all their Pompous Feaſts and Solemnities, are
only to ſatisfie their own Pleaſure, Vain-glory and
Avarice? and that therefore God abhors and
abominates theſe their Services; ſo far are they from
being any proof of the Truth of their Religion.
In the mean time I muſt needs acknowledge,
That this is that which deludes many, and is a
Stone of Offence to all thoſe, who in Matters of
Religious Worſhip conſider only that which ſtrikes
the Senſes.</p>
               <p>I knew a Papiſt in <hi>England,</hi> that was turn'd
Proteſtant many years before, who told me he was
returning again to <hi>Italy,</hi> in order to joyn himſelf
again to the <hi>Romiſh Communion;</hi> and his Reaſon
was, <hi>Becauſe forſooth, the Divine Service was not
ſolemniz'd here with that Solemnity, as it was in
his Country.</hi> I wonder, why by the dint of the
ſame Argument he was not perſwaded to turn
<hi>Jew,</hi> who uſe yet more Ceremonies than the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or rather, I am aſtoniſh'd he
did not conſider with himſelf, That all theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and Pompous Vanities being only Arbitrary
things, which depend only on the Will of Men,
if the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were inclin'd that way, might
contrive and inſtitute ſuch as ſhould be more
Magnificent than thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and might make
their Biſhops to appear every day in as pompous
Ornaments, as the Pope does on S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Day:
And if they don't do it, the Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe they
are well perſuaded, that what is moſt pleaſing in the
Eyes of Men, is not always moſt acceptable to God,
who requires pure and holy Hearts, and not rich and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57009:124"/>
pompous Apparel, and to whom the fervency of
our Prayers is far more acceptable, than Clouds of
the ſweeteſt Incenſe.</hi> Beſides, the Service and
Worſhip of God, as it is celebrated in their
Churches, is not altogether deſtitute of decent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
neither: The Miniſters Habit is ſuch as
diſtinguiſheth them from all others in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
but yet ſo, as without any thing of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition;
there is no Divine Virtue attributed to
them, that renders the Wearers thereof more holy
than others; whereas, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
ſhould a Prieſt celebrate Maſs without his Hood, or
<hi>Amict,</hi> and that wilfully, they hold it to be a
Mortal Sin.</p>
               <p>I return now to our Feaſts again, and having
given you an account how the ſame are celebrated
by thoſe Monks who live upon their Incoms; I
ſhall proceed now to thoſe of other Religious, who
partly live of Incoms and partly of Alms, as well
as of thoſe who live altogether of Alms, who are
known in <hi>Italy</hi> by the Name of <hi>Frati.</hi> During
my ſtay at <hi>Rome,</hi> I went to the <hi>Minerva,</hi> which
is a Famous Convent of the <hi>Dominicans;</hi> it was
on a <hi>Saturday,</hi> at which time they were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
a Feſtival in Honour of the <hi>Roſary</hi> of the
<hi>Bleſſed Virgin.</hi> I learnt, That the Heads of that
Confraternity met every <hi>Saturday,</hi> and did every
one of them by Turns celebrate the Feaſt of the
<hi>Roſary</hi> at their own Charges. 'Tis the Humor
of the <hi>Italians,</hi> in ſuch like caſes, to ſtrive for the
Honour of ſurpaſſing one another, and ſpare no
Coſt, to the end they may in Magnificence outvy
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57009:124"/>
others; This is an Emulation that is Natural to
them, and which I believe cannot with good
ground be attributed to their Vertue, becauſe herein
they feed their Vanity as much, as in thoſe ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<hi>Cavalcades</hi> they make, and in which (after
the ſame manner) their great aim is to outdo one
another.</p>
               <p>Theſe Religious, or <hi>Frati,</hi> have contrived a
Form of Feaſts for their own Tooth: The Monks
(as was ſaid before) make them at their own
Charges, and to ſet forth their Riches and Glory;
but theſe always celebrate them upon other Mens
Purſes, and with ſuch Caution, as withal to fill
their own into the bargain. The Laws they have
eſtabliſh'd to this purpoſe, are, That whoſoever
cauſeth a Feaſt to be ſolemniz'd, muſt ſend before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
a ſufficient Sum of Mony, to defray all the
Maſſes that the Religious of the Convent do cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
that Day: In the ſecond place, he muſt be
at all the Charge of Adorning the Chappel, or
Church, where the Feaſt is to be kept; and in the
third place, he is oblig'd to ſend in a ſplendid
Dinner for all the good Fryers of the Convent.
Some amongſt them, for this very Reaſon, do very
aptly call theſe Feaſts, <hi>The Fryers Milch-Cows.</hi>
As for thoſe Fryers which are call'd <hi>Mendicants,</hi>
ſuch as the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and ſome others, who live
wholly of Alms; foraſmuch as they cannot, by
reaſon of their Vow of <hi>Poverty</hi> in Common, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any Mony for their <hi>Maſſes,</hi> there is this
difference, that inſtead of delivering the Mony for
that purpoſe into their own Hands, it is to be paid
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57009:125"/>
to him whom they call their Temporal Father, that
is a Layman, who has the diſpoſal of their Mony
for their uſe, and whom they call every Month to
an account, even to the utmoſt Farthing. Their
Patriarch, S. <hi>Francis,</hi> never dreamt of this piece
of ſubtilty, and conſequently alſo he has not made
the leaſt mention of it in his Rule, or Directory;
but as for theſe good Fathers, they have quite out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
him in refined Wit and Invention. They do
not think it convenient, ſo wholly to rely upon the
Divine Providence, as not to think their own the
more ſafe and ſure way. <hi>What would you have
us do?</hi> (ſay they) <hi>alas! the Times are changed,
and Laymen are not ſo Charitable now, as they
were in the time of S.</hi> Francis! For my part, I
durſt undertake to prove to their Faces, That in
caſe they liv'd with as much Frugality as their
Ancient Fathers (who, to ſpeak Truth, are of no
great Antiquity neither) they would find Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
People enough, to furniſh them with a
ſufficiency, for a Sober and Penitential Diet. But
who would take delight to incommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to Cram a Company of Lazy Lubbers, who
do nothing but go from Houſe to Houſe to fill
their Bellies, eſpecially leading ſo ſcandalous a
Life as they do? True it is, that by their Cunning
they have ſo order'd the Matter, that they want
for nothing; and one of the beſt Inventions they
have ever yet found out, to be ſumptuouſly and
delicately Treated, is their Feaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:57009:125"/>
And foraſmuch as a Regular Feaſt, I mean thoſe
that are mark'd in the Almanack, are only to be
found once in the Year, they have invented the
uſeful Contrivance of <hi>Confraternities,</hi> as being
moſt fruitful Nurſeries of Feaſts or Holy-days for
them, ſo as even to produce many for them in one
and the ſame Week. A <hi>Confraternity,</hi> according
to the definition they give us of it, is an Aſſociation
of many Perſons, who unite themſelves and agree
together, at certain Times, to render ſome Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worſhip to God, to the Virgin, or to ſome
other Saint, in ſuch a manner as is not common to
all: But at the bottom, it is indeed nothing elſe,
but the moſt ſure and refined Art the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> has to catch Mony; and they have always
ſome good Crafty. Father or other, that has the
Trade of Drawing-in People at his Fingers-end,
who is the Director of it: 'Tis to him all thoſe that
deſire to be Admitted to the <hi>Confraternity</hi> muſt
addreſs themſelves, where (for Writing down his
Name in the Book, and for Entrance-Mony) it coſts
him a Crown at leaſt; and every Year at the ſame
Day, he muſt come to have his Name renewed, and
pay over the ſame Entrance-Mony, as at his firſt
Admittance, otherwiſe you are without Mercy
moſt ignominiouſly Expell'd the <hi>Confraternity,</hi> and
from that time forwards are excluded from having
any ſhare in their <hi>Prayers,</hi> or partaking of their
<hi>Indulgences.</hi> Over and above all this, there is
ſome Mony to be paid every Month, towards the
Lights of the Chappel where the <hi>Confraternity</hi> is
erected; which, conſidering the vaſt Number of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57009:126"/>
thoſe who are Inroll'd in it, produceth a prodigious
Sum of Mony.</p>
               <p>The Leaſt <hi>Confraternities</hi> that are, conſiſt of
Three or Four hundred perſons; there are ſome
have a Thouſand, yea, Two or Three Thouſand
belonging to them. I have my ſelf ſeen above
Twenty Thouſand Names enroll'd in the Book of
the Confraternity of the <hi>Scapulary</hi> of the <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
of <hi>Milan;</hi> and in that of the great Confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
of the <hi>Roſary</hi> of S. <hi>John,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> of
<hi>Venice,</hi> I have been certainly inform'd, there are

                  </gap>orty Thouſand Brothers: Suppoſe every
one of the Brethren ſhould only give a Peny
every Months towards the Chappel-Lights, it
would be impoſſible to burn all the Wax-Candles
that Mony would buy; which by conſequence
turns to the profit of theſe good Fryers. They
are continually hankering about the Richeſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of their <hi>Confraternity,</hi> endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
them to make Feaſts in honour of the He or
She Saint, in whoſe Name their <hi>Confraternity</hi> is
erected.</p>
               <p>I hapned once to be in Company of an <hi>Italian</hi>
Count, who was of the <hi>Confraternity</hi> of the <hi>Little
Scapulary</hi> of the Virgin, erected in the Great
Convent of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> at the time
when the Father Director of the <hi>Confraternity</hi>
came in to him, and told him with a Smiling
Countenance, <hi>Conte Giovanni, I have a great
Complaint againſt you, from one of your very good
She Friends.</hi> The Count ſuppoſing it to be from
one of his Miſtreſſes, ask'd him, Who it was?
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57009:126"/>
The Director anſwer'd, <hi>That it was from the</hi>
Bleſſed Virgin, <hi>and that he had no Reaſon to doubt,
but that ſhe was very angry with him, for having
for ſo long a time neglected, to cauſe the Feaſt of
the</hi> Holy Scapulary <hi>to be celebrated.</hi> The Count
excuſed himſelf upon the account of ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
buſineſs, that had put him by his Thoughts
that way; and deſired the Director, to ſend him
in next Week the Liſt of their Religious. When
he was departed, the Count told me, That what
he had told him imply'd as much, as that he would
make the Feaſt of the <hi>Scapulary</hi> the next Week;
becauſe on the like occaſion it is cuſtomary, to
ſend in as many Couples of Capons and Bottles of
Wine, as there be Religious in the Convent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Mony to pay for the Maſſes that are to be
ſaid that Day; ſo that his demanding a Liſt of the
Director, was a full Intimation, that he had granted
his Suit; and accordingly he took his leave very
well ſatisfied, Saying, <hi>He would take care to pacifie
his She Friend.</hi> The Count told me afterwards,
That this Feaſt would coſt him a Round Sum, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
commonly the Note of the Director of the
<hi>Confraternity</hi> mounted very high, as well for the
Lights, as for the Muſicians and Adorners of the
Church.</p>
               <p>And in order to the multiplication of theſe
Feaſts, they have pitch'd upon one Day of the
Week, for the aſſembling or meeting together of
their <hi>Confraternities;</hi> that of the <hi>Roſary</hi> meets
every Saturday; of the <hi>Little Scapulary</hi> on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
as likewiſe that of the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> the

Confraternity of S. <hi>Francis</hi> his <hi>Cord</hi> on Fridays;
that of the <hi>Annunciation</hi> on Wedneſdays; that of
S. <hi>Antonio,</hi> on the Tueſdays; and laſtly, the Mondays
are peculiarly appropriated to the Confraternities
of the <hi>Souls in Purgatory.</hi> So that you ſee, they
are fairly provided with Feaſts for every Day of
the Week, and that without counting ſeveral other
particular <hi>Confraternities,</hi> the Number whereof is
unknown to me, theſe which I have mentioned
being only the more general. They are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
all of them to be met with in one Church,
nor in one and the ſame Order of Religious;
for the <hi>Roſary</hi> belongs to the <hi>Dominicans;</hi> the
<hi>Little Scapulary</hi> to the <hi>Carmelites;</hi> the Cord of
S. <hi>Francis</hi> to the <hi>Franciſcans;</hi> the <hi>Annunciation</hi> to
the <hi>Soccolanti;</hi> S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> appertains in
general to all the Religious, that live under the
Rule of S. <hi>Francis;</hi> and the <hi>Souls in Purgatory</hi> do
not only belong to all the Religious Orders, but alſo
to all Pariſhes and Churches under the inſpection of
Secular Prieſts.</p>
               <p>After all this, it cannot be deny'd, but that thoſe
of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> are certainly fallen in
love with their own Blindneſs, in that they will
not ſo much as take the pains to open their Eyes,
to ſee how miſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ably theſe Fellows gull and cheat
them: For what can be imagin'd more ridiculous,
than all theſe ſorts of <hi>Confraternities?</hi> Becauſe
S. <hi>Francis</hi> forſooth, wore a Cord or Rope inſtead
of a Girdle, they have erected a <hi>Confraternity</hi> in
Honour of it; accordingly every Brother of the
Society muſt wear a ſmall Cord: Theſe ſmall Cords
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57009:127"/>
or Bands, do not in the leaſt reſemble that which
S. <hi>Francis</hi> wore, which I have ſeen at <hi>Aſſize,</hi> and
is as thick as ſome of the greateſt Ropes, that wind
up Buckets in a Well; but theſe are very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately
wrought, and very artificially Knotted in
ſeveral places. The Cuſtom is, to bleſs them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
with many Ceremonies and Prayers; which
being performed, they tells us, <hi>They have the virtue
to blot out all Venial Sins; to drive away the
Devil, and troubleſom Temptations of the Fleſh.</hi>
Moſt of the Ladies of <hi>Italy</hi> wear this Cord of
S. <hi>Francis;</hi> they ty them round about their Bodies,
and the Ends of them reach to the bottom of their
Petty-coats; they are full of pretty little Knots,
and they ſerve them to Play withal, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Ladies do with their <hi>Fans</hi> or <hi>Masks.</hi> Were it true
indeed, That theſe Cords had the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
Carnal Temptations, the Ladies of <hi>Italy,</hi>
who wear ſuch lovely ones, could not fail of being
the Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſt Women in the World; and yet I am
ſure, this is not the Commendation that is given
them. But be it as it will, this <hi>Cord</hi> is a thing ſo
extraordinary Holy, that Great Feaſts are cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in Honour of it every Week in all the
Churches belonging to the <hi>Franciſcans;</hi> and the
Popes have been pleas'd to beſtow great Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
to all thoſe, who ſhall Enroll themſelves
in this Society of the <hi>Cord.</hi> They are only the
poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that do not enjoy all theſe fair
Advantages, becauſe they look upon them, as no
better than meer Folly; and for my part, I believe
they have very good Reaſon for being of this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57009:128"/>
Opinion; and that the ſureſt and ſafeſt way is, to
believe with them, That the only thing that can
make us of proof againſt all Temptations, and
endue us with power to overcome Sin, is the
<hi>Grace of God,</hi> and that by means of it alone, we
ſhall become Conquerors over the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi>
and the <hi>World,</hi> without the aſſiſtance of either <hi>Rope,</hi>
or <hi>Cord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Confraternity of the <hi>Roſary,</hi> is no leſs
Superſtitiouſly founded than the fore-going. Since
the <hi>Salutation</hi> of the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> to the <hi>Virgin,</hi>
has paſt in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the moſt Holy
Prayer that can be made to her, the Father <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,</hi>
who pretend to be the greateſt Favourites
of the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> to the end they might have
ſome particular Devotion to diſtinguiſh them from
the Common, have invented that which is now called
<hi>The Roſary,</hi> which is nothing elſe but an aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſeveral <hi>Ave Maries;</hi> there are Tentimes
Ten of them in the <hi>Roſary,</hi> and at the end of each
Ten they add the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi> And to the end
they may not fail of ſaying the juſt Number (for
in caſe one only <hi>Ave-Mary</hi> ſhould chance to be
omitted, it would be the loſs of the whole Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence)
they have brought into uſe their <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſters,</hi>
or <hi>Beads,</hi> by which they count the Prayers
as they ſay them, that there may be no miſtake.
And as it is the Belief of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
That the Elements and material Subjects of the
Sacraments, are not only Signs, but Phyſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Cauſes, producing Grace in the Soul: For
they ſay, That the <hi>Water</hi> in Baptiſm, the <hi>Oil</hi> in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57009:128"/>
the Extream Unction, and the Matter preſented in
the Collation of Orders, do phyſically produce
Grace in the Soul; ſo in like manner the Popes
have affixed to theſe <hi>Beads</hi> of Wood, Glaſs, or
any other Matter, the Graces and Priviledges that
belong to the <hi>Roſary:</hi> So that if a perſon ſhould
Repeat all the Prayers ordered and eſtabliſhed for
the <hi>Roſary,</hi> without having one of theſe <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosters;</hi>
yea, tho' (to be exact in his Tale) he
ſhould count them on his <hi>Buttons</hi> or <hi>Fingers,</hi> yet
would he not thereby obtain the Indulgence: No,
by no means, there muſt be <hi>Pater-nosters</hi> in the
caſe, as being the Inſtrumental Cauſes of producing
Grace in the Soul. There are ſcarcely any <hi>Italians,</hi>
but have theſe <hi>Pater-noſters</hi> about them, either in
their Pockets, or hanging about their Necks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their Shirts and their Doublets. The Ladies
carry them on their Arms, and they have now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adays
made an Ornamental Bravery of it, not
inferiour to their <hi>Necklaces</hi> and <hi>Bracelets</hi> of Pearls
and Diamonds. They ſometimes go abroad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either <hi>Fan</hi> or <hi>Mask,</hi> but never without their
<hi>Beads.</hi> The moſt common, for Women of a mean
Condition, are of <hi>Coral</hi> or <hi>Amber;</hi> but the Ladies
of Quality have them of <hi>Precious Stones,</hi> or of
<hi>Odoriferous Pasts,</hi> adorn'd with the moſt curious
<hi>Ribands,</hi> and garniſh'd with abundance of <hi>Gold</hi> and
<hi>Silver Medals.</hi> The greateſt Proſtitutes would
be aſham'd to go abroad without their Great <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſters</hi>
on their Arms, which hang down to their
Feet; not that their Devotion is ſo great in Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them over, but meerly becauſe it is cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57009:129"/>
and a kind of neceſſary Implement for them
to trifle with, which they cannot well be without:
Neither do they make any difficulty, to ask of their
Lovers a <hi>Pater-noster</hi> for the Price of their Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Commerce.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Little Scapulary,</hi> or <hi>Habit of the Virgin,</hi> is
a Piece of the ſame worth and value, and belongs
to the <hi>Carmelites;</hi> for it is their own Habit to
which they make People pay ſo great Reſpect, and
ſo many Adorations. Theſe Fathers were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<hi>Hermits,</hi> who had their place of Retirement
on <hi>Carmel.</hi> They pretend, That the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi>
appeared to them there, and gave them the Form
of the Habit they were to wear, which is a <hi>Vest</hi>
and a <hi>Scapulary</hi> of a Brown Colour, and a great
<hi>White Hood;</hi> and that ſhe told them at the ſame
time, <hi>That all thoſe who ſhould wear that Habit,
ſhould be Bleſſed by her and her Son</hi> Jeſus Chriſt,
<hi>and ſhould never die in any Mortal Sin.</hi> Now
foraſmuch as it is not poſſible to perſuade all the
World to become <hi>Carmelites,</hi> that ſo they might
enjoy the Priviledges of this Miraculous Habit,
they have found out a way to cut their Old Habits
into little Square-pieces of the bigneſs of four or
five Fingers-breadth, which they (for their Mony)
beſtow upon Lay-men, to wear about them. They
have Perſons on purpoſe ſtanding at the Doors of
their Churches, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell them for Four-pence or
Five-pence a piece. Certainly, this is the beſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Old Cloaths that ever was thought
of; and the moſt excellent Invention never to
want New ones, and to be always well Clad, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57009:129"/>
could poſſibly be imagin'd. And indeed, I ſcarcely
remember ever to have ſeen any <hi>Carmelites,</hi> that
were not very well Accouter'd, and that with New
Cloaths too. True it is, There are ſome of thoſe
to be ſold, that are very curiouſly wrought over
with Silk, for thoſe, who not contenting themſelves
with theſe Fooliſh Devotions, muſt needs have them
ſet forth with abundance of Vanity; but however,
the Ground of them muſt always be a Shred of a
<hi>Carmelites</hi> Old Frock. They have inſtituted ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Confraternities</hi> in Honour of this Holy Habit;
they celebrate Great Feaſts every Week, with
moſt exquiſit Muſick, and have particular Maſſes
ſaid in Reverence and Reſpect to this Habit. As
for this <hi>Little Scapulary,</hi> as well as the <hi>Roſary,</hi>
S. <hi>Francis</hi>'s <hi>Cord,</hi> the bleſt <hi>Paſts</hi> and <hi>Medals</hi> of our
Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> 'tis ſtill one and the ſame Song;
it, as all the reſt, Forgives <hi>Venial Sins,</hi> prevents ones
dying in <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> and procures a ſpeedy Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from the <hi>Flames of Purgatory.</hi> I deſire
you, Sir, to repreſent to your ſelf a poor <hi>Roman
Catholick</hi> with all this Gear and Harneſs about
him, one of the <hi>Little Scapularies</hi> on his Back,
S. <hi>Francis</hi> his <hi>Rope</hi> about his Waſte, a <hi>Roſary,</hi> or
Great <hi>Paternoſter</hi> in his Hand; abundance of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi>
and <hi>Bleſt Paſts, Images, Written Prayers,</hi> and
<hi>Saints Bones,</hi> about his Neck, upon his Breaſt, or
in his Pockets, who is Cock-ſure, that by means of
theſe he ſhall not only eſcape Hell, but alſo the
ſcorching <hi>Flames of Purgatory.</hi> What think you? Have
we not all the Reaſon of the World, to write above
his Head in great Characters, <hi>Error &amp; Superſtitio?</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:57009:130"/>
On the other hand, ſet before your Eyes a Good
<hi>Protestant,</hi> who neglecting all theſe things, wholly
applies himſelf to Live well, placing all his Hope
and Confidence in God alone, and the Merits of his
Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; and then tell me ſincerely,
and without byaſs, which of both has more Reaſon
of his Side, and better ground for what he does.
And yet this Error and Superſtition is ſo deeply
rooted in the Minds of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that there is
ſcarcely any way left to diſabuſe and unhoodwink
them, ſo fatally have their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi>
enchanted them.</p>
               <p>I knew in <hi>Germany,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Captain, who
had no great Faith in all theſe <hi>Confraternities</hi> and
<hi>Contrived Devotions;</hi> I Tabled at his Houſe, in
the City of <hi>Mentz;</hi> whenever there hapned to be
any Diſcourſe concerning them, he always diſcover'd
his Averſion to them, and declar'd with abundance
of Reaſon, That they were only the effects of
<hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monk-Craft,</hi> to get Mony; and that he
believed, God would moſt ſeverely puniſh them
for it in the other World, as well as thoſe who
ſuffer'd themſelves to be abuſed by ſuch Follies.
This Captain ſome time after fell into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
and about Three or Four Hours before
his Death, I was with him in his Chamber, and
foraſmuch as he had ſtill the free uſe of his Senſes
and Speech, he diſcourſed concerning the Things
of Eternal Life, and (as a Good Father) exhorted
his Children, which ſtood about his Bed, to an
honeſt and truly Chriſtian Life. Whilſt he was
thus employ'd, in comes a Father <hi>Dominican,</hi> who
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57009:130"/>
had been ſent for by the Miſtreſs of the Houſe:
He was the Director of the Confraternity of the
<hi>Roſary,</hi> with a Great <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> in his Hand, and
drawing near to the Dying-man, he exhorted him
to Enroll himſelf in the <hi>Confraternity</hi> before his
Death. The Sick-man deſir'd him, not to interrupt
the Exhortation he was giving to his Children,
which might be of far more Profit to them than
his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Roſary;</hi> the Words of a dying-Father to his
Children, remaining commonly impreſt on their
Minds as long as they live. The <hi>Dominican</hi> giving
little heed to all this, obſtinately proſecuted his
Deſign, repeating continually to him, <hi>That ſhould
he come to die without Enrolling his Name in the</hi>
Confraternity, <hi>he would lie a tedious while in
Purgatory, and that there he would have time
enough, and to ſpare, to repent him at leiſure.</hi> The
Sick Man told him, <hi>If you believe it to be ſo good
and ſaving a thing for my Soul, why don't you
then ſet down my Name of your own accord?</hi>
But the Father not finding his Account in this,
continued to fright and terrifie the Patient; who at
laſt being ſcar'd by the horrid Repreſentations he
had made him, Cry'd out to his Wife, <hi>Pray give
him a Crown, and let him write down my Name.</hi>
Whereupon the Father, after he had given him a
<hi>Paternoster,</hi> went his way, and as he was going
out of Doors, told his Wife, <hi>That in caſe he had not
happily come to her Husband, he would have died like
a Dog.</hi> The good Father having obtain'd his end,
came no more to look after him; and this poor
Gentleman died about Three or Four hours after,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57009:131"/>
with his great <hi>Bead-row</hi> about his Neck. I confeſs,
I ſhould have been extreamly ſurpriz'd to ſee, That
a Man, who had all his life time witneſſed ſo great an
averſion for theſe Foppiſh Superſtitions, ſhould him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at laſt fall under them a little before his Death;
I ſay, I ſhould have been very much aſtoniſh'd at
it, had I not my ſelf heard the frightful Diſcourſe
wherewith the <hi>Dominican</hi> entertain'd him, taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
from his weak and dying condition, to impreſs
in his Mind all the Pannick Terrours of <hi>Hell</hi> and
<hi>Purgatory;</hi> for he talk'd at ſuch a dreadful rate
to him, as if it were impoſſible for him (without
giving his conſent to be admitted of the <hi>Confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi>
with a <hi>Crown</hi> at the Tail of it) to be ever
ſaved, but would be ſure to be damn'd with all the
Devils in Hell to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>See here, Sir, the goodly uſe is made of theſe
<hi>Confraternities,</hi> and what all theſe affected and
contrived Devotions of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do end in. I
am now enter'd into ſo large a Field, and I have
ſo many True Stories to produce on this Subject,
that I ſhould never make an end, ſhould I once
begin with them; and am therefore oblig'd, to the
end this LETTER may not ſwell too big, to
paſs them by in Silence. Nevertheleſs, I think I
cannot in Reaſon exempt my ſelf from giving you
a word of Information more, concerning the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of the Souls in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> This is the moſt
general of them all, as belonging to all Churches,
and to all Prieſts, as well Secular as Regular:
This is their true Nurſing-Mother; for in <hi>Italy</hi>
the Dead (which is ſtrange) maintain the Living;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57009:131"/>
and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Monks</hi> are the <hi>Ravens</hi> and
<hi>Crows,</hi> that fatten and cram themſelves with the
Karkaſſes of the Dead. This is that probably
which inſpires them with that inhuman Cruelty
and Barbarity, that makes them deſire the Death
of all Men.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſpend any time here, to oppoſe the
falſe Opinion of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> becauſe being a Point
of Doctrin, it is no part of the Task I have
undertaken; but ſhall only acquaint you with the
uſe is made of it in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and
how dexterouſly the Prieſts and Monks have turn'd
it to their great Gain and Advantage. I cannot
but own, that a perſon who is perſwaded of the
Exiſtence of a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and that ſo dreadful an
one as the Roman Catholicks repreſent to us, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but apprehend it his Intereſt to think ſeriouſly
of it; and according to this Perſuaſion, I do not
think it ſtrange, if a Papiſt in his Laſt Will appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates
ſome conſiderable part of his Eſtate for
Prayers and Maſſes to be ſaid for the Relief of his
Soul after Death, or even his beſtowing ſomething
by way of Charity, to have them ſaid for others
alſo; but when this is done with Indiſcretion and
Exceſs, and to the great prejudice of ones Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
this is a thing I can in no wiſe approve of.
I know well, that in this Point I ſhall have all
the Clergy of the Roman Communion againſt me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for they maintain, That in this caſe there can be no
Indiſcretion or Exceſs committed, nor any prejudice
or hurt done to any whatſoever, grounding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on this Principle (which they extreamly
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57009:132"/>
Miſconſtrue,) <hi>That a well-order'd Charity begins
from a mans ſelf; Charitas bene ordinata incipit
à ſeipſa.</hi> So that conform to their Hypotheſis, a
man that ſhould Diſinherit all his Children without
any other Cauſe, but the deſire he has to beſtow
all his Eſtate upon the Prieſts, that they may Pray
to God, and ſay Maſſes for his Soul after his Death,
does them no injury at all; and that they would
be ready to repreſent him as a man who did not
conſult with Fleſh and Blood, in a caſe where the
good of his own Soul lay at ſtake, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>I ſhall to this purpoſe relate to you a Matter
of Fact, the remembrance only whereof doth ſtill
afflict and grieve me, becauſe it prov'd the Ruin
of ſome perſons, whom I was particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with. In a ſecond Journy I took to
<hi>Rome,</hi> I took a Lodging in the Houſe of a very
honeſt Widow, who was plentifully provided for,
her Husband having left her a good Eſtate; and
foraſmuch as ſhe had no Children, ſhe took two
of her Siſters to live with her, and Entertain'd
them very Charitably. The Father <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who
are far better acquainted with how many Widows
there are in <hi>Rome,</hi> than how many Chapters there
be in the Bible, had not forgot to ſet this good
Woman on their Liſt; neither were they wanting
in their diligence and application to Court her, in
hopes to get her Eſtate. Her Confeſſor, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
wanted to have her in the other World,
order'd her (during the greateſt Heats of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
to take a Journy to <hi>Loretto;</hi> which ſhe fail'd
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57009:132"/>
not to perform; but return'd very ſick to <hi>Rome,</hi>
where the Phyſicians ſoon deſpair'd of her Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
whereupon ſhe made her Laſt Will, whereby
ſhe left all her Eſtate to her two Siſters, except
only Two hundred <hi>Livers,</hi> which ſhe aſſign'd for
Maſſes to be ſaid for her after her deceaſe. The
Father <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had ſoon notice of this, and without
delay preſented themſelves before the Bed of their
dying Votary; they forgot nothing which they
conceiv'd might prevail with her to change her
Teſtament. They repreſented to her, That it was
the greateſt folly imaginable to beſtow ones Goods
upon Relations, who commonly were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful;
That her chiefeſt Care ought to be, to
procure her own Reſt and Happineſs in the other
World; That ſhe might be ſure her Siſters would
never be at a Farthing charge, to procure Prayers
for her; yea, ſo far was it from that, that they
had diſcover'd, That her Siſters foſter'd a ſecret
and mortal Hatred againſt her, and that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
(by a Trick of an <hi>Italian</hi> Revenge) they
ſhould be glad to leave her to ſwelter a good while
in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Laſt of all, they told her, That her
Siſters were too far engag'd in a Worldly Spirit,
and would probably make a very ill uſe of the
Eſtate ſhe ſhould leave them; and that to leave
them any Mony would be no better, than to truſt
a Knife in the hand of a Child, or Fool, who
might hurt themſelves therewith; And by this
means, ſaid they, ſhe would give an occaſion to her
Siſters of offending God, and damning their own
Souls, and conſequently would become reſponſible
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57009:133"/>
therefore before God: That her Siſters could
Work, and ſo might honeſtly gain their Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
with the Labour of their Hands, which at
the ſame time would ſecure them from Idleneſs,
which is the Mother of all Vices. All theſe fair
Reaſons being utter'd with all the Artifice and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
imaginable, prevail'd with this poor Widow,
whom a violent Fever, and the Pangs of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Death, made yet more apprehenſive of the
Pains of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> ſo that without any more ado
ſhe revok'd her Teſtament, and made but one
Article of it, diſpoſing all ſhe had to the Houſe of
the Father <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might cauſe
Prayers and Maſſes to be ſaid for her. Thus ſhe
Died in the midſt of four <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and ſcarcely
had they ſhut her Eyes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>but they turn'd her
Siſters out of Doors, and poſſeſt themſelves of all
that ſhe had. Theſe poor Gentlewomen, with Tears
in their Eyes, deſired only, That they would be
pleas'd to give them ſome of their Siſters Cloaths;
but the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> utterly refuſed it, ſaying, <hi>That they
could not diſpoſe of the leaſt thing that belong'd to
their Siſter, for that all was to be turn'd into Mony,
to pray God for her Soul, who was now actually
burning in the Flames of</hi> Purgatory; <hi>ſo that they
could not in Conſcience deprive her of the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
or Comfort, ſhe had ſo wiſely provided
for her ſelf.</hi> Thus theſe poor afflicted young
Women were fain to leave the Houſe in a moſt
deſolate condition; and I learnt ſince, That one
of them died in an Hoſpital, and that the other
(preſt by Want) had ſuffer'd her ſelf to be debauch'd,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57009:133"/>
and at preſent led a lewd and ſcandalous Life in
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What think you, Sir? Is not this an excellent
uſe that is made of the Doctrin of <hi>Purgatory</hi> by
theſe wretched and accurſed <hi>Jeſuits?</hi> I'le ſpend
no more time in repreſenting to you the deformity
and abominableneſs of the Fact, ſince the ſole recital
of it evidenceth it as clear as the Sun.</p>
               <p>Now, to bring this falſe Devotion the more in

<hi>Purgatory</hi> are not only ſuccour'd and reliev'd by

the ſame means they become helps and aſſiſtants

in ſome Troubleſom buſineſs; or if a man
be deſirous to obtain a Place, Command or Dignity;
the ſureſt way (ſay they) in theſe caſes, is to have
recourſe to theſe Suffering-Souls, and to get a
Number of Maſſes ſaid for them; for then by way
of gratitude and acknowledgment, they take all
Rubs out of ones way; they influence the Spirits
of the Judges, and procure the Favo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

are taught, That if they would riſe at the Set-hour
in the Morning, they muſt recommend themſelves
to the Souls in <hi>Purgatory</hi> over-night, before they
go to Sleep. But pray, What appearance is there,
That thoſe poor Souls who cannot help themſelves,
ſhould be in a condition to concern themſelves
about, and help others? I have ſeen Lewd Women
impudently come into the <hi>Sextry,</hi> and to order a
company of Maſſes to be ſaid for the Souls in <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
to recover the good-will of ſome of their

to be of that extent, and ſo general, as to
believe, That by this means they can obtain even
Unlawful things at the Hand of God. If it be

in this groſs Ignorance? It is evident, that they
are no other but the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks;</hi> and the
Motive for which they do it, is purely their own

               <p>A Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> in a Company where I
hapned to be preſent, gave a very pleaſant Relation
of the Sport he had on this occaſion: He was left
Executor of a Teſtament, and made the Guardian
of a Pupil: The Lady who was dead, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
a Sum of Mony for Two Thouſand
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57009:134"/>
Maſſes, to be ſaid for her. The <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi>
are very diligent to inform themſelves, by means
of their Emiſſaries, when any Perſon of Quality
dies, to the end they may prevent one another if
they can, and get the Maſſes for themſelves. The
<hi>Jeſuits,</hi> as being the moſt crafty of all, had firſt
got the ſcent of it, and before any others, addreſt
themſelves to the Noble <hi>Venetian;</hi> and as their
Cuſtom is, they began to enlarge on the Subject of
their own Praiſes, and averr'd, That there were no
Religious in the Church of God, who did celebrate
Maſſes with more Modeſty and Devotion than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and that the great Zeal they had for the
ſpeedy Deliverance of the deceaſed Party, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them to come and deſire the diſcharging of
the Two Thouſand Maſſes, left by her Laſt Will.
They ſaid, it was an open ſhame to ſee in what
manner the other Religious and Secular Prieſts did
diſpatch their Maſſes with ſo much hurry and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation,
that a Maſs did not laſt above Half a
quarter of an Hour, and that without doubt God was
rather diſhonour'd, than honour'd by ſuch Services.
The Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> having heard this fair Speech,
told them, <hi>He was glad to ſee the great Zeal
they had for the Soul of his Kinſwoman, tho'
he was not ſo fully perſwaded of the Indevotion
of all other Eccleſiaſticks, as they ſeem'd willing
to repreſent them; that they might ſay Maſſes for
the Dead as well as others; and that tho' he knew
well, that it was not lawful for the</hi> Jeſuits, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Popes have affixed ſo many <hi>Indulgences,</hi> that if
one only Maſs be ſaid at them for any Soul in
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> they are infallibly deliver'd thence)
they alledg'd beſides, That all the other Religious
made no Bones of it, to Sing one High Maſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of many, and which they made to paſs for an
Hundred common Maſſes; but that, as for them,
they ſcorn'd any ſuch ſiniſter ways, and promis'd
fairly to Say them all without the leaſt abatement
of the Tale; and that moreover, to teſtifie their
ſuperabundant Kindneſs to the Deceaſed party,
they would over and above the Number cauſe
ſeveral Maſſes to be Sung for her on the grand
Priviledg'd Altar in their Chappel of the Holy
<hi>Roſary.</hi> The Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> without taking any
great notice of their Diſcourſe, Treated them no
better than the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and having granted them
only ſome few Maſſes, ſent them packing.</p>
               <p>After them follow'd a great number of <hi>Sextons</hi>
of other Religious Houſes, and all for the Love of
theſe Two Thouſand Maſſes. If a man might
believe them, they were every one of them more
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57009:135"/>
Holy than their Brethren of other Orders; all
others, according to them, were Perſons without
Conſcience, who devour'd the Mony aſſign'd to
Maſſes, without performing the obligations they
took upon them. The <hi>Venetian</hi> however gave to
every of them a pretty competent number of
Maſſes, ſo that of the Two Thouſand he had only
Five Hundred left.</p>
               <p>He ſent in the Evening one of his Servants to
the Place of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> to inform the <hi>Sec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lar Prieſts</hi>
(who commonly have their Walks there, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
themſelves where they may meet with
Mony for their <hi>Maſſes</hi>) That the next Morning
his Maſter would be there, in order to diſtribute a
number of <hi>Maſſes.</hi> According to his Promiſe, the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Nobleman repair'd thither with Five
Hundred Notes (this being the way of giving
<hi>Maſſes</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> they give a Note, whereupon he
that hath received, goes and ſays Maſs, and enters
it into the <hi>Sexton</hi>'s Book, and then returns it to
him who hath given it him, to receive his Mony)
and went up to the <hi>Procuracies</hi> of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> which
are the Buildings which ſurround the Place of
S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and there pleas'd himſelf, throwing down
theſe Notes amongſt them from ſome of the Upper-Windows.
There were about Three or Four
Hundred <hi>Prieſts</hi> below greedily waiting for them;
who, as ſoon as they ſaw the Papers fly about, put
themſelves in a poſture, to catch each of them the
moſt they could; they puſh'd one another, they
flung one another in the Dirt, they Beat one
another, they pluck'd one another by the Hair,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57009:136"/>
and tore one anothers Bands and Caſſocks, whilſt
a great number of People look'd on, and Laugh'd
at them. There can be no better way of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
this Action, than by fancying to our ſelves
a Crowd of Common People, or rather of the
Scum or Filth of the People, to whom ſome pieces
of Mony are thrown out of Windows, as I ſaw
ſome Perſons of Quality did on the Day of the
Coronation of Their Majeſties, King <hi>William</hi> and
Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> for this was a perfect Repreſentation
of the Behaviour of the good Prieſts of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church on this occaſion. And ſeeing many in the
Scuffle had dropt their Cloaks and Hats, ſome of
their Companions, more dexterous than they, who
choſe rather to get a Cloak, or a Hat, than a Note,
took them up, and having ſlily convey'd them
under their own, skulk'd away with two Cloaks
inſtead of one. The Notes being thus diſtributed,
or rather Chance and Force having thus diſpos'd
of them, theſe good <hi>Prieſts</hi> departed each of them
to their ſeveral Poſts, to ſay their Maſſes.</p>
               <p>Probably, Sir, you'l think very ſtrange of this
Relation of the Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> yet I dare aſſure
you, you need not queſtion the belief of every
part of it. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> do agree the
beſt in the World, and are but as one, as long as
their Common Intereſt cements and keeps them
together; but they are all at Daggers-drawing,
when the leaſt particular Intereſt divides them:
And as for thoſe Prieſts who Thrub'd one another
in the Place of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> for to catch the Aſſignations
to ſay Maſſes, that is no ſtrange thing in <hi>Italy,</hi> I my
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57009:136"/>
ſelf have ſeen it with mine own Eyes above an
hundred times: Alas! they do far worſe than this,
for even whilſt they are in the <hi>Sextry,</hi> inveſted
with their Sacerdotal Ornaments, they ſometimes
fight together for the Priority, or Precedency, in
ſaying their Maſſes, and call one another the
moſt Infamous Names imaginable. The <hi>Italians</hi>
in this alſo excuſe them with a great deal of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourableneſs,
or rather with too much Indulgence.
<hi>What would you have them do</hi> (ſay they)? <hi>they are
a Company of Poor Priests, that live of their
Maſſes, and have nothing elſe to help themſelves
with; when that fails them, all fails them: And
therefore they have great Reaſon to exert their
utmost Activity for the obtaining of them.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I am not a little amaz'd, that the Biſhops take
no courſe to prevent theſe ſcandalous Diſorders, and
that they ordain ſo many Prieſts without providing
them ſome Benefices. There is nothing more ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
in a Clergy, than to ſee thoſe who are the
Members of it, to be reduc'd by a neceſſity of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
to baſe and mean Actions, and altogether
unworthy of their Character. This Diſgrace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but with a great deal of Reaſon reflect upon
their Heads; and it is an evident demonſtration
either of their Negligence to remedy it, or their
want of Charity to procure the means of it. The
moſt part of theſe Poor Prieſts in <hi>Italy</hi> live of their
<hi>Maſſes,</hi> or elſe by Filching, when <hi>Maſſes</hi> fail them:
They take all they can get, even in the Churches
themſelves; the Calices, the Linnen-Covering of
the Altar, the Wax Candles, the Books, and in a
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57009:137"/>
word, all that comes to hand. Wherefore we need
make no difficulty to believe what this Noble <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
averr'd, That ſome in the Scuffle had ſtolen
the Cloaks of their Companions.</p>
               <p>Another thing mentioned in his Diſcourſe, and
whereon I deſire you to make ſome Reflection, is
the great Diviſion and Enmity of thoſe Religious
who went to demand the <hi>Maſſes:</hi> They accuſed
one another as perſons without Conſcience, and
falſe and faithleſs in diſcharging the Truſt they
took upon them, and for which they were paid.
What the <hi>Jacobite</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Cordelier,</hi> the very
ſame the <hi>Cordelier</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Jacobite,</hi> and ſo of
the reſt; and indeed herein they all ſpoke Truth.
'Tis a matter of common practice in <hi>Italy,</hi> That
when any one ſends Mony to a Convent for an
Hundred Maſſes, they content themſelves with
Singing one, with the aſſiſtance of a Deacon and
Subdeacon. 'Tis the Prior, or Guardian of the
Colledge, that Sings it: They call this a <hi>Maſs Sung,</hi>
an <hi>High Maſs,</hi> a <hi>Solemn Maſs;</hi> and they maintain
that one of theſe <hi>Maſſes</hi> is an equivalent to many
Common ones: They call this, <hi>Making a Reduction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, pray Sir, What can this Singing, or theſe
Ceremonies, contribute towards the rendring One
<hi>Maſs</hi> as efficacious as an Hundred? I know a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
may eaſily ſolve this difficulty, by ſaying, That
One Maſs is as good as an Hundred, and that an
Hundred are of no more Value than One; becauſe
they are good for nought, whether ſingly or aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gately
conſider'd. But you who are a <hi>Roman
Catholick,</hi> how can you anſwer this? If you have
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57009:137"/>
never ſo little Sincerity, you cannot but own that
your <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> are not only content for to
ſatisfie their Covetouſneſs, to make uſe of the Doctrin
of <hi>Purgatory</hi> to induce Lay-men to laviſh their
Mony for the celebrating of <hi>Maſſes;</hi> but that after
all this, they would by this Artifice of <hi>Reduction,</hi>
exempt themſelves from the trouble of Saying them.</p>
               <p>The deceaſed Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eleventh was
no way favouring this Trick of <hi>Reduction;</hi> for
being inform'd, that the <hi>Carmelites</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> had
celebrated a <hi>Maſs</hi> in Muſick, to acquit themſelves
of all the Maſſes they were oblig'd to ſay, he ſent
down a Commiſſion, to examine the Regiſters and
Books of the <hi>Sextry;</hi> and upon Examination there
were found no leſs than Four and forty Thouſand
<hi>Maſſes,</hi> which were not diſcharged. <hi>Innocent</hi> being
acquainted herewith, did not believe, That ſo vaſt a
number of <hi>Maſſes</hi> could ever be ſatisfied by one
<hi>Maſs</hi> only, how ſolemn ſoever it might be. He
let them know, That ſeeing they had receiv'd the
Mony, they ought to Say them with the firſt; and
becauſe they had not Prieſts enough in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
to celebrate them, they muſt take in ſome
Secular Prieſts to their aſſiſtance. The thing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Wind, and being divulg'd through <hi>Naples,</hi>
many Stranger Prieſts went and preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to celebrate ſome of them, and for Fifteen
Days they admitted them; within which Time
they ſaid about Four Thouſand <hi>Maſſes</hi> at ſeveral
Altars; and the Fathers paid them at the Rate of
the one Half of what they had received for them.
At the end of Three Weeks, ſome Prieſts that I
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57009:138"/>
was acquainted with, came and told me, That
having been to offer themſelves, to Say more <hi>Maſſes</hi>
for them, they were refus'd; and told, <hi>That all the
Maſſes were already celebrated;</hi> tho' indeed it were
a thing abſolutely impoſſible, for ſo many <hi>Maſſes</hi>
to be ſaid in that compaſs of Time: But the Truth
of the matter was, That they were griev'd at the
Heart, to ſquander their Mony thus abroad, and
therefore were reſolv'd rather to tell a groſs Lye,
than to part with any more. They alledg'd for
their Excuſe, <hi>That they had celebrated ſeveral
Maſſes at their Priviledg'd Altar.</hi> This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stratagem of thoſe Prieſts, which is never a
whit inferiour to that of <hi>Reduction,</hi> and againſt
which the Popes have nothing to alledge; for
otherwiſe they would contradict themſelves, as to
the Power they pretend to have over the Affairs
of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Priviledg'd Altars</hi> (as was hinted before)
are ſuch as be Endow'd with great <hi>Indulgences.</hi>
To obtain one of theſe Altars, great Sums of
Mony muſt be given; but what care they, as long
as the Bubled Multitude refund it an Hundred-fold.
A <hi>Maſs</hi> celebrated at this ſort of Altars, on
ſuch a Day of the Week, which commonly is
<hi>Monday,</hi> doth infallibly deliver a Soul out of
<hi>Purgatory;</hi> and a man who ſhould dare to queſtion
this, would be look'd upon as an Heretick, and
Committed to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> as if he had deny'd
one of the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now to this Principle, they Argue thus; (and
indeed, granting their Suppoſition, I find their
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57009:138"/>
Argument ſtrong enough) <hi>The Pope</hi> (ſay they)
<hi>grants a Priviledge to one of our Altars, and
declares, That when any ſhall procure a Maſs to
be ſaid there for any Soul in</hi> Purgatory, <hi>tho' the moſt
obnoxious that is there, it ſhall in the ſame moment
be deliver'd thence. Now, the Pope is Infallible
in all he declares, eſpecially about the Concerns of
the other World; wherefore to draw to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
We have Mony ſent us to celebrate ſo many
Hundred or Thouſand Maſſes, to Say for ſuch a
Man or Woman; What is to be done in this Caſe?</hi>
Fruſtra fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pauciora;
'Tis a folly to go about, when there lies a ſhort Cut
before us; <hi>We'l therefore cauſe One Maſs to be ſaid
at our Priviledg'd Altar, which will infallibly
deliver the Party concern'd out of</hi> Purgatory, <hi>and
will trouble our ſelves no farther about Saying the
reſt; foraſmuch as they, being only in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the ſame End, would be altogether ſuperfluous
and unprofitable; ſo that by this fair Way, we have
(without the leaſt Pains-taking) gain'd a good
Lump of Mony, as well as without the leaſt diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
to our Peace of Conſcience.</hi> This Argument
was once moſt vigorouſly enforc'd againſt the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> upon this occaſion:</p>
               <p>A Rich Merchant by his Laſt Will had left
them all his Eſtate, to have ſo many Millions of
<hi>Maſſes</hi> ſaid for the Deliverance of his Soul from
<hi>Purgatory</hi> after his Death: His near Kinſman,
who of Right was to have been his Heir, being
made acquainted with his Will, loſt no time; but
as ſoon as he was Dead, went to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57009:139"/>
gave them Mony to ſay a <hi>Maſs</hi> at their Priviledg'd
Altar, for the Soul of the Deceaſed; he himſelf was
preſent at it, and took an Atteſtation in Writing
of them, that they had Said it. Having done this,
he order'd all the Goods of his Kinſman to be
Arreſted; alledging, That the End of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being obtain'd, the Goods ought to return to
their Natural Channel; that is to ſay, to the Heir
at Law; that he could prove, That his Relation
was either in Paradiſe, or in Hell, and that in
either of thoſe places he ſtood in no need of <hi>Maſſes.</hi>
The Caſe was brought to the Bar, and pleaded
with great heat on both ſides; the Jeſuits being
Plaintiffs, and the Merchant the Defendant: But
alas! the Caſe was to be determin'd by an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Court, where all the Judges were Parties,
who (had they done right) would have condemn'd
what themſelves do every day: So the Suit was
carried in Favour of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> under pretence
forſooth, That the Church muſt always be favour'd.
However, it is evident that Right and Reaſon were
on the Merchant's ſide, and that he could not be
condemn'd without Injuſtice. But I return to our
<hi>Confraternities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is never a Village in <hi>Italy,</hi> how ſmall and
inconſiderable ſoever, which has not a <hi>Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
for the Souls of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and at the leaſt a
Score of Prieſts, who live upon it very plentifully.
Beſides the Mony they receive for their Maſſes,
which never fails them, they have a ſort of People
who carry Boxes through the Streets, from Houſe
to Houſe, Begging of all thoſe they meet with,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57009:139"/>
with a great deal of Importunity, ſome Mony for
the Souls in <hi>Purgatory;</hi> which Mony the Prieſts
afterwards ſhare amongſt themſelves. In many
places of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially in the great Cities, in
order to their having a fix'd and ſetled Income,
they Let to Farm this <hi>Purgatory-Mony</hi> to ſome
Lay-man or other, as I have ſeen at <hi>Milan,</hi> in
that Famous Confraternity of the <hi>Souls in Purgatory,</hi>
eſtabliſh'd in the Church of S. <hi>John de Caſa Rotta.</hi>
The Farmer here pays Four Thouſand Crowns every
Year to the Prieſts of that Church, and makes his
Profit of the reſt: He maintains for this end Forty
Box-Carriers, who are cloath'd in White, and wear
upon their ſhort White Cloaks the Arms of the
<hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>raternity,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them. They have each
of them a Shilling a Day allow'd them, and their
Buſineſs is to run through all the Streets of the
City, and beg Mony for the Souls in <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
Theſe Box-Carryers are pickt Men, very cunning
and skilful at their Trade of Begging. Sometimes
they are ſo importunate and impertinent, that they
follow a man the length of two or three Streets,
without quitting him, to force him by their Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to give them ſomething. Neither is it
without danger to give them any rude or churliſh
Anſwer; for in that caſe, they have the Malice to
tell you to your Face, <hi>That they ſee well enough
by you, you have no conſideration for the Souls in
Purgatory:</hi> And ſhould you continue to Revile
them, might probably get you recommended to
the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> to learn more Manners. The Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the <hi>Souls in Purgatory,</hi> has the Keys of all
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57009:140"/>
theſe Boxes, and they are bound once or twice a
Week to bring them in to him. When at any
time they bring them full and well Lin'd, he gives
them ſomething over and above their ordinary
Pay, to encourage them to perform the Queſt with
ſo much the more application and dexterity. He
takes care to place ſome of his Boxes in all Inns,
Ordinaries, Taverns, Victualling-Houſes, and other
publick Places. Thoſe who have Travell'd <hi>Italy</hi>
know, That the Hoſt doth commonly at the end
of every Meal, bring in his Box for the Souls in
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> and deſire his Gueſts to put in their
Charity. At the Time of Harveſt and Vintage,
the Farmer ſends ſome of his Emiſſaries into the
Fields, to carry on the Queſt there for the ſaid
Souls; they have great Wagons with them, and
beg ſome Portion of what is gather'd, in Corn,
Wine, Wood, Rice, Hemp, even to the very Eggs
and Hens. Which done, they either ſpend what
they have got themſelves, or elſe ſell it and turn
it to Mony.</p>
               <p>Now the poor Country People being extreamly
Simple and Ignorant, and the perſons employ'd to
Receive their Charity being very Subtil and Cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty,
make them believe what they pleaſe themſelves,
and ſo abuſe them extreamly. I over-heard once a
poor Country-woman, who gave ſome Hemp to
ſome of theſe crafty Collectors; ſaying, <hi>She was very
ſorry ſhe could not give them enough, to make a
great Shift of:</hi> But one of the Queſt-men told
her, <hi>That they would take care to make a little
Shift of it, for ſome ſmall Soul in Purgatory.</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:57009:140"/>
They turn'd their Heads, and laugh'd at the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of this poor Woman; but not one of them
had the Charity to inform her better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignorance</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> paſſeth for
<hi>Simplicity;</hi> and 'tis to this Ignorant Simplicity, or
Simple Ignorance, that they attribute that Bleſſing
of the Goſpel, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit.</hi>
Whereas it ſeems to me, that this Poverty of Spirit
is to be underſtood of a Simplicity equally devoid
of Malice and Ignorance, and of a Candid and
Open Spirit, without any foldings or deceit; or
elſe of thoſe, who having their Hearts ſet looſe
from the deſire of the Riches of this World, are
the true Lovers of Evangelical Poverty. But to
ſpeak Truth, the Reaſon hereof is, Becauſe this
Ignorant Simplicity, is a thing of ſuch exceeding
Profit and Advantage to the Prieſts and Religious
of <hi>Rome.</hi> The more Idiots the People are, the
more eaſie it is to Chowſe them, and to Pick their
Pockets.</p>
               <p>This is, Sir, ſome part of what I have obſerv'd
concerning the Uſe that is made of the Doctrin of
<hi>Purgatory</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> I might produce many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of every different Point I have Treated of
in my LETTERS; but commonly I alledge
one only, and very rarely two; and indeed never,
but when ſome particular Circumſtance, which
deſerves ones Notice, does oblige me to it. I ſhall
only add a word or two concerning their <hi>Pictures</hi>
of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> before I conclude this LETTER.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:57009:141"/>
There is never a Church or Chappel in <hi>Italy,</hi>
which has not ſome large Picture in it, repreſenting
<hi>Purgatory.</hi> The <hi>Souls</hi> that are there are painted
in the reſemblance of Naked young Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
with ſome Flames ſurrounding them; theſe
<hi>Flames</hi> indeed are harmleſs enough, becauſe they
burn not; but I fear thoſe infamous <hi>Naked Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
kindle very dangerous Flames in the Hearts
of many Spectators. An <hi>Italian</hi> having caus'd his
Miſtreſs to be painted in the Flames of <hi>Purgatory;</hi>
becauſe ſhe had refus'd him ſome Favours, had
theſe two Lines writ at the bottom of the Picture:
<q>
                     <l>S' è così piacevole divederla in Purgatorio,</l>
                     <l>Che coſa ſarebbe divederla nel Ciele.</l>
                  </q>
His Fancy was this: <hi>If it be ſo pleaſing a thing to
ſee her in Purgatory, where the Flames hide ſome
part of her Naked Body; how great would the
pleaſure be, to ſee her painted in Heaven ſtark Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
where no part of her Body would be hid?</hi>
For after this manner do they of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> repreſent the Laſt Judgment, and the Bleſſed
Souls in Heaven. They publickly expoſe theſe
Pictures on their Altars, and the People have them
before their Eyes, whilſt they hear Maſs. I know
what they alledge, <hi>That this is done, to impreſs
theſe great Truths of Christianity the more ſtrongly
upon the Imagination;</hi> as if Chriſtians were only
to be led by their Imaginations, and not by their
Reaſon. They will have a man to ſubmit his
Reaſon in all things, and at the ſame time ſpare
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57009:141"/>
nothing for to fortifie his Imagination. Whereas
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do quite the contrary, they diſregard
and neglect Material things that ſo vigorouſly affect
the Senſes, that they may <hi>worſhip God in Spirit and
in Truth,</hi> and render to him a <hi>reaſonable Service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They practiſe one thing in <hi>Italy,</hi> which indeed is
very horrible. When a poor Criminal is led to
Puniſhment, he has always two Prieſts by his ſide,
who hold a Picture of <hi>Purgatory</hi> before his Eyes;
yea, they go up the Ladder or Scaffold with him,
ſtill holding the Picture before him till Execution
be done, and talk to him of nothing elſe. Is not
this indeed to double the Fright and Terrour of
theſe poor Wretches, who are but too much terrified
already with the Death they ſee prepared for them?
The ſame thing they practiſe towards thoſe that
lie a Dying; They place a Picture of <hi>Purgatory</hi>
at the Feet of their Bed, between two lighted Wax-Candles,
to make it appear with more luſtre, and
the Patient is exhorted to keep his Eyes upon it.
Some are fain to beſeech them, to ſpeak to them of
the Goodneſs and Mercy of God, becauſe they are
already ſufficiently terrified with his Juſtice: But
for the moſt part, they do but Knock at a Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Door; for the Prieſts are ſo wedded to their
Songs of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that if they chance to make a
ſmall digreſſion, they preſently fall again into their
old Track. For my part, I am of Opinion, That
after we have ſpoke to a Sick Perſon concerning the
Juſtice of God, of puniſhing of Sin in the other
World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Eternal Pains of <hi>Hell,</hi> to the end,
to make him ſeriouſly examine his own Couſcience;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57009:142"/>
it is very ſitting afterwards to lay before him the
great Mercy of God, to raiſe his Hope and enflame
his Charity. We Fear God, becauſe he is Juſt to Puniſh;
but we Love him, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and ſurely, 'tis better the laſt Moments of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
Life ſhould be ſpent in Loving God, than in
the Fears and Terrours of his Judgments. This is
that which hath caſt many into thoſe Terrours,
which wanted little of downright Deſpair. But alas!
it is but too evident, That the Doctrin of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
was never contrived ſo much for the Comfort
of Dying perſons, as for the Profit of the Living,
I mean of thoſe Lazy Prieſts, who think of nothing,
but of pleaſing themſelves, and to enjoy Eaſe and
Plenty in this World.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now come, to ſpeak ſomething of the
Principal Means they make uſe of, to confirm and
maintain their Doctrin of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which is to
Preach it up with an incomparable Zeal and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs.
I call to mind alſo, that I promis'd you
at the beginning of this LETTER, to give
you ſome account of their Manner of Preaching in
<hi>Italy:</hi> But foraſmuch as I perceive my LETTER
to be long enough already, and that this Subject
cannot be diſpatch'd in few Words, I ſhall reſerve it

               <head>The Sixth LETTER,
Of the deplorable Abuſe of Preaching
in Italy, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>YOu know, Sir, That that which ſupports the
Church of God, and is (as it were) the Life
and Soul of it, are the Sacraments and the Word
of God; wherefore it is of the higheſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that both theſe be faithfully and decently
Adminiſtred; and I ſhall always take the due and
faithful Diſpenſation thereof for a ſure Mark of the
True Church. This Motive engag'd me, whilſt I
was at <hi>Rome,</hi> particularly to inſpect the Practices
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> in reference to both theſe.
I ſuppos'd I could not meet with any place more
favourable to this my deſign than this Great City,
which boaſts her ſelf (if we will believe her) not
only to contain within her Precinct, the Principal
and Mother Church of the whole World; but
over and above, doth attribute to Her ſelf (tho' it
be hard to ſay upon what good ground) the Name
of HOLY, <hi>Roma Sancta.</hi> As for what concerns
the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but the ſame is performed there both very
orderly and ſolemnly, and indeed with an overplus
of Ceremonies, even to Superſtition. Here I ſhould
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57009:143"/>
give you an account of thoſe Ceremonies which
are obſerved at the Conſecration of Prieſts, the
Celebrating of the Euchariſt, and of the Pompous
Preparations that are made againſt <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the
Week before, called <hi>The Holy Week;</hi> which by
their Splendour and Magnificence, draw an infinite
Number of Strangers to <hi>Rome,</hi> towards the End of
<hi>Lent,</hi> to be Spectators thereof. It is a common
Saying, <hi>That he who would paſs his Time moſt
agreeably in</hi> Italy, <hi>muſt be at</hi> Venice <hi>at</hi> Shrove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide
<hi>and</hi> Aſcenſion-day; <hi>the</hi> Octave <hi>of the Holy
Sacrament at</hi> Bononia, <hi>and the</hi> Holy Week <hi>at</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I ſhould have occaſion to Relate to
you an infinite Number of Fopperies, that are
practis'd here on certain Feaſts in the Year; as at
<hi>Chriſtmaſs, Aſcenſion,</hi> and <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> but becauſe
this would take up a great deal of Time, I ſhall
paſs them by in Silence at preſent, to enlarge my
ſelf on a more conſiderable Subject, wherewith
my intent is to Entertain you particularly at this
time, which is, their Way and Manner of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Aſmuch as there is of Superſtition and Exceſs
in the pompous Adminiſtration of their Sacraments;
ſo great a Deficiency, Negligence, and Unfaithfulneſs
do we meet with in their Diſpenſing of the Word.
During the ſpace of the Seven Years, that I was in
<hi>Italy,</hi> in all the Cities where I have been at the
Times of <hi>Advent</hi> and <hi>Shrovetide,</hi> I have heard
a vaſt Number of Sermons; but I have never ſeen
or known any Curate, or Secular Prieſt, to Preach,
except once a Canon at S. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and
a Cardinal on <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> in the Cathedral Church
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57009:143"/>
of <hi>Milan.</hi> So that in caſe the Word of God be
corrupted and abus'd, as indeed it is very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
every day, we cannot charge the Secular
Prieſts of <hi>Italy</hi> therewith, who do not Preach at
all, or who indeed are (for the moſt part) ſo Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that they cannot, if they would; but the
Fault is wholly to be laid at the Door of the
<hi>Monks,</hi> and other Religious, who have in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
wholly engroſs'd the performance thereof. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it is enough ſaid, when I tell you, That
the true Paſtors, who are the <hi>Curates,</hi> take no pains
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eed their own Flock, but recommend that Care to
Strangers, I mean to <hi>Monks,</hi> who are more ſollicitous
to ſatisfie their own Intereſt and Vain-glory, than to
procure the Salvation of Souls. Yea, the <hi>Monks</hi> have
ſo abſolutely poſſeſs'd themſelves of this Miniſtry,
that they will not ſuffer a Secular Prieſt to Preach
in his own Church; and if any of them ſhould
undertake ſo to do, and they ſhould find that they
could not ſupplant him, they would maliciouſly
employ all manner of Means to blacken and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent
him in the Eyes of the People, and rob
him of his Credit and Reputation.</p>
               <p>True it is, that on the other hand, the <hi>Curates</hi>
being generally lovers of Eaſe and Idleneſs, make
no great endeavours to reclaim their Right to the
Pulpit: They declare openly, That it is the Buſineſs
of the <hi>Monks</hi> to Preach, foraſmuch as not being
engag'd in the Buſineſs and Trouble of the World,
they have leiſure enough in their Monaſteries to
Study and Cun their Sermons; but that as for
them, being wholly employ'd in the Adminiſtration
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57009:144"/>
of the Sacraments, in hearing of Confeſſions, and
aſſiſting at Funerals, they have no ſpare Time to
turn their Thoughts that way. So that we ſeldom
meet with any Quarrels on this occaſion between
them and the <hi>Monks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt I was at <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I often went to the
<hi>Minerva</hi> to hear Sermons: They are the Father
<hi>Dominicans</hi> that Preach here, who are alſo called
<hi>The Preaching Brothers;</hi> becauſe in the ſharing and
diviſion of the Gifts and Graces of God, the
<hi>Monks</hi> have made amongſt themſelves, theſe have
boldly appropriated to themſelves the Gift of
Preaching. But we find, that this is nothing but an
arrogant Uſurpation of theirs, without the Conſent
of the Holy Spirit; for I have ſcarcely found any
<hi>Monks</hi> more unſucceſsful in this Miniſtry than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
God will never permit the Pride of Men,
to diſpoſe of thoſe Gifts which belong to him alone.
The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have arrogated to themſelves the Gifts
of Tongues, and of Informing Youth; and yet
Experience ſhews, that they are indeed very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and unskilful in both theſe; and that the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
who have Studied in the Univerſities under
other Maſters, are incomparably better grounded
in Learning, than theirs are. The Monks of
S. <hi>Bennet</hi> have appropriated to themſelves the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>Retirement</hi> and <hi>Silence,</hi> and yet we find
no People more Gadding up and down in Cities
and Country, than they.</p>
               <p>But to return to my Diſcourſe; It was one of
theſe Old <hi>Dominican,</hi> or Preaching Brothers, that
Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ed at the <hi>Minerva;</hi> but he did it in ſo
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57009:144"/>
unworthy and indecent a manner, that I wonder
how I could reſolve to go and hear him more
than once. All that was attractive in him was,
That notwithſtanding he was very Old, yet he
was extreamly Comical, and an egregious Buffoon;
ſo that he made his Auditors Laugh with open
Throats: He walked in his Pulpit (for in <hi>Italy</hi> they
have them very long and wide); he Thump'd the
Pulpit with his Hands and Feet; he Roll'd his
Eyes in his Head, and put himſelf into an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ridiculous Poſtures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall give you here a ſmall ſcantling of one of
his Sermons, which I ſtill remember, that by the
Pattern ye may judge of the Whole Piece. He
had a mind it ſeems, to make a Moral Application
of the Hiſtory ſet down in the XXI. Chapter of
the Book of</hi> Geneſis, <hi>where</hi> Abraham <hi>turn'd his
Maid</hi> Hagar <hi>out of Doors. He begins thus;</hi> Sirs,
<hi>ſaid he,</hi> come follow me, and take a Walk with me
in the Holy Scripture; <hi>Then fetching three Steps
in the Pulpit, having one of his Arms a Kimbow,
he ſtopt ſhort at the Fourth, and as a man who
in an horrid Deſert ſaw ſome Body at a great
diſtance, he ſtood ſtill a good while without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a word, and very attentively fixing his Eyes
till the near approach of the Object; he began to
ſay,</hi> What is that I ſee there? Sure it is a Woman;
<hi>and keeping Silence again a good while, he ſaid,</hi>
O God! if I beent much mistaken, 'tis <hi>Hagar,
Abraham</hi>'s Servant: Ay, ſure enough 'tis the very
ſame. God ſave you <hi>Hagar!</hi> Prethee tell me what
is thy Buſineſs here in this loanſom Deſert, which
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57009:145"/>
is ſo diſmal and frightful to Nature? <hi>Then
making as if he view'd her from Head to Foot;</hi>
I perceive one thing already (<hi>ſaid he</hi>), that ſhe has
not Robb'd her Maſter, as many Servants do
now a-days; for ſhe is in a very pitiful Equipage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Tell me <hi>Hagar,</hi> Why is it then you have left your
Maſter? <hi>Here making</hi> Hagar <hi>ſpeak in a moſt
afflicted and ſorrowful manner, and as it were all
in Tears,</hi> That it was becauſe of her Miſtreſſes
Jealouſie; <hi>he anſwer'd Laughing,</hi> A very fine
Reaſon believe me; What was this all? Hum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this is very pleaſant; Madam <hi>Sarah</hi> Turns away
her Servant, becauſe ſhe is jealous of her. Come
<hi>Hagar,</hi> come thou along with me; I'le at this
inſtant go and speak to thy Maſter about it. <hi>And
then taking ſeven or eight Turns in the Pulpit,
muttering all the while to himſelf; Sarah</hi> Turns
away her Servant, becauſe ſhe is Jealous of her; a
ſtanch Reaſon indeed; <hi>and then ſtopt, Striking
two great Thumps againſt the Pulpit, he ſaid,</hi> Who
is there? Pray tell <hi>Abraham,</hi> I would ſpeak with
him; <hi>and ſoon after making a very low Bow,
as if he had ſeen</hi> Abraham, <hi>he ſaid to him, Abraham,</hi>
pray tell me for what Reaſon you have Turn'd away
your Servant <hi>Hagar?</hi> She tells me it is, becauſe
your Wife is Jealous of her: <hi>Then perſonating</hi>
Abraham, Abraham <hi>anſwers him,</hi> If I have turn'd
away my Servant, I have had an Order from
God for it, and therefore don't think my ſelf bound
to give you any further Reaſon of it. Tho' indeed
<hi>Hagar</hi> has not told you all; It was not only upon
the account of Jealouſie ſhe was turn'd out of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57009:145"/>
Doors, but becauſe ſhe has a Little Boy of her own,
that is very Naughty, he beats him that I had by

they pull one another by the Hair; they Cry, and
make an intolerable Noiſe in the Houſe. My Wife

about it, but <hi>Hagar</hi> is become too bold and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,

Tongue: For theſe Reaſons therefore, and to have
quiet in mine own Houſe, I have been fain to Turn
her out of Doors. <hi>Here the Old Father</hi> Dominican,
<hi>rolling his Eyes in his Head, and wrinkling his
Brow, as one that was very Angry with</hi> Hagar;
Hagar, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I find now, that you did not tell
me the Cream of the Jest: Thou art just like the
Servants of <hi>Rome;</hi> when they are turn'd out of
Service, 'tis never any of their Fault, 'tis becauſe
their Miſtreſſes are of an intollerable difficult Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
they are exceeding Humourſom; they are very
Jealous, and 'tis impoſſible to live with them: But
by what I can perceive, it was becauſe you began to
play the Miſtreſs, and becauſe there was a continual
diſturbance in the Houſe upon your account. I know
well enough, that Jealouſie could not be a ſufficient
Reaſon for ſending a good Servant packing; for
otherwiſe our <hi>Roman</hi> Dames, who are extreamly
Jealous, would never be able to keep any: But
there muſt be this beſides in the caſe, That this Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie

The Father, after that he had very dexterouſly
plaid the Buffoon on this Hiſtory of the Bible, paſt
on to another, which he handled in the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
manner, making all his Hearers to burſt out
into loud Laughter: And after all, fell upon the</hi>
Devotion <hi>common to their Order, which is the</hi>
Roſary; <hi>for they bring this in by Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
upon all occaſions, let their Subjects be what

Preaching, and the Church was always full of
People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> are extreamly in love with Sermons
that make them Laugh, which is the Reaſon, that the
moſt part of their Preachers apply themſelves to a
Comical and Drolling Style. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have
another Way of Preaching, which I may call a
<hi>Poetical Style:</hi> For they being perſons who have
ſpent their young Years in Teaching Human Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Colledges, they have their Head and
Fancies fill'd with <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> and <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s
<hi>Fables,</hi> and accordingly all their Sermons are ſtuft
with them. If they ſpeak concerning the <hi>Incarnation
of the Word,</hi> they would think they had not expreſt
themſelves well, without ſaying, That the Divine
<hi>Prometheus</hi> brought down Fire from Heaven to the
Earth; that is to ſay, <hi>Has perſonally united the
Divine with the Human Nature.</hi> They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
quote a vaſt number of Paſſages drawn
from Profane Authors and Poets; as from <hi>Cicero,
Virgil, Horace, Martial, &amp;c.</hi> yea, I have heard
ſome of them that have quoted <hi>Terence</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and <hi>Ovid De Arte Amandi;</hi> but they
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57009:146"/>
very ſeldom are heard Citing the Fathers, and
yet more ſeldom the Holy Scripture. The great
Converſe they have with Perſons of Quality, makes
their Words and Expreſſions to be choice; their
Diſcourſe neat and refin'd, tho' Subſtance and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
be for the moſt part wanting in them; their
Geſture is very proper, and their Declamation or
Elocution not amiſs. For to gain the more Credit
to their Order, which is of late ſtanding, and yet
ſo powerful, they very frequently quote the Book
of the Exerciſes of their Founder S. <hi>Ignatius;</hi>
which, after all, is but a very poor Book, and (as 'tis
ſaid) none of his own neither, having ſtolen it
when he was Convert Brother in the Abby of the
<hi>Benedictins</hi> of <hi>Montſerra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Capuchins</hi> have another Way of Preaching,
and their Style is Stoical, Emphatical, and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering:
They commonly make choice of very
Terrible Subjects, as <hi>Death,</hi> the <hi>Laſt Judgment,
Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>Hell:</hi> They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill the Air with Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
Thump the Pulpit with their Hands and
Feet; they lay hold of their great Beards, and Roar
with ſuch a Tone, as terriſies all Men, yea, and
the Dogs too; for I have obſerv'd, That when a
<hi>Capuchin</hi> Preaches, all the Dogs run out of Church.
In a word, Almoſt all the Religious have a different
Way of Preaching, and different Divines too,
whom they follow, whoſe Opinions are frequently
oppoſite to one another. The <hi>Cordeliers</hi> have their
<hi>Scotus</hi> and S. <hi>Bonaventura;</hi> the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi>
the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> their <hi>Suarez;</hi> and ſo of the
reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:57009:147"/>
As for the Order obſerv'd as to Partition of their
Sermon, 'tis the ſame throughout all <hi>Italy.</hi> They
all begin their Sermon with the <hi>Angelical Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
or <hi>Ave Maria;</hi> and not with the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Heavenly Father, in praying, <hi>Our
Father, &amp;c.</hi> or by calling upon the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
which yet are the moſt proper, or rather the only
neceſſary for this purpoſe. But indeed, the Doctrin
they preach is ſo extreamly corrupt and wreſted,
that it is no wonder to find their Introductions
tainted with the ſame Infection. God by this very
thing manifeſting to us, That what they preach is
not the pure Word of God, by permitting them to
Preface their Human Inventions with the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Creature. After their Addreſs to the
<hi>Virgin</hi> they pronounce their Text, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
is a place of Scripture, or ſometimes a part
of a Prayer of their Church, or ſome Entrance of
the Maſs. They cite the Texts of Scripture only
by halves, and in an abſtract and interrupted Senſe,
without declaring what goes before, or follows after;
which yet they ought to do, to render the Senſe
perfect. After this they proceed to their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
and then continue their Diſcourſe all of a
pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e, without any Diviſions or Subdiviſions at all.
They divide their Sermon indeed into Two parts;
but the Second is nothing elſe but an heap of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Hiſtories, and Tales made at pleaſure, to divert
their Auditors. In the Interval between this Firſt
and Second part, they gather the Alms in the Church
for the Poor. There are Men appointed for this
purpoſe, who have Bags faſtned to the end of long
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57009:147"/>
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aves, with little Bells at the Bottom of them, and
they paſs by all the Ranks and Seats of the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to receive their Charity. The Preacher in the
mean time, whilſt theſe Bags or Purſes are march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about, doth with an incomparable Zeal exhort
them, to Give freely.</p>
               <p>I never in my life ſaw People more enflam'd
with Charity for their Neighbour, than they are, in
the Pulpit; you would ſay, <hi>They are the very
Fathers of the Poor.</hi> Herein I cannot but do them
the Juſtice to own, That our <hi>Proteſtant Miniſters</hi>
are not ſo good Advocates for the Neceſſitous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Jeſus Chriſt, and do not take the Cauſe of
the Poor to Heart, with ſo much Heat and Zeal, as
theſe Men do. However, Sir, I would have you
know, that when I praiſe your <hi>Italian</hi> Monks, 'tis
not their Perſons I praiſe, but their Action, or
rather the External Appearance of their Action:
For if we cut this Fair Apple in two, we ſhall find
the Worm there, which makes it all Rotten and
Corrupt within. To make ſhort, my meaning is,
That the Motive that prompts them ſo ſeriouſly and
zealouſly to Recommend the Poor to their Auditors,
is a piece of Self-Intereſt: For the one half of the
Alms that are gathered in the Church, as well as
at the Church-Door, during the Sermon, belongs to
the Father-Preacher: Otherwiſe, it were impoſſible
to induce thoſe Hard-hearted and pitileſs <hi>Monks,</hi>
thoſe Hearts of Braſs and Marble, who are ſo
ſignally qualified with Inſenſibleneſs and Cruelty;
I ſay, it would be impoſſible to induce them to any
Sentiments of Mercy and Compaſſion for the Miſeries
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57009:148"/>
of their Neighbour, if Lay-men had not found out
a way to joyn the Intereſt of the Preachers with
that of the Poor, and to make but one of them.
This, this Sir, is the great Spring that moves the
whole Engin, and makes the <hi>Monks</hi> to ſtudy ſuch
importunate Motives and Reaſons, to draw Mony
from their Hearers Purſes: Yea, there be ſome of
them, who are ſo extreamly Malepert and Inſolent,
that I am aſtoniſh'd they do not pull them out of
the Pulpit.</p>
               <p>I went one day in <hi>Lent,</hi> to hear one of the
Sermons at the Church of S. <hi>Andrew</hi> of the <hi>Valley</hi>
at <hi>Rome;</hi> it was a Father <hi>Franciſcan</hi> that then
preach'd there; his Sermon was concerning <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination,</hi>
and after he had declar'd, That the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe that were predeſtinate, was not ſo ſmall
as ſome did imagin; <hi>I ſpeak now</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks;
<hi>for as for all Infidels, who do not believe
in Jeſus Chriſt, aſwell as all</hi> Hereticks, <hi>as the</hi>
Lutherans, Calviniſts, Zuinglians, &amp;c. <hi>our Mother
(the Holy Church Catholick, Apoſtolick, and Roman)
teacheth us, that they are all undoubtedly Damn'd,
and we ought to believe accordingly.</hi> Afterwards,
making a long enumeration of all thoſe he firmly
believ'd would certainly be ſaved, he amongſt the
reſt mention'd all thoſe who were Enroll'd in the
Confraternity of S. <hi>Francis</hi> his <hi>Rope,</hi> which pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
belongs to thoſe of his Order; <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaid
he) <hi>it is impoſſible, according to the Bulls we have
concerning it, from the Popes, that any ſuch ſhould
die in any Mortal Sin.</hi> He very frankly allow'd
the ſame Grace alſo to all thoſe who wore the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57009:148"/>
Habit of his Order, and ſo very handſomly juſtled
in himſelf into the Number of the Elect. Finally,
putting a Queſtion to himſelf, Whether there were
not ſome viſible Mark upon Earth, by which one
might diſtinguiſh the Elect from the Reprobate?
he anſwer'd himſelf, <hi>Yes, that certainly there were
ſuch Signs.</hi> Amongſt other Signs he reckon'd up,
I remember this was one, <hi>To love Muſick, and the
ſound of Inſtruments;</hi> but that the principal Sign
of all was, <hi>To give Alms.</hi> This indeed was the
Point he would be at, and very dexterouſly he
took occaſion from hence, to Exhort all his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<hi>To expoſe that day to the Eyes of all Men,
the undoubted Tokens of their Predeſtination, by their
Liberal putting into the Purſes; and that for his
part, He would take exact Notice from his ſtation
on high, of all thoſe who gave this Evidence of
their Election, that ſo he might know, who were
Reprobate, and who were Predestinate amongſt
them.</hi> Accordingly he ſets himſelf down in his
Pulpit, and was ſilent; and ſtaring with his great
Eyes that way they carried the Bags, having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
all the firſt Rank had ſhewed themſelves
very Liberal: <hi>This is well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I find that here
is one Rank already of my Auditors that are Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate:</hi>
And the ſecond and third having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the ſame Example; <hi>In very Truth</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>I believe, that my whole Auditory will prove to be
of the Number of the Elect. This is an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ort for me, that I have Preach'd
here this</hi> Lent, <hi>and I render Thanks to God for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
becauſe it is a Sign, that Sinners are Converted.</hi>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:57009:149"/>
By this means, the Father procur'd a very Liberal
Collection. I obſerv'd all this while, that he put
many of his Auditors into great trouble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
eſpecially ſome Women, who probably had
no Mony about them; they Bluſht exceedingly,
and to avoid the confuſion of being accounted
Reprobates, they reach'd forth their Hands to the
Bags, as if they had put in ſomething. I my ſelf
heard an Handicrafts-man ſaying to one of his
Acquaintance, <hi>That Monk there (with his Signs
of Predeſtination) made me, ſore againſt my Will,
put a Crown into the Bags, becauſe I had no other
Small Mony about me; for if I had given nothing,
it would have ſpoil'd my Reputation; they would
have taken me for a Damn'd Wretch, which would
have been enough to have frightned all Cuſtomers
from my Shop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Monk</hi> raviſh'd to have ſeen ſo many Elect
in his Auditory, very joyfully fell to the Second
part of his Diſcourſe, and being put into an extream
good Humor by their Liberality, he play'd the
Buffoon to admiration. After he had told them
many Little pleaſant Stories, he began his Second
Queſt for the Souls in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> He made uſe of
the ſame Motive, with which he had ſpeeded ſo
well before. He repreſented to them, <hi>That it was
not enough to have ſhew'd their Charity to the
Living, but that it was neceſſary for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of the Evidence of their Predeſtination, to
extend it alſo to thoſe that are Dead;</hi> that is, <hi>to the
Members of the Suffering-Church;</hi> for that is the
Title they give to <hi>Purgatory.</hi> The Mony of this
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57009:149"/>
Queſt, goes to the Prieſts or Monks to whom the
Church belongs, where the Sermon is Preached;
and to Encourage the Preacher to do it more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
they allow him the Fourth part of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.
This is that which makes them ſo zealous
to Exhort the People from their Pulpits, to a Liberal
Contribution. There are ſome who are ſo far
tranſported with Zeal for theſe Suffering Souls, that
not content to have made one Queſt in General on
this Subject, they back the ſame with two others.
The Second is with an intention to Relieve ſome
Relation or Friend, that any of the Auditors are
more particularly obliged to aſſiſt; and the Third
for that Soul in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which is the moſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
as to matter of Suffrages, and who hath
neither Relations nor Friends to pray God for her.
Thus it is that theſe Fooliſh and Raſh Men, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently
exalt their own Mercy and Compaſſion
above that of God himſelf; implying, That if their
Charity did not extend it ſelf to theſe Wretched
Souls, deſtitute of all help and aſſiſtance, as they
ſay, God would be Pitileſs and Cruel enough, to
let them ſuffer a vaſt Number of Years, yea, even
to the Day of Judgment, without ſhewing any
Mercy to them.</p>
               <p>I have been told a Story of a Country-man, who
perceiving that the Preacher of his Pariſh, after
having made Three Queſts one after another, was
about to make the Fourth, for the Soul that ſuffer'd
the moſt; call'd out to him aloud, <hi>Father, I would
adviſe you to ſhut up your Purgatory at preſent; for
if you let one Soul more out, ſhe will be in danger
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57009:150"/>
to return from whence ſhe came, without any thing:
For my part</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I tell you plainly, I have no
more Mony to give.</hi> Whether this be a true Story
or no, I cannot aver; only this I know, that very
often they give a fair occaſion for their Auditors
to ſay as much. 'Tis in the Interval of their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
this Collect, that the good Father Preachers
do utter whatſoever comes into their Crowns, to
perſuade their Auditors to ſo Charitable a Work.
Here it is, that with a great deal of Heat they vent
all their Fables and Tales of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I heard a Father <hi>Carmelite</hi> in the Pariſh of
S. <hi>Sophia</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> who having made a Sign with
his Hand, to oblige his Auditory to be Silent, and
Liſtning attentively with his Ear, as if he had heard
ſomething; he at length ask'd them, Whether they
did not hear a kind of indiſtinct Noiſe, as of many
Voices at a diſtance? Afterwards, lending his Ear
a Second time, he told them, That he heard the
Souls of <hi>Purgatory</hi> calling upon them, <hi>Not to ſpare
their Charities, but to Relieve them with a Liberal
Contribution;</hi> corrupting to this purpoſe that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of the <hi>Revelation, Audivi ſub Altare Animas
interfectorum clamantium, vindica ſanguinem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum,
Deus noſter; I heard under the Altar the
Souls of thoſe that were ſlain; Crying, Avenge our
Blood, O God:</hi> For he made bold to change moſt
of the Words, to accommodate them to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
ſaying, <hi>Audio ſub Altare Animas defuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
clamantium, Refrigerate Sanguinem nostrum
Fratres nostri; I heard under the Altar the Souls
in Purgatory, that Cry, Refreſh and cool our Blood
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57009:150"/>
our Dear Brethren.</hi> I took this Action of the
Preacher for an excellent Figure of Rhetorick,
which is called <hi>Fictio;</hi> but I am ſure, that many
there did not take it in my Senſe, but did really
believe, That the Preacher had indeed heard the
Souls in <hi>Purgatory</hi> crying under the High Altar;
a ſure Sign of which was, that many roſe up from
their Seats to look that way. The Sermon being
ended, the Preacher comes down out of the Pulpit,
and is led into the <hi>Sextry;</hi> whither the Purſes are
brought, and there they are open'd in his preſence,
and his Share or Dividend counted out to him;
the Preachers herein reſembling Fowls of Prey, or
Hunting-Dogs, to whom always a portion is given
of the Prey they have taken.</p>
               <p>In thoſe parts of <hi>Italy</hi> that Border upon <hi>Germany</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> the People don't ſuffer the <hi>Priests</hi> and
<hi>Monks</hi> to lead them by the Noſe, ſomuch as the
Inhabitants of the Provinces that are nearer to
<hi>Rome.</hi> True it is, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> are not wanting to
uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to bring their <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
into Requeſt; but the Lay-men look upon
them no better than Mountebanks for their pains,
who ſpare no Lies to perſuade the People to buy
their Drugs.</p>
               <p>I was once deſired, by the Curate of <hi>Campo
Dolcino</hi> in the <hi>Alpes,</hi> to take the pains to clamber
up to Mount <hi>Splug,</hi> to go and preach the Day of
the Aſſumption of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> in a ſmall
Village: I went thither, and did my utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſtir up their Devotion, and make it
Beneficial to their Curate; but it was impoſſible for
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57009:151"/>
me to exalt their Beneficence, beyond a few Pounds
of Butter, notwithſtanding the Curate had earneſtly
entreated me, to be importunate with them for ſome
Mony. <hi>Mony</hi> it ſeems is very ſcarce in thoſe
Mountains, they affording nothing beſides Butter,
Cheeſe, Cheſnuts, and Salt-Meat; and the poor
Country people carry to the Church ſuch as they
have, to beſtow upon their Curate. At the place
where I went to Preach, the Inhabitants cannot
continue, but about Two Months in the very midſt
of the Summer; after which the extream Cold
drives them from thence, and obliges them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
lower, where they continue about Two
Months longer with their Cattle; thus deſcending
by degrees, till they come down to the Vallies, where
they continue all the Winter. But to return to our
Preachers.</p>
               <p>The Second part of their Sermon, as is already
mention'd, is made up of nothing but Idle Tales and
Drollery; which is the Reaſon why many perſons,
who take no delight in theſe Jeſts and Fooleries, and
probably alſo, for fear they ſhould be forced againſt
their Wills by the Impudence of the Preacher, to
put Mony into the Purſes, go out of Church towards
the End of the Firſt part. This Firſt part contains
the Body and Subſtance of their Diſcourſe; and
they who print their <hi>Quadrageſimals</hi> and their <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi>
Sermons, that they may not diſparage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
never print the Second part of them; but
make a ſhift to divide their Firſt part, and make
two of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:57009:151"/>
The <hi>Buffoon,</hi> or <hi>Comical Preachers,</hi> are the moſt
follow'd by the Common people; but thoſe that
preach by curious Thoughts, are the moſt eſteem'd;
and thoſe who are call'd <hi>Dotti,</hi> or <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> do
generally frequent them. This Way of Preaching
by curious Thoughts, conſiſts chiefly in never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
things in their Natural Senſe. If they
alledge a Text of Scripture, it is a Senſe that is
forc'd, ſubtil, curious, and far-fetch'd, which is not
the meaning of the Scripture; and a Preacher who
ſhould ſtop at the Literal and Natural Senſe, would
be look'd upon no better than a Simpleton, <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus,</hi>
and Ideot; and except he had ſomething
of a Comical Air with him, would be very ſlenderly
provided with Auditors. I have made it my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
That they commonly take no place of
Scripture in the Literal Senſe, beſides the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Words, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum; This is my
Body;</hi> for here they obſtinately keep to the Letter.
And yet I once heard a Father <hi>Minim,</hi> in <hi>Trinity</hi>
Church on the Hill, at <hi>Rome,</hi> who interpreted the
whole Hiſtory of the Inſtitution of the Lord's
Supper in another Senſe, applying it wholly to the
Doctrin of Alms. <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>the more engagingly to recommend to us the Care of
the Poor, would have the last Action he ever did
here on Earth, ſhould be an Act of Charity; to this
purpoſe, when he had nothing more to diſpoſe of,
ſave one poor Morſel of Bread he had in his hands,
He brake it, and gave it to his Diſciples.</hi> This
Thought of his was found very quaint and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
tho' in the mean time it is very evident, that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57009:152"/>
this is not the True and Natural Senſe of the Holy
Hiſtory; for Jeſus Chriſt in this Action, did not in
the leaſt pretend to give an Alms, but to inſtitute a
Sacrament, that might ſerve for the Suſtenance and
Spiritual nouriſhment of our Souls. However, the
Monk was extraordinarily applauded for this his
curious Thought, and he was not wanting to make
good uſe of it, at his Queſt. And to the end they
may be the more fruitful and copious in theſe fine
Thoughts, the Monks ordinarily Retire, and take
their Walks in pleaſant places, as in Gardens and
Woods, there to Meditate their Sermons: Others
again, betake themſelves to Dark and Subterranean
places, there to Contemplate without diſturbance.
Some of them drink good Wine, and that in good
quantity too, becauſe (according to the Common
Proverb) <hi>Vinum acuit Ingenium; Wine excites In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention:</hi>
And laſtly, Others follow there particular
Humors.</p>
               <p>The Superiours of Religious Houſes, ſuffer their
Preaching Monks to do what they pleaſe, and go
whither they will, to favour their Invention, or (as
they term it) their curious Thoughts. They deal with
them as charily, as we us'd to do with Bigbellied-Women,
whom nothing muſt be refuſed, for fear
of ſpoiling their Fruit, which are their fine
Thoughts. 'Tis this great Liberty and Indulgence,
that makes ſo many Monks in <hi>Italy</hi> apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Preaching, becauſe being once engaged in
this Way, they are exempted from all the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances
their Rule obligeth them to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:57009:152"/>
The Way of ſetting forth theſe their fine
Thoughts in the Pulpit is this: As ſoon as they
have utter'd any thing that is Neat and Curious, to
make appear, that it doth not want ſolidity, they
(in order to back it) endeavour to find out ſome
Texts of Scripture that ſeem to favour it, and to
which, for the moſt part, they give as forc'd a Turn,
as to that which is the Baſis and Ground of their
neat Thought. They commonly quote nothing
but Ends and Scraps of Verſes, without telling what
goes before, or what follows, and ſeldom or never
cite the Books from whence they are taken. They
content themſelves with ſaying, <hi>As it is Written;</hi> or,
<hi>According to the Oracle of the Holy Spirit;</hi> or, <hi>As
it is ſet down in the Sacred Texts;</hi> and then quote
the place they intend: But it is impoſſible to know,
whether what they alledge, be faithfully Reported
by them or no. Thus it is an eaſie thing for theſe
Corrupters of the Holy Writ, (that they may Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
their neat Thoughts, and high Sublimations
of Wit) to ſeduce poor People which never Read the
Scripture, and to whom the Reading of it is not ſo
much as permitted. After they have thus endeavour'd
to back their curious Thought with Scripture, they
endeavour further to ſtrengthen it by the Authority
of the Fathers. They reckon amongſt the Fathers, not
only the Ancient Doctors of the Church, as S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostom,</hi>
S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin, &amp;c.</hi> but alſo
their moſt Modern Doctors, as S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi>
Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin, &amp;c.</hi> inſomuch as at this rate they
have a very large and wide Field to go a pickecring
in. And foraſmuch as it is an ordinary Say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57009:153"/>
that <hi>Good Wits jump,</hi> this egregiouſly flatters their
Pride, to make out to the People, That thoſe great
Underſtandings of Ancient times do accord ſo well
with theirs. Some have the ſottiſh Vanity to ſay in
the Pulpit, <hi>S.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>or S.</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>had the ſame
Thought with me, when he ſaid, &amp;c.</hi> They very
ſeldom quote the Books and Chapters from whence
they have their Authorities, and they content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with ſaying in general, <hi>As ſaith S.</hi> Auſtin;
<hi>As S.</hi> Ambroſe <hi>affirms.</hi> But Experience does evidence
it beyond diſpute, That they cite a vaſt Number
of Authorities falſly, or elſe do ſo extreamly mangle
and corrupt them, that if we ſhould go to look
for them in the Original, from whence they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have drawn them, it would be a very hard
matter to know them.</p>
               <p>I once heard a <hi>Benedictin</hi> Monk in the Church
of S. <hi>Praxed</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who having made an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to himſelf, Why amongſt ſo many perſons,
who have recourſe to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> in their
needs, ſo few are relieved by Her? An Event in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
which ſeems directly oppos'd to the Belief of
the Church of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> That all thoſe who
Addreſt themſelves with Confidence to the <hi>Bleſſed
Virgin,</hi> are infallibly aſſiſted by her. He Anſwer'd
this Objection by ſaying, <hi>That thoſe who fail'd of
her Aid, were ſuch as did not Lift up their Hearts
to her. They indeed</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>do often enough Lift
up their Eyes, their Hands, and their Voice to</hi> Mary;
<hi>but their Hearts all the while are grovelling on
the Earth, and they never lift them up towards
her.</hi> To this purpoſe he quoted S. <hi>Jerom, Si volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57009:153"/>
exaudiri à</hi> Maria, <hi>erigamus corda noſtra ad</hi>
Mariam; <hi>If we would have</hi> Mary <hi>hear us, we
muſt Lift up our Hearts to</hi> Mary. I have Read
S. <hi>Jerom</hi> before, and I have Read him over ſince,
having always this Paſſage of the <hi>Benedictin</hi> well
impreſt in my Memory, but I could never find it
there; and I am well aſſur'd, that no Body will be
able to find it there after me: But the Myſtery of
it was, That this Paſſage was very proper to back
and confirm the fine Thought of the Monk.</p>
               <p>We need not wonder to find the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
boaſt, of having the Fathers on their ſide;
for if at any time they are not ſo, they ſoon make
them come over to them by force, and draw them
in (as we ſay) by Head and Soulders. In this caſe
they do imitate another <hi>Italian</hi> Monk; who not
being able to make a Paſſage of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> favour
a fine Thought was come into his Head, he began
to be in a Paſſion, and having chang'd two or three
Words in the Text, which did in a manner ſpoil
the whole ſenſe of it; he ſaid in bad Latin, but
very expreſſive of what he would be at, <hi>Faciam
te bene venire,</hi> and thus forc'd the Text to comply
with his fooliſh Imaginations. By this means it is
theſe miſerable Monks, make thoſe Venerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, to aſſert that which they never
thought of, and can never be found in their
Writings; and all this is only to feed their Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
Humor, and to obtrude their own Dreams
for Authentick Truths, own'd and believ'd by the
pureſt Times of Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:57009:154"/>
Moreover, to ſet forth theſe their curious
Thoughts with the greater luſtre, they do adorn
them with many quaint Figures of Rhetorick; all
their Diſcourſe being made up of Metaphors, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions,
and Holy Allegories, with a taking Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and curious ſelect Words; and all of them
<hi>Antitheta,</hi> or oppos'd to one another, wherein the
<hi>Italian</hi> Language is happy beyond others. See
here the fair and glittering Cup of Gold, wherein
the Whore mingles her Poyſon, Lyes and Errors,
to intoxicate the Souls of Men. This is the Wide
Gate, by which ſo many extravagant and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Opinions are entred into the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
You may eaſily judge by the Nature of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
of the Condition the Flock is in; and by the
Qualifications of their New Paſtors, I mean the
<hi>Monks,</hi> the wretched Eſtate of the Sheepfold, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their charge. Theſe are thoſe Paſtors,
who ſhear the Wool, and feed on the Fatteſt of the
Flock; but have little or no concern for the Salvation
of their Souls, ſo they may but glut and ſatisfie
their Covetouſneſs and Ambition.</p>

for his witty and curious Compoſitions, Writing to
<hi>Almorò Grimani</hi> at <hi>Verona,</hi> to recommend to him
a Preacher of his Acquaintance, expreſt himſelf in
his Letter to him in theſe Words; <hi>Sene viene in

Father</hi> Jerome Olivi <hi>goes to</hi> Verona, <hi>to make a

ſaith not, That this Monk goes to preach the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57009:154"/>
Goſpel, or to ſtrive to gain Souls to Jeſus Chriſt;
but ſaith, <hi>That he goes, to make a Show of his
Eloquence;</hi> in which Words he very fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
the Motive that puts theſe Monks upon
Preaching.</p>
               <p>I have no words, Sir, to expreſs to you the
Cabals, Intriegues, Sollicitations, and Interceſſions
that are made to get into the beſt Pulpits; that is
to ſay, thoſe where the moſt Mony or Honour is
to be got. They interpoſe the Favour of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees
and Princes, to aſſure themſelves of them, and
that Four or Five Years before they become Vacant.
There are ſome of theſe Pulpits<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that are worth to
the Preacher, for an <hi>Advent</hi> and <hi>Lent,</hi> Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
Five hundred, and Six hundred Crowns;
yea, ſome of them a Thouſand and more, without
reckoning their Share of the Alms given to the
Poor. As for thoſe, from whence there is no great
profit to be expected, the preſs is not ſo great;
and as for the poor Pariſhes in the Countr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, where
nothing at all is to be had, there is not a Monk to
be found, that will beſtow ſo much as one Sermon
upon them.</p>
               <p>They have ordinarily no Preaching in <hi>Italy,</hi>
ſave only during <hi>Advent</hi> and <hi>Lent:</hi> On all other
Feaſts, and Sundays of the Year, they have no
Sermons at the Pariſhes; and inſtead th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reof they
only Sing an High Maſs in Muſick; but the Word
of God is not preached at all in them. Yet in
ſome Convents of <hi>Monks,</hi> they have Sermons in
the Afternoon; but theſe are Sermons peculiar to
the Order of which the Monks are, and always on
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57009:155"/>
the ſame Subject. The <hi>Dominicans</hi> preach eternally
on the <hi>Roſary;</hi> the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> on the <hi>Scapulary;</hi>
the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> on the <hi>Rope</hi> of S. <hi>Francis;</hi> and
the <hi>Soccolanti</hi> have for their Subject S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of
<hi>Padua.</hi> True it is, that theſe Matters are of
themſelves very dry and barren, and I am aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
how they can continually make them yield
ſomething to Talk of. One great Help indeed
they have, which is, that the greateſt part of their
Sermons is made up of a Relation of Miracles,
which a Preacher of good Invention may almoſt
with as much eaſe, Coin, as Utter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> alſo have erected in their Houſes,
Congregations, which they denominate from the
<hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> where they preach all Sundays and
Holy-days: And to the end they may Have at all,
and draw to them all ſorts of People, they make a
diſtinction of Perſons; they have one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Artizans and Handycraft-men, another for
Scholars, a third for Merchants, and a Fourth for
Gentlemen and Noblemen. They have alſo Set-days
on which they Preach in their Churches, to
prepare People to Die well: They have very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
poſſeſt themſelves of this Poſt; for it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
gainful and profitable to them. Upon this
ſcore it is, that they are ſent for to Exhort the
Sick, and ſuch as lie at the point of Death;
which is the moſt proper time, and faireſt occaſion,
for them to get themſelves put into their Laſt
Wills.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:57009:155"/>
There is yet another ſort of Preachers in <hi>Italy,</hi>
which I never ſaw in any other parts, where the
Popiſh Religion is profeſt: Theſe Preachers are
call'd, <hi>Preachers of the Place.</hi> To give you a
more diſtinct Idea hereof, you muſt know, Sir, that
in the Great Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> towards Evening,
when the great Heat of the Day is paſt, the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
(of what Rank or Quality ſoever they be)
go and take a Walk in the <hi>Piazza:</hi> Here it is they
give Audience, and diſcourſe about their Buſineſs.
If any has a mind to meet with any perſon about
that Time, the firſt thing he does, is to go and look
for him at the Place. Here you are ſure always to
meet with a great number of Ballad-Singers, Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Mountebanks, Fortune-Tellers, and other ſuch
like; who find their greateſt profit, amongſt the
greateſt Crowds: And the People do not fail to
get about them, for their Diverſion and Recreation;
and amongſt theſe, you meet with more <hi>Prieſts</hi>
and <hi>Monks,</hi> than <hi>Lay-men;</hi> for after they have
diſcharg'd themſelves of their Maſſes in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there are none more Idle than they all the reſt
of the Day. No ſooner are the Mountebanks got
up to their Stage, but at the ſame time (by what
Motive or Zeal I know not) a <hi>Monk,</hi> with a
great <hi>Crucifix</hi> carried before him, with a little Bell
they Ring, to give Notice of his Coming, mounts
a portative Pulpit, prepared for him in one of the
Corners of the Place, oppoſite to the Theatre of
the Rope-Dancers, and there begins to Preach; a
Multitude of People Running from all parts to
Hear him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:57009:156"/>
When I firſt ſaw this, I was extreamly Edified,
to ſee ſuch Crowds of People leave theſe Actors
and Rope-Dancers, to hear a Sermon; but drawing
near my ſelf to hear the Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>courſe, I found that
theſe Preachers were better qualified, to make the
People laugh by their pleaſant Diſcourſe and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſture, than the Merry-<hi>Andrews</hi> of the
Stage. The Mountebanks play the Fool on their
Stages; and they, the Buffoons and Drolls in their
Pulpits. Whilſt thoſe uſe their utmoſt Effort, to
ſell their Drugs; theſe make a Queſt in the Place,
which goes in the Name of <hi>Being for the Poor,</hi>
whom they Recommend with a great deal of Zeal
and Earneſtneſs to their Hearers; tho' indeed all the
Mony they gather, comes into their own Pockets.
I chanced once to be in the Company of ſome
<hi>Monks,</hi> who impudently did aver, That theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in the <hi>Piazza's,</hi> were a manifeſt proof of the
Truth of the Religion at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
becauſe in them there was a Viſible accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of that Oracle of the Holy Ghoſt, which
we find in the Firſt Chapter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> where
it is ſaid, that <hi>Wiſdom cries in the publick Places;</hi>
and that this was only to be found amongſt the
<hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> where <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that is, <hi>The Word
of God,</hi> made it ſelf to be heard in publick, by
means of theſe Preachers of the Places.</p>
               <p>To tell you my Thoughts, Sir, I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
that if <hi>Wiſdom</hi> do indeed Cry there, it is
for Vengeance upon the horrid Abuſe and Affront
done to his Goſpel, which is there ridicul'd and
made the Subject of their Drollery, to make People
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57009:156"/>
laugh. Neither can it be ſaid, That <hi>Wiſdom</hi> cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her Voice to be heard there, with reſpect to
the perſons of the Preachers; the moſt of them
being <hi>Monks,</hi> of moſt debauch'd and profligate
Lives. I knew one of them at <hi>Venice,</hi> that was a
moſt wicked Wretch, who no ſooner got out of the
Pulpit, but went and ſpent the Mony he had got
at his Queſt, in Infamous places, upon Whores.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are at a loſs, whither to
betake themſelves for Viſible Signs of the Truth
of their Church. They produce ſome others every
whit as pitiful as that now mention'd, amongſt
which they reckon a certain Cuſtom introduc'd in
<hi>Italy,</hi> to make Little Children Preach publickly in
their Churches, from <hi>Christmaſs</hi> to <hi>Twelf-tide.</hi>
They take pretty Children of about Three or Four
Years of Age, and they make them get by Heart
ſome ſhort Sermons, upon the Birth of our Saviour,
which may laſt about a Quarter of an Hour.
They ſpend much Time to exerciſe them in the
Utterance of them with a good Grace; and on
<hi>Christmaſs-day</hi> they preach them, before the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>
that are prepared in all Churches at that Time.
Theſe Little Children obſerve all the Ceremonies
of Preachers: They begin with their <hi>Ave Maria,</hi>
then proceed to a ſhort Introduction, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to a Diviſion. As ſoon as they have made
an end of their firſt Part, they make a Queſt, and
all their Auditors give them ſomething. This done,
they preach for the Souls in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> No ſooner
has one of them made an end of his Sermon, but
another takes his place, and begins: And thus
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57009:157"/>
they continue till <hi>Twelfth tide.</hi> They begin early
in the Morning, and don't make an end till far in
the Night. The M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ny they get at their Queſts,
ſerves them afterwards to make a Collation with,
and to buy them Sweet-Meats, or other Junkets.
Thus it is they Educate and Accuſtom theſe young
Lions betimes to the Prey, to the end (when they are
grown up to be great Preachers) they may be Expert at
devouring the Alms, which are given to the Poor only.</p>
               <p>Now all this petty Intriegue is produc'd by the
<hi>Italians,</hi> as a Mark forſooth of the Truth of their
Religion, applying to it that Verſe of the Pſalmiſt;
<hi>Ex ore Infantium &amp; Lactentium perfeciſti Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem;
Thou haſt</hi> (according to their Explication of
it) <hi>perfected the work of Preaching, out of the
Mouth of Infants.</hi> They ſay, That this is no
where to be found, ſave only in their Church. This
gives me an occaſion, to ſpeak to you of that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Mark of their Church, of which they boaſt ſo
much, and which with ſo much Vehemence they
object to the <hi>Proteſtants, viz.</hi> the Miſſion of their
Evangelical Preachers, which they ſend into Forein
Countries, and of which number are all thoſe
wretched <hi>Jeſuits</hi> that come for <hi>England;</hi> and of
whom I doubt not but there be great Numbers
ſtill in that Kingdom. This I can aſſure you,
That ſhould the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> ſend thither their
Miſſionaries, proportionably to the Mony that is
given them for this purpoſe, all the Fathers of that
Order would not be ſufficient to ſupply the places.
It is impoſſible to imagine the immenſe Sums are
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57009:157"/>
given them upon this account: This is their great
pretence, in the frequent Viſits they make to the
Palaces of the Great Ones, as well as to the Houſes
of Widows and Rich Men, to induce them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to ſo Holy a Work. And after all, they
content themſelves with ſending only a certain
Number of their <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> whom they provide for,
employing the reſt of the Mony in Building thoſe
ſtately Houſes, or rather thoſe ſumptuous Palaces
for themſelves as they do, (for they will not have
them call'd <hi>Monaſteries</hi> or <hi>Convents</hi>) and with
the ſame Mony they proportionably increaſe the
Rents and Incoms thereof. A poor <hi>Capuchin,</hi> who
goes about Begging an Alms, is very well content,
if he gets but wherewith to fill his hungry Belly;
but the Pretext of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> is far more ſpecious,
'tis for the <hi>Converſion of Souls,</hi> and one muſt open
wide ones Purſe-ſtrings to them, <hi>ad majorem Dei
gloriam; For the greater Glory of God;</hi> elſe they
are not well ſatisfied. In the mean time we ſee with
our Eyes the Work they make in <hi>England,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as their Name is become execrable and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable;
not ſo much for their earneſt application
to Convert, or rather to pervert Souls, as for the
Intriegues they carry on to trouble the publick
Peace: For finding it impoſſible to perſuade People
by the weakneſs of their pitiful Arguments, they
endeavour to put a whole Kingdom into Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and to ſet <hi>Proteſtants</hi> together by the Ears,
to the end, that having by their mutual Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
and Quarrels, plentifully drawn Blood from
each other, ſome <hi>Catholick Prince</hi> may afterwards
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57009:158"/>
ſubdue them the more eaſily; and ſo bring about
that by the Sword, which it was impoſſible for
them to do by their Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is that I was told by a</hi> Jeſuit <hi>of</hi> Milan,
<hi>about Three Years ſince:</hi> Our Reverend Fathers,
the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>England (ſaid he</hi>) write to us, That
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are exceeding obstinate in perſiſting in
their Hereſie; and that the only way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
them, is totally to exterminate and root
them out. This is that therefore (<hi>continued he</hi>) for
which our <hi>Fathers</hi> do inceſſantly labour; and we
hope within a ſhort time to ſee, that God has blest
their Endeavours with an anſwerable Succeſs.
<hi>Indeed, when I arrived at</hi> London, <hi>about a Year
and half ago, the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>were become exceſſively
Inſolent. Being once occaſionally got into Diſpute
with them, and finding themſelves pinch'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being able to anſwer, they began to put it off
with Raillery; and telling me,</hi> That all my fine
Reaſonings would not hinder me from being damn'd
at laſt. <hi>Another of them more cunning, and
very probably more Malicious too, told me,</hi> That
he had at his Lodging ſome Invincible Arguments
ſet down in Writing; and if I would take the
pains to come thither, he would eaſily anſwer all
the Objections I had made againſt him. <hi>But I
had a care of truſting ſo honeſt a Man, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
my ſelf with telling him,</hi> That he would do
well, to go and fetch his Papers, or to appoint ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place for me to meet him, than at his own
Lodging. <hi>But I found him Deaf of that Ear.
Soon after, I perceiv'd the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>had form'd a
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57009:158"/>
Deſign, to make me leave</hi> London; <hi>and to this
purpoſe, becauſe they could not do it openly by
Force, and for that they found me always upon
my Guard, they ſent out a great number of</hi> Rogues
<hi>and</hi> Cut-Throats <hi>to dog me, who follow'd me
every where, to have an occaſion to do me ſome
Miſchief; but foraſmuch as I never went abroad
at Night, theſe good Miſſionaries fail'd of executing
their Deſign; and the Happy Revolution, that
hapned ſoon after, oblig'd them to caſt their
Thoughts another way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing here is Remarkable, which is, That
we do not find the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſo zealous to go to
other <hi>Proteſtant Countries,</hi> as they are to come for
<hi>England;</hi> for we meet but with very few of them
in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> or <hi>Germany;</hi> the Reaſon is, Becauſe
<hi>England</hi> is furniſh'd with a Charm, that is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible
for them; 'tis a Country well ſtor'd with
<hi>Mony,</hi> and could they but once wriggle in
themſelves, to be the Confeſſors and Directors of
all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies, it would be a very pleaſing
Employment for them. Beſides, it is well known
what kind of Life they lead here, and that it is
nothing leſs than a <hi>Penitential way of Living,</hi> as
they would make others believe. Wherefore I
cannot ſee how their Miſſion can be an infallible
Mark of the Truth of the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> as the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> pretend: But ſure I am that this Mark (if
there muſt be any at this Time) may with greater
Juſtice be attributed to thoſe Zealous <hi>Protestant
Miniſters,</hi> who having already ſuffered Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Baniſhment for the Defence of the Goſpel,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57009:159"/>
are privately return'd to <hi>France,</hi> in the greateſt
Heat of the <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and betaken themſelves
to thoſe Provinces where they were altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
for to ſtrengthen and encourage their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
to perſevere in the Profeſſion of the Truth,
and to endeavour to Raiſe up thoſe again, who by
their Frailty had Renounced it. Here, to be ſure,
were no Temporal Advantages for them to hope
for; and they could eaſily be aſſur'd, That in caſe
they were taken in the Fact, they would be ſent to
the Gallies, or Condemn'd to Death, as hath hapned
to many of them.</p>
               <p>But as for the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> they are ſo well perſuaded,
that they are never like to Suffer any thing here in
<hi>England,</hi> upon the account of their Religion, that
notwithſtanding all the Acts of Parliament, which
are only level'd to prevent their Wicked Deſigns,
they ſtill continue here very freely and openly:
and yet when they are got home, they will not be
wanting to publiſh every where, as it is their
Cuſtom to do, That they have been Perſecuted;
Clapt up in Priſon; Tormented; and had certainly
been put to Death, had not the Interceſſion of the
<hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> or of ſome Saint to whom they
have devoted themſelves, moſt miraculouſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
them.</p>
               <p>But 'tis time I return again to <hi>Italy,</hi> where I find
yet another ſort of Miſſionaries, which are not be
employ'd in Forein Countries, but in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf:
Theſe are all <hi>Monks,</hi> ſometimes of one, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of another Order; but moſtly <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and
yet more ordinarily a certain ſort of Fryers, which
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57009:159"/>
are call'd, <hi>The Fathers of the Miſſion:</hi> Theſe, after
they have furniſh'd themſelves with a good Stock
of Sermons upon different Subjects, they ſend to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and demand a Miſſion from the Pope; that
is, Leave to go and preach their Sermons in certain
Towns and Provinces, with all the <hi>Indulgences</hi> and
power to <hi>Abſolve</hi> in, reſerved; as is cuſtomarily
granted on like occaſions.</p>
               <p>The firſt I ever ſaw of this ſort was at <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiaſcone,</hi>
Two days Journy and an half from <hi>Rome.</hi>
Theſe were <hi>Capuchins,</hi> who beſides their Habit,
which was very odd and antick, with their great
Beards, they had on their Heads great Red <hi>Calots,</hi>
or Cloſe-Caps, to ſignifie their Zeal, and the Red-hot
Ardour of their Charity, for the <hi>Converſion of
Souls:</hi> For this (if we will believe them) is yet
another Mark of the True Church; For even as
the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> did viſibly deſcend on the Heads
of the Apoſtles in the form of <hi>Fiery Tongues;</hi> ſo
there are to this day found thoſe Heads in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom the <hi>Fire of Scarlet</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth
from others; and that this alſo is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> who are all Divine Love,
(or to ſpeak more truly, who ought to be ſo) wear
Red Hats, and the <hi>Pope,</hi> a Cap of the ſame colour.
Well, to return to my <hi>Red-Caps,</hi> I had the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to go and hear them Preach; I entred the
Church where I ſaw one of them in the Pulpit,
with a great Rope or Cord about his Neck, and a
great Crucifix in his Arms, who did his utmoſt
endeavour, to excite Senſible Affections in the Hearts
of his Auditors. The chief Aim of theſe <hi>Preachers,</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:57009:160"/>
is, to make the People Weep; if they can once
effect this, they are happy, and this is all they
deſire; for this procures them the Reputation of
being Great Miſſionaries, and Men of a true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick
Spirit. To this end they make uſe of the
moſt tender, melting, and affectionate Expreſſions
they can think of, to draw Tears from their
Hearers.</p>
               <p>The Preacher I heard at this time, was Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſing
the Hiſtory of the Paſſion of our Saviour;
and after he had employ'd his utmoſt Skill, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth our Saviour as the moſt Lovely and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
of all Men: He on the other hand repreſented
thoſe pityleſs Tormentors, who with great Cords
tied his Fair Hands, white as the Driven-Snow, and
beat his Lovely Countenance, where the <hi>Lally</hi> and
the <hi>Roſe</hi> did urge for Maſtery. He added to all
theſe Expreſſions a moſt lamentable and affecting
Tone, with Geſtures very proper, and according to
the Subject; whereby I perceiv'd that this Father
was an excellent Declaimer. When on a ſudden
ſome good Women, wholly melted into Tenderneſs
and Compaſſion (as were thoſe Women of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
who Wept ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt carrying his
Croſs up to Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and whom our Saviour
bade, not to Weep for him, but for themſelves)
caus'd their Sighs to be heard aloud; and a few
Minutes after, all that Quarter where the Women
fat being all in Tears, the Emotion ſoon caught
amongſt the Men alſo; ſo that the whole Church
was fill'd with Groans, Sighs, and Sobs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Capuchin</hi> reſolv'd to proſecute his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57009:160"/>
Caſt himſelf down upon his Knees, and fixing
his Great Crucifix upon the Pulpit, he lifted up
both his Hands to Heaven; and with a mournful
and terrible Voice, Twiſting the Cord about his
Neck as if he had a mind to ſtrangle himſelf, he
cried out, <hi>Mercy, Mercy;</hi> and continued in the
ſame manner, to repeat the ſame Word about Forty
or Fifty times, till he made all his Auditory cry ſo
after him. Then there was a moſt dreadful Noiſe
heard in the Church, which continued for a good
Quarter of an Hour, till their Breaths being ſpent,
the Noiſe began to leſſen by degrees, and at laſt
ended in a great Silence; which gave occaſion to
the Father to Reſume his Diſcourſe, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
with the ſame Tender Affections to the
End.</p>
               <p>I don't pretend in the leaſt to blame here the
Senſibleneſs and Tenderneſs of Mens Hearts, with
reſpect to our Saviour's Paſſion; I am ſo far from
that, that I wiſh it were in my power to make a
moſt deep Impreſſion thereof in the Hearts of all
Men: But withal, this ſhall never hinder me from
averring, That theſe Affections do ordinarily paſs
away like Lightning; and that good ſolid Motives
laid down in a Sermon, to engage People to a truly
Chriſtian Life, make a longer ſtay in a mans Mind,
and are there ready upon occaſions to move the
Will; and this is that which theſe Miſſionaries
wholly neglect. Accordingly we don't find, that
the <hi>Italians</hi> (after all theſe Miſſions) are ever a
whit the better Men. At the end of Three Weeks,
or a Month, which commonly is the term of theſe
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57009:161"/>
Miſſions, they go with a great deal of Solemnity
and plant a Great Croſs of Wood, of about Thirty
or Forty Foot high, on ſome Eminent place near
the Cities where the Miſſion has been diſcharg'd,
<hi>ad perpetuam rei memoriam.</hi> This Action is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
with a great deal of Ceremony and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition;
thither they repair all, and Worſhip, Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed,
and Cords about their Necks; and here it
is the Preacher Concludes and Seals his Miſſion, in
giving the People a grand <hi>Benediction,</hi> and all the
<hi>Indulgences</hi> the Pope has afforded him.</p>
               <p>It was once my hap to meet with ſome <hi>Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi>
on Mount <hi>Apennine,</hi> who came from Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a City belonging to the County of <hi>Urbain.</hi>
A Luſty young Man, who had been their Guide
for Seven or Eight Miles together, and who had
carried them on his Shoulders over a Brook, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
That he had never found any thing more
Light than they were, and that he thought that
they weighed no more than a Feather. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſs,
at whoſe Houſe they had Lodg'd, Anſwer'd
Smiling, <hi>That this Miracle did ſurprize her the
more, becauſe ſhe had given them a good Dinner
just before their going away; and if there were
nothing, but what they had eaten, they muſt needs
weigh ſomething.</hi> The place where I met them
was at another Inn, where they notwithſtanding
caus'd a ſecond Dinner to be prepar'd for them.
By this I perceiv'd, That all theſe Zealous <hi>Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi>
with their Ropes about their Necks, are not
always the greateſt Lovers of Penance, herein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who tho' they carried the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57009:161"/>
Commandments of the Law written on their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
yet were not the ſtricteſt Obſervators of it.
And yet it is to theſe kind of Miſſionaries, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks</hi> aſſure us, That the Gift of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
is particularly communicated by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
in the particular diſpenſation and diviſion of his
Graces and Gifts. For my part, I ſhould rather
believe, That this excellent Priviledge does in the
firſt place belong to the Biſhops and Miniſters of
the Churches; theſe are the True Paſtors, whom
the Sheep are to hear. Indeed we may ſay in one
Senſe, That the Miniſtry of <hi>Preaching</hi> is quite
ceaſed in <hi>Italy,</hi> where they hear in a manner no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but the Voice of Strangers; I mean, of
a vaſt number of Miſerable <hi>Monks,</hi> who are not
Curates of Churches.</p>
               <p>I have already mention'd in one of my LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS,
That during the ſpace of Seven Years
that I Liv'd there, I never heard any Man preach
that had Eccleſiaſtical Authority; that is to ſay, who
was either Curate or Biſhop, except only Cardinal
<hi>Viſconti,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> whoſe Cuſtom was
to preach on the Four principal Feaſts or Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
of the Year in his own Cathedral. And yet
herein alſo I found a great Inconvenience; for this
Cardinal Archbiſhop, that he might preach with
the greater Magnificence, and probably alſo by a
motive of Vain-glory, would not permit any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to be preach'd that Day, neither in the Morning
nor Afternoon; and this in <hi>Milan,</hi> which is a very
great City, and full of People. The Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is very ſpacious, but yet I don't believe it can
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57009:162"/>
contain the Fiftieth part of the Inhabitants, at ſuch
a diſtance that they may underſtand the Preacher:
So that excepting only a certain Number of perſons,
all the reſt are depriv'd of Hearing the Word of
God.</p>
               <p>I went once to hear him preach on an <hi>Eaſter-Day;</hi>
I could ſay indeed, that I ſaw him preach,
but I could not hear him, the Sound of his Voice
not reaching ſo far as where I was; and becauſe of
the great Crowd, it was not poſſible for me to get
nearer. He was magnificently Apparel'd, in his
Pontifical Habiliments, with the Mitre on his Head;
And the Pulpit of that Cathedral being very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
he had ſeveral <hi>Canons</hi> that aſſiſted on each
ſide of him, likewiſe dreſt in all their moſt pompous
Ornaments. Having therefore ſeen him for a good
while, ſhaking his Head, and caſting abroad of
his Hands, I went out of the Church, without
having underſtood one word that he ſaid. And
foraſmuch as I have now made mention of an
<hi>Eaſter-Day,</hi> I cannot refrain, Sir, from giving you
ſome account of a pleaſant, but yet truly deteſtable
and abominable Cuſtom, which takes place on
<hi>Eaſter-Day</hi> throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> in reference to
Preaching. They tell us, That <hi>Eaſter-Day</hi> is a
Day of Merriment and Rejoycing for Chriſtians,
applying to this purpoſe that Text of the <hi>Pſalmiſt;
Haec est dies quam fecit Dominus, exultemus &amp;
laetemur in ea; This is the Day which the Lord
hath made, let us be glad and rejoyce therein.</hi> And
indeed it is ſuch a Day; but in another Senſe than
they take it. Wherefore, to make the People
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57009:162"/>
merry, all the Preachers on that Day (how grave
or ſerious ſoever they be) muſt play the Merry
<hi>Andrews</hi> in their Pulpits, and Act a kind of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
that the People may hear the Preacher with
the greater pleaſure and ſatisfaction. The Sermon
that is us'd to be preach'd, during <hi>Lent</hi> time, in the
Morning, is on <hi>Eaſter-Day</hi> made in the Afternoon;
becauſe (as the <hi>Latin</hi> Proverb hath it) <hi>Venter jejunus
non delectatur Muſicâ; An hungry Belly takes no
pleaſure in Muſick.</hi> The word <hi>Hallelujah</hi> is a
common Text to all the Preachers on that Day,
which Word in its proper ſignification is as much
as to ſay, <hi>Praiſe the Lord:</hi> But on <hi>Eaſter-Day</hi> (in
<hi>Italy</hi>) it ſignifies, <hi>Gentlemen and Ladies, prepare
your ſelves for a ſound Laughter.</hi> After they have
nam'd their Text, they enter upon Matter, and vent
all the moſt ridiculous Stuff they can think of.
Theſe Sermons afterwards ſerve all the <hi>Eaſter-time</hi>
for Mirth and Paſtime in Companies, where every
one takes delight in relating to others what he hath
heard.</p>
               <p>Being once on an <hi>Eaſter-Day</hi> in <hi>Bononia,</hi> I went
to hear the Sermon at S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, being the
Cathedral of that City, the Archbiſhop himſelf
being then preſent. The Preacher was one of the
Fathers <hi>Soccolanti.</hi> After that he had turn'd ſeveral
Texts of Scripture into Ridicule, he quoted the
2<hi>d</hi> Verſe of the 16<hi>th</hi> Chapter of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> where it
is ſaid, That the <hi>Maries came to the Sepulchre,</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to
jam Sole, <hi>after Sun-riſing,</hi> as it is in the Vulgar
Latin; and oppos'd this to the 1<hi>ſt</hi> Verſe of the
20<hi>th</hi> Chapter of the Goſpel of S. <hi>John,</hi> where it
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57009:163"/>
is ſaid, That they <hi>arriv'd very early, before it was yet
day-light;</hi> and then put the Queſtion, how it were
poſſible to reconcile theſe two places, which ſeem'd
to contradict one another. <hi>For his part</hi> (he ſaid)
<hi>he believed, That the</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ries <hi>did not Riſe till long
after the Sun was riſen, and indeed till it was near
Noon: For we ſee</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that this goes for very
Early Riſing with our</hi> Italian <hi>Ladies, who don't
come to Maſs on Sundays till it be half an hour
after Eleven or Twelve.</hi> And hereupon he began
in a Comical manner to repreſent a Womans
awaking out of her Sleep; the time ſhe takes to
rub her Eyes, to ſtretch her Arms, and an hundred
other impertinent Follies, which put all the Church
into a loud Laughter. Afterwards (for this Father
was very fertil of his Curious Thoughts) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd
himſelf, and ſaid, <hi>That indeed the</hi> Maries
<hi>were Riſen very early in the Morning, but that they
needed ſo much time to Dreſs and Trick up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that it was very late before they could get
out of Doors, which was the Reaſon they could not
reach the Sepulchre till after the Sun was riſen;
Orto jam Sole.</hi> Here he repreſented Women Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of themſelves; how much time they ſpend in
dreſſing their Head, in laying on of Paint, fixing
their Patches, and making an hundred Faces before
their Looking-Glaſſes; and expreſs'd all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
admirably well, with his Mimical Geſtures.
This Curious Thought he immediately back'd with
another: <hi>I cry Mercy!</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the</hi> Maries <hi>were
not ſuch vain Women, as I have been juſt now a
deſcribing: But they were Goſſiping-Houſwives;
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57009:163"/>
they roſe, and went abroad indeed betimes in the
Morning, but before they could take their Leaves
of their Neighbours, much time was ſpent; ſo that
they did not come to the Sepulchre till it was late;
Orto jam Sole.</hi> Here he enlarg'd himſelf on the
Tattle and Goſſiping-Diſcourſe of Women, and
mention'd ſuch ridiculous Stuff amongſt it, that the
Cardinal-Archbiſhop, who was there, burſt-out into
a loud Laughter. He continued his <hi>Easter-Sermon</hi>
at the ſame rate, to the end of it, profaning (after
a moſt heinous and unworthy manner) ſo Holy a
Day, and the Venerable Hiſtory of theſe Holy
Women, who were judg'd worthy to be the firſt
Witneſſes of the greateſt Myſtery of our Faith,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Reſurrection of our Lord JESUS
CHRIST.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Year, being at</hi> Venice <hi>on</hi> Eaſter-Day,
<hi>I heard a</hi> Benedictin, <hi>that was a</hi> Genoueſe <hi>by Birth,
who (amongſt a great many fooliſh and impertinent
Stories) told this that follows, by which you may
judge of the reſt:</hi> A young Lady (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) being
newly Married, did extreamly afflict her ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
her Husband often told her, That he could
not Love her ſo well as otherwiſe he would, becauſe
ſhe had not black Eyes. Whereupon ſhe went and
communicated her Grief to her Confeſſor; the Good
Father, whom ſhe had choſen to be the Director of
her Conſcience, bade her not to afflict her ſelf, and
that if ſhe would but bring him all the Jewels
and Great Pieces of Gold, which her Husband kept
very charily in his Cloſet, he would by his Prayers
obtain for her of God the favour of having Black
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57009:164"/>
Eyes. The Lady in the earneſt deſire ſhe had of
becoming more beautiful and pleaſing to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
follow'd her Confeſſor's Direction, and brought
him the Jewels and Gold, according to his deſire:
But her Husband miſſing them ſoon after, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
by the ambiguous and uncertain Anſwers
of his Wife, that ſhe muſt be guilty of the Theft,
Beat her moſt outragiouſly; and to make her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
how ſhe had diſpos'd of them, made her Black
and Blew all over with the Stroaks he had given
her. The poor Lady in this pitiful Condition, with
Tears in her Eyes, returns to her Confeſſor, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him how ill ſhe had ſped with his Advice,
and to Redemand her Jewels; but the Confeſſor
abſolutely refus'd to reſtore them to her, maintaining,
That now they were his own, according to the
Bargain and Contract made between them; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as ſhe could not deny, but ſhe had obtain'd
her Deſire, and got Black Eyes with a Vengeance,
as indeed they were with the Stroaks and Bruiſes
her Husband had given her.</p>
               <p>What think you, Sir, was not this a pretty Story,
to be Told from a Pulpit on <hi>Eaſter-Day?</hi> It being
moreover very probable, that this was only an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Tale. Thus theſe Wretched <hi>Monks,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of diſpenſing the Word of Truth to the
People, ordinarily feed them with nothing but
Lies.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, Sir, you will not take it ill, if I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon another ſhort digreſſion, referring to
another pleaſant Cuſtom obſerv'd in <hi>Italy, viz.</hi> that
of Bleſſing <hi>Eggs</hi> at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which are of great
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57009:164"/>
virtue to ſanctifie both Soul and Body. On <hi>Eaſter-Eve,</hi>
and <hi>Eaſter-Day,</hi> all the Heads of Families
ſend great Chargers full of hard-Eggs to the
Church, to get them Bleſſed, which the Prieſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
by Saying ſeveral Appointed Prayers, and
making great Signs of the <hi>Croſs</hi> over them, and
ſprinkling them with <hi>Holy-Water.</hi> The Prieſt
having finiſh'd the Ceremony, demands, how many
Dozen Eggs there be in every Baſon? to the end
he may know, how many of them came to his ſhare;
and ſometimes are ſo honeſt as to take Three or
Four out of every Dozen, eſpecially when they
know the perſons that ſend them to be Wealthy.
There be ſome of the poorer Sort, who are apt to
Cry, when they ſee the <hi>Prieſt</hi> take more than his
due, or pick out the Faireſt and Greateſt of them.
Theſe Bleſt Eggs have the virtue of Sanctifying
the Entrails of the Body, and are to be the firſt Fat
or Fleſhy nouriſhment they take after the Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of <hi>Lent.</hi> The <hi>Italians</hi> do not only abſtain
from <hi>Fleſh</hi> during <hi>Lent,</hi> but alſo from <hi>Eggs, Cheeſe,
Butter,</hi> and all <hi>White Meats.</hi> As ſoon as the <hi>Eggs</hi>
are Bleſſed, every one carries his portion home, and
cauſeth a Large Table to be ſet in the Beſt Room
they have in the Houſe, which they cover with
their beſt Linnen, all beſtrew'd with Flowers; and
place round about it a Dozen Diſhes of <hi>Meat,</hi>
and the great Charger of <hi>Eggs</hi> in the midſt.
'Tis a very pleaſant ſight to ſee theſe Tables ſet
forth in the Houſes of Great perſons, where they
expoſe on Side-Board Tables (round about the
Chamber) all the Plate they have in the Houſe,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57009:165"/>
and whatſoever elſe they have that is Rich and
Curious, in Honour to their <hi>Eaſter-Eggs,</hi> which of
themſelves yield a very fair Show; for the Shells
of them are all painted with divers Colours and
Gilt. Sometimes there are no leſs than Twenty
Dozen in the ſame Charger, neatly laid together in
form of a Pyramid. The Table continues in the
ſame poſture cover'd all the <hi>Easter-Week,</hi> and all
thoſe that come to Viſit them within that time, are
Invited to eat an <hi>Easter-Egg</hi> with them; which
they muſt not refuſe.</p>
               <p>I return now again to my Sermons, upon which
Subject I have this only further to add; That there
is yet another ſort of Preachers, who only preach
before the <hi>Nuns</hi> Grates. Theſe are Finnical
Preachers, of a ſweet Countenance, and commonly
all of them handſom young <hi>Monks:</hi> For except
Beauty and Sweetneſs do meet in a Preacher, the
<hi>Nuns,</hi> who have the Choice of them, will have
none of him. All the Study of theſe Men is, to
find out pretty Words, and the moſt Tender and
Affectionate Expreſſions, and frequently to enlarge
themſelves in praiſe of the <hi>Nuns,</hi> to whom they
preach. I have heard many of theſe ſorts of
Preachers, and amongſt the reſt a young <hi>Monk</hi> at
<hi>Milan,</hi> Preacher to the <hi>Benedictin Nuns</hi> of the
Monaſtery call'd the <hi>Magiore.</hi> Scarcely could this
<hi>Monk</hi> ſpeak Three Words together without ſome
expreſſion of the high Value and Love he had for
them: <hi>My moſt Dear and Lovely Siſters, whom I
love from the deepest Bottom of my Heart,</hi> ſaid he,
which was almoſt the conſtant Appendix of every
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57009:165"/>
Sentence he utter'd: So that having recollected all
his Sermon with my ſelf, I found that the upſhot
(in a manner) of all that he had ſaid, was, <hi>That he
loved them the moſt tenderly and affectionately that
could be.</hi> When once a <hi>Monk</hi> has the good hap
to become a Preacher to the <hi>Nuns,</hi> and that he is
lik'd of by them, he may promiſe himſelf an happy
Time of it ever after, and that he ſhall ſpend the
reſt of his Days in a voluptuous delicacy and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs:
For the <hi>Nuns</hi> have nothing ſo much upon
their Hearts, as to procure all manner of Eaſe to
their Directors and Preachers, to the end, to make
them the more Indulgent towards them. They
allow them great Penſions every Year; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
them with Linnen, and furniſh them with Dry
and Wet Sweet-Meats; and ſend them every Day
a Diſh of what they judge moſt pleaſing and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
which they call the <hi>Preachers-Diſh.</hi> So that
indeed it is no difficult thing for theſe handſom
<hi>Monks,</hi> to declare from their Pulpits the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Love they have for their Tender Nurſes,
and to be ſo laviſh in their praiſing of them.</p>
               <p>This way of Praiſing others from the Pulpit,
puts me in mind of another Cuſtom the <hi>Monks</hi>
have introduc'd, to praiſe one another publickly,
on certain Days of the Year, which is commonly
the Feaſt of their Bleſſed Founders. Thus, for
Example, on the Feaſt of S. <hi>Ignatius de Loyola,</hi>
Founder of the Order of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> they make
the Panegyrick of that Saint in all their Churches;
and after having enlarg'd themſelves in the praiſe
of their Patriarchs, they proceed to that of his
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57009:166"/>
Children and Diſciples, that is, all thoſe that follow
his Rule, and more particularly of the Fathers of
that Convent where the Sermon is preach'd. But
foraſmuch as according to the Common Proverb,
<hi>Proprio Laus ſordet in Ore; That it is a baſe thing
to praiſe one Self;</hi> they employ a Religious of
ſome other Order to preach in their Churches on
that Day. It is a thing but too Notorious, That
the <hi>Monks</hi> do mortally hate one another; however,
the deſire of being prais'd themſelves in their
Turn, prevailing beyond their Hatred, makes them
to undertake theſe otherwiſe unpleaſing Panegyricks.
The <hi>Dominicans</hi> do publickly praiſe the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> the <hi>Dominicans;</hi> and ſo for the
reſt. They all agree, that theſe are the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Sermons of all others, and that rarely one
comes off with Credit and Applauſe, partly by
reaſon of the too inſatiable deſire of the One party,
to be prais'd beyond meaſure; and partly, becauſe it
goes againſt the grain with the Other, to praiſe
them, which makes one in the midſt of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums
to diſcover ſomething of Force and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
that evidenceth the Falſneſs of them.
Indeed, how is it poſſible to praiſe thoſe heartily,
whoſe Hearts one wiſheth out of their Bodies?</p>
               <p>A <hi>Cordelier</hi> preaching the Day of S. <hi>Francis
Xavier,</hi> in the Church of S. <hi>Lucia,</hi> belonging to
the Father <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of <hi>Bononia,</hi> praiſed them very
pleaſantly, attributing Elogies to them, diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically
oppoſite to their known qualities and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
<hi>Do you ſee</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Reverend Fathers
the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>of this Houſe, they are the best men that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57009:166"/>
live on the Earth: They are as modeſt as Angels,
they never open their Eyes, to caſt a Look upon the
Ladies at Church: They are ſuch extraordinary
Lovers of Retirement, that one never ſees them in
the Streets: They are ſo in love with Poverty, that
they deſpiſe and trample on all the Riches of the
World; they never come near Dying-perſons or
Widows, to importune them to be remembred in their
Laſt Wills; they never concern themſelves in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up of Marriages: They never go to Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Cardinal Legat, or the Cardinal Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop.</hi>
And in this manner he ran over every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of their Behaviour and Conduct. All that
were in the Church Laugh'd at this pretty way of
Commending them, the <hi>Cordelier</hi> had lighted on;
but the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were gall'd to the Heart, and put to
the utmoſt Confuſion. The <hi>Cordelier</hi> having ended
his Sermon, came down from the Pulpit; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of going to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Convent, there to be
entertain'd, (according to the Cuſtom of Preachers
in the like caſe) he went directly to the Gate; it
ſeems, he fear'd their giving of him the Laſh, and
(I ſuppoſe) that to avoid their Revenge, he never
afterwards would appear in the City <hi>Bononia.</hi>

               <p>HAving paſſed the <hi>Lent</hi> Time at <hi>Rome,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
thence ſome Weeks after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> with
an intent of Returning to <hi>France.</hi> I took my
Journy through that part of the Great Duke of
<hi>Tuſcany</hi>'s Country, which Borders upon the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the Popes Dominions. The
Entrance into the Dukes Territories, is by <hi>Il Rè
de Caphani;</hi> which is a very high Mountain, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with many great Woods, and is a very
proper place for Hunting; where I ſaw ſeveral
Cardinals, who diverted themſelves at that Sport.
From hence 'tis Two ſmall days Journy to <hi>Sienna;</hi>
in my Way thither, I met with nothing but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
all along the Road. 'Tis an Ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to celebrate
frequent Proceſſions after <hi>Easter,</hi> which they call
<hi>Rogations,</hi> in order to implore the Bleſſing of
God upon the Fruits of the Earth. The Year
wherein I took this Journy, there was a more
preſſing need of it, than ordinary, becauſe of the
great Drought, which threatned a Scarcity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:57009:168"/>
A <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> according to the definition of the
Papiſts, is, <hi>A Walking, or Marching of People from
one Church to another, under the Conduct of the
Prieſts, aſſiſting with the</hi> Croſs <hi>and</hi> Banner, <hi>there to
Invoke, by the Interceſſion of ſome He or She Saint,
the extraordinary Aſſistance of God.</hi> Theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
are ſometimes Two or Three Days a
Marching before they come to the place deſign'd;
and when they have once diſpatch'd the Singing of
their <hi>Letanies,</hi> they play the Fools, as much as the
<hi>Pilgrims</hi> in their Pilgrimaging do, according to the
Account I have already given you in a former
LETTER: So that I wanted no Divertiſement
all the Way from the <hi>Rè de Cophani,</hi> till I came
to <hi>Sienna,</hi> whither all theſe Proceſſions were going.
Only I found great Inconvenience when I came
to my Inn; becauſe that wherever theſe <hi>Proceſſions</hi>
paſs, they cauſe great Scarcity, by reaſon of the
great Numbers that compoſe them. Being come to
<hi>Sienna,</hi> I enquir'd what Church it was to which
all theſe Devotions were deſign'd; and was told,
That they all went to a Church of our Lady,
where they had lately uncover'd a Miraculous
Image of the <hi>Virgin;</hi> which was only done at the
end of every Forty years. My Curioſity invited
me, to take a View of it; but the Throng of the
People was ſo great, that I had much ado to
Crowd into the Church. They told me, <hi>That this
Thronging Concourſe had already continued for Eight
Days,</hi> (for ſo long the Image had been Unveiled)
<hi>and that after Eight Days more, it was to be
Veiled again with a great deal of Solemnity.</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:57009:168"/>
I took an exact View of this Image, which was
about a Foot broad, and a Foot and an Half high,
the Countenance of it repreſenting that of a very
young Girl; neither could I find any thing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
in it, for which it might ſeem to deſerve
the Adorations they gave it. I enquir'd of the
<hi>Priests,</hi> that ſerved this Church, What might be
the Reaſon, that this Image was only Unveiled once
every Forty Years? But they could give me no
better than this, <hi>That it had been a Cuſtom obſerved
Time out of Mind; and that they believed, the firſt
Riſe of it was, An Order given by the</hi> Virgin <hi>her
ſelf, for ſo doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have in <hi>Italy</hi> ſeen a vaſt Number of theſe
ſorts of Veiled-Images; not only of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> but
alſo of the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and all other Saints; and I can
ſay with Truth, That there is ſcarcely a Church
to be met with, which hath not Two or Three of
them. Sometimes we meet with great Pictures in
their Churches, where ſeveral Saints are repreſented,
and amongſt them one only having his or her Face
Veiled, that being the Myſterious Saint. The
Secret of which Intriegue, as far I could pierce
into, by the uſe the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> make of it,
is plainly this: They find this way admirably well
ſuited to advance their Temporal Profit. The
things we ſee every Day, become too common
with us, and make little or no Impreſſion by reaſon
of the Cuſtomarineſs of them on our Imagination.
There be ſome Parts of the World, where they
have ſix Months of Night, and ſix Months of Day;
ſo that their whole Year conſiſts but of a Day and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57009:169"/>
a Night. Now we are told, That the Inhabitants
of theſe Countries, aſſemble themſelves in Crowds
to ſee the Sun Riſe; whereas in theſe Lands where the
Sun riſeth every Day, we don't find People concern
themſelves, to be preſent at his Riſing; and by a
parity of Reaſon we may conclude, That the Images
and Statues of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would make no
great impreſſion on the Minds of the People, or be
powerful enough to induce the opening of their
Purſe-Strings, if the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had not found out this
ingenious Invention of making them more rare, and
therefore the more deſired. Yea, it ſeems alſo, that
the long time of their Veiling, begets ſomething of
a greater Veneration for them, and that the <hi>Roman
Catholicks</hi> imagin, That when after ſo long a time
they are uncovered, they meet with in thoſe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
Images, and Statues, ſomething more Auguſt
and Divine than ordinary. In a word, They do all
believe, and take it for granted, that when theſe
are Unveiled here on Earth, the Saints whom they
repreſent, become more Liberal in Heaven, and
more favourably inclin'd to grant their Vows and
Prayers. Thus you ſee whither Superſtition, or
rather Folly will run, when thoſe who ought to be
the moſt Zealous to overthrow it, I mean the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> are the chief Contrivers of Ways and
Methods to foſter and encourage it. The Profit
which from hence accrues to the <hi>Priests</hi> is very
great, as you will be able to conceive from what
I ſhall tell you of this Our Lady of <hi>Sienna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:57009:169"/>
I ſpent Nine or Ten Days in this City, and ſo
had the leiſure frequently to Viſit this Church of
the <hi>Virgin;</hi> I confeſs, I cannot give you an exact
account of the Preſents I ſaw there offer'd; and
therefore ſhall content my ſelf to tell you, That I
do not believe any Single perſon entred the Church
without giving ſomething very conſiderable. And
to encourage the People the more in their Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to exceed and outſtrip one another, the <hi>Prieſts</hi>
had had the Cunning to prepare a place Rail'd-in
with Baliſters, near to the Altar of the <hi>Virgin;</hi>
where they expos'd to View part of the Preſents
the People had offer'd. Here were to be ſeen a
vaſt quantity of whole Pieces of Cloth and Fine
Linnen, Handkerchiefs, Shifts, many rich Jewels,
and in particular, a prodigious number of Great
Tapers of White Virgin-Wax, whereof ſome of
them could weigh no leſs than Fifty pounds apiece,
the leaſt of them being about Four or Five pound
each, with the Names of the Donors upon them.
As for the Mony that was given, I ſuppoſe the
<hi>Prieſt</hi> put that into their Pockets, parting it among
themſelves; for tho' the People were continually
pouring in Mony into the Baſons, yet ſome Hours
after they were ſeen all Empty. Some <hi>Spaniſh
Priests,</hi> that were Travelling homewards, having
preſented themſelves to Say Maſs in the ſaid
Church, whilſt they were in the <hi>Sextry,</hi> had
Rings preſented to them by ſome of the Country
Gentry, who ſuppoſed them to be <hi>Priests</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Church; and had deſired them, to get
them faſtned to ſome particular Picture; but they
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57009:170"/>
conceiv'd it more convenient, to put them into their
own Pockets, and being got out of the Church,
proſecuted their Journy with a great deal of Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
for the Booty they had ſo happily lighted
on: One of them ſaid merrily, <hi>That he found no
ſcruple in himſelf at all, for having committed this
lawful piece of Robbery, as being in much more want
than the Image of the</hi> Virgin, <hi>who had no need
either to eat or drink, as he had.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The following Sunday, all the Inhabitants of
<hi>Sienna</hi> and Neighbouring places met together in
different Bodies, according as they were diſtinguiſh'd
by their Trades and Callings; and all of them
together made a great Proceſſion to the Church of
<hi>Our Lady,</hi> every Company marching under its own
Croſs and Banner, different from the reſt, as under
their proper Standard. The <hi>Coblers,</hi> as being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to all the reſt, went firſt of all; the Arms
pourtray'd on their Banner were two <hi>Awls</hi> plac'd
Salter-wiſe: Theſe were follow'd by the <hi>Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers;</hi>
and ſo all the reſt in their Order. After
every Banner followed a Man, carrying a great
Wax-Taper, which was that of the Company,
being all Gilt, and adorn'd with Ribands and
Flowers, with a great Scutheon upon it. Beſides
which, every Member of each Society or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
(which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Scuole</hi>) had their
own Tapers of about Three or Four pounds apiece.
After the Croſs, Banner, and Taper, came a Man
in a Surplice, carrying a great Purſe, faſtned to the
End of a fine Great Staff, curiouſly gilt and
painted, which contain'd the Sum of Mony, that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57009:170"/>
each Company were to preſent to the Image of
the <hi>Virgin.</hi> Some of theſe had about Ten Crowns
apiece in them, and others Twenty, more or leſs,
according to the Ability of each Profeſſion. In the
Purſe belonging to the Company of <hi>Merchants,</hi>
there were at leaſt Two hundred Crowns, as I was
inform'd by one of the Merchants themſelves.</p>
               <p>All theſe Companies do not aſſiſt at theſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions</hi>
only in their Ordinary Cloaths, as having
over them great Veſts of Fine Linnen, dy'd of
different Colours, to diſtinguiſh the Companies one
from another; theſe they have girt about them
with curious Girdles, and upon the Breaſt or Arms,
the Device or Scutcheon of their Society; and have
beſides a great Cowl, hanging down on their
Backs. After the Company of <hi>Merchants,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
all the <hi>Religious Orders</hi> that are in that City,
or Neighbouring places, which are very numerous:
They marched according to their Antiquity, or
Standing in the City.</p>
               <p>'Tis on ſuch occaſions as theſe one may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
with the moſt pleaſant variety of Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Dreſſes, that can be imagin'd: Some are
dreſt in Grey, others in Brown, and others again in
Black, &amp;c. and all with their Frocks and Cowls
ſhap'd in different Faſhions, the pattern of moſt of
which they pretend to have receiv'd from no
meane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a hand than that of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> or even
God himſelf. Every one of theſe <hi>Religious Orders</hi>
went under their own Croſs and Banner, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
only was, that their Banners were not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by either Taper or Purſe, they leaving
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57009:171"/>
that Ceremony to the Seculars; as being very well
pleas'd to ſee them bring plentifully to their
Churches, and are not wanting to encourage them
thereto, by all the devices and ways imaginable;
but as for them, they take ſpecial Care the Seculars
ſhall never be a Farthing the better for them.</p>
               <p>It would be an eaſie matter one would think, for
the <hi>Italians</hi> to reflect a little on theſe Practices,
if once they were willing; but that is it which puts
out their Eyes, that they are unwilling to diſcover
the Cheat. For to ſpeak the Truth, Sir, what does
hinder theſe <hi>Monks,</hi> that are ſo Rich, and moſt of
which have great Revenues belonging to them,
which they ſo prodigally ſpend at Taverns and
Bawdy-Houſes; What hinders them, ſay I, from
making up a Purſe amongſt themſelves, as well as
the Seculars, and to be at the Charge of a great
Taper to preſent to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> as well as they;
but that they do not find themſelves in the Humor,
to furniſh other <hi>Priests</hi> with Mony; as knowing
but too well, how they uſe to ſpend it? And yet, if
the poor Seculars ſhould entertain the ſame
Thoughts of them, they would at the Tribunal
of their Confeſſion, condemn ſuch Reflections of
great Impiety and Sacriledge.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Monks,</hi> or <hi>Regular Clergy,</hi> follow'd
the <hi>Secular Clergy, viz.</hi> the <hi>Prieſts, Curates,</hi> and
<hi>Canons,</hi> who all appear'd likewiſe with Empty
Hands. The <hi>Cardinal-Archbiſhop</hi> was ſomewhat
indiſpoſed, who (if he had been there) I am ſure
he would, like all the reſt, have aſſiſted at the
Ceremony without either Purſe or Taper. Both
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57009:171"/>
theſe Orders of the Clergy were followed by the
Magiſtrates of the City, and the Officers of Juſtice,
all in their Robes of Ceremony, with their Tapers
and Purſes. And laſt of all, the whole <hi>Proceſſion</hi>
was concluded with a Company of young Gentle-men,
and Sword-men.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Proceſſion</hi> marched on towards the Church
of <hi>Our Lady</hi> in very good Order, at the ſound of
Trumpets and Drums, and the Air reſounding
with continual <hi>Ora pro nobis.</hi> All their Wax-Tapers
and Purſes were left in the Church, in the
Hands of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> by which you may gueſs the
great Advantage they make of theſe Pageantries.
<hi>For</hi> (as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſaid very well) <hi>the Image doe;
not stand in need either of Meat or Drink, and none
but Men can make uſe of the Mony, and other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
offer'd to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two or Three Days after, as Children pleaſe
themſelves in imitating the Practices of their Elders,
the Boys and Girles of the Town, aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in Companies. The School-Boys and young
Girls got their Maſters and Miſtreſſes, to Conduct
them to <hi>Our Ladies Church.</hi> They made Purſes
of about Two or Three Crowns apiece; ſo that
about Two days after the Great <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> one
could ſcarcely walk through the Streets of <hi>Sienna;</hi>
for they Boys had got great Cords, which they
held at both Ends, ſtretch'd out, to make all thoſe
that had a mind to paſs, to give ſomewhat to make
up their Purſes. Afterwards they provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with Wax-Tapers, Little Croſſes, and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and ſo went by way of <hi>Proceſſion</hi> to the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57009:172"/>
Church; where the <hi>Prieſts</hi> gave them a very kind
Reception, Weeping for very Joy, to ſee ſo
good Beginnings in ſuch Tender and Young years.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Day they uncovered the Image with a
pomp and magnificence altogether extraordinary;
at which time there was a great Concourſe of the
Nobility and Gentry of the City and Country.
The Confluence was ſo extraordinary, that they
were forced to ſet a Guard at the Doors of the
Church, who ſuffer'd none to enter, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Appearance and Quality. I heard an
Old Gentleman, who with a great Senſe of
Devotion bleſſed God with a Loud Voice, <hi>That
he had vouchſafed him the happineſs of having
ſeen the ſame Miraculous Image Two and twenty
times uncover'd during his Life time.</hi> I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſurpriz'd at this Expreſſion of his; for had it
been true, That the Image (as was ſaid) had not
been uncover'd more than once in Forty years, it
muſt have follow'd, that at that rate this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
muſt be more Aged than <hi>Methuſalem.</hi> But I
was inform'd afterwards, That there ſeldom paſſed
a Year, wherein (upon ſome emergency or other
of publick Need requiring it) the ſaid Image was
not uncover'd. This gave me a full Notion of
the Cunning of theſe <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who to procure the
Vogue and Devotion of the People for ſome of
their Images, do Veil them withal, declaring them
to be Miraculous, and ſo traſcendently Holy,
that it is not lawful to expoſe them to publick
and common View, more than once in ſeveral
Years time, except it be upon ſome extraordinary
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57009:172"/>
emergent Neceſſity: And yet, as ſoon as they ſee
that their Device has taken, that the Devotion of
the People is kindled, and that their Profits are
ſure, they have not the patience themſelves to ſtay
out the time of their own prefixing, before they
diſcover theſe their Lucriferous Myſteries; but they
lay hold of the opportunity of the firſt Drought, or
Wet Seaſon; and declare, That Neceſſity having
no Law, the Fruits of the Earth being in great
danger, they are forc'd to uncover the Image
ſooner than they had deſign'd.</p>
               <p>And thus an Image, or Statue, which according
to the firſt Inſtitution was not to be expos'd more
than once in Forty years, is ſet forth almoſt every
Year. Which proceeding of theirs is ſo far from
being ſuſpected by the deluded Laity, that it gains
them a great deal of Reputation, and the Eſteem of
very good and honeſt Men, full of Compaſſion,
and extreamly deſirous to obviate and prevent (as
far as in them lies) all publick Calamities. The
<hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> do both of them perfectly well
agree and harmonize in this Point; for they have
all of them ſome hidden Idol or other in their
Churches, which they uncover at certain Intervals
of Time, each in their due order, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
or claſhing one with another, playing <hi>Hodie
mihi, cras tibi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In thoſe Monaſteries where the Abbots, Priors,
and Guardians are <hi>Triennial,</hi> they have taken up
the Cuſtom of vouchſafing this Favour to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
at their firſt Arrival in the Monaſtery, and
this commonly either by expoſing the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57009:173"/>
for Three days together, or by uncovering
ſome miraculous Image or other. Neither doth the
Idol loſe a whit of Credit and Repute for all this,
becauſe it is look'd upon as an extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and ceaſeth not to paſs in the Minds of the
People, for a Myſtery not to be expos'd, but once
in ſuch an Interval of Years. This was the Rare
Show I was entertain'd with at <hi>Sienna,</hi> which at
preſent is one of the moſt Superſtitious Cities that
is in all <hi>Italy,</hi> and is commonly called by way of
Prerogative and Excellence, <hi>Sienna the Devout.</hi>
This City alſo is very famous for the Purity of
her Language, the beſt <hi>Italian</hi> without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
being ſpoken here.</p>
               <p>After that I had Viſited all the Places of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that are in it, I proſecuted my Journy, and
paſſing a Second time through <hi>Tuſcany</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
after two great days Journy I came to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi>
which is a very fine City. Formerly this
place was a Commonwealth; but at preſent the
Popes have reduc'd it to their Obedience, and have
a Legat there, who Commands in their Name.
On the great Gate of the Legates Palace, which
is a very Ancient Structure, is a Statue of Stone,
repreſenting a Woman with a <hi>Tiara,</hi> or Triple
Papal Crown upon her Head. They of <hi>Bononia</hi>
ſay, This Figure repreſents RELIGION;
but it ſeems with more probability to be a Statue
of Pope <hi>Joan:</hi> For that it is not the former ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from hence, becauſe the principal Marks with
which the Papiſts ſet forth <hi>Religion</hi> are wanting in
this Statue, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Croſs</hi> in the one Hand, and a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57009:173"/>
                  <hi>Chalice</hi> with the <hi>Hoſt</hi> in the other. Two days
after my Arrival at <hi>Bononia,</hi> I went to take a
View of the Fair and Renowned Abby of S. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>
in <hi>Boſco,</hi> ſituate on a pleaſant Hill, about
two Muſquet-ſhot from the City. It ſeems to have
been plac'd on that Eminence, to be ſeen and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
by all <hi>Italy.</hi> Above all other places, this is
peculiarly Famous for the curious Paintings that
embeliſh it, <hi>Carache, Guido Rhenus,</hi> and many
other Famous Painters ſeeming to have depoſited
in this Building the whole Curioſity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of their Art, to make it the more Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
to Poſterity. The Religious that dwell
here are <hi>Olivetan-Monks;</hi> they profeſs the Rule of
S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and are habited in White.</p>
               <p>As I was taking a View of the Painting of the
Grotto's, or of the firſt Cloiſter, which is built
with right Angles, the Abbot taking a Walk after
Dinner with ſome of his Religious, by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
piece of Civility drew near to me, and
took the pains himſelf to explain to me the Pictures,
which repreſent ſome very conſiderable Particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of the Life of their Legiſlator S. <hi>Bennet.</hi>
After which he conducted me to their Library,
which is all curiouſly painted, and furniſhed with
very good and fairly Bound-Books, and certainly
is one of the neateſt I have ſeen in <hi>Italy.</hi> Where
being entred into Diſcourſe concerning ſome of
thoſe Books, the Abbot made a proffer to me of
ſtaying in the ſaid Abby, and Teaching <hi>Humanity</hi>
and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to his Religious; telling me, <hi>That
if I thought good to accept of it, I ſhould be
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57009:174"/>
Entertain'd at his own Table, and enjoy a very
Competent Allowance.</hi> Tho' at this time I had
no deſign of ſtaying in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that I was now
actually engag'd in my Journy for <hi>France;</hi> yet
this occaſion ſo favourably preſenting it ſelf, and
meeting with a ſtrong Inclination in me, to acquire
a further perfection in the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, after
Two or Three days reſpit I had deſir'd of the
Abbot, to conſider of it, I accepted of his Offers.
He appointed me a very good Salary, and aſſign'd
me Twelve of his young Monks for my Pupils.
They were almoſt all of them either Earls or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſſes;
for theſe Fathers Receive none into their
Society, but perſons of the Higheſt Quality. I
continued Two whole Years in this Employment,
during which time I received a Thouſand marks
of Kindneſs and Civility from my young Religious
Scholars, beſides the continual Experience I had
of the Bounty and Generoſity of the Noble
Prelat.</p>
               <p>You cannot doubt, Sir, but that by this means
I had the faireſt Opportunity I could wiſh for,
to penetrate all the Secrets of <hi>Monkery,</hi> for they
kept nothing from me; and tho' I was not one of
them, yet I liv'd and continually Convers'd with
them, neither was any thing hid from me. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may ſay, without boaſting, That I can
ſpeak of the Monaſtick-way of Living upon good
grounds, which I intend to do in my next LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER
to you. As for this I have now in hand,
as I have already begun it, with giving you ſome
account of the Manner of their <hi>Proceſſions,</hi> ſo I
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57009:174"/>
intend to proſecute the ſame Subject; and the
rather, becauſe I find here, in this City, Matter
enough to Stuff it out, and ſuch as is very curious
too; and therefore hope, that the Recital I ſhall
make of it, will not prove unacceptable or tedious
to you. I ſhall begin with the <hi>Proceſſions</hi> which are
celebrated during the <hi>Octave,</hi> or Week of the Holy
Sacrament in the City of <hi>Bononia:</hi> The Feaſt of
the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> having been inſtituted on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>to make the Hoſt to Triumph,</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
ſay, they omit nothing that may render that Day,
and the Week following, the moſt pompous and
ſolemn that may be. They make many fine <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions,</hi>
and carry the Conſecrated <hi>Hoſt,</hi> (which they
ſay, is the Living Body of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>)
through their Streets, with very Magnificent Shows
and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France,</hi> it is the Cuſtom on this occaſion, to
Adorn the Fronts of Houſes with curious Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries,
and to ſtrew the Streets with Flowers and
ſweet ſmelling Herbs. They erect Oratories, or
Repoſitories, (as they call them) at certain diſtances,
there to repoſe the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> as if it were
very weary with the March it had taken. They
Dreſs up abundance of Little Children, like Angels,
to ſtrew Flowers in the Way before it, and to
Incenſe it: And in a word, they make a Thouſand
Idolatrous Proſtrations and Adorations to it. In
<hi>Germany</hi> they Adorn all their Streets with the
Branches of Trees on both ſides of them, by
this means turning their Cities into Parks, or
Foreſts, or rather into Fine Gardens, whereof
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57009:175"/>
every Street repreſents a Long Walk, as far as
one could ſee, all ſet with Trees and Verdure.
But <hi>Italy</hi> being the moſt ingenious of them all, as
well as the moſt Superſtitious, does by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
excel all other Nations, that profeſs the
<hi>Roman Catholick Religion;</hi> and the City <hi>Bononia</hi>
exceeds the reſt of <hi>Italy</hi> in her Famous celebration
of the <hi>Octave</hi> of the <hi>Holy Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the great <hi>General Proceſſion</hi> which is
made throughout that City, the Thurſday after
<hi>Trinity Sunday</hi> (which is the Day appointed for
that Feaſt) at which all the Clergy both Regular
and Secular, with all the Magiſtrates of the City
do aſſiſt; there are every Year Three Pariſhes
appointed, to furniſh and make the Preparatives for
the <hi>Octave;</hi> and having diſcharged their Turn,
they are quit of that Expence for Twelve or
Fourteen years after, until all the reſt have had
theirs; this being a very Chargeable Office.
About a Fortnight or Three Weeks before the
Feaſt, they Barricado all the Entries of the Streets
of thoſe Pariſhes, to hinder Horſes and Carts from
paſſing that way, that the Workmen may apply
themſelves to their Work without diſturbance.
The Chief Work, and that which is moſt painful,
and takes up moſt Time is, to cover all the Streets,
and Walls, with Veils of Silk, which are the
Manufactory of that City, and to form them into
Figures and Hiſtories. The ſeveral Pariſhes, when
their Turn comes, ſtrive to outvy one another in
ſome New Invention or other. Some with theſe
Little Veils repreſent all manner of Birds, others
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57009:175"/>
all Four-footed Beaſts, inſomuch that a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſo much as imagine any whole Figure is not to
be found there. Others endeavour to repreſent
in the ſaid Silken Figures, Huntings, Battels, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs,
and in a word, an infinite Variety of things
extreamly pleaſing to the Eye. Moreover, they
expoſe to publick View in the Streets, all the moſt
curious Pictures which the Inhabitants of thoſe
Pariſhes are Maſters of, not excepting the Profane
ones themſelves; amongſt which are to be ſeen
many infamous Naked Pictures, and <hi>Groteſques,</hi> to
cauſe Laughter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bononians</hi> are extreamly curious in Pictures;
all their Cloſets, Halls and Chambers, are full
hung with them; and foraſmuch as they expoſe
them to publick View at this time, Travellers
meet with the ſatisfaction of ſeeing very Rare and
Curious Pieces of Art. Over and above all this,
Altars are erected almoſt in every Corner of the
Streets, ſet forth and adorn'd with Statues, Images,
and Veſſels of Gold and Silver; and upon every
Altar there is always a Repreſentation to the Life,
of ſome Myſtery of our Religion, or of ſome
Saint. The Houſes of the Great Lords of thoſe
Pariſhes, that furniſh the Ornament of the Feaſt,
are open to all: As long as this Feaſt laſts, they take
Care to adorn their Chambers the moſt ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
they can, and to expoſe all their Riches to
view: There be ſome of them ſo ſplendid and
liberal, to beſtow Cooling Liquors, called <hi>Sorbetti,</hi>
upon all Comers, or at leaſt upon all perſons who
appear never ſo little Conſiderable; and in their
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57009:176"/>
Courts or Gardens, they have Fountains Running
with Wine in great abundance for the Common
People.</p>
               <p>All things being thus prepared, the <hi>Proceſſion</hi>
begins: This is a Work on which the <hi>Prieſts</hi> exhauſt
their Invention, and rack their Brain, to bring forth
ſomething New and Unlook'd for, that may pleaſe
the Spectators. They dreſs up a great many Little
Children like Angles, with Wings at their Backs; they
make very lively Repreſentations of all the Figures
and Types mention'd in the Old Teſtament, which
they conceive did prefigure their Holy Sacrament;
as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Sacrificing of his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> the <hi>Shew-Bread,</hi> the <hi>Paſchal
Lamb, &amp;c.</hi> They repreſent all the Prophets and
<hi>Sibyls,</hi> that have Prophecied of our Saviour: And
laſt of all, they make a Show of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi>
the <hi>Twelve Apoſtles,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who follows
them with a Loaf in his Hand, as if he were about
to break it, as he did at the Celebration of his Holy
Supper. Beſides theſe, they alſo give us the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
of many of their He and She Saints,
which were the moſt devoted to the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
as S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi>
S. <hi>Roſe</hi> of <hi>Viterbo, &amp;c.</hi> All theſe they repreſent not
in Figures to the Life, but Living Figures, that is,
young Boys and Girls, chuſing the prettieſt and
handſomeſt they can meet with. Above all, I took
notice of many Little S. <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> amongſt
them. To repreſent theſe S. <hi>John Baptists,</hi> they take
Little Children of Four or Five years of Age, ſtrip
them ſtark Naked, and put nothing upon them
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57009:176"/>
beſides a Colour'd Riband, which like a Belt reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from their Right Shoulder, to their Left Thigh;
ſo as it doth not hinder their Nakedneſs from being
expos'd to publick View. It is not now only, that
the <hi>Italians</hi> are accus'd of equally loving both
Sexes; ſo that no body needs to be ſurpriz'd at their
having ſo great Devotion to theſe Little S. <hi>Johns;</hi>
of whom I very well remember, I counted no leſs
than Twenty in one <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> following one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In one Hand they hold a great Croſs, made of
Reed, and very light; and with the other, they lead
a little Lamb in a String. After all this Pageantry,
follow the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in magnificent Habits, and next
to them follows the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> which is carried
under a Rich Canopy, ſurrounded with an infinite
number of young Boys and Girls, attir'd like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
who all the Way ſtrew Flowers before it. Near
to the Canopy there is always an Excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Muſicians, who ſing Hymns and Songs of
the Holy Sacrament, being thoſe the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> has compos'd ſince the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in
honour of it. The Canopy is follow'd by the
Principal Men of the Pariſh; and after them, to
ſhut up all, a vaſt Crowd of People of all ſorts. In
this manner they <hi>Walk Our Lord</hi> (to uſe their
own Expreſſion) throughout all the Streets of the
Pariſh; but yet ſo, as to give him leave to repoſe
himſelf at the End of every Street, on the Altars
erected for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> is ended, they do not for all
that take away the Adorning of their Streets, but
leave them whole and entire for many days; to give
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57009:177"/>
the Citizens leave to View them at their leiſure, and
to Walk the ſame Round the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> took; for
in ſo doing they believe they ſhall merit much, and
obtain great Indulgences. All the <hi>Sbirris</hi> of the
Legat and Archbiſhop, do guard all theſe Pageants
all Night, to prevent the Stealing of them. And it
is chiefly at Night, that the Gentlemen and Ladies
of the Town walk abroad to take a View of them,
becauſe then they make the fineſt Show; all the
Streets being illuminated with a vaſt Number of
white Wax-Tapers, ſet thick in every Corner, which
very much exalt the ſplendour of thoſe Rich and
pompous Ornaments. Here it is they Court their
Miſtreſſes, make Aſſignations, and diſpatch Notes to
one another, and in the End, always ſome miſerable
Wretch or other, is left a cold Victim on the ground,
to the Revenge of his Enemies, or the Jealouſie of his
Rivals. All the Ladies of Pleaſure, in a particular
manner, never fail of coming thither towards Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where they continue till they have got their
Prey. In a word, it appears that the moſt Innocent
are thoſe, who repair thither only to ſatisfie their
Eyes, or pleaſe their Curioſity; for as for Devotion,
there is not ſo much as the leaſt ſhadow of it to be
diſcern'd amongſt them. Thus are theſe fine gawdy
Feaſts, inſtituted on purpoſe to confound the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
within a ſhort time, by a juſt Judgment of
God, become the ſhame and confuſion of <hi>Papiſts</hi>
themſelves; and I have reaſon to fear, that our Lord
Jeſus will tell them to their Faces, at that Great
Day, in which he will come to judge both the Quick
and the Dead, that his Soul has abhor'd their Feaſts,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57009:177"/>
and that their Incenſe has been an Abomination
unto him; becauſe inſtead of advancing his Glory
by them, as they ſeem to pretend, they have only
endeavour'd to ſatisfie their own Curioſity, Vanity,
and infamous Luſts.</p>
               <p>I have been a Spectator of many other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions,</hi>
made in honour of the Holy Sacrament at
<hi>Venice, Milan,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy;</hi> but I will
not take up time to give you the Particulars of
them, becauſe they generally are the ſame thing
over again; except only, that their Adornings of
the Streets are not ſo Curious, neither continue ſo
long a Time as thoſe at <hi>Bononia.</hi> I cannot find
that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> reap any great Benefit from theſe
<hi>Proceſſions,</hi> but on the contrary are at the Charges
of Adorning their Churches and Altars: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they hereby gain much Credit and Repute to
their <hi>Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Maſſes;</hi> and they appear at
them with ſo much Majeſty, and dreſt with ſuch
pompous Ornaments, and Habiliments, that it makes
the People conceive a greater Veneration for their
Perſons. However, they know very well how to
Repay themſelves this Charge they are at, upon other
Occaſions: 'Tis but Unveiling one of their Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Images, when they have a mind to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſe
themſelves, double and treble. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
'tis for this very Reaſon, that at <hi>Bononia,</hi> (a
ſhort time after the <hi>Octave</hi> of the Holy Sacrament)
they make that great Ceremony and Proceſſion of
our Lady of S. <hi>Luke.</hi> To give you ſome Idea of
it, I ſhall tell you, that about Five Miles from <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi>
upon an high Hill called the <hi>Mount de la
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57009:178"/>
Guardias,</hi> ſtands a Church, wherein is kept an Image
of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> which the <hi>Papists</hi> tell us was painted
by S. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf. The <hi>Priests</hi> have ſo beſtirr'd
themſelves, as to perſuade the Magiſtrates, to put the
City under Her Protection, giving her the Title of
<hi>Their Patroneſs and Conſervatrix; Patrona &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatrix
Bononiae.</hi> They have cauſed a Coyn to be
ſtampt in Honour of her, which on the one ſide
bears the Repreſentation of the Image pretendedly
Painted by S. <hi>Luke;</hi> and on the Reverſe, the Arms
of the City; which Piece of Mony they call a
<hi>Madonnine.</hi> The Magiſtrates have made a Vow,
to go and fetch this Image every year, and carry it
in Proceſſion: They bring it from <hi>Mount de la
Guardia</hi> to their Town, to the end ſhe may bleſs its
Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Many days before this Solemnity, great Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are made to fetch her off in Triumph. Having
got her into the City, they make her ſtay there
8 Days, during which time they remove her to two
or three Churches; where the People flock in throngs
to Viſit her, and Offer great Preſents, all which
accrue to the profit of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of thoſe Churches.
After that they have ſufficiently Idoliz'd this Image,
or Picture, they oblige her to give her Bleſſing to all
the People. To this purpoſe they faſten the Picture
to great Staves or Poles, ſupported by Men; and
lifting it up on high, they make it bow and incline
towards the People, as if ſhe Saluted them. This
done, they lift her up a little higher, and incline her
downwards again; and then ſtoop her down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Right and Left, that ſo ſhe may make
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57009:178"/>
the Sign of the Croſs over all the People that are
preſent; and this, forſooth, is her Bleſſing of the
People. To receive this <hi>Benediction</hi> with the greater
Reverence, all the People are down upon their
Knees, with their Faces bow'd down to the Ground.
All this while the Trumpets and Drums do Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
And after this Ceremony is over, ſhe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
back again, in the ſame Proceſſional way, to
the place of her Abode, where ſhe continues all the
Year after, except ſome publick Calamity oblige
the Magiſtrates, to permit the bringing of her
extraordinarily to the City in Proceſſion; for in
that caſe, they believe ſhe will not fail of redreſſing
all the Evils they can lye under. Every <hi>Saturday</hi>
there is a vaſt Concourſe of People comes to this
Image from the City of <hi>Bononia,</hi> and adjoyning
places.</p>
               <p>To make the Way more commodious for thoſe
devout <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> the <hi>Bononians</hi> have undertaken to
make a Covered-way, which begins at the Gate of
the City, and is intended to be carried on to that
of the Church, where the Image reſides. Above
half of this Way was already finiſhed, when I was
there. The Whole is compos'd of great <hi>Porti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>'s</hi>
of Brick, very large and high Roof'd, the Roofs
being all curiouſly painted; and the bottom is
Paved very neatly with great ſquare Bricks. When
this <hi>Portal</hi> is once finiſhed, it will be one of the
moſt Curious pieces of Workmanſhip that is in all
<hi>Italy.</hi> Many particular Noblemen, have ſignaliz'd
their Zeal for carrying on of this Work, having
each of them made ſeveral Arches of it at their
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57009:179"/>
own Charges, on which they have cauſed their
Arms to be painted. But in the mean time, tho'
this Work be already ſo far advanced, yet ſome are
afraid they ſhall never ſee it brought to perfection;
becauſe the remaining part is the moſt difficult to
compaſs, and will coſt much more than what is
already done; for this <hi>Portal</hi> is now to be carried
on, up the Mountain, till it reach the Church of
our Lady on the Top of it; and to this end they
muſt be obliged to Dig very deep, to find firm
Ground whereon to lay a ſolid Foundation. A
good Curate perceivin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that the Devotion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
to this vaſt Expence began to grow cold,
found out a very ingenuous way to excite the
Drowzy and Lethargic Charities of the People,
making uſe of the following Device:</p>
               <p>He acquainted his Pariſhioners, <hi>That he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
inſpir'd by the</hi> Virgin, <hi>to make a Proceſſion to
the</hi> Miraculous Image <hi>with Twelve Wagons loaden
with Materials, for carrying on this Structure;
he deſired them to ſhew their Zeal in contributing
to ſo good a Work; and that for his part, he would
take care to range the Proceſſion in Order, according
to the Model the</hi> Virgin <hi>had been pleaſed to give
him of it in a Dream.</hi> His Pariſhioners very
punctually executed the Orders he had given them,
lading four Wagons with Bricks, four with Lime,
and four with Sand. The Curate ſeeing their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs,
ſent every where for Flowers and ſweet
Herbs to cover the Wagons, and to make Garlands
for the Oxen that drew them; he got their Horns
and Hoofs to be gilt, and ſet himſelf at the Head of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57009:179"/>
this Convoy, with the Croſs and Banner, having
procur'd ſeveral young Girls with Timbrels in their
Hands to play upon them, and Dance about the
Wagons, as <hi>David</hi> did before the Ark. In this
Equipage he paſs'd through all the Streets of the
City. He had the Approbation of the <hi>Italians,</hi>
who are much delighted with new and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
Inventions, and eſpecially wherein Women
or Girls come to play their parts. The good
Succeſs this Curate met with, beſides the general
Approbation, put all his Brethren upon doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Imitation of him, and, if poſſible, to go
beyond him. So that about a Fortnight after there
was to be ſeen a general Proceſſion of all the
Pariſhes with above 200 Wagons loaden with
Bricks, Lime, and Sand, drawn by Oxen with gilded
Horns. I never ſaw a more Extravagant Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
than this was, nor a more pleaſant one. The
March advanced in very good order, with Croſſes,
Banners, Prieſts, and the Girls that Danced, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Lady of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and helpt to build a
great part of that <hi>Portal.</hi> As ſoon as it is finiſhed,
they will be able to go (at all Seaſons, and in all
Weathers) from <hi>Bononia</hi> to the place of Devotion,
without wetting or dirting themſelves, any more
than if they were in their own Houſes.</p>
               <p>But that I may not wander too far from my
Subject of Proceſſions, I ſhall further acquaint you,
that the <hi>Monks</hi> do far excel the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in their In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſome Proceſſion or other made in their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57009:180"/>
The <hi>Dominicans</hi> make a Proceſſion of the
<hi>Roſary</hi> every firſt Sunday of the Month, and the
ſecond Sundays the <hi>Carmelites</hi> make one in honour
of the <hi>Scapulary;</hi> the third Sundays, the <hi>Soccolanti</hi>
celebrate a Proceſſion in honour of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of
<hi>Padua.</hi> 'Tis in theſe Monkiſh Proceſſions that all
is put in practice, wherewith Lewdneſs and Vanity
are capable of Inſpiring the moſt looſe and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Souls; ſo far are they from being Religious
Employments, and fitted for Devotion, as they
pretend them to be. By the ſmall taſte I ſhall here
give you of them, you may be able to judge of all
the reſt. I ſhall begin with a Proceſſion of the
<hi>Roſary,</hi> which I ſaw at <hi>Venice,</hi> made by the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi>
of <hi>Caſtello,</hi> which was order'd in this
manner:</p>
               <p>Next after the Croſs and Banner, went about
Two or Three hundred Little Children, dreſt like
Angels, and others like little He and She Saints,
amongſt which they did not forget to place a good
number of Little S. <hi>John Baptists:</hi> Theſe were
followed by Thirty or Forty young Women, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
ſo many Saints of their Sex. One of
them repreſented S. <hi>Apollina;</hi> and to diſtinguiſh her
from the reſt, ſhe carried in her hand a Baſon gilt
and enamell'd, in which there were Teeth; another
repreſented S. <hi>Lucia,</hi> and carried in a Baſon two
Eyes; a third, S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> who carried in her Arms a
Living Lamb; and ſo of the reſt, every one of
them being Characterized by their Marks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.
There were ſome of them that were
prepar'd on purpoſe to make People Laugh, and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57009:180"/>
above all the reſt, a Saint <hi>Genevieve,</hi> who had a
lighted Wax-Taper in one hand, and in the other
a Book wherein ſhe read, or at leaſt made ſhew of
doing ſo; and round about her there were Seven or
Eight young Boys dreſt like Devils, all over black
as a Coal, with great long Tails, and very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
and ridiculous Countenances, and great
Horns on their Heads; theſe skipped about the
Saint, and made a Thouſand Ridlculous poſtures,
Apiſh Tricks, and Faces, to endeavour to diſtract
and divert her from reading of her <hi>Breviary,</hi> by
making of her Laugh. The Maiden who acted
the Perſonage of this Saint, had been choſen by
them on purpoſe of a Melancholy Temperament,
who accordingly Acted her part very well; ſhe
always kept her Eyes fix'd on her <hi>Hours,</hi> without
giving the leaſt ſhew of a Smile; tho' all the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators
that were preſent could not contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from burſting out into loud Laughter, to ſee
the Ridiculous Poſtures thoſe Little Devils put
themſelves into, and who were certainly moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
and pickel'd Youths; foraſmuch as many
times they made a ſhew of taking up her Coats.
This Saint was followed by another, as fit to make
the People Laugh as the former; this was a S. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi>
of <hi>Sienna,</hi> who had by her ſide a pretty
Little Boy, with a Broom in one Hand, and a pair
of Bellows in the other; for they hold, that this
Saint (who was a Religious of the <hi>Dominican</hi>
Order) had ſo great a Familiarity with the Child
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> that that Divine Infant, to eaſe her when ſhe
was weary, frequently came and ſwept her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57009:181"/>
and kindled her Fire. After theſe good She
Saints came all thoſe whom they call <hi>Figures,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
all thoſe Holy Women, who according
to them did repreſent the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> in the
Old Teſtament; they were carried upon Frames
on Mens Shoulders. Amongſt the reſt there was
<hi>Jael</hi> to be ſeen in her Tent, with <hi>Siſera</hi> lying at
her Feet, who was a Beautiful young Youth, dreſt
in the Garb of a Warriour, and ſhe with a Great
Nail and Hammer, making ſhew as if ſhe had been
ready to pierce his Temples: After this Figure
came a <hi>Dalila,</hi> ſitting in an Elbow Chair with a
comly young Youth between her knees; ſhe had
a pair of Sciſſors in her Hand, as if ſhe had been
about to cut off his Locks. After theſe appeareth
<hi>Judith:</hi> This was a fine Figure indeed; for on
the Frame where ſhe was, there were above
Twenty perſons, it being the Repreſentation of
<hi>Judiths</hi> Return to <hi>Bethuliah</hi> in Triumph with
<hi>Holofernes</hi> his Head, when the Prieſts and People
came out to meet, and ſung a Song in praiſe of her.
This <hi>Judith</hi> was one of the moſt Beautiful young
Women of <hi>Italy,</hi> and very Laſciviouſly dreſt;
round about her (upon the ſame Frame or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant)
they had placed ſeveral excellent Muſicians,
who ſung moſt Raviſhing <hi>Stanza's</hi> in honour of
her. The following Pageant, as if they had a
mind to oppoſe <hi>Deformity</hi> to <hi>Beauty,</hi> ſupported a
good Old Woman, without any Teeth in her
Head, and very deformed; who mutter'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
within her Gums, and repreſented <hi>Hannah</hi>
the Mother of <hi>Samuel.</hi> I was aſtoniſh'd to ſee a
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57009:181"/>
Woman of her Age would truſt her ſelf on a
Pageant. She was followed by many more Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants,
which were in all Eighteen in number,
with their different Figures; but I ſhall not inſiſt
upon a particular deſcription of any more of them,
that I may not tire you out; and ſhall only tell you,
that the laſt of them all was the Truth of all theſe
Figures, and the Perſon typified, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Bleſſed
Virgin,</hi> who was repreſented by a very comly and
Beautiful Maid, very Richly dreſt, with a great
Royal Robe; ſhe held a great <hi>Roſary</hi> or <hi>Beadrow</hi>
in her left Hand, and in her right Hand a Scepter.
She had a rich <hi>Crown</hi> upon her Head, ſet thick
with <hi>Pearls</hi> and <hi>Diamonds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>People of Quality in <hi>Italy</hi> take it to be a Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
piece of Service to accommodate the Saints
of both Sexes, with their richeſt Jewels, at theſe
Proceſſions; which is the Reaſon, that very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
on theſe Occaſions great Riches are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to view.</p>
               <p>I obſerved, that when this young Woman, who
repreſented the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> paſt by, carried on a
Pageant, no Body ſtirr'd their Hats, no Body
bow'd themſelves, or fell down to Worſhip her, or
call upon her; but a little while after, when the
Wooden Image of the <hi>Virgin</hi> came to paſs by
them, (which is the ſame that ſtands on the Altar
of the Chappel of the <hi>Roſary</hi> of the <hi>Dominicans</hi>
of <hi>Caſtello</hi>) all the People fell down on their
Knees, and beating their Breaſts, called her the
<hi>Mother of God,</hi> and prayed to her. They made
her, at certain diſtances, to beſtow her Salutations
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57009:182"/>
and Benedictions upon the People, in the ſame
manner I related to you, ſpeaking of our Lady of
S. <hi>Luke</hi> of <hi>Bononia,</hi> and which were received by
them with a great deal of Acknowledgment, as a
very great Favour. Having apply'd my Mind to
find out the Reaſon, why the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not pay
their Adorations to Living Figures, tho' they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
repreſent the <hi>Virgin</hi> more naturally, than a
piece of Stone or Wood can do; and yet are ſo
exact in beſtowing them on their Inanimate Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
After having ſpent ſome Thoughts upon it,
I could not light upon any other Reaſon but this;
That Human Nature having a kind of Horrour
impreſt upon it, of rendring to the <hi>Creature</hi> a
Worſhip that is due to <hi>GOD</hi> only, all Living
Figures (and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi>)
do more fully diſcover to the Senſe their weak
dependent Creatural Being, than Inanimate things
do, in which they ſuppoſe there is ſome ſecret adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Divine Virtue. Tho', to ſpeak the Truth,
this is no other than the higheſt pitch of Folly,
and the root and riſe of all Idolatry. But I return
to our <hi>Proceſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Image of <hi>Wood</hi> was carried in the midſt
of the Father <hi>Dominicans,</hi> who were to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of about an Hundred; for they having many
Convents in <hi>Venice,</hi> they are ready to aſſiſt one
another upon the like Occaſions. Nothing can be
imagin'd more looſe and laſcivious than they
appear'd in all their Deportment; they had great
<hi>Roſaries</hi> on their Arms, but there was none of
them that troubled himſelf to ſay them, except
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57009:182"/>
it were ſome Old Father amongſt them, that was
going out of the World, and was no more fit to
make any Figure in it; but all the reſt of them,
ſtrutted and march'd in a moſt Wanton manner in
their Fine white Habits. All the way they went,
they Talk'd and Laugh'd together, caſting their
Eyes this way and that way on the Ladies that
look'd out of Windows, or ſtood in the Streets, to
ſee the Proceſſion march along.</p>
               <p>I do not think, Sir, it will be neceſſary for me,
to deſire you to make ſome Reflexion on theſe
kind of Proceedings; becauſe you cannot but take
notice from the Recital I give you, what all theſe
<hi>Proceſſions</hi> aim at. Certainly, they are at the beſt
no better than Entertainments for Children, or
rather ridiculous <hi>Farces</hi> to pleaſe Fools; but which
at the ſame time expoſe the Chriſtian Religion
to the reproach and derision of Atheiſts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.
Some Perſons reported to me of a Truth,
that they had overheard ſome Turkiſh Merchants,
who were Spectators at this Proceſſion, ſaying to
one another, <hi>Have you ever ſeen the like Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Fooleries? And, muſt not a Man be
bereft of his Senſes, before he can ever be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
to embrace ſuch a Religion?</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi>
boaſt themſelves in this, as an infallible Mark of
the Truth of their Religion, That there is no one
Chriſtian Society in the World, that take more
pains for the Converſion of Infidels, and who are
bleſt with greater Succeſs in that Undertaking,
than themſelves. But ſuppoſing all they ſay to
be True, yet I am ſure it may be ſaid (with much
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57009:183"/>
more Truth,) That there is no Chriſtian Church
in the World, is a greater Obſtacle to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of Infidels than theirs is, and that for One
whom they Convert, they hinder a Million from
being Converted, who probably might come to
the Light of the Goſpel, had they not been Eye-witneſſes
of the groſs Folly and Idolatry of their
pretended Religious Practices: Yea, they are even
found in the uſe of thoſe things which make their
own <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> of Forein Countries to
Bluſh for them, when they are told of it. The
<hi>Engliſh Papiſts</hi> look upon ſuch Relations barely as
Exaggerations and Calumnies deviſed by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to blacken them. All that I can ſay to this
ſort of People is, That if they pleaſe to go to
<hi>Italy,</hi> their own Eyes will be able to convince them
of more and greater Extravagancies, than thoſe I
have related to you in any of my LETTERS.
The very ſame Follies were formerly in Vogue and
Practiſe in <hi>France;</hi> but the ſight only of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
that were mingled amongſt them, have
made them drop a good number of them. Thus
by a ſpecial effect of the Goodneſs of God, the
Preſence only of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> carries a kind of
Bleſſing with it, which ſecretly reproves and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
Vice, confounds Error, and inſpires Truth.</p>
               <p>I will add to this <hi>Proceſſion</hi> I ſaw at <hi>Venice,</hi>
another I have ſeen at <hi>Milan:</hi> This was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
by the <hi>Carmelites</hi> in Honour of the <hi>Little
Scapulary,</hi> wherewith I have entertain'd you in a
former LETTER; and that I may not trouble
you with Repetitions of the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:57009:183"/>
which were of the ſame kind, as thoſe I have
already given you a deſcription of; I ſhall only
take notice to you of ſuch Particulars as were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and different in this <hi>Proceſſion</hi> from thoſe
before related. One thing very remarkable in this
<hi>Proceſſion</hi> was, That moſt of the young Gentle-women
of the Town aſſiſted at it in their Richeſt
Cloaths, and adorn'd with all their Jewels. They
marched Four in a Rank, with great white Wax
Tapers in their Hands, and all the way they went,
ſung the Pſalms and Hymns to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi>
that are uſed in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> The Women
in <hi>Italy</hi> are not wont to Sing in their Churches,
it being forbidden them, except thoſe only who
are of ſome Religious Order. However the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites</hi>
made bold to introduce this piece of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
either to give themſelves the ſatisfaction of
being Charm'd with ſo may ſweet Voices, or at
leaſt to flatter and pleaſe the Humor of the <hi>Milan</hi>
Gentlemen, who were extreamly pleas'd with the
Device. They were rang'd on both Sides of the
Street, to ſee the young Ladies paſs by, who went
with Naked Breaſts, and with an Air of Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs,
proper to inſpire their Lovers with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
indeed, but very different from what was
pretended.</p>
               <p>It was about an hour and half in the Night
when the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> began to ſet forth, and the
Light of the Wax-Candles and Torches, much
advanced the luſtre of the Beauty and Ornaments
of this Choice Band. All the Way they paſt, the
Streets rung with nothing but, <hi>Ay, this is a fine
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57009:184"/>
Show indeed! O, the Lovely Proceſſion! See,
how gracefully the Lady of</hi> N. <hi>carries her Taper!
What a Majeſtick and becoming Gate that Lady
has? O, the charming Voice of this Sweet one
here!</hi> Others again more impertinent than the
former, caſt out Words to them (as they paſs'd by)
of a double meaning, which in the midſt of ſo holy
an Exerciſe, as (forſooth) they will needs have it
to be, were pregnant Inſtances of the Profaneſs and
Filth of their Hearts. After the Ladies, came the
Fathers <hi>Carmelites,</hi> Two and Two together; ſo
that this whole Proceſſion was only compos'd of
Women and Monks; with a Wooden Image re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
the <hi>Virgin,</hi> which brought up the Rear,
and to which all the Spectators paid their Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Kneeling down in the Streets when it paſs'd
by, to receive its Salutations and Benedictions,
which the good Fathers <hi>Carmelites,</hi> that bore the
Statue, made her beſtow upon the People.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> pleaſe themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
in making ſuch like Proceſſions in their ſeveral
Churches; becauſe it is upon theſe Occaſions, that
they appear with a pomp and luſtre, that dazles the
Eyes of People, and makes the Simple imagin, they
diſcern ſomething in their Perſons that is more than
Human; tho' indeed all this be at the bottom no
more than a fooliſh Vanity, and a pure Illuſion of
the Spirit of this World. We don't find them ſo
zealous for, and ready to aſſiſt at thoſe <hi>Proceſſions,</hi>
that have any thing that is painful annex'd to
them; and at which the Ladies cannot conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
aſſiſt. This is what I obſerv'd at <hi>Milan,</hi>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:57009:184"/>
at the time of the <hi>Rogations</hi> that are kept in
<hi>Aſcenſion Week.</hi> 'Tis a Cuſtom obſerv'd in all
Countries that are of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, to
make Proceſſions the Three days before <hi>Holy
Thurſday;</hi> that is to ſay, to go with Croſs and
Banner from one Church to another, to ſay their
Prayers.</p>
               <p>Now at <hi>Milan</hi> this Proceſſion begins not till
an Hour after Midnight, and doth not end till the
next Day at Two of the Clock in the Afternoon.
All the Prieſts of the City, and adjoyning Places,
are bound to aſſiſt at them, not excepting the
Stranger Prieſts that are in the City. They muſt
preciſely meet at the Hour appointed, at the Sound
of the Great Bell of the Cathedral, in order to
Range themſelves under the Croſs and Banner.
But becauſe the great Allurement is wanting in
theſe kind of Proceſſions, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had rather
Sleep far in the Day, than to take the pains to
aſſiſt at them: But the Cardinal Archbiſhop, tho'
he does not care for going himſelf, has at laſt
found out a way to make them go, tho' ſore againſt
their Wills; for by his Order all the <hi>Sbirris</hi> of
the Archbiſhoprick being joyn'd with thoſe of the
Town, to the number of an Hundred and Fifty,
Armed with Blunderbuſſes, Piſtols, and Bayonets,
divide themſelves into ſeveral ſmall Parties of Five
or Six together, and go the Round through all the
Streets of the City, to look for the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that are
abſent from the Proceſſion; they go and ſearch for
them in their very Houſes, and in caſe they find
any, they tye their Hands together on their Backs,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57009:185"/>
and in this Infamous manner, drag them to the
Archbiſhops Priſons. When they are come to the
Priſon Gates, then <hi>Sbirris</hi> ſearch their Cloaths and
Pockets, and after having very Abuſively treated
them, they take from them all they find about them,
and thruſt them down into a Dungeon; where
they remain, till they be Summoned to Appear in
the Archbiſhops Court; where at laſt they are
acquitted, after a ſmall Reproof, and a Mulct of
Twenty Crowns to the Archbiſhop. The <hi>Prieſts</hi>
ſeeing that there was no way of exempting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from aſſiſting at the Proceſſion, found out the
Secret however, of making it ſomewhat more ſweet
and eaſie to them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proceſſion</hi> goes in One Morning only to
Ten or Twelve Churches, where they enter, and
ſtay for ſome conſiderable Time, to Sing their
<hi>Litanies;</hi> but foraſmuch as the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> by reaſon
of their great Numbers, cannot all enter into the
ſame Church, the far greater part of them being
oblig'd to ſtand abroad in the Streets, about the
Church; but they not liking this Waiting abroad,
found a means to take up all the adjoyning Taverns
and Victualling-Houſes, and there made much of
themſelves, whilſt their Brethren were Singing in
the Church; and after they had well ſolac'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
went and reliev'd their Brethren, giving
them an occaſion to do as they had done; and by
this means the Office was diſpatch'd with much
more Courage and Vigour. But the thing in it
ſelf being ſo baſe and ſcandalous in the Eyes of
the Seculars, and ſome Complaints having been
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57009:185"/>
made of their diſorderly Carriage to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,
he order'd ſome Thirty of his <hi>Sbirris</hi>
ſhould always Coaſt about the Proceſſion, and
ſearch all the Taverns for <hi>Priests,</hi> and if they find
any, to drive them thence; ſo that the poor <hi>Prieſts</hi>
being ſo nearly watch'd, are debarr'd of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of Refreſhing themſelves with a Glaſs of
good Wine. However this doth not hinder, but that
ſome of them take care to have a Bottle of Wine
in their Pockets, or ſome other Convenience, under
their Surplices; and when they have a mind to take
a Sup, they pray ſome of their Brethren to ſtand
round them, and ſtooping a little, that they may
not be perceived by the <hi>Sbirris,</hi> they very dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
Refreſh themſelves, in ſpite of the Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Proceſsion</hi> enters into any Churches
belonging to <hi>Monks,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> get themſelves
into the Convent which joyns to it, where the
<hi>Monks</hi> (that any of them are acquainted with) treat
them with Meat and Drink, as much as they deſire;
and here they are ſecured from the Search of the
<hi>Sbirris,</hi> who have no power to look for them
there; and ſhould they attempt ſuch a thing,
would find but a very bad Welcom. As ſoon as
the <hi>Proceſsion</hi> is arriv'd to a certain Church, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
by the Archbiſhop, the Twelve Eccleſiaſtical
<hi>Praefects</hi> of the Twelve Gates of <hi>Milan,</hi> which are
all <hi>Arch-Prieſts,</hi> and who have the inſpection of all
the Clergy divided amongſt them, aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſome great Place, and every one of
them having a Liſt of all the <hi>Priests</hi> that are
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57009:186"/>
under his Juriſdiction, they Read their Names aloud
one after another, being all of them obliged to
Anſwer to their Names, and preſent themſelves.
If any one be found wanting, the ſame day a
Note is ſent to his Houſe, to pay the Twenty
Crowns mulct for his Abſence. The whole Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
being finiſh'd, the <hi>Proceſsion</hi> returns to the
Cathedral. It is commonly Three of the Clock in
the Afternoon before the <hi>Proceſsion</hi> enters the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral;
and then upon the Ringing of the Great
Bell, every one of them has leave to return home,
the <hi>Sbirris</hi> having no further power to meddle with
them; but they Scuffle home with that precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as makes the Spectators Laugh heartily, to ſee
Hungry Prieſts poſt away to their long-look'd-for
Dinners.</p>
               <p>Now it is apparent, that theſe <hi>Rogation Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
are ſo very diſpleaſing to them; becauſe,
firſt of all, there is nothing to be Gain'd by them.
In the ſecond place, there are no Ladies to aſſiſt
at them. And thirdly, there are neither Angels nor
Figures, to give them the leaſt Sport or Diverſion.
In the fourth place, they are not permitted to
Solemnize theſe Proceſſions in their pompous Habits,
but ſimply with their Surplices and ſquare Bonnets;
which is the cauſe why the Seculars will not ſo
much as ſtep out of their way to ſee them paſs.
Fifthly, the Proceſſion being enjoyn'd them, under
rigorous Mulcts and Puniſhments, this is that which
makes it go moſt of all againſt their Stomach to
aſſiſt at it; for as much pleaſure as they take in
imperiouſly Commanding others; ſo much regret
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57009:186"/>
they have to obey and be ſubject to the Command
of their Superiours. And laſt of all, in theſe kind
of Proceſſions, there are ſome Inconveniences to
be endur'd; they muſt leave their Beds long
before Day; they muſt take many large Turns
and weariſom Steps, and Sing long without either
Eating or Drinking; which does not very well ſort
with their Humor.</p>
               <p>The Jolly Proceſſions of the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi>
have much more Charms for them; or the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiling
of ſome <hi>Miraculous Image;</hi> or the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Proceſſion of the <hi>Holy Nail,</hi> which is Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
every Summer in <hi>Milan,</hi> and to which not
only the Inhabitants of that City, but all the
Nobility and Gentry of the Neighbouring Towns
and Provinces do flock in Crowds, to be the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators
of that Ambulatory Pomp and Magnificence.
In this caſe there is no need of the <hi>Sbirris,</hi> to
oblige the Eccleſiaſticks to aſſiſt at it: The Cardinal
Archbiſhop himſelf. aſſiſts in perſon at it, and carries
the Relick of the <hi>Holy Nail.</hi> According to their
Tradition, this is one of thoſe Nails that pierced
the Adorable Body of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus
Christ,</hi> when he was Nailed to the Croſs; which
<hi>Constantine</hi> the Great having met with, in Honour
to it, made it part of his Horſes Bridle. It is now
expos'd to View, enclos'd in a very fair Chryſtal,
fix'd upon a large Pedeſtal of pure Gold, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Workmanſhip, and embeliſh'd with
Precious Stones; and is certainly one of the richeſt
and fineſt Pieces that can be ſeen, and ſo heavy,
that the Cardinal had much ado to carry it.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57009:187"/>
The Nail is crooked, as having been made a part
of a Bridle.</p>
               <p>The Reflection I have made upon this Nail is,
that according to the Hiſtory it ſelf, which the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> give us of it, it appears, That the Relicks,
and ſpecially the Inſtruments of the Paſſion of our
Saviour, to which they at preſent pretend we are
oblig'd to render <hi>Latria,</hi> that is, <hi>Divine Worſhip,</hi>
did not in Ancient Times receive any ſuch Honour,
ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (as they own themſelves) made
that Nail a part of his Horſes Bridle; which no
Body will be ſo impertinent as to own for a piece
of Divine Honour. He did not cauſe it to be ſet
upon the Altar, as it is at preſent; neither did Men
Kneel before it, as the practice of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is at
this Day; for otherwiſe it would have follow'd,
That wherever <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Horſe paſs'd, all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
muſt have proſtrated themſelves before it;
which is very abſurd, and beſides is not hinted to us
in any part of the Hiſtory of that Great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p>And ſince I am inſenſibly fallen upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
that are in Vogue at <hi>Milan,</hi> I think my
ſelf bound to give you the deſcription of one of
the moſt Famous that City can boaſt of, being the
ſame which is put in practice the Eve of <hi>Holy
Friday.</hi> This Proceſſion is celebrated by Torch-Light,
and proceeds in the Order as follows:</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Croſs and Banner, follow
the Croſs-Bearers; theſe are Men that carry great
<hi>Croſſes</hi> on their Shoulders, fifteen or twenty Foot
long; they are very great and heavy in appearance,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:57009:187"/>
but hollow within, and indeed are nothing but
Four thin Boards glu'd together: Yet I am apt
to believe, That by reaſon of their great Bulk,
they are a reaſonable good Burthen for a ſingle
Man, and troubleſom enough to thoſe that bear
them; and accordingly they tell us, That theſe
Croſs-Bearers perform this piece of Devotion from
a Spirit of Repentance and Penance, and to imitate
our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when he carried his <hi>Croſs</hi>
up to Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi> There are no leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
than two or three Hundred of them, and
the moſt of them have Ropes about their Necks,
and great Chains on their Legs, which Trail on
the Ground after them, and make a hideous Noiſe.
Their Faces are cover'd with great Cowls.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Croſs-Bearers</hi> put me in mind of certain
Hereticks, mention'd by <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Annals, who were call'd <hi>Cruciferi.</hi> It
ſeems they took that place of the Goſpel according
to the Letter, <hi>He that doth not take up his Croſs
and follow me, cannot be my Diſciple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And
accordingly they had got great <hi>Croſſes,</hi> which they
bore on their Shoulders, and running like Mad-Men
over Mountains and through Deſerts, they
never quitted them, till Hunger, Thirſt, and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs,
thruſt their Souls out of their Bodies. I
muſt confeſs, That thoſe who aſſiſt at theſe Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
do not ſtrain their Devotion to this pitch;
bnt ſtill there is ſomewhat of reſemblance in their
Actions.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of theſe <hi>Croſs-Bearers</hi> was carried
on a Pageant, a Figure of our Saviour going up
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57009:188"/>
to Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi> After theſe <hi>Croſs-Bearers</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the <hi>Diſcipliners,</hi> as they call them; theſe
alſo had their Faces cover'd with great Cowls, and
having their Backs ſtark Naked, with great <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines</hi>
they had in their Hands they cruelly beat
themſelves, making the Blood to run down their
Shoulders in a manner, that caus'd Horrour to
Nature. In the midſt of theſe Flagellators, was
carried a Repreſentation of the Scourging of our
Saviour, ty'd to a Pillar. After theſe followed
ſeveral Companies of Souldiers, with their Muskets
and Pikes, the Points downwards, and their Colours
in like manner. All the Drums were cover'd with
Black Cloth, and beating upon it made the Sound
very doleful. After the Souldiers, followed a
Living Figure of our Saviour, which was a young
Man dreſt in a large Purple Robe, with a Crown
of Thorns on his Head, and bearing a great Croſs
on his Shoulders: He had round about him near a
Score of Youths habited like <hi>Jews,</hi> who put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into an hundred ridiculous Poſtures, and made
Faces at him after ſuch a manner, as forc'd the
Spectators to Laugh, at a Sight, which ought to
have melted their Hearts into ſorrow and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction;
neither was this a ſtrange thing amongſt
them, their holy Repreſentations being very ſurely
exempt from ſome Notorious Profanation: There
was no Kneeling to this Figure, becauſe it was a
Live one. This Figure was follow'd by all the
Confraternities of the City or <hi>Scuole,</hi> which are
very numerous. They marched Two and Two
with Wax-Tapers lighted in their Hands; and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57009:188"/>
after them follow'd another Figure of our Saviour
laid in his Sepulchre. As ſoon as this came by,
tho' it were only made of Wood, all that ſtood in
the Streets, fell down on their Knees and worſhip'd
it. About this Figure, there marched a Company
of Women all in Mourning, who held their Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs
before their Eyes, as if they had wept.
Next to theſe Women follow'd the Prieſts, and
after them a Statue of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> having
her Heart pierc'd with Seven great Swords, that
ſtuck faſt in it: They commonly call this, <hi>Our
Lady of Pity;</hi> and wherever it paſſed, they paid to
it the ſame Proſtrations and Adorations, as to the
Statue of our Saviour. A great Throng of People,
laſt of all, concluded the Proceſſion.</p>
               <p>I know well enough, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will not
only excuſe theſe kinds of Proceſſions, but will alſo
exalt them far above their plain Ones; alledging.
That theſe are all of them Holy Repreſentations,
which renew in our Minds, the Idea of what paſt
long ago on Mount <hi>Calvary:</hi> But for my part,
I believe, that the Time they take to diſpoſe and
regulate theſe kind of Proceſſions, and which the
Spectators ſpend in ſeeing them paſs by, would be
much better employ'd in Reading and Meditating
of the Hiſtory of our Saviour's Paſſion in private,
in order to the enkindling of holy Affections, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that great Occaſion. This, I ſay, would in
all probability be a far more efficacious Means to
obtain this Holy End, than to dreſs up a Man like
our Saviour, and turn all to a Farce, to make the
people Laugh at ſo tremendous a Myſtery; for this
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57009:189"/>
indeed, however they may otherwiſe diſguiſe it, is
the End of all.</p>
               <p>Thus likewiſe it is, when five Weeks after <hi>Eaſter</hi>
they repreſent the Aſcenſion of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> into Heaven; they have a great Statue of
Wood to repreſent him, which they tye with great
Cords about the Head, and juſt at Noon-tide of
<hi>Aſcenſion-day,</hi> at the Ringing of all the Bells in
Town, and in the preſence of all the People, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Perſons placed on the Roof of the Church,
draw it up by Cords into the Air; the Prieſts in
the mean time Singing the Anthem, <hi>Viri</hi> Galilaei
<hi>quid admiramini aspicientes in Coelum? &amp;c.</hi> When
the Statue is ready to enter into the Hole, which
they have made on purpoſe in the Roof for it,
there are Men poſted, who from the high Galleries
of the Church caſt ſome twenty or thirty Pails of
Water on the Spectators; ſo that many of them
are made wet to the Skins, which makes the reſt
break out into loud Laughter. This is the devout
End of this fine Ceremony, or holy Repreſentation,
as they are pleas'd to term it. I have ſeen this
particularly practis'd in <hi>Germany;</hi> where I have
alſo ſeen a great number of <hi>Croſs-Bearers</hi> and
<hi>Diſcipliners,</hi> as in <hi>Italy.</hi> And indeed, to judge by
outward appearance, one would believe theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to be animated by a great Spirit of Devotion
and Mortification; but having made it my buſineſs
to ſearch into the Matter, I found that the
moſt of them are engag'd to do it for Intereſt ſake,
being paid for Laſhing of themſelves, becauſe the
Eccleſiaſticks think it a ſhame, if in a <hi>Lent. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:57009:189"/>
they ſhould not have a good Number of
theſe Men of Diſcipline, and Croſs-Bearers. Others
again do it, becauſe their Confeſſors have enjoyn'd
it them, as a piece of Penance.</p>
               <p>I know indeed no Reaſon, why the Prieſts ſhould
pride themſelves with this; but ſure I am, I have
often heard them Reproach one another, that they
had none, or very few Scourgers in their Proceſſions.
'Tis poſſible, that by a ſottiſh kind of Vanity they
may ſuppoſe that the Glory of theſe kind of
publick Penances reflects upon themſelves, as being
the Impoſers of them, in which caſe their Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory
is no better founded, than the <hi>Crow's</hi> in the
Fable, who prided himſelf with that was none
of his. They are very well pleaſed, to ſee others
Laſh themſelves; but not ſo much as one of them
will be an Example of it to others; for never in
my Life did I ſee either <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Monks</hi> whip
themſelves in publick. Theſe <hi>Whippers</hi> and <hi>Croſs-Bearers,</hi>
for the moſt part, to make this piece of
Penance more tolerable to them, drink themſelves
to a good pitch before they ſet out a Proceſſioning.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was at <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> I ſaw a
great Inconvenience and Diſappointment happen
upon this Occaſion; where many of theſe <hi>Croſs-Bearers,</hi>
in the midſt of the Proceſſion, threw
down their <hi>Croſſes</hi> in the Streets, and very fairly
ſet themſelves down upon them, ſaying, <hi>That they
had born them long enough,</hi> and <hi>that it was but
fitting the</hi> Croſſes <hi>ſhould now bear them.</hi> Beſides,
many of the <hi>Diſcipliners</hi> fell a Singing and Danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Vomiting the ſurplus of the Wine they
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57009:190"/>
had taken. Moſt of them were <hi>Jeſuit</hi> Scholars,
whom their Regents had forc'd to this involuntary
Mortification.</p>
               <p>By this, Sir, you may eaſily diſcern, that the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> will make all things bend and ſtoop to their
Fancy and Humor. They have almoſt fram'd to
themſelves a New Goſpel; and they interpret the
Myſteries of it ſo materially and groſly, that in the
end they will probably perſuade People, That to
bear their Croſs in this World, is nothing elſe, but
to go a Proceſſioning with great Croſſes of Wood
upon their Shoulders; and conſequently maintain,
That it is a meer Hereſie to believe with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
<hi>That true Mortification is that of an humble
and contrite Heart, and of a Soul pierced with an
holy Sorrow and Repentance for Sin.</hi> 'Tis ſcarce
poſſible to make the Popiſh <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that
come into <hi>England,</hi> acknowledge, That theſe ſort
of fooliſh Exerciſes of Devotion, are at this Day
the moſt frequent Employments of their <hi>Roman
Catholicks,</hi> in thoſe Places where that Religion
takes place. They are ſo aſham'd to own theſe
their Follies, that at preſent none but Travellers
are able to convince them thereof, who can tell
them, that they have ſeen with their own Eyes,
what they ſo impudently deny with their
Mouths. It was from an effect of this Shame, that
made ſome <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>German Jeſuits</hi> (in my
preſence) Treat a Chapter of a certain Book, as
containing nothing but meer Calumnies, becauſe it
mention'd a Devotion which is ſtill every Year
practis'd in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> at <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:57009:190"/>
which is the Ceremony of Rocking the Cradle of
the Child JESUS. And yet there is nothing more
true, than that this Cuſtom is much in Vogue
amongſt them, my ſelf having ſeen it done ſeveral
times. Their way is this: They make on an Altar,
or in ſome Chappel of their Churches, a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Stable at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> with great Figures
repreſenting the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> S. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the
<hi>Child JESUS</hi> lying in his Manger. The <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
do excel all others in making thoſe kind of
Repreſentations, and make them their Paſtime and
Diverſion all the <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> Holydays; and the
Women have leave at that time to go from Church
to Church, to ſee theſe Pageants, and under pretext
of frequenting theſe Devotions, many Bargains are
ſtruck, little ſuiting with the pretended Holineſs of
the places where they are made.</p>
               <p>It cannot be deny'd, but that there is ſomething
in theſe Repreſentations, that does extreamly take
the Eye: You have a pleaſant proſpect here of
Rocks, Fountains, Foreſts, and delightful Green
Plains expreſs'd to the Life, and Shepherds feeding
their Flocks upon them: You ſee People from
all parts coming through Lanes and Paths, to offer
their Preſents to the Child <hi>JESUS.</hi> All this is
very naturally repreſented, and there is always ſome
Merry Conceit or other joyn'd with them, to make
People Laugh. But the principal Point I aim at in
this Deſcription is, That there are many great Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
or Cords, ty'd to the Cradle of the Child
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> which the Spectators that are there preſent,
(and upon their Knees) do pull towards them very
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57009:191"/>
devoutly, to Rock the Cradle, in like manner as we
ſee Nurſes do their Children; and then ſing what
in <hi>Italian</hi> they call their <hi>Nà, Nà,</hi> which are Songs
commonly ſung, to Rock Children aſleep; <hi>Sleep my
Little</hi> Jeſus, <hi>Sleep my Dear Love, Sleep; Nà, Nà,
Nà, Nà.</hi> But that which ſurpriz'd me beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
was, to ſee ſometime Old Men and Women riſe
up from their Knees in a great Anger, when they
heard too much Noiſe made in the Church, and
bidding them be Huſht, for that elſe they would
awake the Child <hi>Jeſus;</hi> which notwithſtanding is
no more than a piece of <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Paſt-Board</hi> painted
over: Yea, there be ſome ſo fearful of offending this
way, that they pull off their Shoes, aſſoon as they
enter the Church, for fear of Troubling the Childs
Reſt; whilſt (in the mean time) their <hi>Monks</hi> and
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> ſtanding behind in their <hi>Sextries,</hi> Laugh at
all theſe their Follies.</p>
               <p>I can ſay, that I never ſaw any of them lay hold
of the Cords to Rock the Cradle, and would be
ſore aſham'd to be found ſo ſottiſhly employ'd. And
probably, they would be underſtood in this ſenſe,
when they ſay, that this is never practis'd amongſt
them, becauſe they do not do it themſelves; but
they are very glad to ſee the Seculars ſo well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
for their Diverſion. Neither is this Childs
Play altogether without Profit to them; for there
be many of the Viſitants, who bring ſome of them
freſh Eggs, and others Pullets and Capons, to make
Caudles and Broths for the <hi>Virgin;</hi> all which they
lay in the Stable, near to the Image: Others bring
Cheeſes and great Bottles of Wine, which they lay

and Devotion a great Truſs of Hay, and laid it
down in the Holy Stable, between the <hi>Ox</hi> and the

bring good Gammons of Bacon and Neats Tongues
for S.</hi> Joſeph. The <hi>Sexton</hi> accordingly ran to take
it away; but the Country-Man briskly oppos'd him,

or rather I ſhall conclude this LETTER<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in like manner, as I have begun it, by giving you
a Relation of another Unveiling of an Image of
the <hi>Virgin</hi> I have ſeen at <hi>Milan,</hi> and which (as I
was told) was only done once in 50 years. All the
Corporations of the City, and of the Neighbouring
places, made their Viſits to it Proceſſionally, with
Wax-Tapers, Purſes, Preſents, and Ceremonies, not
much unlike thoſe I have already related to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The only thing ſingular in this Uncovering was,
That all the while the Image was Unveiled, there
was a great Concourſe from all parts of Poſſeſſed
perſons, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> being very buſie in all Corners
of the Church, to Exorciſe them. The <hi>Papists</hi>
maintain, That their Prieſts in their Ordination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Power of Caſting out Devils, and that the
Effect ſhews they are ſucceſsful in it. For my part,
I have ſeen very many of theſe Poſſeſſed Perſons,
and I have diligently apply'd my ſelf, to ſearch into
and examin the Matter; but could never diſcover any
able to perſuade me, that thoſe Effects or Operations
proceed rather from the Devil, than from a ſtrong
Imagination or ſome violent Diſtemper. Beſides,
I ſeldom met with any, but Women that were Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed;
and I would gladly be inform'd, why the
Devil ſhould rather attack them than Men. Indeed,
the true Reaſon of this is, That in <hi>Italy</hi> the Women
are more than ordinary ſubject to fall into Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
and ſtrange Imaginations. Their Parents, or
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57009:192"/>
their Husbands, keep them always ſhut up in their
Chambers or Garrets, without permitting them to
go abroad, except it be ſometime to Church: And
being naturally of an Hot and Amarous Temper,
a flattering and pleaſing Object they may by chance
have eſpy'd from their Windows, or at Maſs, does
ſo far tranſport them, that they are wholly poſſeſt
with it, and not with the Devil, as is ſuppoſed.
Their Thoughts are ſtrongly fix'd on it Day and
Night, and the force of their Imagination, making
a wonderful impreſſion upon their Vital Spirits, does
extreamly agitate and confound them; and from
thence proceed all that diſorder, and thoſe Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
that appear in their Bodies.</p>
               <p>The Church I ſpeak of was full of this ſort of
Poſſeſſed perſons. Amongſt the reſt I perceived in
one of the Chappels, a very Beautiful young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
who continually beat her Breaſt with her
hand, and cried out, as if ſhe had felt ſomething
that would have choak'd her. She had many Prieſts
about her, Reading of Exorciſms; but amongſt the
reſt there was a very Handſom Prieſt, who did
Wonders, and indeed outdid them all. The Poſſeſt
Party ſeem'd to have no conſideration for any of
the reſt, but for him only, and whenever he touch'd
her, the Devil to appearance being overcome by the
force of his Exorciſms, left off to Torment her.
I was aſtoniſh'd to ſee the Liberty this young
Gentleman took with his Poſſeſſed; for ſometimes
he would Embrace her Body, he handled her Hands
and Arms, and almoſt continually gave her little
Flaps on the Cheek. They tell us, That the Devil
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:57009:193"/>
being a proud and haughty Spirit, cannot endure
to be humbled; which is the Reaſon of their Boxing
and Affronting the Poſſeſſed. The other Prieſts
that were about her, ſometimes ſtretch'd forth their
Hands to Box her, (as he did) but ſhe ſhewed her ſelf
Enrag'd againſt them, and would not ſuffer them to
touch her; ſo that they were fain to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with abuſing the Devil in Words, whilſt the
young Prieſt alone was admitted to Flap her on the
Cheek. This Proceeding at laſt ſtirr'd up ſome
Jealouſie amongſt themſelves; and one of the Old
Prieſts ſaid to this young Blade, in a ſmart way of
Raillery, <hi>Dom</hi> Pietro, <hi>I ſee well, that this Devil
likes none ſo well as your ſelf; and if I been't much
mistaken, you would well enough agree together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whatever the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> may pretend,
certain it is, That the Abſolute Power they claim
over the Devils, is not ſo evidently verified in them,
as they would make the People believe it is. I have
ſeen Poſſeſſed Perſons, and Exorciſms pronounced
over them in quantity; but I never ſaw any of
them freed of their Poſſeſſion by this means. I
know 'tis commonly ſaid, There are many Beggars
who counterfeit themſelves Poſſeſſed, that by this
means they may procure a good Maintenance all
their Life after; and as for theſe indeed, I queſtion
not but the <hi>Prieſts</hi> have power to deliver them of
their Counterfeit Poſſeſſions. This Cheat of the
Beggars procures vaſt Credit to their Myſterious
Images, which are but once Unveiled in 50 Years
time. But I'le leave theſe Poſſeſſed, to come to
a Concluſion of what I have ſaid concerning <hi>Popiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:57009:193"/>
Proceſſions, which they define, as I hinted at the
beginning of this LETTER, a <hi>Marching,</hi> or
<hi>Walking of the People from one Church to another,
under the Conduct of their Prieſts, with the</hi> Croſs
<hi>and</hi> Banner, <hi>there to Invoke the Extraordinary
Aſſistance of God.</hi> But indeed and in truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the account now given you of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
does it not appear to you, Sir, That they may with
much more right be defin'd, <hi>Pompous and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Walks, invented on purpoſe to enhance the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and Repute of the</hi> Monks <hi>and</hi> Prieſts, <hi>and to
abuſe and gull the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their own Advantage?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have not the leaſt Footſteps of theſe kind of
<hi>Proceſſions</hi> in the Primitive Centuries of the Church,
as being only an Invention of the Popes Brain;
and if I been't much miſtaken, S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great
was the firſt that inſtituted them at a time of the
Plague. In his time they were celebrated with
abundance of Modeſty; but the Luxury and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of the Clergy have in proceſs of time ſo
much amplified them, that it is as clear as the Sun
at Noon-day, they ſerve for no other uſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
but to give them the Advantage, and make
them triumph over the Seculars. Beſides, they ſerve
for publick Marks of Honour, whereby they are
diſtinguiſhed amongſt themſelves. There is nothing
they are more jealous of, than their precedency in
Proceſſions, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> oft quarrel with
one another on this occaſion; and ſometimes their
Conteſts break out into great Diſorders, as it hapned
not long ſince at <hi>Dijon,</hi> a Parliament City in <hi>France,</hi>
where the <hi>Monks</hi> of S. <hi>Bennet</hi> having undertaken

to go a <hi>Proceſſioning,</hi> with great <hi>Canes</hi> in their

roſe up againſt them, which occaſion'd a furious

               </p>
               <p>The Order obſerv'd in all <hi>Proceſſions,</hi> is, That the

the laſt Man that ſhuts up the <hi>Proceſſion.</hi> The <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
being of ſo late ſtanding in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and not having been able to obtain the Precedency
they affected of their Senior Orders, at Proceſſions,
have wholly renounced them, and never aſſiſt at
them. Only at <hi>Venice,</hi> the Senate obligeth them to
go in Proceſſion with the reſt; and to avoid ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Coblers, Shoemakers, and Taylors, march firſt of

               <p>I ſhall here conclude this LETTER, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
detaining you with an ample Moral Application
of all this, ſhall only tell you, That foraſmuch as it is
ſo apparent and viſible, that theſe kinds of <hi>Proceſſions</hi>
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are only made to ſerve the
Ends of Ambition and Temporal Intereſt of the
Clergy; that the beſt <hi>Proceſſions</hi> we can make, are
not to march from one Church to another; but to
advance from one Vertue to another, until we arrive
at the Holy Mount of God, <hi>viz.</hi> a Bleſſed Eternity.

               <head>The Eighth LETTER,
Of the Corruption of the Italian Prieſts
and Monks in their Devotion and
Morals, &amp;c.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have already acquainted you in my Laſt, that
my Abode for two years together in the City
of <hi>Bononia,</hi> at the Abby of S. <hi>Michael</hi> in the <hi>Wood,</hi>
afforded me a very favourable Opportunity of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
into the Lives and Manners of Monaſticks;
and I might have ſtaid there much longer, if the
Perſuaſions of a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> had not prevail'd
with me, to go with him to <hi>Venice.</hi> It ſeems, as if
a Divine Providence had conducted me thither, to
put me in a ſtation where I might take a nearer
View of the Conduct and Converſation of other
Eccleſiaſticks, commonly called <hi>Secular Prieſts;</hi> not
ſo much, becauſe I was ignorant before of their
way of Life, having been always brought up
amongſt them, and one of them; but becauſe I
found a conſiderable deal of difference between the
Secular Clergy of <hi>Italy,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>France,</hi>
amongſt whom I had my Education. The former
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57009:195"/>
of theſe live without any Reſtraint, and without
being much obſerv'd or taken notice of by their
own Countrymen, whom they have corrupted as
well in their Practice, as in their Principles, as I
ſhall more particularly make out to you in the
Sequel hereof; whereas the latter, (that is to ſay,
the Eccleſiaſticks of <hi>France</hi>) have ſtudied the Art of
<hi>Diſſimulation,</hi> and are more upon their Guard, to
avoid their being expos'd to the Cenſure of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
whom they regard as ſo many Spies upon
them.</p>
               <p>I was no ſooner arrived at <hi>Venice,</hi> but I had the
good luck to procure my ſelf the Protection of
ſome of the moſt conſiderable Perſons in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick;
ſo that in leſs than a Months time I was
provided of three Small Benefices, in Three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Churches, which gave me an occaſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
with a vaſt number of Clergymen of all
Nations, who Reſorts to this City of Liberty, there
to enjoy the Pleaſures of this Life. After I had
ſtaid Three years here, I undertook another Journy
to <hi>Rome,</hi> having been drawn thither by the Promiſes
of a Cardinal, who died Eight Days after my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
there. This unlook'd for Accident having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
the Hopes I had formed of making a longer
ſtay in that City, I departed thence ſome Months
after: Having Viſited before the City of <hi>Naples,</hi>
I took my Journy towards <hi>Milan,</hi> without any
deſign of making any ſtay there; but the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſome Noblemen of that Country made me
change my Reſolution. The Abbot of Great
S. <hi>Victor,</hi> amongſt others, made me very conſiderable
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57009:195"/>
Offers, to oblige me to ſtay in his Abby, and to
take upon me the Care of Inſtructing his Religious,
according as he knew I had done in the Abby of
S. <hi>Michael,</hi> in <hi>Bononïa,</hi> that was of the ſame Order
as his; which at length induc'd me to yield to his
Deſire. By this means I found my ſelf anew en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
with <hi>Monks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have here on this Occaſion, Sir, hinted to you
ſeveral parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> where I have made my Abode
for ſome time, and the Employments I have had
there; but without the leaſt intent of Boaſting my
ſelf on that account, but only to inform you, that
what I take upon me to ſpeak here concerning the
<hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> is from a thorough Knowledge
and Experience, as having had abundant Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to make thoſe Obſervations, which many
(who have handled the ſame Subject,) have been
wholly depriv'd of. I have had ſeveral other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
both in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> which I
might with more Reaſon boaſt of, if I was ſo
minded; but they having no reference to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in hand, I paſs them by in Silence. Tho'
indeed it be not altogether out of the way, for one
in my Circumſtances, to make mention of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
he has had beyond the Seas, and the
Honourable way of Subſiſtence he has been in, if
it were only to confute the Calumnies the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
are wont to caſt upon the Prieſts of their Religion,
who leave their Communion, to ſatisfie their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
by joyning themſelves to that of the
Reformed Churches: Their common Cry is, That
ſuch are either meer Vagabonds, or Perſons that
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57009:196"/>
had nothing to live on at home in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and who were weary of the condition they
were in, for want of ſome good Benefice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
plentifully to maintain themſelves; or elſe,
that it is nothing but a Spirit of <hi>Libertiniſm,</hi> that
prompts them to make this Change. This laſt
Aſperſion being the moſt odious and reflecting of all,
made me very careful (when I was in <hi>Italy</hi>) to
obviate it, by taking Atteſtations of my Good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and Manners from all the places where I had
made any ſtay, that I might have them in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to clear my ſelf from any ſuch Reproach, in
caſe any ſhould be found Malicious enough to rank
me in that Number; ſo that indeed (by the Grace
and Goodneſs of God) I may now ſpeak boldly
and openly, without the leaſt danger or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from the moſt envenom'd Tongues. Yet for
all this, I muſt profeſs, that the Subject of this Laſt
LETTER is very averſe to my Natural Humor
and Inclination, <hi>viz.</hi> to expoſe the Vices and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of others: But yet, when I conſider on the
other hand, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> oft declaim'd very
ſeverely againſt the Hypocriſie of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Phariſees</hi> of his Time, and this, to inform the
People, and deter them from following their ways;
I conclude, it cannot be unlawful (upon good
ground and occaſions) to publiſh the Sins of thoſe,
who are not only the main Corrupters of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
but alſo of the Principles and Doctrins of
the Goſpel, to the end, we may oblige others, to
be warned and take heed of them, as of <hi>Wolves in
Sheeps cloathing; Cavete à fermento Phariſaeorum;
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57009:196"/>
Tahe heed of the Leaven of the Phariſees.</hi> By
this means alſo it will appear, what uſe is made of
all thoſe vaſt Sums of Mony, which accrue to
the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by thoſe
Subtil Inventions and Religious Artifices where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I have entertain'd you in my Foregoing
LETTERS: For it is evident, that <hi>Gold</hi> and
<hi>Silver</hi> can ſerve only for the uſe of Men; and by
the uſe they make of it, we may eaſily judge of the
End they propounded to themſelves, in ſearching
for the Means to obtain it.</p>
               <p>Having therefore more eſpecially apply'd my ſelf
(during my Abode in <hi>Italy</hi>) to find out the Ways
the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> had, to diſpoſe of and ſpend
their vaſt Revenues, I found, that it was only to
ſatisfie and glut their Domineering Appetites, Luſts,
and Paſſions. Some of them are ſuch Idolaters of
<hi>Mammon,</hi> that the more they heap up, the leſs
they think themſelves poſſeſt of; and thus dye (like
little <hi>Croeſus</hi>'s, or rather like bad Rich Men) in the
midſt of their Riches, from which nothing but
Death could ſeparate them. 'Tis the common Cry
of the Poor in that Country, That nothing can be
more inexorable, more inſenſible, or more pityleſs
than the Clergy. 'Tis meer Labour loſt, to addreſs
ones ſelf to them for an Alms; for at the beſt one
meets with a Denial, and very often with Scornful
and Taunting Words: So that their <hi>Cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ouſneſs</hi> is
like an unſatiable Gulf, which ſwallows all, and gives
up nothing again. I have known ſeveral Prieſts,
who had their Coffers full of <hi>Gold,</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
grutch'd themſelves a piece of dry Bread;
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57009:197"/>
and ſome of theſe were ſo dextrous, as to make
their ſordid <hi>Avarice,</hi> paſs for a Love of <hi>Abſtinence</hi>
and <hi>Mortification;</hi> but in the mean time were ſo
far from beſtowing the leaſt Alms on the Poor,
that they could not endure that any one ſhould
ask them a <hi>Charity;</hi> whence it was obvious
to make this diſcovery, That ſo fair a Vertue as
<hi>Abstinence</hi> is, could not be the Inmate of ſuch ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
Covetous Breaſts: For according to that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Sublevamen Pauperis ſit Abſtinentia Jejunan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;
The Abſtinence of him that Fasts, ought to be
a Relief for the Poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others beſtow their Mony in Building Palaces
for themſelves; I ſay, <hi>Palaces;</hi> for tho' indeed it
would much better become their Profeſſion, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for themſelves Houſes, in which ſome Marks
of that Chriſtian Humility might be diſcerned,
which is ſo indiſpenſable a Qualification of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Altar; yet ſo far are they from this
Temper, that they ſpare no Coſt to erect for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
moſt ſtately and ſumptuous Fabricks, beyond
the Magnificence of the Palaces of the greateſt
Princes. For proof of what I here alledge, we
need only caſt an Eye upon all the Monaſteries of
<hi>Italy;</hi> and thoſe who have Travell'd thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
know, That the faireſt Palace which is found
near the Church, is always the Curates Houſe.
Others conſume their Revenues in Making much of
Themſelves, and contriving Ways for their Pleaſure
and Diverſion: For ſeeing they have no Families to
provide for, <hi>It would be a Profanation,</hi> ſay they, <hi>of the
Gifts of God,</hi> (ſo they call the immenſe Riches
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:57009:197"/>
they have got by their Maſſes) <hi>in caſe they ſhould not
make uſe of them, to make much of themſelves in this
World, who do ſo much good to the Souls of Purgatory in
the other.</hi> For this Reaſon it is we ſee their Tables
ſo deliciouſly and profuſely cover'd, and that they
Entertain one another by Turns with ſuch Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitneſs,
Splendor, and Magnificence; inſomuch that
their inclination this way has authoriz'd that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial
Expreſſion, ſo common in <hi>Italy,</hi> by which
they call any extraordinary Dainty; <hi>Boccone di
Preti ô di Cardinali; A Bit for a Prieſt or Cardinal.</hi>
What I have here ſaid concerning thoſe Objects
that pleaſe the Pallat, is to be underſtood propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
concerning all other things that do any
way contribute to a delicious and luxurious Life,
which they take care to procure for themſelves with
a ſuperfluous profuſeneſs, altogether inexcuſable.
Should any many be tempted with a deſire to ſee
the very utmoſt height of Vanity, of Wantonneſs,
and of Effeminacy, he needs only to take a View
of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> which, as it is compoſed
only of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks;</hi> ſo its boaſts it ſelf, of
ſurpaſſing in Gallantry, Pomp, and Magnificence,
thoſe of the greateſt and moſt potent Monarchs of
the Earth.</p>
               <p>Here you will find Biſhops that have two or
three Biſhopricks, and Abbots that have five or ſix
Abbies apiece. 'Tis a kind of diſgrace for an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick,
to have no more than one Benefice; for
indeed without a great Revenue, one can make no
Figure in this Court of <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Yea, the Vanity of
this Court is mounted to that Exceſs, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57009:198"/>
of it are ſo far from Bluſhing at it, that they
make it the principal Matter of their glory and
boaſting. A <hi>Cardinal</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop</hi> does not make an
Hunting Match, does not Feaſt his Conſorts, but
the whole World forſooth muſt Ring of it. All
the Gazets we have from <hi>Rome</hi> are ſtuft full of
ſuch Vanities as theſe, That <hi>my Lord the Cardinal</hi>
N. <hi>has given a Viſit to one of his Colleagues;</hi> That
<hi>another was at the</hi> Opera; <hi>or caus'd a Rich Livery
to be made for his Retinue, and appear'd in publick
with a Train of ſo many Coaches.</hi> I have oft made
it my diverſion, whilſt I was at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee the
<hi>Cardinals</hi> (on Sunday Mornings) Ride to the <hi>Vatican,</hi>
when the Pope held Chappel there. They are
trick'd up like ſo many Scarlet Puppets in their
Coaches, and all their Creatures are about them,
with an Air that proclaims them extreamly Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and Wanton. After all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I confeſs, a Man
muſt needs have a very ſtrong Faith to believe, that
this ſort of People are no ſooner met together in a
Chamber, but the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is inſtantly in the
midſt of them, to give Law to the Conſciences of
all Men. If to meet together with ſuch Exceſs of
Ambition and Vanity, be to Meet in the Name of
the Lord, 'tis certain our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who
appeared in ſo mean and humble a condition, did not
come into the World in the ſame Name. Every
Cardinal has his Nephew or Neareſt Kinſman with
him, who holds his Scarlet-Hat in the Boot of the
Coach; which is a ſignal Honour to him, and a
Mark of his being the moſt beloved Creature of
the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:57009:198"/>
'Tis this <hi>Nepotiſm,</hi> that made ſuch a Noiſe in the
Time of the late Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the XI<hi>th,</hi> and which
he (who, to give him his due, was a Man ſevere
enough in his Morals) reſolved wholly to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,
having begun the Reformation in his own
Houſe; but we ſee now, that things are quietly
and without Noiſe return'd to their old Channel.
All the Endeavours of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the XI<hi>th</hi> were
only like the ſprinkling of a little cold Water upon
Red-hot Iron, which ſerves only to make it more
fiery and glowing: And, for my part, I muſt own,
That I cannot conceive how a Church (where Fleſh
and Blood ride ſo glouriouſly Triumphant, and
prevail to that exceſſive Degree) can ever have the
Face to boaſt, That the <hi>Gates of Hell ſhall never
prevail against Her.</hi> This! <hi>Nepotiſm,</hi> or Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Nephews, does not only take place at
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but (whether from Imitation,
or by Natural inclination of promoting thoſe who
are nearly related to us) we find it obtain amongſt
all the reſt of the Clergy, who are not perfect Slaves
to Avarice, or the love of Pleaſure. They think of
nothing elſe, but how they may enrich thoſe of their
Family, whoſe Humor pleaſeth them beſt. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
indeed, that this is the moſt commendable and
moſt innocent way of employing their Treaſure,
as carrying ſome appearance of Charity in it; tho'
(to ſpeak Truth) we can never make a Chriſtian
Vertue of it, as being common to us with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
themſelves: The <hi>Turks</hi> do good to thoſe of
their Kindred and Friends, as well as the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and probably alſo do it during
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57009:199"/>
their Lives, which theſe latter are very ſeldom found
guilty of, becauſe they commonly do not diſpoſe
of their Riches to thoſe of their Family, till they
ſee Death ready to ſnatch them from them. This
<hi>Nepotiſm</hi> therefore is a vaſt Gulf, which ſwallows a
great part of the Eccleſiaſtical Revenue; but there
is another Abyſs that devours incomparably much
more, and in a way that is not only a Scandal and
Reproach to their Profeſſion, but even to Nature
it ſelf; and, is in a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the abominable Commerce
they drive with both Sexes.</p>
               <p>All the World knows that it is not lawful for
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to
Marry, as having proteſted againſt Marriage at
their Ordination, and in their ſeveral Profeſſions
and Orders, as againſt <hi>a thing</hi> (to uſe their own
terms) <hi>which defiles and pollutes a Man, and makes
him incapable of duly and purely ſerving at the
Altar.</hi> 'Tis upon this Principle they refuſe to
Marry, and the Prieſt that can be convict of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
this Law, muſt be burnt alive. But for all
this their Huffing, they perceive well enough, that
all this while they reckon without their Hoſt, and
this great Undertaking of theirs proves quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing in effect, than it was in Speculation.
Take but a little leiſure to Read their Lives, and
you'l find, they have no ſooner made their Vow of
<hi>Chaſtity;</hi> but they ſtudy and invent (with all the
Application imaginable) how to break it. They
have voluntarily debarr'd themſelves from honeſt and
lawful Wedlock, and muſt now betake themſelves
to Fornication, Adultery, Inceſt, and Sacriledge, to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57009:199"/>
ſatisfie their Concupiſcence, and glut their infamous
Luſts.</p>
               <p>Now to do this, there muſt be Mony, becauſe
the Debauched Sex is doubly concern'd for having
to do with them, and therefore do not afford them
ſo good Quarters as they do to others; and their
Wenches have the Boldneſs to tell them, That
<hi>ſince it is a greater Sin to have to do with them,
than with others, 'tis but juſt they ſhould pay accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</hi>
The Clergy therefore finding that the
World carries it ſomewhat Uncivil towards them in
this regard, and groaning to ſee themſelves in a
condition to ſtand in need of them, reſolve on their
ſide (as far as poſſible) to be even with them; and
accordingly they will not Say a Maſs, or Prayer,
or go a ſtep upon any ſcore whatſoever, without
being well paid for it. If they be ſent for to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
an Infant, to Exhort a Sick Body, or to Bury
a Corpſe, they firſt demand what they will give
them for their pains, and budge not till the Bargain
be made. They ſollicit for Mony towards their
Confraternities, their Feſtivals, Proceſſions, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
and Devotions for the Souls in <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
with incredible Importunity and earneſtneſs, as being
a prompt and effectual Expedient, to fill their
Purſes. There is nothing diſquiets them more, than
the perſuaſion which poſſeſſeth the Sex they Love,
That <hi>to have to do with Men conſecrated to God,</hi>
(as they are) <hi>is a kind of Sacriledge, and the worſt
of all Crimes.</hi> This indeed is a Conſequence, which
very plainly follows from their Principles; but
which they notwithſtanding endeavour to Veil as
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57009:200"/>
much as ever they can. You ſeldom hear them
Preaching againſt Wanntoneſs, Incontinence, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
&amp;c. and, if at any time they do, 'tis without
being Invective, and ſo as to diminiſh the Horrour
any one might have conceiv'd of theſe Crimes.
Yea, ſome of them are arriv'd to that degree of
Impudence, to publiſh, That <hi>theſe are the moſt
Innocent of all other Vices, and that God conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they are born and grown up with us, and
have their riſe from the Blood and Body that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds
us, is very ready to forgive and pardon
them.</hi> They ſay, <hi>That ſuch Sins as theſe are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Human frailty; and provided a perſon be
only convinc'd of his Weakneſs therein, Confeſs
them, and be humbled for them, 'tis enough; and
one</hi> Ave Mary, <hi>or the Sign of the</hi> Croſs, <hi>with a
ſprinkling of</hi> Holy-Water, <hi>is all the Penance that
is ordinarily enjoyn'd for ſuch</hi> Peccadillo's <hi>as theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are wont alſo, to treat Seculars very
ſmoothly in this Point, at their <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> and in
particular the Female Sex; <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>by
treating them too harſhly, they might be diſcouraged
another time to Confeſs them with all their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</hi>
But the true Reaſon is, that in ſo doing
they may oblige the Seculars, to be as favourable
towards them in their Cenſures on the like occa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion,
and that they may not be too ſtrictly obſerv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
when they fall into the ſame Crimes. Indeed
Auricular and Secret Confeſſion, is the moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
way the Prieſts have to lodge their Game;
'tis there they put Women to the Queſtion, and by
this means accuſtoming them (by little and little)
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57009:200"/>
from their Youth up, to ſpeak with Confidence of
their ſecret Sins, they make them at length loſe that
Natural Shamefac'dneſs, which otherwiſe they
would be ſenſible of, in making the leaſt mention of
ſuch Filthineſs. Being therefore by this means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of their Inclinations and Weak-ſide, if they
find them to be of an Amorous Complexion, it is
an eaſie thing for them to ſpeak for themſelves, and
to inſinuate their own Paſſion. It is notoriouſly
evident, that commonly none but Women go to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
for as for Men, they ſeldom uſe it more than
once a Year, and that towards <hi>Eaſter.</hi> The Reaſon
whereof having been once ask'd in my preſence, a
Perſon of a very good Senſe, return'd this Anſwer,
<hi>That the Reaſon why none but Women were ſeen to
Confeſs, was, becauſe Men were Confeſſors; but,
that if Women were once poſſeſt of the Chair of
Confeſſion, we ſhould ſoon find the contrary, and
that none but Men would appear before them.</hi> The
Reaſon is, becauſe Women for the moſt part take
pleaſure in their Confeſſing, being well aſſured, that
their Confeſſors will put ſuch Queſtions to them, as
cannot much diſpleaſe them; and knowing, that
how openly ſoever they may declare their Sins, the
Seal of Confeſſion will always put them out of
danger of running any Riſque thereby: Yea, there
are not wanting a vaſt Number of thoſe, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
upon the Secrecy of this Tribunal, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by the Exhortations of their Prieſts, of
hiding nothing from them, no not ſo much as their
impure Thoughts, make no difficulty ingenuouſly
to declare, That they Love them; that they can
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:57009:201"/>
neither by Day nor Night rid their Spirit from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out after them; and their Amorous Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are ſo violent, that except God be pleaſed to
Reſtrain them, or they take ſome Compaſſion on
them, it will make them infallibly go Mad and
Diſtracted.</p>
               <p>The Men (eſpecially in <hi>Italy</hi>) go but ſeldom to
Confeſſion, becauſe they do not love to be Queſtion'd
or Examin'd about their Amours. A <hi>Capuchin</hi>
Fryer (who was very Ugly, and the very picture of
a Satyr, with his great Beard) told me once Smiling,
That his Confeſſion-Seat was a Scare-Crow to
Women; but that, to make amends for that, he
was the great Confeſſor of Jealous Lovers. His
meaning was, That Women did not care to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to him, becauſe he was Ugly; but that on the
other hand, Men did chooſe to Confeſs to him the
rather, becauſe he was ſo, as judging him incapable
of Injuring them by becoming their Rival. A
Confeſſor, who has a deſign to make a bad uſe of
his Minſterial Function, may eaſily find means, by
the Queſtions he can put, and to which his Penitent
is oblig'd to Anſwer, to diſcover the perſon he ſpeaks
of, and accordingly may afterwards find means of
attempting her.</p>
               <p>A young Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> having been upon a
time too indiſcreetly Queſtion'd by a Monk in his
Confeſſion, where his Miſtreſs dwelt, Swore, he
would never Confeſs upon that point any more,
except it were at the point of Death, or at leaſt
when he ſhould be weary of his Miſſes, and no
more apprehend, to have a Competitor in his Love.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57009:201"/>
I have been told by ſeveral Gentlewomen, That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
have come to Viſit them in their Houſes,
being led thither only by the Light they have got
from the Confeſſion of their Penitents. This <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
is one of the New Sacraments of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and we ſee to what goodly Ends it is
made uſe of, and the Intereſt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi>
have to preſerve it. This is that which makes them
ſo boldly to proteſt againſt Marriage, which they
care ſo little for; the Corruption of Mans Nature
being ſo great, that it repreſents Sin more ſweet
and pleaſant to him, than that which is honeſt and
lawful.</p>
               <p>I remember a Saying of a Regular Abbot of a
Monaſtery in <hi>Italy,</hi> who talking with me about
Women, ſaid, <hi>Melius est habere nullam quam ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam;</hi>
That <hi>it was better to have none than any;</hi>
And having demanded of him what he meant by
thoſe Words; <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>when a perſon is
not tied to one, he may make uſe of many.</hi> This
you'l ſay was a fine piece of Morality; and, to give
this Prelate his due, his Practice was very Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to his Doctrin. He Entertain'd above a
Score of Women with the Revenues of his Abby;
he had many Country-Houſes, which he turn'd into
as many Brothel-Houſes for himſelf and his Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where he ſplendidly Entertain'd them; and the
exceſſive Expences he was at in theſe places of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
procur'd him the Surname of <hi>Liberal.</hi> But he
was not of the ſame Humor towards his poor Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
who labour'd hard to make the beſt of his
Incoms, and to Till his Ground; for he was to
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57009:202"/>
them an inſatiable Exactor and Oppreſſor, inſomuch
as they could ſcarcely get out of him ſome part of
the Mony, which was of Right due to them. Theſe
poor Men finding themſelves ſo ill Treated by him,
reſolved on a time to have their full Revenge of
him, and to play their Maſter ſuch a Malicious
Trick, as he might have Reaſon to remember ever
after. They knew very well the Archbiſhop was
a ſworn Enemy to <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Abbots,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
queſtion'd not, but They would find him in a
diſpoſition of favouring their Enterprize. They
went therefore and complain'd to him, of a Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Life their Abbot led, who was at that time
Three Leagues diſtant from <hi>Bononia,</hi> at one of his
Country-Houſes, with Three young Women, who lay
in the ſame Bed with him every Night. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
having taken their Information, loſt no time,
but the ſame Evening, ſent away all his Marſhalſey,
compos'd of the <hi>Barigel</hi> or Provoſt, and Threeſcore
<hi>Sbirries</hi> or Serjeants well Arm'd, with Orders to ſeize
the Abbot, and the Women that were with him. They
arrived at the Abbots Country-Houſe but a moment
after he was gone to Bed. The Farmers, who had
the Word, and the Keys of all the Doors, made
the Provoſt, with his <hi>Sbirries,</hi> enter to rights into
the Prelates Chamber; who (you may eaſily imagin)
was extreamly ſurpriz'd with this unwelcom and
unlook'd for Viſit. He deſir'd to compound with
the Provoſt, and the <hi>Sbirries,</hi> as he had often done
before; and to perſuade them the better, open'd to
them a Purſe full of Gold; but their Orders were
too expreſs to be ſo eluded, and the Farmers, who out
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57009:202"/>
of pure Revenge had ſolicited the Seizing of their
Landlord, were in preſence, and would not have
fail'd to give in their full Information concerning all
that had paſſed, to the Archbiſhop: So the <hi>Barigel</hi>
and <hi>Sbirries</hi> (tho' People otherwiſe of baſe and
covetous Minds) upon this occaſion ſhew'd a forced
Reſolution, not to be corrupted by the Prelates
Gold. Accordingly they took the Abbot ſtark
Naked, as he was, without ſuffering him to put any
thing upon him, beſides a Morning-Gown; and
in this Equipage having Mounted him with his
Three Concubines, upon an old Cart they found in
a back-Yard of the Houſe, they tied them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Back to Back, and thus led them in Triumph
in the moſt ignominious and reproachful manner
into the City of <hi>Bononia,</hi> before the Archbiſhop.
It was about Midnight when they arrived, and the
thick Darkneſs of the Night favour'd the poor Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
very much, ſparing him a great deal of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
he would otherwiſe have been put to. The
Archbiſhop ſeeing him in this condition fell a
Laughing, and by way of Raillery told him, <hi>That
ſince it was not lawful for him to take any Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of the Affairs of Monks, he was willing ſo
far to honour them, as to make themſelves the
Judges of their Brethren;</hi> and ſo order'd him with
his Wenches, at that very inſtant, to be carried in
the ſame poſture to S. <hi>Michael in the Wood,</hi> a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
of the ſame Order, about a Canon-Shot
diſtance from the City. It was about One of the
Clock in the Morning when all this goodly Train
arrived there. The <hi>Sbirries</hi> Knock'd with that
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57009:203"/>
violence at the great Gates of the Monaſtery, and
made ſuch a Hollowing and Shouting, that the
Abbot himſelf was fain to Riſe, and to go (accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by all his Monks) to the great Gate, where
he met with a Sight he had little dreamt of. He
at firſt would not acknowledge the Old Abbot for
his Brother, upon pretext forſooth he was in his
Night-Gown, without the Habit of his Order, and
refus'd to receive him into the Monaſtery: But the
<hi>Sbirries</hi> told him, <hi>That if he was ſo reſolv'd, they
had no more to do, but to carry him back again to
the Archbiſhop, who would not fail to ſend for his
Habit, and to ſend him back the next day at High
Noon in his Prelates Habit, and accompanied with
his Doxies, as now he was.</hi> The Abbot perceiving,
that nothing could be gain'd this way, but a double
Reproach and Confuſion, commanded his Fryers, to
go and unlooſe him, and ſo admitted him into the
Monaſtery, and let the Women go. The Penance
impos'd upon this Abbot, for the Affront and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
he had given, was this; To abide 15 Days in
the Monaſtery without ſtirring abroad: Which was
the more eaſie for him to ſubmit to, becauſe the
Noiſe of this gallant Story being ſpread through
the whole City, he could not well any ſooner
(without great Shame and Confuſion) have appear'd
in the Streets. The General, who might eaſily have
Depos'd him from his Charge of Abbot, was of
Opinion, That for ſo light a Fault as this, it was
not worth the pains to proceed to ſo rigid a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and thus by a Spirit of <hi>Charity,</hi> which will
not permit us to do that to another, which we
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57009:203"/>
would not have others do to us, eſpecially when we
find our ſelves in the ſame Circumſtances, contented
himſelf to make him exchange his Abby for ſome
time, and Entertain'd him at his own Monaſtery of
Mount <hi>Olivet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have given you a true and faithful Relation of
this Hiſtory, as having been an Eye-witneſs of
part of it my ſelf, becauſe it hapned during the
time that I was in the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Michael in
the Wood.</hi> This Accident gave me the occaſion of
making a very pleaſant Diſcovery; for upon the
<hi>Sbirries</hi> entring into the Monaſtery, a young Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
being extreamly affrighted, and apprehending
leſt they might make a narrow ſearch into his
Chambers, where for Three Weeks time he had
kept a young Laſs, came directly to me; and
without much conſidering to whom he addreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
deſir'd me, for the Love of God, to hide his
Miſtreſs in one of the moſt private Chambers of
my Apartment, until the Storm were over. But
notwithſtanding the extream Earneſtneſs wherewith
he ſolicited my Conſent, I did not think it fit to
expoſe my own Credit, to ſave his; and knowing
withal how dangerous it is, to give a downright
Refuſal to an <hi>Italian,</hi> and more eſpecially to a
Monk; I in the mildeſt way I could, wiſh'd him
to Addreſs himſelf to the Apothecary of the Abby,
who was a young Man of his own Country, and
who was not ſo ſcrupulous in that point, as I was:
The Religious following my Counſel, found the
Apothecary very ready to comply with his deſire,
and without making any difficulty, took her from
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57009:204"/>
him, and ſhut her up in one of the Large Preſſes
of his Shop; where ſhe continued the reſt of that
Night, and the Day following, in deadly Fears.
The young Monk came to me the next Morning,
to Excuſe himſelf, and (as 'tis likely) being troubled,
that he had given me an occaſion, (by the diſcovery
he had made to me) to believe, That the reſt of his
Brethren were better than he; he took the freedom
to diſcover to me ſeveral things, which till then I
was ignorant of, tho' I had now already continued
ſix Months amongſt them: He told me, <hi>That most
of his Brethren had their Wenches, whom they kept
in their Chambers; and that they got them in from
abroad from time to time, where they kept them,
ſome a Week, others a Fortnight, or a Month, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Bargain they had made with them,
and the Ability of their Purſe: The Abbot himſelf
was not ignorant of it; but prevalent Cuſtom had
reduc'd things to that paſs amongst them, that he
was fain to wink at all, and content himſelf with
the Preſents they made him from time to time for ſo
doing: The moſt convenient time they had to get
their Wenches into the Abby, was about the beginning
of the Night; who being come to a place (according
to Appointment) and preciſely at ſuch an Hour; the
Monks, who had ſent for them, brought them Cowls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Frocks, and ſo dreſs'd them in their own Habit;
which done, theſe good Fryers entred all without
diſtinction into the Monaſtery, in greater Number
than they were gone out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had indeed formerly often been ſurpriz'd, to
ſee ſeveral new Figures of Monks entring into the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57009:204"/>
Dormitories, which I had never ſeen before; and
upon my Enquiry, they had always made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that they were ſome Stranger-Monks, that
were come to Lodge with them. Moſt of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
have double Rooms, whereby they have a
great Convenience of Entertaining their Women
unperceiv'd. The Abbots make their Profit of it;
for a Religious cannot have one of theſe Double-Chambers,
without paying about an Hundred
Crowns for it; and they are very well acquainted
what it is deſign'd for; but provided their Religious
only take care, to manage the Matter ſo, as that it
may not come to the knowledge of Seculars, they
do not trouble themſelves about it; neither doth
this hinder them from being advanced to Religious
Charges and Employments, as much as if they
were the Holieſt perſons of the World.</p>
               <p>I was acquainted at <hi>Venice</hi> with a Regular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Abby of S. <hi>Saviour,</hi> who was a young
Man of conſiderable Learning, and who publickly
taught Philoſophy. This Man entertain'd the moſt
infamous Whore that was in the whole City, and
who commonly ſerv'd for a Model to the Lim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rs of
the Academy. It was above a Year that he had had
commerce with her, and his Abbot gave him leave
(every Evening) during <hi>Shrovetide,</hi> to dreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in Maſquerade, and to go to her Lodging, and
lead her thence to the <hi>Opera</hi> or <hi>Comedy;</hi> after
which, he either brought her along with him to his
Chamber in the Monaſtery, or elſe paſt the reſt of
the Night with her at her own Lodging. Now, as
long as the Matter was carried ſecretly, and without
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:57009:205"/>
making any Noiſe abroad, the Abbot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> let the young
Monk take his ſwing, without giving him the leaſt
Check or Reproof for it; and having a particular
Kindneſs for him, he had already diſpos'd all things
in order to his being choſen Abbot; when (by Ill-luck
for this young Fryer) a great number of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans,
who lived in the ſame Street with this Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan,
and who probably were diſpleaſed with his
frequent Viſits to her, came and made their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to the Monaſtery. The Abbot having heard
what they had to ſay, endeavour'd what he could
to ſweeten them, and to excuſe the Monk; but all
this did but incenſe them the more; and the next
Sunday they gather'd together in the Church, near
to the Chappel where this young Religious was
wont to ſay Maſs, being reſolved publickly to
Affront him, and to ſtop him from going up to the
Altar; but the Abbot having notice of it, ſent
them a piece of Mony, to make them deſiſt from
proſecuting their Deſign; whereupon they retir'd
without more ado: But the Abbot perceiving the
thing had taken Wind, and was become the publick
Talk of the City, thought it now high time to
declare himſelf againſt the Monk; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he had never before given him the leaſt
Reproof for this high Miſdemeanour, he then wrote
a Letter to the Father General of the Order, to
deprive him of his Salary; and about a Fortnight
after there came an Order, by which he was put
out of his place of Philoſophy Lecturer, and ſent
away to a ſmall Monaſtery in the Country. His
Crime, as far as I could ſearch into the matter,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57009:205"/>
was not for having Entertain'd an infamous Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
with a Common Proſtitute, for this his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
had been well acquainted with a year ago;
but his Fault was, That he had been ſo unhappy,
not to uſe that Caution, as to prevent its coming to
publick Knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Italy,</hi> without contradiction, is accounted by all
for a very Corrupt and Debauch'd Country; and it
is as ſure, that the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> (a ſort of
People, who have Vowed <hi>Eternal Chaſtity</hi>) are the
main occaſion of her being branded with this juſt
Reproach. The immenſe Treaſures they poſſeſs,
are a Scandal and Stumbling-Stone unto them, and
Looſe-Women, who are not ignorant of this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
themſelves happy to be taken into their
Favour; it being a Proverb in <hi>Italy,</hi> That <hi>the
Wench of a Prieſt, or Monk, can never want any
thing.</hi> The Monks, beſides the Vow of <hi>Chaſtity,</hi>
have alſo taken upon them that of <hi>Poverty,</hi> and
accordingly ought never to poſſeſs any Mony of
their own; but the Avarice of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi>
have made them, in direct oppoſition to their Vow,
<hi>Proprietors.</hi> To what purpoſe is it, to cover the
Inſtitution of Monaſtick Orders under the fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of leading a more Perfect and a more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Life, than Secular Men do; when it is ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that the principal Motive of their Inſtitution
was the filling of the Pope's Coffers, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
of the Prelates of the Court of <hi>Rome?</hi> Let
any one go and ſearch as long as they pleaſe in
Cloiſters for that Spirit of <hi>Chaſtity, Poverty,</hi> and
<hi>Obedience,</hi> which in them is expreſly profeſſed, and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57009:206"/>
after all, 'tis certain he will find there leſs of theſe
than in many Secular Families: But ſure it is, the
Pope always finds them ready to furniſh him with
what Sum of Mony he ſtands in need of. The
Reaſon why the Popes inſtitute ſo many New
Orders, is, becauſe they are morally certain, they
will not ſtand long, without falling and departing
from the Rules and Strictneſs of their firſt Inſtitution,
and that this will make way for their Suppreſſion,
which cannot but be of vaſt advantage to them.
'Tis not long ſince that one Pope ſuppreſſed Three
of them all at once, <hi>viz.</hi> the Order of S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> that
of the <hi>Jeſuats,</hi> and that of the <hi>Waters,</hi> who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
profeſſed the Rule of S. <hi>Jerom.</hi> The Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this laſt Order was a very pleaſant one, and
their <hi>Exit</hi> was as ridiculous.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Fathers of this Order being <hi>Inſpired</hi>
(as they ſaid) <hi>by the Holy Ghost,</hi> ſet themſelves to
Diſtil Waters and Spirits, for the relief and ſervice
of poor Sick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> People; and this their <hi>Distilling of
Waters,</hi> was their Character of diſtinction from
others, and made them to be call'd <hi>Fathers of the
Waters.</hi> A ſhort time after, all this Spirituality was
reduced to a Diſtilling of <hi>Beautifying Waters</hi> for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
to make their Hands white, and to preſerve or
augment their Beauty. All theſe Three Orders
were become extreamly Rich and Scandalous, when
the Pope thought fit to ſuppreſs them, and to unite
to the Patrimony of the Church all their Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
giving their Churches to other Monks, who
at the bottom were ne're a whit better, than thoſe
they were taken from. This was indeed a very
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57009:206"/>
rude Treatment for them, thus at once to diveſt
them of all their Revenues and Incoms, and to force
them, tho' ſore againſt their Will, to the practice of
their Vow of <hi>Poverty,</hi> by reducing them to Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,
and the Charitable Benevolence of their
Friends and Acquaintance. This is that which
makes the Monks ſo much to dread theſe Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and the Popes, who are not ignorant of it,
have nothing to do, but to threaten them therewith,
whenever they have a mind to ſqueez a conſiderable
Sum of Mony from them; which Method the late
Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the XI<hi>th</hi> ſeveral times put in practice,
as well againſt the Order of the Canons Regular,
as ſeveral other Congregations of the Order of
S. <hi>Bennet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Order of Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> alone, at one time,
made him a Preſent of an Hundred Thouſand
Crowns, to appeaſe his Anger; tho' it was not long
before this, that another Pope had ſqueez'd out of
them, by the ſame Artifice, the Sum of 400000
Crowns; and becauſe for this Reaſon it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for them to raiſe that Sum in Ready Mony,
within the ſhort term was allotted them for it, he
gave them leave to engage their Fonds, and to
Mortgage the Land belonging to their Monaſtery;
which they did accordingly, and making a dextrous
uſe of this Conjuncture, by ſtriking whilſt the Iron
was hot, they deſired of the Pope, whom they found
at that time in a good Humor, to give them leave
to receive Penſions from their Kindred and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and of poſſeſſing Land in Propriety; which
was in effect to requeſt, That notwithſtanding their
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57009:207"/>
Vow of <hi>Perpetual Poverty,</hi> it might be lawful
for them, to be as Rich as any other Seculars; and
yet as contradictory to their Vow, as their Requeſt
was, the Pope had the Conſcience to grant it, not
only to them, but to all other Religious Houſes, from
whence he drew vaſt Sums of Mony.</p>
               <p>This is that which at this day makes the Monks
of <hi>Italy</hi> ſo full of Mony, and ſo well Lin'd; for
beſides the competent Allowance they have for
their Subſiſtence from the Monaſtery, they enjoy
beſides conſiderable Annual Penſions from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
which they ſpend at their pleaſure, and to
ſatisfie their Luſts. I have known ſome of them my
ſelf, that had no leſs than 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, Annual
Penſion. The Cardinals perceiving that the Popes
draw ſo conſiderable Advantage from Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
are not wanting on their ſide, to make them as
profitable to themſelves, as they can; and to this
end have found out the way of Selling them their
Protection, for as much Mony as they can raiſe them
to. Each Order has its Cardinal Protector, to whom
they allow an Annual Penſion of 3 or 4000
Crowns; and this, for to obtain their Favour and
Protection at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon occaſion.
The Abbots of the Congregation of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi>
finding that <hi>Innocent</hi> the XI<hi>th</hi> was reſolved to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
them, or at leaſt made a ſhew to be ſo, they
immediately had recourſe to their Protector, the
Cardinal <hi>Faſchinetti;</hi> they writ a Letter to him,
wherein they declar'd, the great Danger in which
their Congregation was, and earneſtly entreated
him, to make uſe of all his Credit with the Pope,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57009:207"/>
to ſtave off this fatal Blow from them, and that
in conſideration of this his ſeaſonable Service, they
would augment his Penſion with the additional Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of 1000 Crowns a Year. I was preſent
at the very time when the Cardinal opened this
Letter, and having read the Promiſe they made him
of 1000 Crowns Augmentation, he Cry'd out in a
moſt tender and affectionate Tone; <hi>Ah my Dear
Congregation of Mount</hi> Olivet, <hi>I will never ſuffer
it to be ſaid, That ſo great an Affront ſhould happen
unto thee, whilst I am thy Protector;</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
thereupon ſent his Secretary to the <hi>Vatican;</hi>
to deſire Audience of the Pope, upon a Matter that
was extreamly preſſing, and of great importance.
He had the good luck to be admitted to Audience,
at the very time when the Act for Suppreſſing the
Order, was actually Drawing up. His Eminence
caſt himſelf at the Pope's Feet, and told him Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>That if he did proceed in his Reſolution, it
would certainly be his Death.</hi> The Pope ſeeing
him in this poſture, lifted him up with a great deal
of Kindneſs, and the Cardinal being his old Friend,
he Promis'd, <hi>That for his ſake he would not ſuppreſs
the Order, as he had intended;</hi> and accordingly we ſee
it ſubſiſt until this Day, tho' the Monks of it be
ne're a whit better than others, who have been
Suppreſt.</p>
               <p>It would be matter of Aſtoniſhment to ſee ſo
many Monaſteries and Convents ſuffer'd in <hi>Italy,</hi>
full of a ſort of People, who being under a Vow

but that it is notorious, <hi>That Gold is more

than the Lives of <hi>Monks?</hi> He that doubts of it,
needs only to go to <hi>Rome, Venice,</hi> or other principal
Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> at <hi>Shrovetide,</hi> where he ſhall meet
with nothing in the Streets, but <hi>Monks</hi> in Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,
with their Whores; all the Theaters of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi>
and <hi>Opera's,</hi> and all places of publick Shews
and Paſtime, are throng'd with them; yea, and
they glory in theſe their Exceſſes, which ought to
be the greateſt matter of Shame and Confuſion to
them.</p>
               <p>I have been acquainted with a vaſt Number of
<hi>Monks,</hi> who at <hi>Shrovetide</hi> ſeeing me, would draw
near to me, and take off their Vizards on purpoſe
that I might take notice of them; they had each
of them a Wench by the Hand, and the next
Morning in the Sextry, before they went to the
Altar to ſay Maſs, all their Diſcourſe was about the
Debauches and Licentious Pranks they had plaid
the Day before, and of thoſe they intended to play
the ſame Day, after their Drudgery of Saying Maſs
was over. I call to mind a Story one of theſe
<hi>Monks</hi> on a time told me, which becauſe it contains
ſome rare extraordinary Circumſtances, I think
worthy of my communicating to you. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
I am about to tell you hapned at <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:57009:208"/>
This <hi>Monk</hi> told me, that it was about Three
Weeks ſince, that he had met with a very happy
Adventure; which was, That as he was going one
Evening to the Play-Houſe, he met with a Lady of
Quality in Maſquerade, whom (as far as he could
gueſs from all Circumſtances) he met with after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
was a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> tho' at firſt, becauſe
ſhe was alone, and becauſe ſhe rather Addreſt her
ſelf to him, than to her, he took her to be a Lady
of Pleaſure; and in this perſuaſion he deſir'd her
to go along with him to the Play-Houſe; the
Lady very readily accepted his Offer, which being
ended, he offer'd her his Service to lead her home;
and ſhe who deſir'd nothing more, preſently made
a ſign to the Men (that waited for her coming at
the Wate-ſide in her <hi>Gondola</hi>) to come and take
her in. The <hi>Monk</hi> ſtept in with her, and ſpied at
the farther-end of the Boat a Gentleman in Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,
who received him with a great deal of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
The Lady fearing leſt the unlook'd for
Meeting with this Gentleman, might affright or
diſcompoſe her New Galant, bid him, Not to fear
any harm; and commanded the Boat-men, to pull
away. It was about One of the Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when they entred the <hi>Gondola,</hi> and the Moon
being in the Wane, and the Heavens all cover'd
with Clouds, made that nothing could be diſcern'd
by any Light from thence; and the Boat-Men
made ſo many Turnings and Windings through
the Canals of <hi>Venice,</hi> that it was impoſſible for him
to diſcern in what part of the City he was. All
that he could take Notice of was, That the <hi>Gondola</hi>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:57009:209"/>
ſtopt at a back Gate of a ſtately Palace, whence
immediately many Vizarded Lackeys came forth
with Flambeaus to Light them in. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by a Private pair of Stairs into a ſpacious
Dining-Room, where he likewiſe met with ſeveral
Perſons with Vizards. The <hi>Monk,</hi> tho' he was a
perſon of great Confidence and Reſolution, confeſt
to me, That he was ſeiz'd with an extream Terrour,
which receiv'd a conſiderable addition, after the
Lady was withdrawn, and he ſaw himſelf left all
alone with the Gentleman, and ſome of his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
all Mask'd; for, as he aſſur'd me, he expected
nothing leſs than Death. But the Gentleman, on
the other hand, us'd his utmoſt endeavours to aſſure
and rid him of his Fears. Soon after the Table was
cover'd with a ſumptuous Collation, and he was
ſerv'd with ſeveral ſorts of the choiceſt Wines.
After which he was ſhewed to a rich Bed, where he
was bid to <hi>Lie down.</hi> The <hi>Monk</hi> ſeeing there
would be danger for him, not to comply readily
with every thing they would have him to do, gave
a ready Obedience to all their Orders. He was no
ſooner got into Bed, but the Fire and all the Tapers
in the Room were put out, and immediately after
the Lady entred, and came to Bed to him, giving
him a Thouſand Aſſurances, that not the leaſt hurt
ſhould happen to him, and therefore wiſhing him to
diſcard all Fear. He was thus kept and ſerv'd for
a Fortnight together, in the manner as I have juſt
now related, without ever being able to diſcover
where he was, or who any of the Perſons were,
that accompanied him, or waited on him. All that
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:57009:209"/>
he could gueſs from the Ladies Diſcourſe was, <hi>That
becauſe ſhe could have no Children by her Husband, he
had conſented to avenge himſelf of ſome of his Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Relations, to whom he was unwilling to leave his
Eſtate after his Death, that ſhe might find out ſome
Expedient to have an Heir; and that they had not
judg'd any way more proper for their Deſign, than
to make uſe of a young and handſom</hi> Monk, <hi>as he
was, to obtain their Deſire.</hi> Thus after many Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
receiv'd, and very kind and great Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(but withal, after having committed a great Sin)
he was ſent away with the Preſent of about Fifty
<hi>Guinea's</hi> value in Gold; and having in a dark
Night put him into a <hi>Gondola,</hi> after many Turnings
and Windings, they Landed him near the place,
where they had taken him in; neither was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for him ever after to make any further diſcovery
about this Matter. He himſelf related to me this
Adventure with ſuch a Tranſport of Joy, (and this
too, when he was upon the point of going up to
the Altar to ſay Maſs) as made it evident, he would
have been extreamly ſatisfied, to find himſelf again
in the ſame Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>I have heard of another <hi>Monk,</hi> who (in a much
like caſe) met with a very different Succeſs; for
having been brought by a Lady of Quality into her
Houſe, during her Husbands abſence, and probably
with the ſame deſign of providing him an Heir;
but by Miſhap for him, her Husband being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
return'd, ſurpriz'd the good Fryer, and
took him Napping; and having kept him a cloſe
Priſoner in a Chamber for about a Fortnight, till
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:57009:210"/>
a certain Holiday, on which a General Proceſſion
was to be celebrated; which the Gentleman knew
was to paſs by his Door; as the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> was
approaching, he caus'd his Priſoner to be ſtript ſtark
Naked, and after he had been ſoundly Slaſht by four
of his Lackeys, juſt at the midſt of the Proceſſion,
as the Fathers <hi>Carmelites</hi> paſs'd by, of whoſe Order
this Fryer was, he turn'd him out of Door ſtark
Naked, with a Written Paper on his Back, ſpec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his Crime, and forc'd him thus to run through
the <hi>Proceſſion.</hi> This gave a very great Offence,
and the Fathers <hi>Carmelites,</hi> who found themſelves
moſt outragiouſly Affronted thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> went and
complain'd to the Inquiſition, pretending that the
Gentleman, who had thus horribly e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pos'd one of
their Brotherhood, could be no other than an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,
and a ſworn Enemy to all Religious Orders,
whom he had ſo outragiouſly abus'd in the Perſon
of their Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but however, notwithſtanding all
their Rage, the Honeſt Man made a ſhift to defend
and juſtifie his Proceeding againſt the Diabolical
Malice of theſe Monks.</p>
               <p>I could furniſh you here with an infinite number
of curious Stories, concerning the Amours and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegues
of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> if I were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
That it is the Duty of every Honeſt Man,
not to ſpeak, but with great Moderation of a Vice,
whereof the Diſcovery is equally dangerous, to
him that makes it, and to thoſe to whom it is made.
And therefore ſhall only tell you, that I may out
ſhort here, That I never in my life convers'd with
any one <hi>Monk</hi> or <hi>Priest</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:57009:210"/>
for ſo long a time as was ſufficient to penetrate a
little into their Manners and Courſe of Life; but
that I found at laſt, that they had ſecret Commerce
with Women, or, which is worſe, and what I
would not willingly name, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were
addicted to the abominable Sin of <hi>Sodomy.</hi> And
yet many or thoſe were meer Saints to outward
appearance, all their Diſcourſe was of the <hi>Bleſſed
Virgin,</hi> and of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> and the only Reaſon why
I deſir'd their Friendſhip, was becauſe at firſt I
took them to be very good and honeſt Men; but
ſometime after I found to my great Regret, that I
had been deceived by my too favourable Opinion
of them.</p>
               <p>I was acquainted (during my ſtay at <hi>Venice</hi>) with
one of them, that was the Steward of a Religious
Houſe. He was a Man of the moſt promiſing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy
that could be; and I was much edified to
ſee how Modeſt and Humble he was in his Garb
and Behaviour. For, whereas moſt of the <hi>Monks</hi>
of <hi>Italy</hi> wear curious ſhining Stuffs, fine Hats, Silk
Stockens, and neat Shoes, he had nothing about
him but what was very plain and ſimple: He wore
a great old Hat, with a brim of a Foot and an half
broad, which flap'd down over his Ears, with a
great <hi>Pater Noster</hi> of Wood hanging down from
his Girdle; and beſides this, had an Air and Port
that breath'd nothing but Devotion; and his Maſſes,
which others have found a way to expedit in leſs than
a Quarter of an Hour, always laſted an Hour and an
Half. He was alſo a great Lover of Books, as
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:57009:211"/>
being of ſome competent Learning. Theſe good
Qualities I obſerved in him, joyn'd with ſome
others that he poſſeſs'd, and the good Report he had
every where, tho' indeed acquir'd by his Hypocriſie,
were the Motives that engag'd me, to endeavour an
Acquaintance with him; and I look'd upon my
ſelf as very happy, in meeting with a great deal of
Facility in the executing of this my Deſign. During
a Seventh Months Converſation I had with him,
I perceived nothing by him but what was good and
honeſt: Yea, he ſeem'd to have ſomething of a
Spirit of <hi>Prophecy;</hi> for what he had publickly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
of the Raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and of
the total Defeat of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
came to paſs. It had been happy for him,
could he as well have foreſeen the ill Conſequences,
which the licentious and flagitious Life he led in
Secret, would draw down upon him, in order to
have prevented them. This good <hi>Monk</hi> (for ſo he
was as to all outward appearance, and whom I
look'd upon as a Man come from Heaven) was
oblig'd by a troubleſom Accident that hapned to
him, to diſcover to me all his Wicked Life: A
Lewd Woman, whom he had kept for ſeveral years,
was reſolv'd at laſt to ruin his Reputation; She
being perfectly well acquainted, how great a Lover
this Hypocritical <hi>Monk</hi> was of Vain-glory, ſhe
had already for ſome Months threatned to expoſe
him in his own Colours to the World, in caſe he
did not furniſh her with the Sum of Mony ſhe
demanded of him. She had already, by theſe her
Menaces, drawn from him at twice an 100 Crowns,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:57009:211"/>
and was now come for the Third time, to demand
the like Sum, neither would he have mended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a whit, by complying with her Demand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe would not have fail'd within a Fortnight
after to come with the ſame Threats, <hi>viz. That ſhe
was reſov'd to declare in preſence of the Prior of
the Convent, and all the Religious, That he (through
whoſe hands all the Mony of the Convent paſſed)
had not only raviſh'd her Daughter; but alſo abuſed
one of her Boys, in the moſt abominable manner
imaginable.</hi> The <hi>Monk</hi> own'd, that he had to do
with the one, and the other, and the Mother too;
but that he had not been the firſt; foraſmuch as
long before his Aquaintance with them, they had
been Proſtitutes, and that beſides they had been
well paid for it: That in the mean time, to put
ſome ſtop to her Impudence, he deſir'd me, to go
and warn her ſeriouſly, <hi>That if ſhe would not be
ſatisfied with the Mony he had already given her,
he was reſolv'd to get her Murther'd.</hi> I was ſo far
from offering him my Service in this Affair, that
from that time forwards I conceiv'd the greateſt
horrour and averſion for him, and took a firm
Reſolution never to ſee him more. However,
I had the Curioſity, before I took my laſt leave of
him, to ask him, What was the Reaſon why the
went ſo ſtrangely Dreſt, and ſuch a ſlouching Hat
hanging over his Ears; he who took ſuch great
pleaſure in Courting of Women? He told me, That
he had found the Habit he wore very advantagious
and uſeful to him, that being an Officer of the
Monaſtery, when he went to receive any Rents,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:57009:212"/>
the Perſons concern'd had the greater Reſpect for
him; and beſides this, That it was alſo very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to fill his own Purſe, which he ſhewed me
how. <hi>For as our Monaſteries</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>are never
without Suits at Law, every one knows what is the
ſet price of an</hi> Aſſignation, <hi>a</hi> Warrant, <hi>a</hi> Contract,
<hi>an</hi> Acquittance, <hi>and an hundred other Formalities
us'd in Law. It is ſufficient when I give in my
Accounts, that I have made uſe of ſo many</hi> Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
Conſultations, Acquittances, &amp;c. <hi>which do
amount to ſuch a Sum: All or moſt of which is
my Profit; for ſometimes I have disburs'd nothing
at all for them. I go to the Lawyers, the Attorny,
and Notary with my great Slouching-Hat, and in a
pitiful Whining-tone I repreſent, to the utmost of
my power, the extream Poverty of our Monaſtery,
and that ſo effectually, as often to move them to
compaſſion; and ſo they either take no Mony at all
of me, or elſe content themſelves with a very little:
So that the Mony of theſe Formalities of Law
comes moſt into my Pocket, neither am I oblig'd to
give any account thereof to my Superiours, as being
the fruit and product of my own Induſtry. Whereas</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>ſhould I preſent my ſelf to theſe Men of
the Law with a little Hat, and a neat Habit, they
would preſently twit me with a,</hi> See here a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of good Fat <hi>Monks,</hi> who live at eaſe and
pleaſure, and have wherewith to pay well, and ſo
they ſhall; <hi>and accordingly would make me pay for
all theſe Writings to the utmost Rigour. And as
for Women</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I am always aſſur'd, That tho'
my Perſon may not pleaſe them, yet my Mony will;
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57009:212"/>
and that as long as I am ſtor'd with that, I ſhall
never fail of being Welcom to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Diſcourſe made me conceive, That all thoſe
great flapping Hats, thoſe old and Thred-bare
Cowls, the long Beards of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and the
high Collars of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> are no certain Proofs
(as ſome ſuppoſe) that thoſe who wear them are
good and honeſt Men. The knowledge alſo I have
had of their Diſorders, has powerfully convinced
me, that the Sin of <hi>Uncleanneſs</hi> is that which reigns
moſt abſolutely, and without controul amongſt
them; and that of all theſe Vowers of <hi>Chaſtity,</hi>
there are but a very few, and may be, none at all
that obſerve it indeed and in truth; for God will
never afford his Bleſſing to fooliſh Confidences, or
Raſh Vows.</p>
               <p>From all that has been ſaid, it will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to conceive, how the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy can make
away with thoſe vaſt Revenues they are poſſeſſed of,
this Sin of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> being one of thoſe Vices that
requires great Expences to maintain it. True it is,
that <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> are not all of them equally
Rich; for there be ſome of them, that have neither
Benefices nor Penſions, and who conſequently are
not in a condition to ſpend as high as others, who
yet ſpend proportionably to their Incoms. I have
known ſome of them who had nothing to live upon,
but the Mony they receiv'd for their <hi>Maſſes,</hi> who
did almoſt ſtarve themſelves with Hunger, to ſpare
ſomething to enable them to Viſit a Whore-Houſe
once a Fortnight, or at the leaſt once a Month.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:57009:213"/>
There are others of them who have ſuch baſe
and mean Souls, that they learn Handicrafts,
and exerciſe them in private, to gain ſome Mony:
Yea, there be not wanting ſome of them who learn
to make Womens Cloaths; as, <hi>Mantoe's, Stays,</hi> and
<hi>Petticoats;</hi> that by this means they may have an
occaſion of freer acceſs to them; ſome of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
the Art of <hi>Fortune-Telling,</hi> and ſome are down-right
<hi>Negromancers.</hi> Laſtly, there be others who
are not only baſe and mean, but alſo Sacrilegious;
for tho' (according to their Principles) to celebrate
more <hi>Maſſes</hi> than one a day, be one of the greateſt
Profanations a man can be guilty of, yet theſe
<hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> who ſacrifice all that is Sacred
and Holy to their own Intereſt, do eaſily get over
this difficulty, and ſay ſometimes three or four
<hi>Maſſes</hi> a day in ſeveral places.</p>
               <p>Once on a Holiday I heard Maſs ſaid very early
in the Morning in the Church of S. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
by a poor Prieſt of my Acquaintance; and
having occaſion the ſame Morning to go to <hi>Muran,</hi>
which is but a little League diſtant from <hi>Venice,</hi> as
I paſt through a Church, I ſaw the ſame Prieſt
celebrating another <hi>Maſs.</hi> About Two Hours after
I was oblig'd to go to a place call'd <hi>la Judeka,</hi>
and there I again found the ſame Prieſt ſaying
<hi>Maſs</hi> in a Convent of <hi>Nuns.</hi> This Prieſt turning
himſelf to the People at <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me, and knowing he was diſcover'd, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſeiz'd with ſuch an exceſſive Fear and Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs,
during the reſt of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> that he ſcarcely
knew or minded what he ſaid; he left out ſome of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57009:213"/>
the accuſtomed Collects and Benedictions, and after
he had conſecrated the Cup, he forgat to lift it up
on high, for the People to worſhip it, according to
Cuſtom. As ſoon as he had made an end of Saying
<hi>Maſs,</hi> he put off his Habit with an extraordinary
precipitancy, and taking his Hat and Cloak, ran
away without ever demanding his Mony for the
<hi>Maſs</hi> he had ſaid. I could eaſily have caus'd him
to be ſeiz'd; but knowing it to be a matter belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Inquiſition, and having never had any
liking for that Tribunal, I would not concern my
ſelf with it. Beſides, I knew that he was not the
only Man, that was guilty of this Fault, but that
many others committed the ſame every day. My
Pen is weary of ſetting down all thoſe infamous and
ſcandalous Actions; but yet, becauſe there is no
Evil from whence ſome great Good may not be
drawn, I heartily wiſh, Sir, that from what I have
here written, as well as in all my other LETTERS,
you may at leaſt derive this Benefit, to be convinc'd,
That the firſt Argument which put me upon Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
theſe LETTERS, and upon which you rely
ſo much for your confirmation in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
is a very poor, weak, and dangerous one;
viz. <hi>That it is not poſſible, that ſuch a great number
of</hi> Monks <hi>and</hi> Prieſts, <hi>who ſit at the Helm of your
Church, ſhould be all of them in an Error, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that they may be very ſafely rely'd upon.</hi>
This is one of thoſe Arguments we call <hi>Circulus
Vitioſus,</hi> a <hi>Vicious</hi> or <hi>Faulty Circle.</hi> The <hi>Seculars</hi>
repoſe themſelves in matters of Faith upon the
<hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Monks;</hi> and if we divide the <hi>Prieſts</hi>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:57009:214"/>
and <hi>Monks,</hi> as they divide them at <hi>Rome; viz.</hi>
into <hi>Prieſts</hi> on this ſide, and on the other ſide the
<hi>Alpes;</hi> we find that the latter rely on the former,
who are <hi>Italians;</hi> and theſe again repoſe themſelves
wholly on thoſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, upon that number
of Eccleſiaſticks that are about the Pope, and who
in their Opinion paſs for very great Doctors.
Now theſe again on the other hand, do not rely ſo
much upon their own Science or Learning, which
they know to be very mean, as upon the great
number of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Seculars,</hi> who believe them.
This made one of their great Preachers declare
from the Pulpit; <hi>That it was an invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove the Truth of</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was ſuch a vaſt number of thoſe who
believed, in compariſon of the inconſiderable Number
that deny'd it:</hi> That <hi>their</hi> Catholicks <hi>being twenty
to one, were to be accounted as the ſtrongeſt, ſo the
trueſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not employ my time here to ſhew, how
weak and frivolous thoſe Arguments are, that are
drawn either from the Number, or Dignity of the
Perſons that profeſs it. It ſhall ſuffice me, that I
have expoſed to your View the diſcovery I have
made of the Unfaithfulneſs and Falſneſs of your
Paſtors, and how much it is their outward Intereſt
to abuſe you, and to deceive themſelves whilſt they
impoſe upon you. For as they are well-pleaſed to
be made uſe of by the <hi>Multitude,</hi> as an Argument
to enforce their Belief; ſo God ſuffers them to make
the ſame <hi>Multitude,</hi> an Argument to confirm their
own Belief. If one Blind-man leads another, they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57009:214"/>
muſt <hi>both of them fall into the Ditch;</hi> and if one
leads Twenty, they muſt ſtill undergo the ſame
Fate. 'Tis a much ſurer way for us to rely upon
ſomething we know to be fixt and ſolid, (ſuch as
we know the Scriptures to be, and to endeavour to
penetrate the true Senſe thereof,) than to repoſe ones
Confidence upon Men, who being blinded by their
Intereſts, or Paſſion, may afterwards blind and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us alſo for Company.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this account of my Journy, or
rather the Remarks I have made during my ſtay
in <hi>Italy,</hi> with the recital of ſome ſmall Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which deſerve to be taken notice of. From
<hi>Milan</hi> I took my Journy towards the Lake <hi>de
Como,</hi> where I Embarked to go to the <hi>Valtelline;</hi>
and from thence I again paſt over the Mountain
<hi>Splug,</hi> where (in my way) I gave a Viſit to the
Curate of <hi>Campodolcino,</hi> my old Acquaintance, who
was a Doctor of <hi>Milan.</hi> He was much ſurpriz'd
to ſee me there again, and eſpecially when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by me, That my intention was to take another
Journy through the Country of the <hi>Griſons</hi> into
<hi>Switzerland.</hi> He adviſed me very ſeriouſly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and to Converſe with them
as little and as cautiouſly as might be. I told him,
it would be a very difficult Task, to avoid their
Converſation in a Country, where they are every
where mix'd with the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> or ſo much as to
know and diſcern them. Whereupon he told me,
That I might eaſily diſcern them by their manner
of Diſcourſe; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you ſhall not be a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an Hour in any of their Company, but you
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57009:215"/>
ſhall hear ſome of theſe Words coming from them,</hi>
The Purity of the Goſpel; the Liberty of the
Children of God; the Written Truth; the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and other like Expreſſions,
tending to exalt the Holy Scripture above the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the See of</hi> Rome. But this Notion the
Doctor gave me of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> was ſo far from
giving me an undervaluing Conceit of them, that
on the contrary, I took notice of ſomething very
pleaſing and excellent in it, and which rendred them
the more amiable in my Eyes.</p>
               <p>And as I was paſſing over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> meditating
on the deſcription the Doctor had given me of the
<hi>Protestants,</hi> I conceiv'd, That what was objected
to them as a Crime, might very well be look'd
upon as an Apology for them. Whilſt my Mind
was taken up with thoſe Thoughts, I perceiv'd afar
off a Company of Little Children, who came
Running towards me from a little Hamlet, upon the
Mountain, to Beg an Alms of me: I obſerv'd, that
theſe Children beg'd only in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> and
for the <hi>Love of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by which I knew
them to be <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> And tho' I was not then
ſo well ſtor'd with Mony to be liberal to them;
yet they were very thankful for the Little I gave
them, and return'd peacably to the Village, having
firſt beſtow'd a Thouſand Bleſſings upon me. As
I Travell'd forwards, and was coming down the
Mountain, I met with another ſmall Hamlet, from
whence alſo came forth a Company of Children
upon the ſame deſign as the former; but their Form
of Begging was very different, for they entreated
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57009:215"/>
my Charity for the <hi>Love of the Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> of
S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> and the <hi>Souls of Purgatory.</hi>
Neither were they contented with the ſmall Gift I
had beſtow'd upon the other Children, but followed
me with great Importunity above a quarter of a
League, repeating a great Number of <hi>Ave Maries,</hi>
and <hi>Prayers for the Dead;</hi> and after all, ſeeing they
could get no more of me, they chang'd their
Prayers into a Thouſand Curſes, and took up
Stones, which they flung at me. I perceiv'd by
this Action, that theſe Little Catholicks were not
ſo well Taught and Educated as the Children of
Proteſtants; and that the Doctrin inſtill'd into
them, did not produce ſo good Fruit, as the Purity
of the Goſpel did in the others. In this manner I
continued my Journy through the Country of the
<hi>Griſons,</hi> and of the <hi>Swiſſes;</hi> and without tying
my ſelf to obſerve the Advice of the Curate of
<hi>Campodolcino,</hi> I indifferently Convers'd with the
<hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know it is a difficult thing for People of a
different Religion (tho' living under the ſame Laws
and Government, as the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> are) perfectly to
love one another. However, I obſerv'd, That the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> ſpake with a great deal more of Bitterneſs
againſt the <hi>Protestants,</hi> than the Proteſtants did
againſt them, tho' indeed theſe latter had much
more Reaſon ſo to do; for it was at the time when
the Perſecution was carried on againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
with a great deal of Fury. I was very much edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the Example of ſeveral <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi>
fled into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> who were ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57009:216"/>
of the Miſeries they had ſuffer'd, that they
exhorted one another, (with Words of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
to bear patiently thoſe further Sufferings their
Exile might expoſe them to. Neither could they
endure to hear others ſpeak ill of their Perſecutors, and
teſtified themſelves to deſire nothing more, than that
it would pleaſe God to Pardon and Convert them.
There was an old Gentleman, who in my hearing,
with a great deal of Charity reprov'd a young
<hi>French</hi> Souldier for being tranſported in Paſſion
againſt the <hi>French</hi> King; asking him, <hi>Whether the
Reading of the Holy Bible had taught him ſo to do?</hi>
The Young man was daſh'd with this Check, and
deſired him, to excuſe a Fault he had committed,
by the Regret he had, to ſee himſelf reduc'd to the
condition of a Souldiers Life for a poor Subſiſtence,
after having loſt all his Eſtate in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I was in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and ſo near to
<hi>Geneva,</hi> I reſolv'd to ſpend Three or Four Days
there. I was Lodg'd at the Houſe of a good
Widow, who was a very Zealous Proteſtant, and
by this occaſion found my ſelf many times engag'd,
to diſpute about Matters of Religion: And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as I was then maintaining a Weak Cauſe,
I found the Arguments put to me to be very ſtrong;
and tho' I did not immediately give up the Cudgels,
yet thoſe I diſcours'd with, took notice of the
Moderation wherewith I gave in my Anſwers;
which made one of the Miniſters who was then
preſent, ſay, <hi>That it were greatly to be wiſh'd, that
all the Prieſts of</hi> Rome <hi>had the ſame command of
their Spirits; becauſe by this means</hi> Truth <hi>would
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:57009:216"/>
have the better Opportunity of diſcovering her ſelf
unto them; but that commonly by their Paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and their ſcornful and injurious Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
they broke off all Diſputes, as ſoon as they
found themſelves pinch'd with the Evidence of
Truth.</hi> The Truth is, they behaved themſelves
towards me with a great deal of Kindneſs and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility;
and after the Diſpute was over, a Fine Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
was Dreſt up, to which they Invited me,
deſiring only of me (by a kind of ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
which did not diſpleaſe me, becauſe I knew
it to be Juſt) that I would be pleas'd to make this
Reflection upon their Carriage, That their Spirit
was not like that of the Papiſts: <hi>For</hi> (ſaid they)
Sir, <hi>you know very well, that if we had Diſputed
as much either in</hi> France <hi>or</hi> Italy, <hi>to maintain our
Faith, as you have done here to defend yours, we
ſhould have been abus'd, Clapt up into Priſon, yea,
and Burnt alive; but as for us, we are ſo far from
having any recourſe to ſuch barbarous and horrid
Means, that we do not ſo much as upon that account
think the worſe of you; neither ſhall you perceive
any thing from us, but the kindeſt Entertainment
we are able to afford you.</hi> I cannot but own, that I
found in this their Behaviour ſomething of that
Spirit of <hi>Beneficence</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs,</hi> wherewith
<hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and his firſt Preachers of the Faith,
did Convert ſuch Crowds of Infidels and Sinners.
The Idea whereof has been ever ſince impreſt on
my Mind, and put me upon applying my ſelf to the
Reading of the Writings of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and to
weigh their Reaſons with a more unbiaſs'd Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:57009:217"/>
and having found them Solid, and founded on
the Word of God and the Practice of the Reformed
Churches, conform to thoſe of the Firſt Ages of the
Church, God had been pleas'd to give me his Grace,
to diſpoſe my Will to embrace it, by abjuring all
the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which I have,
and utterly do renounce from all my heart, and wiſh
you (in Chriſtian Charity) the ſame Happineſs,
as being,</p>
