            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The aucthour of the book was one maiſter Forteſcue knight Seriaunt at the law, and for his Skill and vertues preferred by kinge Henry the .vi. to be Chauncellour of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme. The entrie of the booke it ſelfe ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth where, and vppon what occaſion it was written. It was written in Berry in Fraunce, where Prince Edwarde ſonne to Henry the vi. afterward ſlaine at Tewkeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury by Edward the .iiii. dyd then remayne with his mother Queene Margaret in the houſe of Renate her father duke of Angeow and king of Cicile, during the tyme that Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the fourth reigned in this Realme and Henry the .vi. was fledd into Scotland. The occaſyon was this: The Chauncellour bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g fledde into Fraunce with the yong Prince &amp; perceiuing his delight to be all bent to Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrye as a thing of greateſt neede conſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he ment by force the reſtitucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thereby his own, to the kingdome of England, tooke occaſion (for that his hope was to ſee the Prince reigne heare) to moue him to a diuiſion of his affaires, &amp; as he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him ſelfe againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemy, ſo to adourne him ſelfe againſte his being kinge with ſkill

of lawes, whiche doe preſerue eche ſtate ſo in peace that it maye if neede be, warre, and ſo garde it in warre, that it may haue peace in eie. Thargument is this, that the ſkill of the Countrie lawes is neadefull for the Prince, althoughe not ſo deepe as the purpoſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, yet ſo full as to their honour may &amp; ought to fall in Princes. And for that the Prince ſhould think y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing to be a Princely knowledge, he taketh occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by comparing the gouernement of this Realme w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> others, and the lawes of this lande with the Ciuill, with whome it is of all men lightly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and the betterneſſe of poyntes wherein they bothe trauayle, and prouiſions by the one wiſelyer foreſeene then by the other, to proue the ſingularitie of this ſtate whiche it behoued the Prince to learne ſeyng hee was lyke to ſucceade hys father, and to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the lawes, whiche maketh the ſtate to bee ſo ſinguler.

For yt is the offyce and duytie of a Kyng to fight the batailes of his people, and alſo rightlye to iudge them, as in the viii. chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the firſte booke of Kinges you are plainelye taught.

<pb facs="tcp:2606:6"/>
becauſe that like as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res by force of chiualrye are ended, euen ſo iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes by the lawes are determined. which thing Iuſtinian the Emperour well and wiſely and adui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſedly pondering, in the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginninge of the preface of his book ſaith thus. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth the emperiall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty not onli to be garded with armez, but alſo to be armed with lawes, to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he mai be able right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to execute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernem<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of bothe times, aſwell of warre as of peace. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be it for youre more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt endeuoir to the ſtudy of the law, the exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the chiefeſt lawmaker Moyſes, ſometyme capy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Synagoge ought to be of much more force with you, then the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2606:6"/>
woordes of Iuſtinian, wheras in the xvii. chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the book of Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomie hee doothe by the auctority of god ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye charge the kinges of Iſraell to be readers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe al the daies of theire lyfe ſayeng thus. When the kyng ſhall ſitte vppon the princelye ſeate of hys kingdome, hee ſhall write him out thys lawe in a booke, takynge the copye thereof of the prieſtes the Leuites: and he ſhal haue it with him, and hee ſhall read it al the dayes of hys life, that he may learne to feare the lorde his god, &amp; to keepe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and ordinaunces written in this lawe.</p>
               <p>And Helynandus expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the ſame ſaith thus.
<pb facs="tcp:2606:7"/>
A Prince therefore muſt not be ignorant of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, neither is it tollerable y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee vnder the pretence of warrefare ſhoulde be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfull in the lawe. And a littel after he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſayeth hee, to receyue the coppye of the lawe of the prieſtes the Leuites, that is to ſaye, of catholik and learned men. Thus muche he: For the booke of Deuteronomie is the booke of the lawes, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with the Kynges of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell were bounde to rule and gouerne theyre Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes. Thys booke doth Moyſes commaunde kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges too reade, that they may learne to feare God, and keepe his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, which are wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the lawe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:2606:7"/>Beholde the effecte of the lawe is to feare God.</p>
               <p>Whereunto man cannot attayne, oneleſſe he firſte knowe the will of God, whiche is written in the lawe. For the principall poynte of all ſeruyce is to knowe the wyll and plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure of the lord or maiſter to whome ſeruyce ys due. Howbeit the lawmaker Moyſes firſt i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this charge mencioneth the effecte of the lawe, that is the feare of God: and nexte he allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs to the keepinge of the cauſe thereof, that is to ſaye, of Goddes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes. For in the mynde and intent of the exhorter the effect go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethe before the cauſe.</p>
               <p>But what feare is thys whyche the lawes do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obſeruerz therof?
<pb facs="tcp:2606:8"/>
Surely it is not that fear, wherof it is written, that perfect charitie or loue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellethe feare. Yet thys ſame feare, thoughe it bee bond &amp; ſeruile, oftentimes prouoketh kinges to the reading of the lawes: but it procedeth not out of the law. But that feare wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of Moyſes here ſpeaketh, whiche alſo procedeth out of the lawes is the ſelfe ſame feare, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh of ſaynge. The feare of the lorde is holy, &amp; endureth for euer &amp; euer. This is ſuch a loui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g feare as natural children beare to their deare pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tz commenly termed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child toward his parents, Whereunto there is no puniſhement due, as a thinge wrought by loue. For this feare pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the lawes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2606:8"/>
which teach to do the wil of god, ſo that it deſerueth no puniſhement. But the glorye of the Lorde is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them that feare hym, and he doth glorify them. Yea thys feare is eeuen that ſame feare, whereof Iob after that he had dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſlye ſearched for wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſayeth thus. Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the feare of the lord is perfecte wiſedome, and to forſake euill is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge. That the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakinge of euill is the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge of the feare of god, this do the lawes teache, whereby it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the ſame fear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth out of them.</p>

For all the philoſophers which haue ſo diuerſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned of felicitie, haue all agreed together in this o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e point, that felicitie or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende of al ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s deſire: and therefore theye cal it chief goodnes. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peripatetiks placed it in vertue, the Stoikes i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honeſtie, &amp; the Epicures in pleaſure.

<pb facs="tcp:2606:13"/>
Wherefore Ariſtotle alſo in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th booke of his po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litiques defining felicitie, ſaieth that it is the perfect vſe of vertues.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2606:13"/>
by the name of al ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.

But thys beeing once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned and perfectly kept, then all the hole deuty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a kyng is iuſtly perfourmed.

And yet the lawe is not hable to perfourme theſe thinges withoute the aſſiſtence of grace, witheoute the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che alſo you can not learn nor couet eyther lawe or vertue. For as ſaieth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſ. in his booke intituled <hi>Cur deus homo</hi> the inward vertue of man wherin his deſieringe is placed is ſo

Wherefore in that ſome men applye and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour themſelues to the loue and folowing of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, it proceedethe of the bountiful goodnes of god and not of the power of man.

that they are more woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to haue the name of diſorders, then of well or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dered lawes.

And it cannot otherwiſe bee thoughte, but that they are repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with muche wytte and wyſedome, ſeeynge they are ordayned not by the deuyſe of one man alone, or of a hundrethe wiſe counſellers onelye, but of mo then three hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dreth choſen menne,

And if it fortune theſe ſtatutes beeinge deuyſed with ſuche greate ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and witte, not to fal out ſo effectuallye as the intent of the makers dyd wyſhe, they may be quick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye refourmed, but not wythout the aſſent of the commens and ſtates of the realme, by whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie they were firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſed.

aſwell agaynſt ſtormes, as alſo againſte the heate of the ſonne. And the paſtures are commonly watered, ſo that cattell ſhutte and cloſed therein haue no neede of keping neither by daye, nor by nighte. For there bee noe wolfes, nor beares, nor Lyons. Wherefore theire ſheepe lye night by night in the fieldes vnkepte within their foldes, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with theire lande is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured.

Howbeit whether of the ſame lawes in their iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments excelleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will I leaue to your own determination. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile law doth legittimate the childe borne beefore matrimonie aſwell as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is borne after: and geueth vntoo it ſucceſſion in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parents inheritance.

that by meane thereof the ſacrament or ſtate of matrimonie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge in place, extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhethe the former ſinne, whereby eles the ſowles of twoe perſones ſhoulde haue periſhed.

The churche alſo accepteth ſuche chyldren for legittimate. Theſe I trowe are the iii. ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt reaſons, whereby they maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende theyre law. Which are thus aunſwered by the lawyers of England.

Whiche this lawe dothe not, but rather allureth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myndes of ſynners to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtye. Neither can it bee anye defence to thys lawe, that the churche ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth ſuche children for legittimate.

ſo that the children there of borne are called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the people.

foloweth the ſtate of his conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and of her owne free wyll hathe made her ſelfe a bonde woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not forced thereto by the law muche lyke to ſuch as in kynges courtes become bondemen, or ſell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfs into bondage without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny compulſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all. And howe then can the lawe determine that childe to be free, whom ſuche a mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther hathe thus borne. For the huſband can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be in ſo much ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his wyfe, thoughe ſhe be a right greate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, as this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect to the bondeman, whom ſhe hathe made her lorde: inſomuche as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde ſayeth to al wifes Thou ſhalt be vnder the power of thy huſbonde, &amp; he ſhall haue dominion ouer thee. And what is it
<pb facs="tcp:2606:104"/>
that theſe Ciuilians ſaye of the fruite of a good or euyll tree. Is not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye wyfe of a fre or thral condition accordynge to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtate of her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d And in whoſe ground hathe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> huſbande planted, while his wyfe is one fleſhe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. Not in his owne? And what the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he haue graffed a ſlyppe of a ſwete nature i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſtock of a ſower tree: So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tre be his owne, ſhall not the fruites, thoughe they eu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſauer of the ſtocke, be his owne fruites? So the childe which the wyfe ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth is the huſbandes iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, whether the wyfe be free or thrall. Howbeit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of England de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that if a bonde wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of
