         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Succeſſes of all the Conſultations and Actions of the Sons of Men have their Dependence on the Pleaſure of that God, who is Wonderful in Counſel, and Mighty in Working: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as in all other Affairs, ſo eſpecially in thoſe which are of greateſt concernment, it is our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſeek the Lord, with whom alone is Wiſdom and Strength, that we may teſtifie our Hope to be in him, and our Dependence on him alone. It is the Priviledge of thoſe who are in Covenant with the Lord, that they have a God nigh unto them in all that they call upon him for. The People of God in this Nation (if they had obſerved them, or have not forgotten them) may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo large a Catalogue of Mercies given in anſwer to Prayers, as no Nation under the Heavens can parallel: in not a few of which the Lord hath as it were exemplified that Promiſe, <hi>Before they call I will anſwer, and while they are yet ſpeaking I will hear;</hi> and in others, given a proof of his Faithfulneſs in what he had ſaid, <hi>Ask of me concerning my Sons, and concerning the Works of my Hands command ye me:</hi> All of them ſo many real Demonſtrations, that he hath not ſaid unto the ſeed of <hi>Jacob, Seek ye me in vain:</hi> So that above all the People in the World, thoſe who fear the Lord in theſe Nations have cauſe to ſay of him, <hi>Becauſe he hath heard my voice, therefore will I call upon him ſo long as I live:</hi> And as if the Lord would try us whether we will do ſo or not, he is pleaſed to adminiſter variety of occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to prove the Faith of his People.

Who can look back on the Providences wherewith the Lord hath exerciſed us the Year paſſed, but hath cauſe to ſay, <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgements?</hi> And if we do but with an eye of common Prudence, take a Proſpect of thoſe great Actions which are like to be the Product of the enſuing Year, and weigh the Conſequences of them, may we not ſay, <hi>Lord, we know not what to do, but our eyes are unto thee?</hi> His Highneſs the Lord Protector ſeriouſly conſidering theſe things, and having by the Advice of His Privy Council called a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to meet in <hi>January</hi> next, and being not a little ſenſible how great an influence the Deliberations and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of that His great Council may have, not onely upon the Civil Peace and outward Proſperity of theſe Three Nations, yea of all the Proteſtants abroad, but alſo in reference to the Spiritual Liberties which the Lord hath in an eſpecial maner reſerved as a Bleſſing to be given in to this Generation, and likewiſe to the concernments of the Goſpel through the World: Therefore His Highneſs, by Advice of His Privy Council, holds it a ſeaſonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Duty as in His own Perſon, ſo to call upon, and invite others who are concerned herein, in a Solemn maner to humble themſelves before the Lord, and earneſtly to ſeek his Favor and Bleſſing on the Counſels and Affairs of theſe Nations, and eſpecially on that Great Council, that he who is the Counſellor and Prince of Peace, will ſit among them, guide their Spirits, and lead them to ſuch Counſels of Peace and Good for theſe Nations, and the Intereſt of the Lord Ieſus in them, that the Generations to come may riſe up and call them Bleſſed, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about us may be filled with Admiration at the Lords gracious dealings with us, and we may have further cauſe to ſay, <hi>The Lord is in the midſt of us, therefore we ſhall be eſtabliſhed.</hi> For which purpoſe His Highneſs doth appoint, That in all Places within <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> Wedneſday the Nine and twentieth day of <hi>December</hi> inſtant, and in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Wedneſday the Fifth of <hi>January</hi> next, be obſerved as a day of Solemn Faſting and Humiliation in all Churches, Chappels and Congregations within the ſame; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhorting all thoſe whoſe hearts the Lord hath touched with a due ſenſe of theſe things, to be inſtant with the Lord in this behalf, in ſuch a Serious and Solemn maner, as the nature of ſo Spiritual and Extraordinary a Duty doth require, and that every one in their Places will ſtudy how they may ſecond their Prayers with ſutable endeavors, tending to Vnity and Peace: And His Highneſs doth Will and Require all Miniſters and Paſtors of Congregations, to Read this Declaration in their Meetings for Publique Worſhip on the Lords Day next before the ſaid Day of Publique Faſting, to the end the ſame may be the better taken notice of: And the holding of all Markets and Fairs are hereby Prohibited on that day.</p>
