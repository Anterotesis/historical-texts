            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his Highness PRINCE <hi>RUPERT,</hi> Count Palatine of the <hi>Rhyne, DUKE</hi> of <hi>BAVRIA</hi> And CUMBERLAND, EARL of HOLDERNESS, &amp;c. Constable of the Royal Castle and Honor OF WINDSOR, And KNIGHT of the Noble Order OF THE GARTER.</head>

            <p>I Have not presumed to present this mean and slender Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Minerals unto your Highness view, forth of confidence
<pb facs="tcp:102655:3"/>
of its own worth, though there may be some things in it not unfit for the knowledge of so High and Noble a Person: But rather in respect of the transcendent worth of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it treateth of, being the most abstruse and most excellent part of all Natural Philosophy; being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto especially moved by two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. One is, That your Highness being a Member of the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety (one of the happy fruits of His Majesties blessed and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Restauration, and that which will speak him glorious to all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generations, beyond all his Royal Progenitors) stands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in some measure obliged to be an encourager, and cherisher of all attempts (though of the lowest and meanest persons) that tend to
<pb facs="tcp:102655:3"/>
the advancement of Experimental Philosophy. This (may it please your Highness) did heighten my hopes, that I might receive the same candor (in some measure) that your Highness seemeth to have afforded to all. Another is the propension, and inclination that (as I am informed) your Highness bears in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to this worthy and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Science of Minerals and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. The onely thing (besides the craving pardon for my bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) is, that I humbly beg of your Highness, that if your spare hours will allow, you may sometimes make a perusal of it, and if your Highness be pleased to put to your helping hand, that this kind of knowledge may be
<pb facs="tcp:102655:4"/>
more heedfully sought into, and promoted, and that others of far greater abilities, may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate some part of their knowledge, it is all that is desired by</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>COurteous Reader, Expect here no flourishing Frontispiece to allure thee to the buying of this untrim'd and unpolished piece, no not so much as the Authors Picture, who never yet was so far in love with his earthly Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as to be at the charges to have the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of it drawn, or cut in Copper. Thine own desire after this kind of knowledge, and the plainness of the Subject, are the greatest motives that I have to lay before thee, to move thee either to buy, or read. The stile is low, and plain as the nature of such a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject would bear, whose harsh and unusual terms, suitable for the most part for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners themselves, could not well have admitted of Rhetorick, or more polite Language, had I been furnished with any such. And though sometimes I am forced to use more nice and subtle expressions, they are such as the matter in hand did necessarily require, and cannot but be agreeable to such Readers, whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings are capacitated to comprehend the matters treated of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102655:5"/>What Opinions soever I offer, whether of mine own, or taken from other Authors, are not to impose upon the judgments of any, who am my self no lover of Dogmatizing, and have long wished, and am now most glad to see a way set up for the promoting of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philosophy, that Mens judgments may no longer be fettered in Scholastick Chains, nor kept always in the Prisons of Academick Opinions. Though I would not here be understood to condemn those Systems, and Methods of Arts and Sciences, that are necessary to the instructing of Youth therein, but that they are laudable and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and have their proper and peculiar uses and benefits, but not so far as to set a stop to farther Discoveries by Experiment and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, especially in Natural Philosophy; for all the knowledge (doubtless) that is yet had, is but a small part of that which may be known, and lies yet undiscovered, or found out.</p>
            <p>There are two main things that I have aimed at in this Work. 1. The one is, that seeing there is little extant in our <hi>English</hi> Tongue, concerning Metals or Minerals, the signs of finding, and discovering of them, or
<pb facs="tcp:102655:5"/>
of their Generations, Growth, Properties or Differences, nor of many other things perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this kind of Knowledge: I thought it might be both an acceptable and beneficial matter to communicate publickly what either by reading I had collected, by converse learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or by observation found out, concerning Mineral or Metallick Knowledge, unto our English Miners and others that have a desire to understand these things, and yet are not capable of the Latin or German Tongues, in which the greatest part of this Knowledge is written. And this being as it were the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of mine aim, I hope my Country-men will take it thankfully, and in good part, though it be wonderfully far short of what may be desired and expected about this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another main end that I have had in publishing of this poor piece of collected Learning, is simply (as far as I am able) to promote Metallick Knowledge, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to excite others that have had far better and greater advantages to instruct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves, than I that have always li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a private, obscure, and troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
<pb facs="tcp:102655:6"/>
and doubtlesly know much more than ever I can justly challenge or appropriate to my self; which if it may occasion, or gain this end, I have a great part of my wished desires.</p>
            <p>I have also discussed some things of the highest pitch about mystical Chymistry; which if I be censured for, I am contented, and shall use no other defence but silence and patience: For I too well know how that kind of Learning finds entertainment in the World: But there are none that are blessed with any measure of that noble, true, and most true Science, but they have learned little to weigh the Judgments and Censures of the ignorant and envious. And however others may judge, they that do understand will be satisfied with what particulars I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and that is all that I desire or wish for.</p>
            <p>But if any object, and say, that this is little, but only a Collection and Transcription of what others have written upon this subject: We shall confess it; for it is not possible that one private person that hath been no great Traveller, nor seen any Mines but those of his own Nation, and not the most of them
<pb facs="tcp:102655:6"/>
neither, should be able experimentally to comprehend all that is necessary to this kind of Knowledge. Yet hath the Reader two benefits hereby: one is, that those things that lie dispersed in many and several Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, are here as it were contracted, and for the most part brought to their heads or kinds, whereby with less labour and pains, and the sparing of much cost in buying many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, the Reader may come to some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Mineral Knowledge. Secondly, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother benefit is, That the Reader may find the marrow of what other Authors have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in other Languages, represented in his Mothers Tongue: as also, here are many things of my own Observation that may be conducible to advance this kind of Learning.</p>
            <p>Again, I have here given an enumeration of the most considerable Authors that have written of Metals and Minerals, with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Censure upon them; whereby the Reader may be enabled to make his choice of such of them as he liketh best, and may be indifferently instructed how to judge, or account of the most of them; which is a matter of no small concern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102655:7"/>If any seem offended that I have given too great Commendations to <hi>Paracelsus, Helmont, Basilius,</hi> and some other of the Adeptists, they may know that it is not without just cause, though they understand them not: for chewed meat must not always be put into mens mouths, let them study to find forth the depth of the meaning of those Authors, and then they will judge as I have done, and will confess that far less praise is given unto them than they have justly deserved.</p>
            <p>I have also sometimes given the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties quoted in the Language and words of the Author; sometimes have rendred them into the English, not so much regarding the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Order, as the sense of the Author; and for the most part the Book and Folio no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Margent: so that however, if the Reader doubt or dislike, he may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the Authors themselves, and consult them in their own words, or in other Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations, if there be any.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I have mentioned divers sorts of Ores, that possibly some of them might be found in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> as of Antimony, Tinglass, Spelter, Talk, and Cinnober;
<pb facs="tcp:102655:7"/>
which if the diligent Miner would seek care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully after, the ways of refining and purifying of them might easily be found forth, and thereby no small advantage be brought to the Nation in general, and to the poor Miners in particular. And this is all that I think good to offer by way of Preface, the Work may speak for it self without further Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I hope the Reader will take it in good part, at least until some abler Pen shall publish something concerning this subject in our English Tongue, that may be of greater worth and utility. Farewel.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Histor. Jud. lib. 3. c. 2. p. 205.</note> who saith, The Wisdom of God hath made Metals for Physick, and for defence, for ornament, and for instruments for the Work of men. What great benefit the Mineral Kingdom doth yield in the Art of Medicine, for the curing both of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and external diseases, the Authors (as <hi>Dioscori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and <hi>Matthiolus</hi>) that have written largely <hi>de mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Medica,</hi> as also the whole Band of the Chymists, both mystical and vulgar, do sufficiently testifie. So
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102655:10"/>
that some have thought that an whole Apothecaries shop might be furnished forth of <hi>Vitriol</hi> alone; and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> (quoting <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> which he seems to approve of) that 200 Diseases (perhaps) might be cured with Preparations made forth of Lead. And for the other benefits that this knowledge hath brought to mankind, both for War (which since corruption entered the nature of man, could not be eschewed, either in the offensive or defensive part) and Peace, are so many and so great, that there are none so ignorant that are not sensible thereof. So that in a manner the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of mankind would be much deficient if this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral skill had not been found out, exercised, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; as almost all Trades, Artificers, and Families can sufficiently testifie.</p>
               <p>And therefore we find this Skill was (necessity compelling) found forth in the first Ages of the World,<note place="margin">Gen. c. 4. v. 22.</note>

forth of Brass and Iron; and then the discovering, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging up, and purifying of Metals must have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, and so more ancient.

So that whether way soever it be taken, it is apparent that the discovering of Mines and Metals, their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102655:11"/>
digging up, refining, and sundry uses of them are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient, if not more then many other Arts now extant in the World. And though it be not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Holy Writ, that in those days Medicines were prepared forth of them, yet it is no solid conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to affirm that they were not, for many things were both invented and used, of which there is no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive mention in the Scriptures. And however <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringius</hi> with all his bitterness, the Catholick Transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Rhapsodist <hi>Athanasius Kircherus,</hi> with all his querks, and <hi>Guibertus</hi> with his ignorance and malice may imagine, it is manifest that Chymical or Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Physick was very ancient, as we in a few argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (though digressively) shall prove and evince.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The great question is, Whether the Egyptian Learning was anciently in any great request, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this point of curing Diseases. 2. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chymistry was not ancient in respect of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Medicines forth of Metals and Minerals.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Egyptian Learning in Physick and Metals appeareth thus. 1. We find <hi>Gen. c.</hi> 41.<hi>v.</hi> 42. these words: <hi>And Pharaoh took off the ring from his hand, and put it upon Iosephs hand, and arraied him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck:</hi> from whence it is plain that the Egyptians in that time had either the knowledge of finding of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, or had them brought from some other Countries, but however had the skill of melting of them, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious framing of them, else they could not have made (as may rationally be supposed they did) such valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and choice things as Rings and Chains of gold. And this Art could not in a moment or on the sudden be learned of them, or arisen up amongst them; for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102655:11"/>
nothing is invented and perfected at one and the self-same time; and this sufficiently proveth that they had skill in that part of Chymistry that teacheth the fusion and purifying of Metals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A second Argument is,<note place="margin">Gen. c. 50. v. 2, 3, 26.</note> in this Text, <hi>And Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph commanded his servants the Physicians, to embalm his father: and the Physicians embalmed Israel. And forty dayes were fulfilled for him (for so are fulfilled the dayes of those which are embalmed) and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten dayes</hi>: and <hi>Ioseph</hi> was embalmed also. From whence it is apparent that they had Physicians thus anciently in <hi>Egypt</hi>; and that they had no other skill but onely to embalm, were absurd to imagine, or to think they were not versed in curing diseases, and so were furnished with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines both from the Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral Kingdoms. If their Learning had not been great in this point as well as in Politicks, Arithmetick, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, and Astronomy, the comparison betwixt <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> wisdom and theirs had been fondly asserted by the Text that saith,<note place="margin">1 King. c. 4. v. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>And Solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.</hi> From whence we may note, 1. That the Text would not have said that <hi>Solomons</hi> wisdom had excelled the wisdom of the children of the East, and all the wisdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if the wisdom of the East, and of <hi>Egypt</hi> had not then been account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greatest wisdom known in the world. 2. This wisdom of the East and of <hi>Egypt</hi> was not such as like a <hi>Mushrom</hi> must start up in a night and an age, but must necessarily in reason be supposed to have had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, an encrease long ere it could come to that height to be esteemed the greatest in the world, and then
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102655:12"/>
must needs have been of a long and large antiquity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the days of King <hi>Solomon.</hi> 3. And that it should be then accounted the greatest wisdom in the world, and yet to be defective both in that part of the Theory of Natural Philosophy, which of all is the most noble; and especially in that part of the Practick, the Art of Medicine, or Curing Diseases, and meliorating of Metals, were indeed to mutilate the wisdom of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and to make him not only ignorant in the most secret and noble parts of natural knowledge, but also to have been most miserable, in not being able to cure the infirmities of the body; which cure being wanting, the comfort of all other earthly joys doth vanish and flie away. 4. And what should <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> skill have been accounted to excel theirs (for the excellency is chiefly put in his knowledge of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things) being so knowing in the nature of all Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, that he was able to dispute of all Plants and Trees,<note place="margin">1 King. c. 4. v. 33.</note> from the Cedar of <hi>Lebanon</hi> even unto the Hys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop that springs forth of the Wall: And to know the nature of all living Creatures, as Beasts, Fowls, creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and Fishes: if by all this he knew not to preserve health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cure diseases, and especially to be ignorant of the nature of the things contained in the Mineral Kingdom; or understood not the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana's and Medicines that might be drawn from them, and lay hidden in them:<note place="margin">2 Chron. c. 1. v. 15.</note> and if he excelled them in all these (as doubtless he did) then the knowledge of the children of the East, and of the Egyptians in all these things, was not little or of small account. 5. Why should <hi>Solomon</hi> send to <hi>Ophir</hi> for gold, and to make at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> silver and gold as plenteous as stones: if it were for nothing but for vain glory and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102655:12"/>
what wisdom was this, any but that which was earthly, sensual, and devilish? and not that which as a blessing was given to <hi>Solomon</hi> by the Almighty. 6. But if we may believe that piece (though reckoned among the Apocrypha) called <hi>the Wisdom of Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wisd. c. 7. v. 7, 8, 9, 17, 21.</note> we may hear him thus confessing: <hi>Wherefore I prayed and prudence was given me, I prayed and the spirit of Wisdom was bestowed upon me.</hi> And he esteemed gold in comparison of it, as sand: and acknowledgeth that by it he had innumerable riches, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he knew the framing of the World, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Elements, and whatsoever was hidden and manifest, that he knew. From whence it is plain that he was not ignorant of the most secret vertues both of things occult and manifest, and so could not but understand the nature and vertues of the Mineral Kingdom, otherwise he had not excelled the children of the East, nor the Egyptians, whose skill could not be little in these things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Argument appeareth from the Text. <hi>And Moses was instructed</hi> (or instituted from a child) <hi>in all the learning of the Egyptians.</hi> For though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> after his nursing was brought to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and brought up as her son, yet was it well known unto his Mother who had nursed him, that he was her own child; and therefore it is not rational that she, his father, and the rest of the Hebrews would suffer him to be brought up so with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as thereby to destroy the principles of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (in which no doubt they had a special care to instruct him) being therein as zealous as any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under heaven.

               <p>Concerning some part of the great Learning of the Egyptians, hear <hi>Aristotle</hi>; who saith, speaking of the Stars: <hi>Similiter &amp; de caeteris stellis Egyptii &amp; Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonii dicunt, qui plurimis jam annis ante haec observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt, &amp; à quibus multa fide d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We have received that <hi>Pythagoras, Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> had viewed the farthest Lands: for where there was any thing to be learned, they have judged it fit to go thither.</p>
               <p>Another Testimony take from <hi>Macrobius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Macrob. lib. 1. Saturnal. c. 15.</note> who saith, That <hi>Egypt</hi> was the Mother of all Arts. And again, That the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were the Parents of all the Disciplines of Philosophy: which is confirmed by <hi>Strabo,</hi> an Author of unquestionable verity; by <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi> and by <hi>Diodorus Siculus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geog. lib. 17. Herodot. l. 2. Diod. Sic. l, 1.</note> To these add the words of <hi>Philo Iudaeus</hi> in his Book <hi>De vita Mosis</hi>: who saith, that their Learning consisted in Arithmetick, Geometry, Musick, and Hieroglyphical Philosophy; <hi>vid. Iamblic. de vit. Pythag. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 29. <hi>Diog. Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, p.</hi> 182. <hi>&amp; Orig. Sacr. p.</hi> 122. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all this we shall onely draw these Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if the Learning of the children of the East,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102655:14"/>
and the Wisdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the greatest that then was known, and that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s excelled them both; then it cannot ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be conceived that either of them were defective in the most noble parts, either of Natural Philosophy, or the Art of Medicine drawn from the Mineral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor the Art of Transmutation, but that they understood both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (accounted the Prince of Learning, and of as much Antiquity as the most Authors we have) would never have so much commended the Egyptians and Babylonians for the truth of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning the Stars; but if they were so well versed in the nature of things so remote as the Stars, they must (in all probability) be as much (if not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) skill'd in the knowledge of the nature of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Cicero,</hi> a person that writ above 1600 years since, would never have so remarkably taken notice of <hi>Pythagoras, Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> for travelling into the remotest Regions, and especially into <hi>Egypt,</hi> they knowing the height of the Graecian Learning, and being therein, by the account of all Authors, the chiefest Masters, if there had not been some excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Egyptian Learning that they were ignorant of. And what could that be except the Art of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting of Metals, and of curing diseases in a more perfect way then the Graecians knew; amongst whom notwithstanding the <hi>Aesculapian</hi> Family had been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous many hundred years before the time of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> and those that followed him and their going down into <hi>Egypt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And if <hi>Egypt</hi> was (according to <hi>Macrobius</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102655:14"/>
the rest quoted before) the Mother of all Arts, and the Parent of all the Disciplines of Philosophy; then surely they could not be ignorant of that which is the most noble of all Arts, the Transmutation of Metals, and the curing of all diseases by an universal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which is no where to be had but forth of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But their chief Objection is, that Chymistry (about which name we do not contend, but about the Art it self) is but of late invention; and that the learning at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to <hi>Hermes Trismegist,</hi> is but of late years standing, and both the Author and it but forged and feigned. To which we answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Couringius</hi> (the most bitter Enemy that ever the Hermetick Learning,<note place="margin">Couring. de Herm. Medic. c. 9. p. 77.</note> or that <hi>Hermes</hi> had) doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that from most ancient Times the Art of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine was had in esteem in <hi>Egypt</hi>; and saith, That the Art of Medicine had been in most high esteem with the Egyptians, seeing it was manifest by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their own Country and of others, greater then all exception. For that in the Age of the Patriarchs <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> there wanted not Physicians, by whose care their dead bodies were (being embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) preserved from putrefaction; but that afterwards the same was practised by others, as might be gathered by those things that are related of the Egyptian Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, by <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Democritus.</hi> By whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession it being granted that the Medical Art was so anciently practised there; and that according to <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> they affirmed that the Art of Medicine was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented amongst them,<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 7. c. 56</note> and all their Arts commonly attributed to <hi>Hermes</hi>; then it must of necessity follow, that <hi>Hermes</hi> (though there might be, and by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102655:15"/>
of <hi>Cicero</hi> were divers of that name) was not a feigned Author, nor the Art forged, but was of such antiquity, that no vain Arguments can easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Testimony of <hi>Suidas,</hi> though undervalued by <hi>Couringius</hi> and <hi>Guibertus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Libanii lib. Alchym. Trans. Defens. 2. p. 214.</note> is not of the least validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: who relateth, That <hi>Dioclesian</hi> had caused to be gathered all the Books that treated of Chymistry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Egyptians, and caused them to be burned, lest growing rich by the Art of Transmutation, it might incourage them to rebel. Now <hi>Dioclesian</hi> came to the Empire, or reigned about the Year of Christ, 288. or as some, 287. or as <hi>Baronius,</hi> 284. and <hi>Suidas</hi> lived about <hi>Ann. Christ.</hi> 1214. so that the Name and Art of Chymistry must needs have been both known before the time of <hi>Suidas</hi> writing. And <hi>Coelius Rhodigines,</hi> an Author of great authority and general Learning; the <hi>Collegium Conimbricense</hi> are perswaded that he writ the truth. And this testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Demetrius Chalcocondyles</hi> giveth of the Writings of <hi>Suidas.</hi> This Book, to wit of <hi>Suidas,</hi> doth not onely bring manifold profit to young Students, but also great fruit and pleasure to persons of every Age. For neither doth he onely interpret the words of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,<note place="margin">Libanii ibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which Testimony of the Writings of <hi>Suidas,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Opinion of all learned men for above the space of 400 years, is a far greater evidence then ever the authority of <hi>Guibertus,</hi> or <hi>Couringius</hi> is able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102655:15"/>3. <hi>Couringius</hi> and <hi>Guibertus</hi> both do confess that <hi>Iulius Firmicus</hi> the Astrologer,<note place="margin">Libanii ibid. p. 217.218.</note> who lived in the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour, about the year of Chirst 320. did attribute a good or bad Constellation in Heaven to the Professors of Alchymie. By which it is plain that the Profession of that Art must have been long known before;<note place="margin">Couring. l. de Herm. Medic. p. 62, 93, 137.</note> for it is a rule, that <hi>Rei non exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentis, aut incognitae nulla est assignatio</hi>; That of a thing not existing, or unknown, there can be no assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And seeing that <hi>Firmicus</hi> was a most ancient Astrologer, and that Astrological Observations do arise from long Experience; it must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Alchymy must needs be both <hi>Re &amp; Nomine,</hi> of far greater antiquity then the days of <hi>Firmicus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Guibertus</hi> himself brings an example forth of <hi>Cedrenus</hi> of one Professing Chymistry, that was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician (in the worst sense he meaneth.) Now <hi>Cedre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> writ in the time of <hi>Anastasius</hi> the Emperour, who reigned about <hi>Ann. Christ.</hi> 491.<note place="margin">Liban. at supr. p. 242.</note> And if then there were some that professed Chymistry, then it must needs have been of a more ancient standing. For there is no Profession that upon a sudden doth get root, and pass into an habit; but must have a time of its invention, increase, and perfection; so that it is plain that both the Art of Chymistry and the Name was very ancient. And to this might be added, That the Writings of <hi>Hermes Trismegist</hi> were long extant in the World before the Times of Christianity, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it could not be imagined that the Christians for the advancement and defence of their Religion, should have forged supposititious pieces under <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> his name, but that his Reputation and Learning had been long, and then was of great account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Heathens themselves.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102655:16"/>5. Also it is manifest that Chymistry was ancient, because it had flourished long before the times of <hi>Avicen, Bulcasis, Mesue, Rhasis,</hi> and the rest of the Arabians, who could not have mentioned it, if it had not had a beginning before their Age and Time.<note place="margin">Liban. ut supr. p. 217.</note> To this I shall onely joyn the Testimony of <hi>Morienus</hi> a Roman Hermit, whose Writings were translated forth of the Arabick Language into Latine, <hi>Ann.

And afterwards <hi>Morienus</hi> taught it to <hi>Calid</hi> or <hi>Evelid,</hi> the son of <hi>Gizid</hi> the second, who was King of <hi>Egypt</hi> about the year of Christ 725. which doubtless <hi>Adfar</hi> had learned forth of the Writings of <hi>Hermes Trismegist</hi>; which do all plainly prove that Chymistry, for the Hermetick Learning was of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient antiquity, and <hi>Hermes</hi> himself no feigned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>

For but that since and about the time of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> it hath been revived and restored, and now begins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to flourish; otherwise before it either was by Tradition (especially the mystical part) delivered over from hand to hand, and so kept lock'd up in the brests of a few mystical Authors or Adeptists; or in their Writings delivered so darkly and obscurely, that the most were deterred from taking pains to read or study them: and of those few that bent their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that way, scarce one of a thousand did perceive or understand their manner of Aenigmatical and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Writing and Expressions; so that for the most part, until the time aforesaid, the knowledge of Chymistry lay buried in the Cells of the Friers and Monks, and so came to no great improvement nor perfection.</p>
               <p>And the Reasons of the non-proficiency of the knowledge of Minerals and Metals in general, we conceive to be these principally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whereas the Animal and Vegetable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, in their Generations, Growth, Operations, and Properties, lay visible and obvious, that every diligent Observer and Searcher might dive thereinto; yet hath the knowledge of all those particulars not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to any such degree of perfection, but that the most necessary and substantial points are yet undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered or not found out. Now the progress of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the generation of Metals and Minerals, their properties and alterations, being a thing that lay hid in the bowels of the Earth, whereinto the senses of few men could pierce; and so exceeding difficult to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102655:17"/>
observe or understand, that it is no great marvel that so little progress is made into that kind of Knowledg; for where obviousness and easiness are awanting to know the Subject and the Properties thereof, men commonly have no incitements or encouragement to search after the knowledge of such matter, and therefore must needs be a great <hi>remora</hi> or stop to the progress therin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, Though most Countries that are not extremely barbarous, do produce within the compass of some circuit of years, Men learned, and studious of the secrets of Nature; yet every Region doth not produce such store of Minerals, as may afford either a fit subject, or opportunity for such disquisitions, and therefore searching minds, either diverted themselves to inquire into other parts of Nature, more near and easie to be observed, or else betook themselves to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral contemplation; and so framed Systemes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own fansies, rather drawing Nature to follow their Conceptions, then by travel, labour, long toil and experimental Observations, to order their speculations according to the truth of Natures operations; or else fall down with that scantling of knowledge in these things that they found written by other Authors, that had preceded them. So that thereby this kind of Learning was brought to a stand, and had its <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> set upon it. And it had stood so still, had not some persons of more insatiable desire of the knowledge of the secrets of Nature, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of her Mineral Kingdom, with <hi>Herculean</hi> bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and undaunted resolution, broken through all difficulties, and adventured great dangers and long peregrinations for attaining the same, more (perhaps) then <hi>Iason</hi> for the Golden Fleece. And such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102655:18"/>
plainly <hi>Basilius Valentinus, Bernardus Trevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanus, Iohannes Pontanus</hi>; and of late <hi>Iohannes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola</hi> to have been, and especially that indefatigable person <hi>Paracelsus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nelm. Tartar. Histor. p. 334.</note> who when under the twentieth year of his age (having seen all the Mines in <hi>Germany</hi>) travelled through <hi>England, Scotland, Swedeland, Denmark, Norway,</hi> and into <hi>Russia,</hi> and from thence into the Borders of the <hi>Tartars</hi>; where being taken prisoner, and carried to the <hi>Great Cham,</hi> was from thence conveyed to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and from thence returned home thorow <hi>Arabia,</hi> and so to <hi>Venice.</hi> So little doth any danger fright a noble and resolute mind, when armed with the ardent desire of gaining knowledge, while other idle Lubbers that dare not adventure from the air of their own Countries, nay scarce from the smoke of their own fires, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves fit Judges of the labour of others, as competent Judges as <hi>Midas</hi> was of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Musick.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Reason I shall offer is, That the way and means to discover the Nature of Minerals, is not onely difficult and dangerous, but in it self is so sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, base and troublesome, that the most men of parts, will hardly adventure themselves into the Pits or Shafts where Ores are usually gotten; nor can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to stay there so long, that they can rightly inform themselves of any thing that may be satisfactory to their Inquiries. And the Miners or Workmen (for the most part) being but people of the most indigent sort, and such as whose knowledge and aims reach no higher then to get a poor living by that slavish Labour, regard to inform themselves of no more then what may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to such a poor and servile kind of living; by which means they are little able to give any learned
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102655:18"/>
man satisfaction to those necessary Inquiries that might tend to enable him to judge rightly of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things in that subterraneous Kingdom. And to this you may add, That the Miners (or <hi>Berg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> as the Germans call them) have as well as the School-men, Logicians, nay, Mariners, and other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, their peculiar Idiom or Dialect, which none but themselves, or those that have long conversed with them, are able to understand; it being for the most part like Heathen Greek, or terms of Conjuring to others: and therefore no marvel if this skill have had no greater progress.</p>
               <p>Now for the small progress that is made in Mineral things, either to profit or knowledge, within His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Dominions of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> is not because they do not abound with diverse sorts, both of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and Minerals; though according to the Vulgar opinion, they lying so far in Northern Latitude, might be thought not to yield any great store; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly imagined that the Southern Climates are most fertile of them; but some other special rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons we shall shew anon. For it plainly appeareth by the learned Antiquary <hi>Camden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Camden Brit. p. 148.</note> that <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire</hi> have from Ages long ago abounded with most excellent Ore of Tin, which hath stored a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> with that Metal, accounted ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the best in the World, except that of <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> or <hi>Villacum.</hi> For speaking of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> he saith, <hi>Stannum enim non sine uberrimo fructu,</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102655:19"/>
Sir <hi>Bevis Bulmer</hi> got good store of Silver Ore, that held about 67 pound <hi>per</hi> Tun, as <hi>Walter Basby</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Essay or Test-Master informed me, who was a person of at least 76 years of age, and had (as an expert Artist) been in the time of King <hi>Iames</hi> sent to the Emperour of <hi>Russia</hi> to setle the standard of his Coin: where he remaining divers years, and going down to the Borders of <hi>Tartaria</hi> to view the Mines there, was taken prisoner by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the <hi>Russian</hi> Emperour, and sent over into <hi>England.</hi> Where after about the year 1655. he was again brought down with some <hi>Londoners,</hi> that then had a Patent for Mines. But they being men neither of free purses to follow such a Work, nor of skill or government fit to manage such an Enterprise, they at last deserted the poor old man, whom I entertained for three quarters of a year, and got some of the Ore pick'd forth of the old Rubbish of the Works that Sir <hi>Bevis Bulmer</hi> had left (with whom the said old Mr. <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The other place was within the Township of <hi>Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington</hi> in the Parish of <hi>Gisburn,</hi>

And while the said old <hi>Basby</hi> was with me, I procured some of the said Ore that had been formerly left, of which (I looking on) he made several trials, and I am sure that I was not imposed upon by him, nor deceived, but that it yielded in the Tun about 26 pounds. And since that time there hath been good store of Lead Ore gotten in the same place: but by all the interest and means that I could use, I could never get from the Workmen any such Ore as had been formerly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there; so cunning are the Miners, that if they find any Vein of Ore that may contain so much of Silver as would make it a Mine Royal, they will not let it be known, but presently beat it, and mix it with their softer Ore, pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As also I can shew the most several sorts of Ore of most Metals (except Gold:) besides great diversitie of other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, Stones, and Earth, some known, and some not known, whereby it may sufficiently appear that it is not want of Minerals or Metals in his Majesties Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, that hath hindred the growth of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but some other reasons, which we shall now shew.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The end that commonly men aim at in digging for Minerals and Metals, is gain and profit: and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive cause that moves them to that end, is generally Poverty, Want, Indigency, and consequently Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. Now the most part, if not all of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Subjects of <hi>Great Britain</hi> having wherewithal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102655:20"/>
to get a comfortable and sufficient lively-hood, as by Pasturage, Tillage, Professions, Arts, Trades, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, have no such necessity put upon them as to seek for a sustentation by such slavish and drudgery Work, as men must undergo that work in those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and darksom undertakings, as is necessarily performed in the Mines: and therefore it is clear, that in His Majesties Dominions, few will undergo such servitude, that have a better means to live upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another reason is, the small incouragement that Undertakers, or Workmen have in our Nation, to proceed to undergo such pains and hazards, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily they both must run that meddle with such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For if the Mines be Royal, then for the most part, they are carelesly followed, as too much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath often verified: and if they belong to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Lords, then the conditions are for the most part so hard, that the Undertakers and Workmen can get little profit by them, which causeth them often to be deserted and left. For it is usual with the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that if they can hear of another place where they may find better Wages, both to leave the Work and their Masters. And often it hapneth that either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Lords are at variance about the same Mine, or that divers pretend several Grants, that while they are trying their titles, the Work is neglected, and the Workmen betake themselves to some other Work. Or that where a Mine is discovered, that may lessen the price of the Mineral or Metal that another gets; the Workmen of the one is hired away by the other, or some other sinister means used betwixt them; as often is the overthrow of the one or other, if not of both:<note place="margin">

Another is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hist.</hi> 4.</note> that Sir <hi>Richard Houghton,</hi> had set up a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable Mine of Allom, near unto <hi>Houghton Tower</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Blackburn,</hi> within these very few years, where great store of very good Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom was made and sold; but whether some persons that had Works of the same nature in other places, found that the store gotten there, would bring down the price of that commodity; as it had all about near unto those parts; or for what other cause I know not, a contention was raised against him about the same Mine, so that he was either compounded with, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise forced to give it over; so that it is now quite left, to the loss of the Nation in general, and to the damage of many a poor man in particular, that got their living by working there.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third reason is, The common Disease or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the English Nation, that are accustomed too much to dote upon foreign Commodities, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Wares; which makes them negligent in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into, or improving their own native commodities, and such things as their own Country yields.

               <head>CHAP. II. Of those Authors that have treated of Metals and Minerals.</head>
               <p>IF the Authors that have written of the Mineral Kingdom were to be considered according to their number and multitude, then a man would think that this kind of Learning had already attained its height and Zenith. But if we come to ballance them by their substance and weight, we shall find them for the most part but light, and their writings to contain very much Chaff, and but a little Corn. For a great many of them have framed large Volumes of this knowledge, and the other parts of Nature, which had no other foundation to stand upon, but onely the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fansies of their own brains; others were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102655:22"/>
onely Transcribers of what others had written before them, but had little or no further experience, and so onely added to the bulk of those kind of Writings, but not at all to the substance or matter. Others that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally knew something in this occult Science, yet delivered their knowledge so darkly, that few were thereby instructed or bettered; and some few were painful and experienced men in these matters, and did as freely communicate their knowledge. And therefore amongst so great a multitude and variety, that the Reader may in some sort receive satisfaction, and know by which of them he is most like to profit, we shall propose some few (for it would be endless to enumerate all) and those we shall rank into these three orders: 1. Speculative Authors. 2. Mystical Writers, or Chymists. 3. The Authors that were experimental Observators.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By Speculative Writers I understand such, who by their deep contemplations, notions, and working of their brains, thought they had catched Nature in a Net, and so kept her, that they were able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all her operations, bot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hid and open, and so framed large Volumes of the whole operation of Nature, as though they had been skilled in all things, when the least individual may afford matter to stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and baffle the greatest of Philosophers, of which we shall name some, not in the due order of the times they lived in, but as they occur to our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We shall first begin with the Graecians, who though they were accounted the great Masters in all kind of Learning, yet hath there flowed down to us but little scantlings of this kind of knowledge. For
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102655:22"/>
                  <hi>Plato,</hi> one of the most knowing amongst them, in all his Works (which are pretty large) I do meet with little concerning Metals and Minerals, except some little where he speaketh of their generation; which we shall have occasion to mention hereafter; for he was more frequent in confuting the Opinions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then in asserting his own; and rather adhered to dubitation then to positive affirmation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for <hi>Aristotle</hi> accounted the Prince of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and one who would seem to be (almost) igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of nothing, yet what he hath written in this kind of Learning, is but in general; and far short from giving satisfaction to searching spirits, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the particulars of Mineral knowledge, and that which in general is handled by him concerning their generations, is not received by the most learned, nor will hold good with Experiment and Observation. And therefore I cannot but mind the Reader of that ingenious Confession of <hi>Zabarell</hi> concerning <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s writing of Minerals;<note place="margin">Jac. Zabar. l. 1. c. 30. p. 84.</note> where he saith, <hi>Non sum enim in eo communi errore, ut putem necesse esse Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelem ita perfectam tradidisse naturalem Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiam, ut nihil quod ab humano ingenio inveniri, aut cognosci queat, praetermissum ab eo potuerit.</hi>
                  <q>For I am not in that common error, that I should think that it is needful that <hi>Aristotle</hi> should have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed natural Philosophy so perfect, that nothing which can be invented, or known by the wit of man, was praetermitted by him.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> a most famous Physician, yet in all those Works that have come down to our Age, there is little or no mention made of Minerals or Metals, so that we cannot understand what his knowledge
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102655:23"/>
was in these things.<note place="margin">Gal. de Comp. Med. lib. 3. p. 1162. Id. lib. De Antidot. pag. 1280.</note> And as for <hi>Galen,</hi> though he were a most learned and laborious person that spared no pains to come to the knowledge and attainment of good Medicaments; for it seems that yearly forth of every Nation, he took care to have the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Medicaments brought unto him: as also for the same cause that he travelled into <hi>Syria, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Lemnos,</hi> and left a learned Piece behind him, of the nature of Simple Medicines; wherein he describeth the nature of many Minerals, as to their use in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, and did know divers that were artificially pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; yet for any deep knowledge that he had in the generation and production of them,<note place="margin">Id de Simp.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> an ancient and learned Greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, writ six Books, <hi>De re Medica.</hi> Upon which <hi>Matthiolus</hi> hath made a large and learned Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: in the fifth of which there are very good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of Metals and Minerals, and their Vertues; by which a diligent and heedful Reader may gain much worthy knowledge, and especially by those clear expositions that the laborious Commentator hath made upon the Text. Yet it is to be noted that the Author <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> had been more conversant in the Refining Shops then in the Mines, as speaking but little of the generation of Metals in the bowels of the Earth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I must by no means omit <hi>C. Plinius Secundus,</hi> who collected and writ a Book which he calls his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural History</hi>; a stupendious and laborious Piece,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102655:23"/>
where in the 33. and 34. Book, he treateth of Metals and Minerals, according to what it seems he had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the Ancients; and declareth many nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of them, hardly elsewhere to be found in any that preceded him; and may yield singular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to an heedful Reader. Yet are not the things he treateth of so clear, but that later Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have discovered divers defects in them (if not errors) which our search and industry ought rather to amend and perfect, then to censure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As for the numerous, and almost innumerable rabble of the School-men, Expositors, Commentators, and followers of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> they have all of them (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in some small trivial points) danced after his Pipe, and added little or nothing of new discovery, but rested satisfied in following his tract. And for <hi>Fuchsius, Brasavolus, Baccius,</hi> and such like, they have not much deviated from the rest; though in their Writings there be some things worthy of note, and may much better the understandings of such as be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, if they take care to try before they trust, and not to take every thing for a truth that they may find in them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I cannot but rank <hi>Hieronymus Cardanus</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> together; who (excepting their niceties, quibbles,<note place="margin">Encyclop. Phys. par. 4. p. 487.</note> and disputes) have many things in them that may conduce to the improvement of this kind of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: though neither of them, in my judgment, have shewed any great solidity gained by experience or observation. Onely I shall not forget <hi>Iohannes Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus Alstedius,</hi> in that little Piece of his of <hi>the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdom</hi>; which, both for method and matter,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102655:24"/>
may serve for an Introduction to a Learner or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner. I cannot but here also remember, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Book <hi>De Metallicis,</hi> set forth by <hi>Andreas Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salpinus,</hi> because it is a pretty compendious Piece, comprehending most Metals and Minerals that were then known; and seems to be a good Collection of what had been formerly written in the common way; though it have little of later Observations in it; nor tasts not much of experience or trial.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Jesuite <hi>Bernardus Caesius</hi> writ a Volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Piece of Minerologie, or Natural Philosophy; wherein, though he expatiated too far to fetch in all things that might seem any way of kinred to that kind of knowledge; and that it was but a meer Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and heap stoln from other Authors, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any thing except notions; yet is there something in it (especially concerning the signs of discovering Mines and Ores) that may advantage such a Reader, as either hath the skill, or will take the pains to sever the Tares from the Wheat, and separate the gold from the dross. But I must by no means pass in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that universal Scribler and Rhapsodist, <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Kincherus,</hi> who after a great many huge and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Volumes, did promise the World a Work, by him styled <hi>Mundus Subterraneus,</hi> which put all the Learned into great expectations of some worthy and solid Piece of Mineral knowledge; but, alas! when it appeared, every Reader may soon be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that there is but very little in it, except the Title, that doth answer such conceived expectations, or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill such great promises. For excepting a few Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries sent to the Emperours Officers in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and Answers unto them, there is neither
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102655:24"/>
any solid, or new discovery of any thing material, tending to advance Mineral knowledge; but it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stuffed with Scandals and Lies against <hi>Paracelsus, Arnoldus,</hi> and <hi>Lully,</hi> whose Art of Transmutation or Maturation of Metals he laboureth to prove to be false; of which he knows no more then a blind man doth of Colours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for Mystical Writers or Chymists, I put them in two ranks. 1. Those that knew and writ of Vulgar Chymistry. 2. Those that knew and writ of the Mystical part of Chymistry.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And for the first, I shall onely reckon some few, as <hi>Quercitanus, Mylius, Beguinus, Sala, Faber,</hi> and such like, who though they have written much in the way of preparing Minerals for Medicaments by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry, yet have they done little to the discovery of the Nature and Generation of Metals: but yet some few things are here and there interspersed in their Works, that may be worth the taking notice of, and may be of very considerable use to an intelligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of which, in some places hereafter, we may have occasion to speak.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for <hi>Libanius,</hi> though he would seem very knowing, and a great Chymist, yet it is manifest to all that understand aright, that though he was a great Broyler in <hi>Gebers</hi> Kitchin, yet he never came to enter the Closet of <hi>Philosophick</hi> Secrets: yet hath he (though a bitter and sworn Enemy to <hi>Paracelsus</hi>) gathered some very true and profitable things from the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of other good Authors, which are worthy to be regarded. For it is discretion in every Student and Reader, to chuse the good in any Writer, and to leave that which is bad: for there are few Authors that have not some mixture of both.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:102655:25"/>3. I cannot but commend to the studious of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral knowledge, the <hi>Naturae sanctuarium</hi> of <hi>Henricus Nollius,</hi> who amongst other things, hath methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally comprised the Doctrine of Metals and Minerals; wherein there are many neat and witty things very worthy to be observed. I might here add to these a great number of the like, but these are sufficient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the Mystical Authors that have treated of the Nature and Generation of Metals, though they have written so obscurely, that the darkness of their Writing might deter the most earnest desirers from reading or studying of them: but they must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that, <hi>Difficilia, quae pulchra</hi>; and that, <hi>Dii sua bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na laboribus vend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt</hi>; and that the kernel is not had, but by removing the husk and breaking the shell. And I must assure them, that they above all others have written most truly, and experimentally of the Nature of the Mineral Kingdom, (as perhaps we may shew hereafter) and whosoever shall come truly to know the Nature and Generation of Metals and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, will then understand that they have not written Lies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first those that I shall commend unto the Reader of them that were more ancient, are <hi>Morie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Romanus, Arnoldus de V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lla nova, Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Raymundus Lullius</hi>; these, if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, will give thee a great light and entrance into the knowledge of Metals and Minerals. Neither are our Countrymen, <hi>Roger Bacon, Thomas Norton,</hi> and <hi>George Ripley,</hi> any way inferiour unto them. And to these may be joyned <hi>Rosarius Philosophorum,</hi> and all the Authors contained in the <hi>Musaeum Hermeticum,</hi> to which might be added many others.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:102655:25"/>2. There are none more excellent (especially in declaring the root and seminary power of Metals) then the learned <hi>Bernardus Trevisanus,</hi> who in his Book of Alchymy, and his learned Epistle to <hi>Thomas de Benonia,</hi> doth fully and clearly discover the hidden nature, generation, root, and properties of Metals, so that nothing can be wished for more of an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader; though he must note, <hi>ut perspicuus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paret, it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> profundus delitescit.</hi> To whom I may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the subtile Philosopher <hi>Michael Sendivogius,</hi> who in his <hi>Novum lumen Chymicum,</hi> and his Book <hi>De Sulphure,</hi> hath candidly opened the secrets of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Kingdom; though as he adviseth, he be to be understood, not according to the syllables, but sense; and all things are to be interpreted according to the possibility of Nature. Neither is the acute and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man <hi>Michael Mayerus,</hi> in the most of his Writings of less value and esteem; having in many places un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked those secrets of the Mineral Kingdom, that lay close covered in the Aenigma's and Parables of others; but to be often read, and pondered upon with sober heed, and careful attention.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next (who above all of this sort of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) I do most approve of and commend, is the Frier <hi>Bafilius Valentinus</hi>; who besides his many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Metals and Minerals, and of the rare Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and secrets contained in them, hath written an elaborate Tract of all the particulars that any way may pertain to Minerals. A work so absolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, that I know not any that may justly be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto it. And though it was written in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Tongue, and but lately translated into English; and that he altogether useth the terms of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102655:26"/>
or Miners, which renders it more difficult to be understood; yet he that will learn this knowledge must forbear no pains, but must labour about the Pits and Groves where Metals and Minerals are got, and converse with the Labourers as well as with Books, for else their Terms and Language will not be understood; the want of which, hath caused no small stop to the progress of this knowledge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I come now to that much wronged, though most experienced person, <hi>Theophrastus Paracelsus,</hi> who (notwithstanding the malice of <hi>Erastus</hi> and all his followers) did really understand more of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, generation, and properties of Metals, (which we shall make good in the ensuing Discourse) and of the Art of Medicine, then all those his malignant Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or many hundreds besides: And had taken more pains, and made more dangerous peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even from his Cradle (being brought up under a learned Father, and the most knowing men that <hi>Germany</hi> in that time produced) to attain this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then any other person we know or read of; and doubtless knew and had seen more several Mines, then any one that his Enemies are able to name; as we shall have occasion to shew hereafter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us close up this Class of Authors with that late learned, and deeply experienced person <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Baptista van<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Helmont</hi>; who though he left no Treatise (that ever came to light) that was purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written upon this Subject, yet hath he enriched his Writing with much deep Mineral knowledge. So that it is to me no small wonder, that seeing his Writings are so much read, and studied, that now an <hi>Helmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> seems to overtop a common <hi>Chymist, Paracelsian,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:102655:26"/>
and <hi>Galenist,</hi> that none hath taken the pains to gather up those Pearly drops of Mineral learning, wherewith here and there he hath watered his polite and pithy sheets; unless it be because that the most of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and Readers are drawn, with too longing a desire, to obtain his Arcana's and great Medicines, thereby to purchase profit and honour, that they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard the advancement of the Commonwealth of Mineral knowledge and learning.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third sort of Authors that were mentioned, where those that I termed <hi>Experimental Observators,</hi> as the most of those were that I shall now recite; for either they were such as attended the Mines, or went thither to converse with the Workmen to inform themselves, or bore some Office about those places, or were those that either for curiosities sake, or to enrich their knowledge, did gather together all the Minerals they could, or used the most of all these ways to gain understanding. And therefore I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend these above all the rest before named, to be read and studied of all Officers and men belonging to any Mineral or Metallick Works; and of all young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Beginners that seek after Mineral know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: because these Authors speak not altogether by Opinion, Fansie, and Conjecture; but forth of their own experience, and the experience of those that were conversant about the Mines, and getting of Ore, and purifying and refining of them; and therefore more certain to be relyed upon for Leaders and Teachers. And more, because they have written what they knew, openly and plainly as the Subject would bear; and not in Parables, and Aenigmatical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:102655:27"/>1. The first I shall offer (and not one of the least in worth) is <hi>Georgius Agricola,</hi> a person of great experience and laboriousness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; who being born in a Country (as <hi>Melchior Adams</hi> asserteth) that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fertile of all sorts of Minerals,<note place="margin">Melch. Adam. in vit. Agricol. p. 84.</note> was thereby the better inabled to make a good progress towards the attainment of that kind of knowledge. To which he added industry and diligence; for coming to live in the Valley of <hi>Ioachim,</hi> he was thereby better fitted for such a purpose: and the forenamed Author saith, That what time he had to spare from curing the sick, in attending his health, from his domestick affairs; he bestowed all that partly in inquiring of persons that were skillful in the Metallick Art, partly in reading the Writers, Greek and Latine, who had committed any thing to memory concerning Metals. But when he saw that very few things of that nature were extant, and that more were lost, he determined to write of subterraneous things; that which he had read or learned of such as were skillful in Metallick knowledge, or which he had seen in the Mines, or Work-houses.</p>
               <p>This Author therefore had all those advantages that might enable a man to be sufficiently furnished to write of Mineral knowledge. As first, his reading of what others had left upon Record. Secondly, His learning from those that were experienced in matters belonging to Fossiles and Minerals. Thirdly, That which he had seen and observed, either in the bottom of the Pits and Mines, or in the Work-houses or Shops where the Metals and Minerals were prepared, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and refined; three such advantages as seldom concur to promote the knowledge of one person.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:102655:27"/>2. Another that I shall name, is <hi>Iohannes Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> who giving his mind to this piece of Learning, and living in the Valley of <hi>Ioachim,</hi> where were store of Metals and Minerals; came thereby to be enabled to leave behind him that learned Piece, which he called <hi>Sarepta,</hi> which he writ in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Tongue; it being an Exposition of all those places of holy Scripture, where any mention is made of Metallick matters. A Work of that worth, for declaring experimentally the nature, generation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and decrease, ascension and descension, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and decay, and other properties of Metals, that I know few can equalize it, except <hi>Basilius Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A third is <hi>Iohannes Kentmannus,</hi> who writ an excellent Treatise, which he styled, <hi>A Nomenclature of such Fossiles as were especially found in</hi> Misnia, <hi>and also in other Regions.</hi> A Book that sheweth not onely the Authors learning, but diligence and veracity; he chiefly writing of those things that were to be found in his own Country: and therefore he the easilier might come to the certain knowledg of them.<note place="margin">Melch. Ad. in vir. Jo. Kent. p. 128.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it appeareth that he was most painful, having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Repository furnished (besides many things else) with Gold, Argent Vive, Copper, Metallick Cadmia, Plumbago, Pyrites, <hi>Plumbum nigrum, Cineraeum, &amp; Candidum,</hi> Antimony, Iron, and Steel, that is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly the Ore of all these.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the next place I shall name <hi>Caspar Schwenck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldt,</hi> who writ a Catalogue of the Plants and Fossiles of his own Countrey <hi>Silesia</hi>; a Work by many much commended, (for I have not seen the Book) and is of much affinity with the Authour foregoing. Also
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102655:28"/>
                  <hi>Christophorus Eucelius</hi> writ a Book, <hi>De re Metallica</hi>; wherein there is much of truth shewn, and seems to have proceeded from a candid mind, and was in part the product of his own experience. A Piece for its method and brevity, very fit for a Fresh-man in these studies. <hi>Andrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Soleas</hi> may well also be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, who is exceedingly commended by <hi>Mayerus</hi>; but I shall say the less of it, because I have not had the happiness to peruse it. But <hi>Sebastianus Munster</hi> in his Book of Geography, hath many things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Metals, which are very well worth reading, and a serious consideration. I should have inserted <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel Fallopius</hi> with those of the first rank, but had forgot him; yet must now commend him to the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, as one that hath toyled sore by Arguments to promote Mineral knowledge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I had almost forgot that famous Chymical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician <hi>Martinus Rulandus</hi>; who, besides his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Medical Profession, and his good fortune in curing diseases, being a Master of many rare Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's; hath also taken no small pains to enrich his mind with the knowledge of Minerals and Metals: as his most learned Book, called by him <hi>Lexicon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiae,</hi> may witness. Wherein, besides his great reading in all foregoing Authors that had written of that Subject, he hath manifested extraordinary pains in getting the knowledge of most (if not all) the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ores of Metals and Minerals, that were contained within the large Territories of the German Continent, and the names of the places where they were gotten. A Work truly worthy of eternal commendations, and of that singular use, that no person studious of Mineral knowledge, can well be expert, without the perusal and understanding thereof.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:102655:28"/>6. Lastly, I shall commend unto all diligent inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers into the knowledge of Metals and Minerals, the Writings of that learned Chymist and great Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>Iohannes Agricola,</hi> his two Volumes upon <hi>Hume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Poppius</hi> Book of Antimony; wherein is contained many rare observations about the generation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, that are hardly elsewhere to be found or read. As also those curious pieces concerning Chymical preparations, and the nature and properties of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, written by <hi>Iohannes Pharamundus Rhumelius</hi>: wherein is contained the description of the <hi>primum ens auri,</hi> and of some other rare Minerals that scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any other Author hath named, or made mention of. And though both these Authors were written in the High-Dutch Language, and not yet (that I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand) translated, yet I thought good to mention them, because it may stir up some others (of more abilities then my self) to procure and peruse them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of rendring them into our <hi>English</hi> or the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue.</p>
               <p>To these may be added that Elaborate Piece of <hi>Olaus Wormius</hi> which he calls his <hi>Musaeum</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is not onely contained many rare Ores of Metals and Minerals, but a succinct History of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Subterranean Kingdom.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the generation of Metals, and whether they grow, and have Vegetability, or not.</head>
               <p>IT is the general Opinion, not onely of the Vulgar, but also of most of the Mine-men that I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed withal, (which have been no small number) that Metals do not grow in the Earth, but were all at once created of God; and so have no seminary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to propagate themselves by. Which foolish Conceit the most part of learned men have rejected; nay, even the <hi>Collegium Conimbricense</hi> it self; and therefore it is needless to waste time in the confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
               <p>Now though the whole stream of Mystical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, or Adeptists, have asserted the generation and growth of them; yet have they rather left it as a Principle to be granted, and believed of their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or handled it so darkly, that few have been able thorowly to understand it. And therefore (as a point most material and necessary) we shall labour as much as in us lies, to make it clear, both by reasons, and observations from credible Authors.</p>

So that it is clear, that either Metals have an analogous kind of vegetability in them, or else the Art of transmutation of Metals is false, and all the grounds of the more abstruse Philosophy, without verity.</p>

<q>Our Salt-petre men find, that when they have extracted Salt-petre out of a floor of earth one year, within three or four years after, they find more Salt-petre generated there, and do work it over again. The like is observed in Allom and Copperas.</q>

               <p>It is also common in the Northern parts of <hi>England</hi> to dig up certain sorts of bituminous earth to burn, which is much of their firing where there is want of Wood and Coals, and they commonly call them <hi>Peats,</hi> being digged two or three yards, and sometimes less or more deep, forth of the ground; which places they call <hi>Peat-pits</hi> and <hi>Mosses,</hi> of which they have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And when they have digged some, that there is no more of that sort of bituminous Earth left, they usually leave one depth of a Spade-graft of that Earth, and so cover them with the soil, or first grassie Earth that they cut up, and so leave them for certain time, as twenty or thirty years, and they will be filled, and grow up with the same sort of Earth again. And though it may be said, that the being filled up again is no great matter, because the wind blows dust, and the rain doth bring down mud and sand from the higher places, by which again they are soon filled. Yet this will not solve the business, for what should turn the dust, mud, and sand into that kind of bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Earth, that when they dig there again, they find them as good as before, and as fit for burning; so that doubtless that kind of Earth doth grow, and is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And it is as plain that stones do grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,<note place="margin">Gabr.

small and minute bodies, already framed in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral seminaries, matrixes, or seed-husks) to be brought to perfection. But if they mean meerly by apposition of more to that which was already gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, onely an increase in the bulk, and nothing else, then it is false; for in Vegetables there is a seminal spirit, vapour, or steam, that doth transmute, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similate the juice of every Plant into this or that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, as of Pear into that kind of Plant, a Rose into that kind, and so of the like: and in stones there is a petrifying quality, vapour or steam, that doth turn the matter aggregated, into the nature of this or that stone; as in flint, to flint; in greet, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, to the like. And that the generation of all sorts of those stones we call sand-stones, is such, by some liquor, vapor, or ordor, coagulating, (or as <hi>Avicen</hi> learnedly speaketh) conglutinating the small sandy particles together,<note place="margin">Avic. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. &amp; congl. lapid. in l.

Which may be also noted in our free-stone (which is of a far harder nature, and smoother grain) in the most of the North parts of <hi>England.</hi> So that if Earth renew it self with Salt regenerated; and that bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Earths have their increase, and stones their growth and augmentation, we may well believe that other Minerals and Metals have the like; and from hence <hi>Sendivogius</hi> doth draw this conclusion: <hi>Inde

<q>They have found by experience that the Vein of gold is a living Tree, and that the same by all ways spreadeth and springeth from the root, by the soft pores and passages of the Earth, putteth forth branches, even to the uppermost part of the Earth; and ceaseth not until it discover it self unto the open air: at which time it sheweth forth certain beautiful colours in the stead of flowers, round stones of golden Earth in the stead of fruits, and thin plates in stead of leaves. These are they which are dispersed throughout the whole Island (he is speaking of <hi>Hispaniola</hi>) by the course of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, eruptions of the Springs out of the Mountains, and violent falls of the flouds. For they think such grains are not engendered where they are gathered, especially on the dry land, but otherwise in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. They say that the root of the golden Tree ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to the center of the Earth, and there taketh nourishment of increase: for the deeper that they dig, they find the trunks thereof to be so much the greater, as far as they may follow it, for abundance of water springing in the Mountains. Of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this Tree, they find some as small as a thred, and other as big as a mans finger, according to the largeness or streightness of the rifts and clefts. They have sometimes chanced upon whole Caves, sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and born up as it were with golden pillars, and this in the ways by which the branches ascend: the which being filled with the substance of the trunk

creeping from beneath the branch, maketh it self way by which it may pass out. It is oftentimes divided by encountring with some kind of hard stone; yet is it in other Clifts nourished by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, and virtue of the root.</q>

To ratifie this, and to put it forth of doubt, I shall relate what I my self have found, and now have some pounds of it by me. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after this <hi>Gur</hi> of all persons that I could hear of that wrought in Mines, there could some of them tell me, that often in the sudden breaking of some stone, there would a liquor spurt forth bright and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102655:34"/>
shining, which they regarded not, because they knew no use nor benefit to be made of it, nor knew how to save or keep it. At last, meeting with an ingenious young man, whose Father had all his days been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in working in the Mines of Lead in <hi>Darby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> and he therein also had been trained up from his young years: one whom I had formerly much imployed in seeking and procuring for me, several sorts of Oars, Minerals, Stones, and Earths, wherein I had found him very faithful and diligent; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with him about what liquid juyces or waters he had ever observed in digging in the Mines, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing him in all that I understood of such things, according as I had read in <hi>Paracelsus, Helmont,</hi> or other Writers, he thought the thing might be feasible. So according to my directions, providing himself of some woodden dishes to take with him, it was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long ere he brought me a large quantity, found in a trench; where then he got good store of Lead Ore, such as the Miners account the best for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; that is, such as will most easily run, or melt, and yield the most Lead: the description of which I shall here give as fully as I am able. It was (as he most faithfully affirmed) when he first broke the hard stone in which it was inclosed, some of it especially very thin and liquid, so as he could hardly preserve it; and the other as soft as Butter, and the inmost part of that he brought was as soft as Butter, to my touch and feeling, and the outside more hard; for the longer it lay to the air, the harder it grew. It was of a greyish or whitish colour, and would spread with ones finger upon a table, or smooth piece of wood, as like Butter as could be, but not so fatty, or greasie: and as <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:102655:35"/>
saith, was like unto soft soap, but most of it something harder, for he had brought it near two miles to me, and though he had made haste, yet it had hardened by the air in the way. He also brought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the pieces of the hard grey stone, in whose holes and cavities it lay, and some of it in the midst, little pieces of Lead, bright and pure Ore. So that if a man may give any reasonable conjecture, one would verily imagine that the piece of Lead inclosed in this soft matter, did in continuance of time change, or ripen it into its own Nature; which I will not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively affirm, but commend it to further trial and inquiry, for there had need be many careful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before an Opinion be raised from them. But I remember that the Colliers and those that seek for Coal-mines, do usually before they find the Mine of Coals, find in their boring or other working, such matter as they call Crow-stone, Coal-stone, and Soap-stone; the last of which is a black substance like fat Clay, and will (as the <hi>Gur</hi>) spread like Butter, but will soon harden in the air, into an hard matter that will hardly be cut with a knife, and somewhat harder then the other will do, which I take to be true <hi>Gur</hi>; and this as a common thing I do but onely name, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate the other by: which both makes me more and more admire the skill and knowledge of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> and to wonder at our ignorance in these things.</p>
               <p>An observation agreeable to this (as I conceive) that I have related of mine own experience, is that of <hi>Helmont,</hi> which he gives us thus.

<q>
                     <p>The other two relations I have not met with in Latine Authors, and yet they are both very memorable in themselves, and as pertinent to our purpose. The first I meet with in the Commentary of <hi>Iohannes Valehius</hi> upon the <hi>Klein Baur,</hi> in which that industrious Chymist relates with many circumstances, that at a Mine-town (if I may so English the German Bergstadt) eight miles or leagues distant from <hi>Strasburg,</hi> called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Kirk,</hi> a Workman came to the Overseer and desired imployment; but he telling him that there was not any of the best sort at present for him, added that till he could be preferred to some such, he might in the mean time, to avoid idleness, work in a Grove or Mine-pit thereabouts, which at that time was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle esteemed. This Workman after some weeks la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102655:38"/>
had by a crack appearing in the stone upon a stroke given near the wall, an invitation given him to work his way through; which as soon as he had done, his eyes were saluted by a mighty stone or lump, which stood in the middle of the Cleft (that had a hollow place behind it) upright, and in shew like an armed man; but consisted of pure fine silver having no Vein or Ore by it, or any other addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but stood there free, having onely underfoot something like a burnt matter: and yet this one lump held in weight above 1000 marks, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dutch account makes 500 pound weight of fine silver. From which and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances my Author gathers, that by the warmth of the place, the noble metalline spirits (sulphureous and mercurial) were carried from the neighbouring Galleries or Vaults, through other smaller cracks and Clefts, into that cavity, and there collected as in a close Chamber or Cellar, whereinto when they were gotten, they did in process of time settle into the forementioned pretious mass of Metal.</p>
                     <p>The other German relation is of that great Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, and laborious Chymist, <hi>Iohannes</hi> (not <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>) <hi>Agricola</hi>; who in his Notes upon what <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> hath written of Antimony, relates, that when he was among the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Mines in the deep Groves, he observed that there would often arise in them a warm steam (not of that malignant sort which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Shwadt,</hi> which (says he) is a meer poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and often suffocates the Diggers) which fastned it self to the walls; and that coming again to review it after a couple of days, he discerned that it was all very fast and glistering.

                  <p>For the manner of generation of Minerals, although it be alike in all, yet it differs from the generation of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate bodies, whether animals or vegetables, in this, that having no seed, they have no power, or instinct of producing other individuals, but have their species perpetuated, <hi>per virtutem seu spiritum semini Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logum,</hi> by a spiritual substance proportionable to seed, which is not resident in every individual, as it is in animals and plants, but in their proper wombs.

According to this assertion, there must be two places for the generation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals: the one a matrix where they receive their essence by heat, in form of an exhalation; and from thence they are sent to a second place, to receive their congelation by the coldness of Rocks. And from this matrix come our Mineral waters, and not from the place of congelation.</p>
                  <p>This is the generation of Minerals, according to <hi>Aristotle</hi>; but it is not so clear, but that it leaves many scruples, both concerning the matter and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102655:41"/>
For the matter, it seems not probable that water and earth should make any thing but mud and dirt; for you can expect no more from any thing then is in it, the one is cold and dry, the other cold and moist; and therefore as fit to be the matter of any other thing, as of particular Minerals. And wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereof principally Metals are made to consist, is very unfit to make a malleable and extensible sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, especially being congealed with cold, as we may see in Ice. But some do add a mineral quality to these materials, and that simple water is not the chief matter of Metal, but such as hath imbibed some mineral quality, and so is altered from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of pure water. This assertion doth presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Minerals in the earth before they were bred, otherwise what should breed them at the first, when there was no mineral quality to be imparted to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Again, this mineral quality either gives the water, or the vapour of it the essence of the Mineral; and then it is not the effect of water, but of the mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral quality, or the potential faculty to breed it. If the essence, then this metalline water or vapour, must have the form of the Metal, and so be fusible and mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable. If it have onely the power and potential fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, then the generation is not perfected, but must expect further concoction. This concoction is said to be partly by heat, and partly by cold; if by heat, it must be in the passages of the exhalation, as it is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bowels of the earth. For afterwards, when the exhalation is setled in the stones, the heat is gone. Now if the concoction be perfected before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation be insinuated into the stones, as it must be, if it be like dew, then it is perfect Metal, and neither
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102655:41"/>
is able to penetrate the stones, nor hath any need of the cold of them to perfect the generation. If by cold, it is strange that cold should be made the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal agent in the generation of Metals, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates nothing; neither can heat be the efficient of these generations. Simple qualities can have but simple effects, as heat can but make hot, cold can but cool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they say that cold doth congeal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, because heat doth dissolve them. I answer, the rule is true,<note place="margin">Valesius Sac. Philos. c. 49.</note> if it be rightly applied; as we see Ice which is congealed by cold, is readily dissolved by heat. But the fusion of Metals cannot properly be called a dissolution by heat, because it is neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to water or vapour, as it was before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation by cold; nor is it permanent in that kind of dissolution, although after fusion it should be kept in a greater heat then cold could be which congealed it. For the cold in the bowels of the Earth cannot be so great, as it is upon the superficies of the Earth, seeing it was never observed that any Ice was bred there. Wherefore this dissolution which is by fusion, tends not to the destruction of the Metal, (but doth rather make it more perfect) as it should do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former rule rightly applied. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this dissolution by fusion, doth not argue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation by cold: which being in the passive ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth rather attend the matter then the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of generations: for it is apt to dull and hebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate all faculties and motions in Nature, and so to hinder generations, rather then to further any. It is heat and moisture that further generations, as <hi>Ovid</hi> saith, <hi>Quippe ubi temperiem sumpsere humorque ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorque concipiunt.</hi>

                  <p>There is a seminary spirit of all Minerals in the bowels of the Earth, which meeting with convenient matter, and adjuvant causes, is not idle, but doth proceed to produce Minerals, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, and the matter which it meets withal: which matter it works upon like a ferment, and by its motion procures an actual heat, as an instrument to further its work, which actual heat is increased by the fermentation of the matter. The like we see in making of Malt, where the grains of Barley being moistned with water, the generative spirit in them is dilated, and put in action; and the superfluity of water being removed, which might choke it, and the barley laid up in heaps, the seeds gather heat, which is increased by the contiguity of many grains lying one upon another. In this work Nature's intent is to produce more individuals according to the nature
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102655:42"/>
of the seed, and therefore it shoots forth in spires; but the Artist abuses the intention of Nature, and converts it to his end; that is, to increase the spirits of his Malt.</p>
                  <p>The like we find in Mineral substances, where this spirit or ferment is resident, as in Allom and Copper as Mines; which being broken, exposed, and moistned, will gather an actual heat, and produce much more of those Minerals, then else the Mine would yield; as <hi>Agricola</hi> and <hi>Thurniser</hi> do affirm, and is proved by common experience. The like is generally observed in Mines, as <hi>Agricola, Erastus, Libanius, &amp;c.</hi> do avouch out of the dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Mineral men, who affirm, that in most pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they find their Mines so hot, as they can hardly touch them. Although it is likely that where they work for perfect Minerals, the heat which was in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation whilest they were yet in breeding, is now much abated, the Minerals being now grown to their perfection. And for this heat, we need not call for the help of the Sun, which a little cloud will take away from us; much more the body of the Earth, and Rocks; nor for subterraneal Fire. This inbred heat is sufficient, as may appear also by the Mines of Tin-glass, which being digged, and laid in the moist air, will become very hot. So Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Sublimate being mixed together, will grow so hot as they are not to be touched.<note place="margin">Carer p. 212.</note> If this be so in little quantities, it is likely to be much more in great quantities and huge rocks.

               <p>Thus far this learned Author, whose reasons we shall not censure, nor confute his opinion, which may pass with as much probability as any others; but leave every one to his own liberty in judging. Onely we shall note one thing to the Reader to be considered of; and that is, where he makes Plants to be nourished and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102655:43"/>
augmented by the ingression of nutriment, which fills and inlarges them; but that Minerals are onely aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented externally upon the superficies, by superad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of new matter concocted by the same virtue and spirit into the same species. Of this we shall offer these things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for Plants we take it for a probable truth (though some may look at it as a new fansie and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox) that the true and proper generation of the most (if not of all) Plants, is in the former generant Plant that did produce the seed in its husk or covering; and that the seeds contain in them a Plant of its own kind, as that was of that did produce the seed, though not to be discerned by our senses, nor, perhaps, by the best microscopes, because in many the little Plant contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that husk or covering, is in so extream minute parts, and artificial means not yet found forth, to cause them to open themselves; nor due observations had from time to time as they open and display themselves in their several wombs in the Earth. And that after they are fallen, or cast into fit wombs in the Earth, that the warm and moist vapours, or steams of the Earth, as an external and adjuvant cause, doth soften and dissolve the husk, covering, or shell, and excite and stir up that heat in the seed, or little Plant (which is the true agent and efficient cause of its increase and growth) that before lay as it were idle, and asleep; by which means that little <hi>embrio</hi> doth open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand it self, and receives in by its pores, or cavities of those parts ordered for roots (whether by attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or propulsion of its heat and moisture by the steams of Earth and its saline atoms, I shall not here determine) the fit warm vapours, and assimilates it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102655:44"/>
to its own nature. And as this is (as we conceive) the growth of Plants, though commonly called their generation; so we commend this to be inquired of by all industrious persons, that if Nature (as is most probable) contain in her Cabinet the secret seeds of Minerals, then why may she not, meeting with fit matter and adjuvant causes, have those small semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particles stirred up and put into motion, grow and expand themselves in the manner of Plants, and by taking in new matter grow and increase. This I onely offer as fit to be noted and considered of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other thing that I would note is, That though Plants when young, may receive their nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the matter having ingression by their pores; yet when they are grown older, and their truncks great and hard, it is probable that then their growth is by superaddition of more matter to their outward parts, and assimilating it into their species. For it is generally in the North parts of <hi>England</hi> (especially in old Oaks) that yearly great store of sap ariseth betwixt the bark and the trunck, which afterwards hardens into wood, like unto the other: and if this be a truth, as all our Carpenters, and buyers of Timber affirm, if Metals do but increase by addition of new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the superficies, then in some sort it differs not from the increase of Trees when grown great and old. But if the relation given by <hi>Galen,</hi>

                  </note> and approved of by <hi>Agricola,</hi> be true; that Lead being placed in a moist Cellar or subterranean rooms, where the air is gross and turbid, will be increased both in bulk and weight; then it must probably be by taking in some parts of that gross air, or the mineral particles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, by which it makes protrusion of its parts,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102655:44"/>
and getteth an increase in weight. By all which we may learn to observe:
<list>
                     <item>1. That it may be that the seeds of Metals rising in steams, may sometimes, finding a fit room or vault, setle together, and in time become an hardned and metalline substance.</item>
                     <item>2. Or that other-sometimes those mineral seeds may become setled in some holes and cavities of rocks, in the form of water, or of that thicker substance that the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Gur,</hi> and so in continuance of time grow to be a Metal.</item>
                     <item>3. Or that after they be hardned into a metalline substance, if the place will give leave, may protrude it self further and further (as the roots of Vegetables do in hard Rocks and old Walls) by virtue of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral steams, piercing from the root, through insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pores, or at least may ripen from one degree of perfection to another; as from Lead to Silver, and the like. For my self and divers other ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have observed, that in the late Wars, when many Castles and other old buildings were dismantled or demolished, that the Leads that were taken from off them, would have sold dearer then any other Lead; and I have heard divers persons of credit affirm, that it would yield very considerable quantities of silver, and the longer it had laid, the more. Which (if true) is an evident argument, that either by long lying, the Lead being the softer part, wasted away with the Sun and Weather, and so left more of silver in the same bulk of matter, then the same bulk of Lead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, when newer and fresher; or else that the Silver in the Lead (as all Lead contains some more or less) did maturate some part of the Lead into its own more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102655:45"/>
noble Nature, or got increase from the beams of the Sun, or particle in the Air, or both. And these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hints I onely give, as worthy to be considered of, and inquired after.</item>

               <p>Now we shall come to the other opinion of the causes and manner of the generation of Metals, which is that of the mystical Authors, learned Chymists, and expert Mineralists, which we shall handle fully and at large. And for order sake, we may consider: First the matter, of which they hold they are generated. Secondly, the efficient cause of their generation. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the manner how they are generated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ancient Chymical Philosophers held, that the matter out of which the Metals were generated, were Sulphur and Mercury; but <hi>Basilius Valentinus, Paracelsus,</hi> and the later Chymists have added Salt as a third; which notwithstanding though they seem to make them three in number, and properties, yet they intended but one Homogeneous substance or essence; and the most of them joyned Salt with the Sulphur, so that in effect they held but two. And this Sulphur and Mercury they did not mean of those that are vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, as the most of their adversaries have too grosly mistaken; and therefore it will be necessary in the first place, to clear what they understand by Sulphur, and Mercury, and how those two are first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>

               <p>Now having described their Sulphur and Mercury, and how they are generated, and how they differ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in property, and not in homogeneal essence, which they hold to be the matter of the generation of metals. We shall more distinctly handle it in order, and from what is already said, and to be shewed, deduce their fuller meaning.</p>
               <p>They make the matter of the Minerals threefold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The most remote matter, which they call the first; and this <hi>Nollius</hi> doth call the Aethereal spirit, which doth commix the two elements of Water and Earth, and draws a certain mineral spirit forth of them. And <hi>Trevisan</hi> saith it is the four Elements. <hi>Etenim ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta quatuor aeque sunt ad informationem asini vel bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis apta, ac ad metalla.</hi> For the four Elements are equally fitted for the information of an Ass, or Oxe, as they are for Metals. And <hi>Sendivogius</hi> saith, that the Elements do continually distil down into the centre of the Earth, a ponderous vapour or water, which is again sublimed into divers matrixes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The remote matter they establish to be this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour mixt with the Sulphur that stuck to the Walls, growing into a middle substance like to fat or gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous water.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:102655:47"/>3. The third is the <hi>proxime,</hi> or next matter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and that is this fat and glutinous substance, grown more thick, and may be that which before we have named <hi>Gur</hi>: which <hi>Trevisan</hi> thus excellently defines. <hi>Apprime sciendum materiam primam esse rem ipsam, in quam immediate specifica forma introducitur, uti prima hominis materia, est utrumque viri semen &amp; mulieris.</hi> First of all we are to know, that the first matter (to wit of Metals) is that very thing, into which immediately the specifick form is introduced, as the first matter of a man, is both the seed of the man and woman. And this is it they call their metallick seed, in the nearest power; for after it be conceived and brought to this, it cannot then be changed into any thing, but into some kind of Mineral. From all which, we may note these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the sperm of Metals (to wit in its first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction) is not different from the sperm of other things, to wit, an humid vapour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This metallick seed is not like the animal and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable seed, easily to be known or had; for they say of it:<note place="margin">No. lum Chym. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For there is a nearer place yet, in which these three, Spirit, Soul, and Body, lie hid in one thing, well known, and may with great praise be gotten. He that knoweth exactly this gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den seed, or this magnet, and searcheth throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its properties, he hath then the true root of life, and may attain unto that his heart longeth for. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intreat all true lovers of Mineral Science, and Sons of Art, diligently to inquire after this metallick seed or root, and be assured that it is not an idle <hi>chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera</hi> or dream, but a real and certain truth.</p>
               <p>Sometimes (and perhaps not untruly) they affirm the Metals to be generated of the element of Water; as <hi>Helmont,</hi> who proves not onely that metallick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but also all other Concretes to have their rise from thence, and demonstrateth the immutability of elemental Water, as well as of the homogeneous Mercury of Metals:<note place="margin">Progym.

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:102655:48"/>
There is therefore in Mercury it self (meaning metallick Mercury) as in the Elements, the nearest cause or reason of indestructibility.<note place="margin">Timae. Plat. p. Graec. 488.

And a little after, he speaketh thus of the Water he calleth fusile: <hi>Ex his vero quas aquas fusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les appellavimus, quod ex tenuissimis levissimisque fit densissimum, uniforme, splendidum, flavumque, pretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sissima res est, aurum florescens per petram compactum est.</hi> But of these waters which we call fusile, (or to be melted) gold flowering through the Rock is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, because it is made of most tenuious, most soft (or tender) things, most dense, uniform, splendent, yellow,<note place="margin">Lib. de Miner.

And that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelsus</hi> was of opinion that Metals had for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial cause Water, is manifest; for he saith, <hi>Sic er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go mirabili consilio Deus constituit, ut prima materia naturae esset aqua, mollis, levis, potabilis: &amp; tamen foetus seu fructus ipsius est durus; ut metalla, lapides, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus nihil durius est.</hi> So therefore God hath ordered by a wonderful counsel, that the first matter of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should be Water, soft, gentle, potable.

               <p>And that Water was the matter out of which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and all other mixt bodies were framed, seems not altogether disliked by that honourable and learned person Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi>

Therefore the first life of the metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick seed is in the cup, hole, or little cellar of the place, altogether unknown unto man. But when
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102655:49"/>
the seed doth appear unto light invested, or cloathed, with the liquor, and the Gas hath begun to stain, or corrupt the sulphur of the Water, it is the middle life of the seed; but is the last life when it beginneth to harden.</q>
To this we shall onely add the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Author of the <hi>Arcae Arcani artificiosissimi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertae,</hi> who saith thus.<note place="margin">Theatr. Chym. Vol. 6. p. 305.</note> Which, because it is large, I shall onely give in <hi>English.</hi>
                  <q>Therefore it is to be known, that Nature hath her passages and veins in the Earth, which doth distil Waters, salt, clear and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent. For it is always observed by sight, that in the Pits, or Groves of Metals, sharp and salt Waters do distil down. While therefore those waters do fall downwards, (for all heavy things are carried downwards) there are sulphureous vapours ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the centre of the Earth, that do meet them. Therefore if the waters be saltish, pure and clear, and the sulphureous vapours pure also; and that they embrace one another in their meeting, then a pure Metal is generated; but in defect of purity, an impure Metal: in elaborating of which, Nature spreadeth near, or about a thousand years, before that she can bring it to perfection; which cometh to pass either by reason of the impurity of the salt Mercurial waters, or of the impure sulphureous vapours. When these two do embrace one another, shut up close in the rocky places; then of them a moist, thick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fat vapour doth arise by the operation of natural heat, which taketh its seat where the air cannot come (for else it would fly away) of which vapour then a mucilaginous and unctuous matter is made, which is white like Butter; which <hi>Mathesius</hi> doth call <hi>Gur,</hi> which may be clam'd like Butter; which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102655:50"/>
I (saith this Authour) can also shew in my hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Earth, and forth of the Earth. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Groves do often find this matter which is called <hi>Gur</hi>; but of it nothing can be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, because it is not known what was the intention of Nature in that place; for a Marchasite, as well as a Metal, might equally have been made of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place we come to the efficient cause of their generation; which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his followers have made external, some of them hot, and some of them cold, and some both; vainly holding that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause in natural generations, did not enter the compound, being seduced (as is most probable) by the similitudes taken partly from artificial and manual operations, as the Painter, or Statuary, being the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause of the Picture or Statue, were external and separate from them, after they were wrought and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: Not considering that these, and the like, make no alteration intrinsecally in the compound, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are conversant about the figuring, and altering the dimensions of quantity: partly from humane, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and vegetative generations, wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the male and female to be efficient causes of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and so to be external and separate from the thing generated. Which is merely false, for the male and female are but instrumental, or artificial causes of moving and ejaculating the seeds into the due ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102655:50"/>
was derived, if the matrix be proper, and of due kind for it. And the male and female in this do no more then the husbandman that ploweth and tilleth the earth, and then casteth in the seed, (onely Nature hath prepared and provided seed intrinsecally in the male and female, which the husbandman must have elsewhere provided by Nature for him <hi>ab extra</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no intrinsecal; or efficient cause of its generation or growth; but onely that particle of vital air or <hi>aether</hi> within it. Which being the Faber or <hi>Archaeus,</hi> and excited with the hot and moist vapours in the Earth, or matrix, doth produce its like; or as the Holy Writ words it, gives to every seed its own body.</p>
               <p>But to come to the true efficient cause of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Metals (though what hath been said might suffice) the substance seems to be this. That the Solar particles, celestial spirit, or internal and incombusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sulphur (which is the true fire of Nature) hid in the viscous matter or mercury, and excited a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And all do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that Sulphur is the efficient cause, or father, and Mercury the passive or mother of all Metals.</p>
               <p>Now for the manner of their generations, there hath been so much related in the passages of this Chapter, that we shall but onely add this short collection. That the Water being sharp and salt, and falling down in the subterraneous caverns and passages of the Earth, doth meet with the drie, sulphureous, and warm steams

               <head>CHAP. V. Of the uncertainty of the division of Fossiles, their definitions, or descriptions, and number.</head>
               <p>THe reason why I begin here with the divisions of Fossiles, is, because I mean not to determine, but to propose, and the things being yet so far from being certainly known, that I dare but Sceptically treat of them, and recite what the opinions of Authors are in these particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first, That things may be plain to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as far as we are able to lay them open, by things digged forth of the Earth, commonly called <hi>Fossilia,</hi> we understand all elementated, and perfectly mixt bodies, growing, found, and had either in the bowels of the Earth, or in the superficial parts thereof, brought to the knowledge of our senses by any means whatsoever; thereby not intending subterraneous ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, vegetables, nor any of their parts. Which are
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102655:51"/>
so variously divided by Authors, that a man cannot well tell which of them to pitch upon, as the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but some of the chief of them we shall here recite, and leave the censure to others.</p>
               <p>And first the learned <hi>Wormius</hi> doth thus define <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Fossiles.<note place="margin">Mus. Worm. c. 1. p. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Est autem fossile, corpus perfecte mixtum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animatum, vitae expers, peculiari forma, &amp; virtute se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaria à deo in prima creatione dotatum, ut sibi simile procreare, suamque speciem propagare possit.</hi> But a Fossile is a body perfectly mixt, inanimate, void of life, endowed with a peculiar form, and seminary virtue of God in the first creation, that it might procreate a like to it self, and might propagate its species. And after doth divide them into three sorts. 1. Into mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Minerals; which have a middle nature, as it were betwixt stones and Metals; and of these he maketh four sorts. 1. Earths. 2. Salts. 3. Sulphurs. 4. Bitumens. 2. Into stones, of which he maketh two sorts. 1. Stones less precious. 2. Stones pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. 3. Into Metals, by which (he saith) he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands metallick bodies, meaning as well the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals properly so called, as also those bodies that are of kin or nearness to the Metals. Which I confess to me seemeth as comprehensive a division of Fossiles as any other Author that I have read.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Eucelius</hi> divides them all but into two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sorts,<note place="margin">De re metal. l. 1. c. 1. p. 6.</note> that is to say, 1. Into the greater Minerals, which have their original from Sulphur and Mercury, and that these are all ductible and liquable. 2. Into the middle Minerals, or remote, which are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly metallick bodies, as those that draw their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from a very weak Mercury and Sulphur, or those that consist of <hi>argent vive,</hi> or sulphur alone, as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventaneous
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102655:52"/>
eggs, or a Mole. This division I leave as but defective, and to be censured by others.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. I cannot now but mention the Jesuit <hi>Caesius,</hi> who writ a huge Volume of Minerals, but grounded upon very little experience; in which notwithstanding a curious fansie may find many nice and speculative questions handled, and according to his notions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved. It being the custom of those kind of men to seem ignorant of nothing, when indeed experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally they scarce know any thing.

                  <hi>Agricola,</hi> and others, do divide Fossiles into four kinds; as Stones, Metals, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, and Salts. And others likewise into four, to wit, remarkable Earths, concrete Juices, Stones, and Metals. These and other divisions he sheweth, and seemeth to approve of them all, in these words.
<q>I say that the before-alledged divisions are all useful, for they fitly enough do distribute the whole into its parts, which is the office of a good division. Therefore <hi>Fallopius</hi> and <hi>Raynandus</hi> do rightly commend the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of <hi>Aristotle, Theophrastus, Galen, Avicen,</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi>; and that the said <hi>Fallopius</hi> doth rightly prefer the fourfold division of <hi>Agricola,</hi> into Earths, Juices, Stones, and Metals, as more clear then the rest.<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 2. c. 1. p 141.</note>
                  </q>
And afterwards he forth of <hi>Agricola,</hi> doth enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate six sorts; which, with the rest, I commend to be considered of.</p>

               <p>Now for the definitions and description of what a Metal is, to distinguish it from other Fossiles and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound bodies, we find the Authors as different in their opinions; and therefore the most learned and expert in Mineral knowledge, have for the most part omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, as too nice a difficulty and fruitless specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Paracelsus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. coel. Phil. p. 126.</note> who giveth this; and yet howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, thought of it as good and true as the best of them; who saith,
<q>He that goeth about to know what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are, and from whence they arise; must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that our Metals are no other thing, then the best part and spirit of common stones, that is to say, pitch, grease, fatness, oyl, and stone.

               </p>
               <p>There might be many more definitions, or descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions given of Metals, from many other Authors, but so defective, or imperfect, that I have onely instanced in these, to shew how lame this piece of learning is concerning Metals, that all ingenuous persons may be stirred up to a farther search into the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of them, to help to lead this knowledge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection. And therefore we shall onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion three particulars that may be observed from what hath been spoken before. 1. That if we take a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the sense of the first definition of <hi>Magyrus,</hi> then it may comprehend both those that are strictly called Metals (not excluding common <hi>argent vive</hi> to be one) and those that are also called semi-metals, as Autimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if we take a Metal strictly to be, a perfect mixt, constant and Mineral body, fusible, ductible, or malleable, arising or generated of Sulphur and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and so the special difference of a Metal from all other Minerals to be its abiding the hammer, and <hi>per se,</hi> or of its own nature, without commixture of any other, to endure extension into length and bredth by force. Then quicksilver must be none of them, nor those that are accounted semi-metals, as Antimony, Bismuth, or Tin-glass, and the like; which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves will not extend under the hammer, but with the commixion of some others will easily do it. For they make a semi-metal to be a perfect mixt body, less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102655:54"/>
fusible not ductible <hi>per se,</hi> compounded of a less perfect Mercury and Sulphur then the former. Its difference from other Minerals, to be its metallick colour, and fusion; and from a Metal, that it will not (without mixture of some other) extend under the hammer, but proves brittle and frangible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if a metallick body be taken in the largest sense, then it sometimes comprehends not onely those that are malleable <hi>per se,</hi> but those called semi-me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, that will not extend under the hammer without commixtion of some other, and those other Minerals that some Authors call <hi>Cachimiae &amp; Marchasitae</hi>; of all which we shall have occasion to speak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>In the next place we come to speak of the number of the Metals, which commonly are accounted seven, according to the number of the seven Planets, which we shall let pass, as a thing assumed by Analogy and similitude, more then by certainty and truth; but because they have been most anciently and commonly known more then others, they have got that repute and esteem, which we shall not labour to take from them.</p>
               <p>Concerning this point we may take the judgment of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. do Miner. p. 346.</note> in stead of all; whose experience in Mineral knowledge was inferiour to none; who saith:
<q>But understand further of the generation of Metals, that there is a great number, and a diverse variety of them. For a Metal is that which the fire can tame, and the Workman frame an instrument of; of which are Gold, Silver, Iron, Copper, Lead, Tin. For these are accounted Metals of all men. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, also there are certain other Metals, which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102655:54"/>
are not accounted Metals, either in the Writings or Philosophy of the Ancients, or by the vulgar, and notwithstanding they are Metals. Hitherto doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <hi>Zink, Cobalt,</hi> which are tamed, and forged or stamped by force of the fire; as also certain <hi>Granates</hi> (so used to be called) of which there are many kinds, and these are Metals. But there are many others besides these, that are not yet known unto me: as are many differences in <hi>Marchasites,</hi> in <hi>Bismuths,</hi> in other <hi>Cachimies,</hi> which yield Metals, but not yet known or discovered. For the chief Metals are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, that are more ready, and commodious for use, as Gold, Silver, Iron, Copper, Tin, Lead: The rest are for the most part neglected through a certain slothfulness; neither is there much care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken about their properties. For neither the Smith, nor Artist that worketh in Iron, or Tin, or Copper, regardeth them: and yet they are Metals for other Artificers not yet sprung up; for none labours to learn, except by one way and one Art. And a little after he saith:<note place="margin">Ibid p. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>7.</note> But this Chapter of Metals doth teach that there are six Metals in number known unto me, which also I have reckoned above: to which yet a few more are to be added, to wit, three or four, also known unto me; whose number and species do hereafter follow. But it is of likelihood to me, that yet a great number of them remains behind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. For by the probation or essaying of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, manifold trials or essays do offer themselves, which are of a metallick nature, that is, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily estimated according to the nature of the (known) Metals, but notwithstanding they do not altogether agree with it; that from hence I conjecture that there
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102655:55"/>
remains a great number of Metals undiscovered. For every Mineral may be rightly known and discerned, if it be tried or tested, by a just proof or examination. And to this purpose <hi>Georgius Agricola</hi> tells us, That he would shew them a certain kind of Mineral,<note place="margin">Berman. p. 692, 693.</note> which was in the number of the Metals, but (as it seemed to him) unknown to the Ancients, which the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> called <hi>Bismuth.</hi> And thereupon they reply, Therefore according to thy opinion, there are more then the vulgarly and commonly known seven Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. To which he replies: I judge there are more, for this which even now I told you our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call <hi>Bismuth,</hi> you cannot rightly say it is either white Lead (that is Tin) nor black Lead (that is,<note place="margin">De n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And again he tells us; That there are said to be six Metals in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, distinct in kind, to wit, Gold, Silver, Iron, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Lead, Tin; but that indeed and truth there are more. And that also Quicksilver is a Metal, and that which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Bismuth.</hi> Therefore (he saith) that <hi>Ammonius</hi> had written well, that there are many species of Metals to us unknown.</q>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the signs and discovery of Mines and Ores, both in general and in particular.</head>
               <p>NOw we shall relate the signs of Mines and Ores, as we could promiscuously gather them from the best Authors we have, or could meet withal; and add some few of our own experience and observation. And first take these from <hi>Caesius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Minerol. l. 1. c. 7 p 123. &amp;c.</note> who tells us thus: That they are either found forth by chance, or by Art and search.</p>
               <q>
                  <list>
                     <item>1.
Sometimes Mines are found forth, without the industry of men; as when torrents and great floods do make them bare, as hapned at the Silver Mines at <hi>Friberg.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. By eradicating the Trees that grew over the veins of the Ore, by the force of winds.</item>
                     <item>3.
By the falling out of stones forth of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, by the force of large Showers, Earthquakes, Thunderbolt and Lightning, the rowling down of Snow, or the force of winds.</item>
                     <item>4.
By plowing, or accidental digging; as Gold was found in <hi>Galecia,</hi> as <hi>Iustin</hi> reporteth.</item>
                     <item>5.
By the burning of Woods, as hapned in <hi>Spain,</hi> in shewing Silver Mines, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> writeth.</item>
                     <item>6.
Lastly, Any other force may discover Ores, as the hoof of a Horse (as it is said) at <hi>Gose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laria.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:102655:56"/>Again, they may be discovered by Art, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble signs before digging, or searching.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The heads of Springs and Fountains are to be carefully observed, and their Waters to be tried, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot be far from the Vein, as having their rise or passage near them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The pieces or fragments of Veins are to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that the force of torrents hath laid open; for if they be smooth, it is a sign that the Vein is far off, but if fixed in the Earth, or rough, it is a sign that the Vein is near at hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The site and position of the place is to be noted, for that may be the cause that the Veins are more or less hidden in the Earth, and the pieces thrust far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Frosts sticking to the Grass are to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which commonly are white and hoary, except they which grow over the Veins of Minerals, because they breath forth hot and drie steams, which hinder the concretion of the Frost; therefore where the Grass is moist, and not congealed with the Frost, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grass near the same place is, there the Vein is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably under it, and the Grass short, and of a languid and pale colour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The signs of hidden Veins, are the leaves of Trees, which in the Spring time are livid and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing blewish, the boughs (especially the highest) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with blackness, or some less unnatural colour, and the stock or trunck chinked, all caused by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline vapours.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The tops of Mountains which tend towards the South, and their bottoms towards the North, do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford an Argument of Metals, and especially of silver,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102655:56"/>
and those most abounding which tend directly from the East towards the North.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The colour of the Mountains, Stones, and Earth, is to be regarded, for these do not onely discover Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, but also shew of what sort they are, as a green colour Copper, a black Silver or Gold, a Purple a Fire-stone, or Marchasite, livid and wan Lead and Iron, lurid or very pale Vitriol, Copperas, or such like Juices, ashie and obscure Sulphur.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The smell or odour also may be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the signs of Mines or Ores; as when two stones of the same Mountain are rubbed hard together, if there be Metal, they will greatly smell of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Barren Mountains are also a sign of Metals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the humour is wasted within, and the evil va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours destroy the young Plants and Grass.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The stones or earth being heavier then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; are a certain sign of Metals.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If the stones shine more then ordinary, or be very solid shining but little,<note place="margin">

                  </note> it is a sign of Metals. And if thou flux or melt the stones, thou shalt not onely discover the Metal, but the kind, and quantity of it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Waters afford signs, for if they have any strange smell, or colour, they shew some Metal. The mud and sand in the bottom of Rivers and Brooks, are diligently to be examined; for something in the length of time must needs be washed from the Veins in their passage. And where there are unusual and strange Plants, where they do not thrive, but their truncks are little, leaves and branches withered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are sometimes signs of Metals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:102655:57"/>
                  <note place="margin">Rer. Natur. l. 9. p. 112.</note>To these we may add what <hi>Paracelsus</hi> saith,
<q>That coruscation, or scintillation, is a certain sign of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals that are unripe, and yet in <hi>primo ente</hi>; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as sparkling or fire is carried, so the Veins lie. And that this coruscation, or sparkling of fire, is to be seen in the night, as if Gun-powder were sprinkled in a long line, and then fired; so it goeth along, and shineth, and doth glissen, and glimmer even as Gold or Silver upon the Test or Cupel, when the Lead is separated from it. And if this glimmering shew whitish, it is a sign of white Metals, as Tin, Lead, Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if red, a sign of red Metals, as Copper, and Iron; if yellow, yellow Metals, as Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That this coruscation being thin and subtile, is the best sign; and sheweth subtile, and excellent Metals; and the contrary denoteth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And as long as these glimmerings appear, whether of this or that colour, little or great, so long the Metal is immature, and as yet in <hi>primo ente,</hi> as the sperm of a man in the matrix of the woman. But <hi>Basilius</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Last Will and Test. c. 17. p. 38.</note> Seeing this stuff which this coruscation seizeth on, is found often in a place where no Metals are, therefore it is very deceitful; however com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, and for the most part of a metalline breath.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the signs of Metals, in or after digging, to seek them, take these:</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="1">1.
If the Miners happen into a fat clayish earth, which discovereth a Vein of pure and fresh Metal, it is a very good sign, certainly shewing, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of which it is a Vein, is not far off.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.
If the earth digged up have no Metal in it, but be very fat, and be of a white, black, yellow, red,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102655:57"/>
green, or a bright blue or Azure colour, it is also a good sign of some noble Metal there. For the Mine-men have especially a regard unto noble, neat, and prime colours, as green Earth, or <hi>Chrysocolla, viride aeris, Lazure, Cinnabar, Sandaraca,</hi> red <hi>Arsnick, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripigment, Litharge</hi> of Gold or Silver, &amp;c. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of these doth for the most part shew its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Metal and Mineral. So <hi>viride aeris, Chrysocolla,</hi> Green Earth, do for the most part shew Copper, or a cupreous Metal. So <hi>Lazure,</hi> or white <hi>Arsnick,</hi> or <hi>Litharge</hi> of silver, do for the most part shew the Metal of Copper. So <hi>Cinnabar</hi> and <hi>Sandaraca,</hi> or red <hi>Arsnick,</hi> do sometimes denote Gold, or Silver, or both mixt together. So <hi>Auripigment,</hi> red <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or <hi>Litharge</hi> of Gold, for the most part do po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tend Gold. So where <hi>Chrysocrlla</hi> with <hi>Lazure,</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure</hi> with <hi>Chrysocolla</hi> and <hi>Auripigment,</hi> are found mixed and confounded together, for the most part they shew a most excellent and rich Mineral. Where stones or earth are found of an Iron-like colour they certainly shew an Iron mineral.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.
It is to be noted, that sometimes the <hi>Archaus</hi> of the Earth doth thrust out, or vomit forth, by some hidden passages, from the lower Earth, some Metal; and that is a good sign that the Miners should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, because there is certain hope of a noble metal hid there.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.
<q>Moreover,<note place="margin">Rer. Natur. l. 9. p. 111, 112.</note> If thin leaves of metals like to Talck do stick to the pebles, or stones, it is a good and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sign. Thus far <hi>Paracelsus.</hi>

But the little black Stones, and the rest, do not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from pure Tin, which is melted by blast forth of them; and the best <hi>lapis plumbarius,</hi> or Lead Ore, from which the Lead is melted, differs little from the Metal it self.</p>
                  <p n="2">2,
Then after pure gold, that is, <hi>statim suum,</hi> that which is called rude, or unwrought; whether it be greenish yellow, or yellow, or purple, or black, or red without, and inwardly of a golden colour, it is to be reckoned as a rich Vein, because the gold doth exceed the stone, or earth in weight. Also every Vein of Gold, whereof an 100 pound weight doth contain more then three ounces of Gold, is rich. All the rest of the Veins of gold are to be esteemed as poor ones.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.
Earth, whether drie or moist, sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains gold; but in that which is drie, for the most part there is more, if in the Furnace it give any good sign, or do not want little spangles like cat-silver. These Juices for the most part contain Gold, <hi>caeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum,</hi> or a kind of blue Sand, Azure, Chrysocolla, native Borax, or green Earth, Auripigment native, yellow Arsnick, Orpiment, or Orpine, Sandaraca native, red Arsnick. Also pure or unwrought gold doth sometimes stick or cleave, sometimes less, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more in the sand, gravel, or grittle of flints, little pebles, slates, or cleaving stones and marble. In Fire-stones sometimes it is found, but very rarely.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.
But the richness of a silver Vein is thus discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102655:58"/>
If in 100 <hi>l.</hi> weight of the Ore, there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 3 <hi>l.</hi> weight, it is rich, 'otherwise it is poor, as is that which consists of unwrought silver. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the colour be leaden, red, white, black, ash-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, purple, yellow, liver-coloured, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort; such also sometimes is the Vein of flint, slate, and marble, if much do adhere unto them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Fire-stones, Cadmia, Ore of Brass, Lead Ore, and Ore of Antimony.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.
But in the other sort of Metals, though their Veins may be rich, yet unless they be plentiful also, they are seldom worth labour. But if it happen that any kind of gems or precious stones be discovered, they are diligently to be sought after; as Cements, Marbles, <hi>Lapis Haematites,</hi> Load-stone, which is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually found in the Iron mines; <hi>Smiris,</hi> or as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called by Mechanicks Emery, in Silver mines; the <hi>Lapis Iudaicus,</hi> Trochites, and the like, in Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or elsewhere. Neither ought they to neglect the several sorts of Earth, whether found in the gold, Silver, Copper Mines, or others: nor should they neglect the several concrete, or hardned Juices, found in the metallick passages, or in their proper Mines.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.
If a yellow Earth offer it self, in which the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or shavings of any Metal, pure or unwrought, do appear, it is a good sign: For the Metallick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from whence the shavings are separated, must needs be at hand. But if it offer it self void of all Metallick matter, but be fat, and of a white, green, blewish, or such like colour, the Workmen ought not to give over, so they have the signs spoken of before.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:102655:59"/>7.
But if any drie Earth offer it self to the Miner, which containeth pure and unwrought in it self, it is a good sign, If yellow, red, or black, or any other notable colour, which hath no Metal in it, then it is no bad sign, and <hi>Chrysocolla, Caeruleum, Aerugo, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripigmentum, Sandaraca</hi> being found, are good signs.</p>
                  <p n="8">8.
Also where a subterranean Spring casteth forth some piece of a Metal, we ought to pursue it; for it sheweth that that piece was separated from some greater part of the Metal. Likewise when very thin spangles of some Metal do cleave to the Rock or Stone, they are to be numbred among the good signs. Furthermore, Veins which forthwith do consist partly of flints, partly of clayish and dry earth; if being mixed together with fibres, and descend low into the earth, it is good hope that there is metal.<note place="margin">Vid. Achan. Kirch, Mund. subter. tom. 2. l. 10. p. 180.</note> But if the fibres afterwards appear not, and little or no metallick matter offer it self, they ought not to give over digging.</p>
                  <p n="9">9.
But if a brown, black, horn-like, liver-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed flint appear, for the most part it is a good sign; but white is sometimes good, sometimes not; but the sand or grittle of marble, appearing in the depth of the Vein, is not good. And those sorts of stones that do easily melt in the fire, although they be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, are to be numbred amongst the middle signs, if other good signs appear, they are good; if not, they are no good signs. And they are of some hope which above and below (or at the covering or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom) have a flint or marble, and in the midst clayish earth, &amp;c. In like manner, where the top (or as our Miners call it, Cooping) and the bottom have
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102655:59"/>
an Iron-like earth, and in the midst fat and clammy earth. So where the top and the bottom have that which the Miners call <hi>Armaturam</hi> (the harness or arming) and in the midst black earth, or like to burnt earth, these yield some hope.</p>
                  <p n="10">10.
But the proper sign of Gold, is <hi>Auripigment,</hi> natural yellow <hi>Orpiment,</hi> or <hi>Orpin.</hi> Of Silver, <hi>Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Cinereum, Bismuth,</hi> and <hi>Antimony</hi>: of <hi>Copper,</hi> natural <hi>Verdegrease,</hi> pared off from brass stones, out of which it groweth; <hi>Melanteria,</hi> or black Earth; <hi>Sory,</hi> a poisonous black pory Earth; <hi>Chalcitis,</hi> the Copper stone, or red Vitriol; <hi>Misy,</hi> a kind of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol now not known; <hi>Altramentum sutorium,</hi> green Vitriol, Shoo-makers black. Of Tin, the pure black stones, out of which the Metal is melted, and things digged up like the spume or froth of silver. Of Iron, <hi>Ferrugo,</hi> Iron stone. The common sign of Gold and Copper, is <hi>Chrysocolla,</hi> green Earth, or native Borax, <hi>Caeruleum, Azure,</hi> or blue sand. Of Silver and Lead, <hi>Plumbago Fossilis,</hi> Lead Ore, in which is always silver, less or more; and is also called <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, Molybdena,</hi> and <hi>Lapis plumbarius.</hi> But although the Miners do rightly call <hi>Plumbum cinereum</hi> Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth, Wismuth, or Counterfein, the cover (or coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping) of Silver; and that the Copper fire-stone, or <hi>pyrites aerosus</hi> be the common parent of <hi>Atramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But a good sign of Silver, are little black pebles, forth of which Tin is drawn, especially when the intervein is made of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102655:60"/>
such like. And thus far this noble Authour.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The signs to discover where Metals are that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Miners have informed me of, and that I have observed in these Northern parts, where the Ores that they either get or look for, are commonly Lead, and but rarely any Silver Ore, are these.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Hills and Mountains from whence they are digged, are for the most part barren and squalid, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but little Grass, and that short, dried, and (as it were) withered; few Trees, Plants, or Shrubs, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them; and those they have, little, dwarfish, livid, and ill-coloured, very rocky and stony at the tops, with earths of sundry colours, but most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly something reddish.</item>
                  <item>2. The stones that by the Land-flouds and Torrents are brought down into the Vallies, are very ponderous, flinty, grayish, or horn-coloured, and oftentimes pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and fragments of <hi>Cauk,</hi> and pure white, and other coloured <hi>Sparr</hi>; and good store of small grey, black and white <hi>Silices,</hi> or pebles, which are found to be good, and for the most part certain signs that there is metalline Ore in those Hills or Mountains.</item>
                  <item>3. There are commonly found upon the tops of the Hills where they find Lead Ore, many sorts of fire-stones, or <hi>pyritae</hi>; which rubbed hard or smitten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forcibly, do not onely give sparks of fire, but smell most strongly of Brimstone, whether they yield fire or not. And sometimes store of little yellowish and reddish stones, and these prove very good signs of Metals.</item>
                  <item>4. Sometimes there is found fragments of very bright and shining marchasites of a golden colour, or like Copper in shew, wrought forth of the Hills by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102655:60"/>
Rains, and Flouds, that together with some other signs named before, give great incouragement to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and seldom deceive them.</item>
                  <item>5. Some expert Workmen (which I my self have divers times seriously marked, and sought for) have found in the chinks and holes of the stones washed from the tops or sides of Mountains; a blue kind of Sand or Earth, being (as I conjecture) the native <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleum</hi> or Azure; as also a pure green Earth or Sand, which might be the natural <hi>aerugo</hi> or <hi>verdegrease</hi> that <hi>Agricola</hi> mentions: and where these were found they always proved good signs.</item>
                  <item>6. But the most certain sign that all our Miners relie upon, is to find some fragments of Ore washed down from the sides of the Hills; or by careful walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the tops of the Mountains (whose barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and some other such like signs, have moved them to search) and prying into the clifts, irruptions, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises of the Rocks. And this they find never to fail them.</item>
                  <item>7. After they have digged, the most of the signs that doth encourage them, is grey or blewish stones, flints, or slates, red or yellow clay or earth, or that which appears of many colours; but especially to find some pieces of such Ore as they call loose and shaken Ore; or some small twigs of a Vein of Ore, for then they think that there cannot but be greater store, if they can find the right way to it.</item>
                  <item>8. I have specially noted that near where Metals are (especially near <hi>Brunghill</hi> Moor, where Silver Ore was formerly gotten, and at a place called the <hi>Syks</hi>) there the Stones being for the most part of a greyish, or blewish colour, are very thick interspersed with
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102655:61"/>
the small Atoms, or grains of Metal, as little as small Pin heads, or almost Needle points, and will excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly shine and glister upon a Sun-shine day, and also are very ponderous.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now to conclude this Chapter, I shall onely mind the Reader of a remarkable passage of <hi>Paracelsus</hi>; which though twice repeated in his Works, and (as I judge) of great weight, and full of honest and plain instruction to a Mineralist, yet hath been little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by any one that ever I yet conversed withal; which is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <note place="margin">Coel Philos. p. 126.</note>Whosoever therefore doth search after Minerals, it is fit that he be endowed with such reason and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that he have not a regard alone to vulgar and known Metals, which are found only in the depths of Mountains. For very often such a Mineral is found in the very superficies of the earth, that no such, or none so good is found in the hidden deeps.<note place="margin">Id. de contract. Tract. 2 p. 119.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every stone that comes into our view, whether it be great or little, whether it be a small peble, or a whole stone, is most diligently to be looked into, and to weigh the nature and property of it, with an exact examination. For many times a vile flint or peble, contemn'd and thrown away, is better then any Cow. For here the dominion of Heaven pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails. And all over earth, dust, or sand is offered, which hath with it much of Gold, or Silver, which thou shalt mark and take notice of.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It may be perhaps here expected that I should say somthing of the <hi>Virgula divinatoria,</hi> as by many judged to be a sure way to discover where the Ores of Metals lie; of which I find that some of our credulous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have a great opinion but none of them that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102655:61"/>
ever I could meet withal, had made any certain or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act trial of, so as to verifie the truth of the experiment. Neither indeed is it much used by any in these Northern parts. But yet notwithstanding I shall give you the opinion of some of the best Authors, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the certainty of it, and for the verity of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first <hi>Agricola,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De re metal. l. 2. p. 26, 27, 28</note> a very sober person, far from superstition, and doubtless that had seen the fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of it, and that it hapned to shew where Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals lay but rarely; and after a long discourse about the verity or falshood of it (to whom I refer my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) doth conclude against charms and incantations used about it, but that the natural use of it may be allowed, in these words:
<q>
                     <hi>Virgula igitur, in invenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis venis, viro bono, gravique usui esse potest.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rod for discovering of Veins of Metals, may be used by a good and grave man. But not in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the figure, nor using charms: <hi>non enim valet virgulae figura, sed incantamenta carminum.</hi> For the figure, of the rod prevails not, but the charms.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The second I shall name,<note place="margin">De signat. rer. l. 9. p. 112.</note> is <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> one whom his enemies would brand with most gross su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, and favouring or practising of unlawful and cheating Magick: as commonly all that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Magick that is practised, and counted Diabolical, is but the cheats of crafty and cunning Knaves; or as <hi>Cardan</hi> said, <hi>Carnales Daemones, ipsis daemonibus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidiores.</hi> Incarnate Devils, more cunning then the Devil himself. He (I say) doth so clearly, plainly and honestly disclaim all superstition, charms, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, as none can do more; and also confesseth the deceitfulness of the use of this Divinatory rod, in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102655:62"/>
these words; which for brevity I give in <hi>English.</hi>
                  <q>Therefore care is sedulously to be taken, that ye suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not your selves to be seduced by the Divinations of uncertain Arts. For they are vain and frivolous, especially the Divinatory rods, which have deceived many Miners. For if they once shew any thing rightly, they on the contrary deceive ten times. In like manner, we are not at all to trust to other frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent signs of the Devil, which are done and appear against Nature upon the night, and at inconvenient time, as Apparitions, Visions, and the like.</q>
And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he saith;<note place="margin">Philos. Occult. p 490.</note> For the Divinatory rod is fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; as also the other Visions in Glasses, and Crystals.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The great <hi>Kircherus</hi> doth reject it, and that upon his own trial,<note place="margin">Mund. Subter. Tom. 2. l. 10. Sect. 2. p. 180.</note> in these words:
<q>
                     <hi>Cente ego saepius hujus rei supra metallica corpora auri &amp; argenti, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentum sumens, semper spe mea frustratus sum.</hi> Certainly I very oft making an experiment of this thing upon the metallick bodies of Gold and Silver, was always frustrated of my hope. And concludeth, <hi>Atque luculenter adverti manifestam esse non daemenis, sed virgam tractantis illusionem.</hi> But I have clearly observed, that the manifest illusion is not of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but of him that handleth the rod.</q>
From whence observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there have been, and are many things that are performed by true natural means, though hid, and secret; as also by sleight, nimbleness, and cunning, that wiser heads, and cunninger wits, have used charms, spells, strange words, or incantations to, thereby to keep them veiled from the Vulgar, and to deceive others. Which hath occasioned many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and therefore not to be used by an honest

and conscientious Christian;<note place="margin">Vid. Rog. Bac. de mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. pot. art. &amp; natur.</note> but we are carefully to mark what is natural Magick, which is both lawful and laudable, what may be done by Art, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten strange and wonderful, and what is done by Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical means, if it be a truth that there is any such matter; of which the most learned do not cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly doubt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in trying such nice experiments as this, there had need be extraordinary care, and caution, both in time, and in every minute circumstance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and though one should often miss about it, it is not safe to conclude generally, and negatively: for an experiment (especially when it depends upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more then Art) may fail at some times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for peculiar reasons; and yet when all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances necessary and suitable are added, may prove effectual: and therefore notwithstanding the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and <hi>Agricola,</hi> it may be doubted, whether their trials were accompanied with all the exact circumstances that were requisite for such a matter, for we know they were men, and might err; and it is too manifest, that in many things they did err, and it is the common frailty, that no man, as meer man, hath been priviledged from.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For <hi>Kirchers</hi> trials often made with the rod up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the metallick bodies of gold and silver, which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose were the Ores of those Metals, he doth not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what kind of wood his rod was; or whether he had tried with rods of all those several woods that he nameth; which if not, he left it short, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not safely. Again, the great question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if the rod will move when it is over the veins of Metals, that it will do so at any distance, which is not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102655:63"/>
probable to be supposed, for the Loadstone will no work beyond the sphere of its activity, and therefore there may be great store of Metals in the Mountain where it is used; and yet they not lying near enough the superficies of the earth, may frustrate its effects, though if they had been within the compass of its vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it may be that it would have shewed them. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the great <hi>Quaery</hi> may be, that it will discover Mines at some times and degrees of their concoction, when they send forth strong steams, but not when they send forth little or none. And much may be in the manner and skill of using the rod.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">A discovery of subterranean treasure, p. 11.12.</note>1. Now first for those that affirm the experiment of the rod to be true, I shall give what Mr. <hi>Gabriel Platte</hi> delivereth us upon his own trial, who saith:
<q>The operation with the <hi>Virgula Divina,</hi> is thus to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: some observe a set day and hour, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain words and ceremonies at the cutting up of the same, which I have found to be little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Thus I wrought about Midsummer in a calm morning, I cut up a rod of Hasel, all of the same Springs growth, almost a yard long; then I tied it to my staff, in the middle with a strong thred, so that it did hang even, like the beam of a ballance: thus I carried it up and down the Mountains where Lead grew, and before Noon it guided me to the orifice of a Lead Mine, which I tried, having one with me with an hack of Iron and a Spade, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two hours we found a vein of Lead Ore; within less then a foot of the Grass. The signs that it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is to bow down the root end towards the Earth, as though it would grow there, near unto the orifice of a Mine. When you see it do so, you must carry it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102655:63"/>
round about the place, to see that it turneth in the string still to the place, on which side soever you stand.</q>
The like Story to this I have seen in an unnamed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but shall here omit it, because I know not of what credit he was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second I shall give you is,<note place="margin">Theatr. Chym. Vol. 4. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>71.</note> from the Author of the <hi>Nova disquisitio de Helia artista</hi>; who affirms it of his own knowledge thus, which I give you in <hi>English.</hi>
                  <q>Let a two-forked rod be cut of one years growth, of Hasel or of Oak, whose Forks or two twigs must be equal, and without fault. Some think it ought to be cut down before the Sun rise, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Moon increasing, and that above all about the day of the <hi>Annunciation of Mary.</hi> But we observed none of these. This being done, let the two ends be taken into the opposite hands, the fingers compressed upwards towards Heaven; to wit, that on both sides the ends of the twigs of the divided branch, or fork, may hang forth out of the hands at both the thumbs pressed to the hands. But the root of the forked branch must bend outwardly between the two hands. Which if any having silver buttons fixt to his doublet, that cut end of the root, although with all thine endeavour thou compress the rod in both hands, will make a circle by moving by it self, and will turn it self inwardly towards thy doublet, even to the buttons. But if, having no Metal at all about thee, thou lay silver or gold upon the earth; then holding it fast, and being unwilling, the cut part of the root will bend outwardly, until with a strong motion it smite the Metal.</q>
That there are many exceptions may be made against these two experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is plain; but I shall omit them, because those
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102655:64"/>

                  <note place="margin">Last Will and Test. c. 23.</note>3. <hi>Basilius Valentinus</hi> hath a large discourse about several kinds of rods, but I confess to me so dark, that I dare not adventure to meddle with them, nor to say that I understand any thing of them, onely I shall give you these two passages. First he saith;
<q>Though the stirring of the rod is fallen into abuse among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people; however it is a fundamental way to know, and to bring forth the Metals, if duely and naturally used. Again, he saith: Therefore if you take such a rod, especially of a Hasel, or of a Kray Tree whose sap is full, and beareth a pleasant and sweet fruit; it draweth the same downwards, that the rod must sink and stick; it will suck out the juice when the rod stands right on its passage, this holdeth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove unto this station, where the rod stands still, that place they call the Ores station, standing as streight as a line.</q>
I shall say nothing, but refer all to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; for some have believed too much, and some too little.</p>

               <p>WE shall speak something of these, because the difference, and divers kinds of them are little known or regarded by our common Miners, because they can make no profit of them, nor other use, except as signs to discover where metalline Ores are.

And he doth not say that there are thirty sorts of them, but that of <hi>Marchasites</hi> and <hi>Kachimies</hi> there are about thirty sorts comprehended under those two names, not under the one of them. But his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is thus, both of a <hi>Marchasite</hi> and a <hi>Kachimie</hi>; for speaking of <hi>Marchasites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib de Elem. Aq. Tract. 3. de Miner. p. 280, 281.</note> he saith;
<q>
                     <hi>Nihil autem sunt aliud, quam superfluitas metallorum, hoc est ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria, in metallis abundans, quam metalla intra se fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ac continere, aut in suam formam vertere neque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt.</hi> But <hi>Marchasites</hi> are no other thing then the superfluity of Metals; that is to say, a matter aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Metals, which the Metals cannot bear, or contain within themselves, or change into their own form.</q>
And that a <hi>Kachimy</hi> is of the same sort, to wit, bred of the superfluity of the Metals, he thus declareth:
<q>
                     <hi>Sic ergo Marchasita nihil est aliud, quam superfluitas abundans in prima materia metallorum in Ares, quae per Archaeum separatur in Yliadum, unde postea Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasitae, &amp; Kachimiae generantur triginta circiter ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerum &amp; formarum, quae tamen omnia duobus istis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus comprehenduntur. Quod vero illae multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sunt, nec unius formae, licet ab una materia descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, causa est haec, quia scilicet inaequaliter concurrit trium primorum pondus, uno altero abundantius sese conferente.</hi>

                     <hi>Hinc formas enasci varias necesse est.</hi> So therefore a Marchasite is nothing else, then the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102655:65"/>
superfluity abounding in the first matter of Metals in the Ares, which is separated by the Archaeus into the Yliad; from whence afterwards <hi>Marchasites</hi> and <hi>Cachimies</hi> are generated about thirty of divers sorts and forms; which notwithstanding are all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under these two names. But, that they are manifold, and not of one form, although they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from one matter, the cause is this, because the weight of the three first principles do meet together unequally, one bestowing it self more abundantly then another. From hence of necessity divers forms do arise.</q>
From hence it is plain that <hi>Cachimies</hi> and <hi>Marchasites</hi> are bred and generated of the same matter; to wit, the superfluity of the Metals; and are both about thirty in number, of divers forms and colours.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 28<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </note> And for the difference betwixt them he makes it this:
<q>
                     <hi>Est autem Cachimia fixior, &amp; constantior Marcasita, propter sal fixum ex quo constat.</hi> But a <hi>Cachimy</hi> is more fixed and constant then a <hi>Marchasite,</hi> because of the fixed salt, of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again, he enumerateth eight sorts of <hi>Cachimies</hi> that were known unto him; to wit, <hi>Marchasitae</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasites, <hi>Pyrites</hi> Fire-stones, <hi>Antimonia</hi> Antimony, <hi>Cobalta</hi> Cobalts, <hi>Talka</hi> Talks, <hi>Auripigmenta</hi> Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigments, <hi>Sulphura</hi> Sulphurs, <hi>Arsenicalia</hi> Arsnicks. Now it seems he maketh both <hi>Cachimies</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasites</hi> to be the superfluity of Metals, onely that a <hi>Cachimy</hi> is more fixed then a <hi>Marchasite</hi>; and so see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to make <hi>Cachimia</hi> the Genus to the other eight, and then every <hi>Marchasite</hi> is a <hi>Cachimy,</hi> but not on the contrary; but how this should stand with the rules of Logick, I understand not; nor that Antimony is a

                  <hi>Cachimie,</hi> being in some respects a Metal, or at the least a semi-metal. But it was usual with this Author not onely to neglect, but to despise the Art of Logick; and if he did but certainly know the several sorts of Minerals, and their nature and properties, he little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the ordering of them according to those strict rules. Therefore I should commend this particular to be seriously considered of, and due observation to be made thereof, that what is defective may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and what is amiss may be rectified.</p>

                  <hi>Rulandus</hi> doth num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber six sorts that yield Metal of one sort or another, that are very ponderous and yield sparks of fire. 1. One of a silver colour, that yields silver. 2. One other of almost a golden colour, forth of which cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is melted. 3. One of a full golden colour. 4. One like the Ore of silver or <hi>Galena,</hi> that like the former, holds silver, and some gold. 5. One of an ash-colour that holdeth gold and silver. 6. One of of an Iron-like colour, but what it holds he telleth not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He reckons four of a silver colour, that hold no metal, nor yield any fire: and six others of a golden colour, that have no Metal in them: And other five of a golden colour, that hold no metal, nor yield fire: And ten more of an ash-colour, that hold no metal in them, nor yield fire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He nameth four of other colours, forth of which fire is smitten; and so of divers others that do yield fire, and those that do not yield fire: and numbreth ten several sorts that are fertile of Metal; to which I do refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>They also seem to attribute to every one of the six Metals its proper <hi>Marchasite,</hi> but have not been so free to tell us which were they, nor what they in this sense meant by a <hi>Marchasite.</hi>

he seemeth to grant thus much, that the <hi>primum ens,</hi> or spirit of silver is in a white <hi>Marchasite,</hi> white <hi>Talk,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Zink</hi> and <hi>Cobalt</hi> the spirit of Iron, of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in <hi>Zink, Vitriol,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Zink</hi> or <hi>Bismuth,</hi> &amp;c. the spirit of Tin, and in <hi>Cinnabar</hi> the first <hi>ens</hi> of Quick-silver. But this makes but a slender conjecture; for if every matter, as Stones, Clays, Earths, Juices, Cauk, Sparr, Marble, Plaster Ore, or Quarry, in which the Metals are commonly contained and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, be <hi>Marchasites,</hi> then the Ore of every Metal is its proper <hi>Marchasite.</hi> But we may as roundly say, that the <hi>Lapis Lazuli</hi> is the <hi>Marchasite</hi> of Gold; of Silver, <hi>Talk</hi> or <hi>Galena</hi>; of Lead, <hi>Antimony</hi>; of Tin, <hi>Bismuth</hi>; of Copper, <hi>Zink</hi>; of Iron, the <hi>Load-stone</hi>; of Quick-silver, <hi>Cinnabar.</hi> But of this enough.</p>
               <p>Now I shall say something of <hi>Marchasites</hi> or <hi>Pyritae,</hi> of mine own experience. We have in our Coal-pits in these Northern parts great store of the said <hi>Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi> some of which are of a very bright shining gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den colour, and some of them of a pure bright silver splendor, and some of them so curiously intermixed with diversity of colours, that are very delightful to the Eyes; these are something soft and will not strike fire, but being laid in a cold and moist place, will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve; and then any one may perceive that they hold store of Vitriol; but being fired in a melting pot, do yield store of fumes that smell strongly of Sulphur, by which we may be assured that they contain both Brimstone and Copperas. There are also other sorts found, that are some of them bright, and of a metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line colour, and far more hard then the former, which by striking will yield sparks of fire.</p>
               <p>Also I have divers sorts of them that are very
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102655:67"/>
smooth and shining, as bright as <hi>Flanders</hi> metal, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalcum</hi> or Brass, which is found in the Quarries of Stone, Slate-pits, or where they get flooring-stones for paving of houses, in the clifts betwixt the Stones, but contain no Metal in them, but being fired do smell strongly of Brimstone. Some few I have had that held some little Copper in them, of an hard substance, and not very bright but ponderous; but I have found none that held any Silver, Gold, or any other Metal in them. Many other sorts I have of divers and sundry colours, some of a golden, some of a silver-like, and some of a copper-like, or brass-like colour; some of them found near the Lead Ore, and some of them in their proper Mines, some of them in confused lumps, or interspersed in Stones, Cauk, or Sparr; some tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular, some of them quadrangular, like to the <hi>Ludus</hi> of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> or <hi>Helmont</hi>; some sexangular, and some of them of other figures; but all of them sulphureous, and to be fired away to nothing, but an unprofitable black Earth. One sort there is found in some of our Lead Mines near the Ore, that is ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, black, and glissening; but by several trials I could find no Metal in it, neither any great store of sulphureous fumes; and it is not that which the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> call <hi>Blend,</hi> and our Miners blue <hi>Blind ake</hi>; because that is brighter, more shining, and liker a metallick body. I therefore intreat all Miners to inquire of these particulars.</p>

It is found also in <hi>Philosophia adepta, &amp; naturae thesauro,</hi> that in <hi>rerum natura</hi> there are four sorts of Gold.
1. <hi>Astralish.</hi> 2. <hi>Mineralish.</hi> 3. <hi>Metallish,</hi> 4. <hi>Elementallish.</hi>

<hi>Astralish</hi> is, and is called that very thing which as yet lieth in <hi>primo ente,</hi> and therein is as yet imperfect. <hi>Frater Basilius</hi> calls it, the Star of the Sun, because the stars as yet have their influence and first opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein.

<hi>Aurum metallicum,</hi> or Metallish gold, is that which being freed from its <hi>Schleck</hi> and raw minera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Ore-stuff, and with great force of fire is driven forth of it, and then may be called a pure and clear Metal.
<p n="4">4
<hi>Aurum Elementale,</hi> or Elementalish gold, is any Earth, Mineral, Stone, or the like, wherein the spirit of gold doth lie hid, and may be drawn forth by the <hi>Spagyrick</hi> Art. And he from hence conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that the Astralish gold, according to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and the testimony of all Philosophers, is the best and most profitable of all these four.</p>
               </q>
               <p>From whence we may note, 1. That Mineralish gold, as it lies undrawn from its Ore, Marble, Earth, Sparr, Stone, or the like; is commonly known, and easily to be had, there being divers sorts of gold Ore, of sundry sorts to be gotten from many places.</p>

               <p n="4">4. But the Astralish gold is the great secret, and therefore may be questioned whether it may be found in a liquid and soft form, or hard, or both; and of the former we shall say thus much.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We shall give the testimony of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> and leave it to censure; who saith thus:
<q>The first <hi>ens</hi> is an imperfect compound, predestinated unto some certain end, and corporeal matter. And because it is not perfect, therefore it can alter any body with which it is incorporated, as Mercury, which is like this imperfect <hi>ens,</hi> according to its imperfection. But we speak of the first <hi>ens,</hi> which is perfect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and restore the whole body, as is the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or <hi>ens</hi> of Gold; and that for this cause, by reason it altogether possesseth the spirit of gold, and is most subtile, and far more subtile then the true body of Gold it self. Also from hence it cometh to pass that the first <hi>ens</hi> of Sol or Gold, is penetrable, even as Mercury in Metals; and doth not contain in it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102655:70"/>
self the spirit of Salt, by which it may be coagulated. For the spirit of Salt the first coagulating <hi>ens,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth so great forces, that Gold for the hundred part, is not so potent in its vertues, as the <hi>primum ens</hi> of it is. Further, it is to be known that the first <hi>ens,</hi> that is to say, the first composition of Gold, which as yet remains a liquor not coagulated, doth renew and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store whatsoever it takes; not onely men, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so all Peasts, Fruits, Herbs, and Trees.</q>
From hence we may note these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if this Author be to be credited, then in <hi>rerum natura</hi> there is such a thing as the <hi>primum ens</hi> of Gold, and this as a liquor not coagulated. To the search and enquiry of which, I humbly and heartily intreat all ingenious persons, and Sons of Art, to use their industry, and ultimate endeavour, and not to think it a <hi>Chymical Chimaera.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scept. Chym. p. 360.</note>
For if the quotation of that honourable person Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> (who useth not to cite Authors of small credit or veracity) may be trusted, from <hi>Gerardus</hi> the Physick Professor (a man of great learning and Chymical experience, and whose fidelity is not questioned by any) that <q>at <hi>Anneberg</hi> a blue water was found, where silver was yet in <hi>primo ente,</hi> which coagulated, was reduced into the calx of fixt and good silver.</q>
Then it may be as possible and probable, that the liquor of Gold may likewise be found uncoagulated, especially if we consider that all the Adeptists do seem to acknowledge a twofold way of the generation of Gold; one when the mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and sulphureous steams (of which Metals are bred) being pure before and at their conjunction, do meet with a pure matrix, that hath nothing of impure sulphureous faeculency, nor other earthly or waterish
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102655:70"/>
uncleanness to mix with them, and to pollute them, then pure Gold, and no other imperfect metal is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated: and in this way onely I conceive, that the pure <hi>primum ens auri,</hi> is to be had liquid, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. Another way there seems to be of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Gold, and that is when the mercurial and sulphureous steams, either before, or at their conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are commixt with some impurities, or meet with an impure matrix, or both; then this liquor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first <hi>ens</hi> of Gold, cannot be had; but yet that impure substance containing in it the true seeds and principles of Gold, will in time work it self through the degrees of the imperfect metals into Gold, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's ultimate and finite end; and therefore in some respects (though perhaps not to be found liquid) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it the <hi>primum ens auri,</hi> which I wish may be noted.</p>
               <p>For it is the unanimous consent of all the Adeptists (as we have sufficiently proved before, where we shewed the vegetability of Metals) that Natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to bring all metals to the perfection of Gold, if she had not been hindered by the adventition and mixture of extraneous matter; and so that metals do not specifically differ one from another (as <hi>Erastus</hi> and many other Authors, ignorant of, and unexperienced in the true manner and order of Natures way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Metals) but onely gradually, some of them standing in an intermediate way, and wanting the due height of concoction and maturation. For as <hi>Petrus Bonus Ferrariensis</hi> saith, <hi>Ad aurum reliqua metallae ordinantur tanquam ad finem</hi>: For the seed of all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are but specifically of one nature: for as <hi>Trev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102655:71"/>
Earth, whereof it may generate Metals, but onely a mercurial substance, in which is included its quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sulphur, as its agent. And there is Sulphur and Mercury, equally perfect in the rest of the Metals, as well as in Gold; onely it is in the imperfect Metals infected, or contaminated with terrestrial faeculency, or combustible Sulphur, which are extraneous and adventitious unto it, and not of its homogeneous and constitutive principles. For the Metals become more pure, or impure according to the wombs where they are produced; a pure matrix yields a pure metal; and so on the contrary, for Nature always aims at the most perfect work, though sometimes by accident she may be hindered; and perfection in the inferiour Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals is attained, when either by Nature or Art, they are brought into Gold; the one of which all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Miners know, the demonstration of the other remains with the Adeptists. And to this purpose we may take serious notice of another passage in <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rer. natur. l. 9. p. 113.</note> who saith;
<q>
                     <hi>Primo sciendum est, metallum quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, &amp;c.</hi> First we are to know that every Metal, as long as yet it lies hid in its first being, or <hi>ens,</hi> hath its peculiar stars. So Gold hath the star of the Sun, Silver hath the star of the Moon, &amp;c. But so soon as they are come unto their perfection, and are coagulated into a fixt metallick body, their stars do recede from every one of them, and leaves its body dead. From whence it follows, that all their bodies are from thenceforth dead, and inefficacious; and the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible star of the Metals doth overcome them all, and convert them into its nature, and make them all so to be Astral.</q>
Whereby we may perceive that when the Ore of Lead is from its liquid and soft substance,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102655:71"/>
coagulated into an hard metallick body, then the star of <hi>Saturn</hi> doth leave it, and so of the rest; but it must be understood, that when the star of an imperfect Metal hath left it hardned, that yet the star of ☉ or <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> may operate in it to a greater perfection.</p>
               <p>I may add to this purpose what <hi>Trevisan</hi> saith,<note place="margin">De Alchym. Thea. r. Chym. Vol. 1. p. 754.</note> That vulgar bodies, to wit, Metals perfected by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone in the Mines, are dead, that they cannot bring imperfect bodies to perfection. So that thereby it is granted, that before they were perfected in the Mines, they had life and vegetability. And <hi>Basilius</hi> saith, that therefore all things are found more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the star of the Sun, then in the rest of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, if it be brought to its maturity by the benefit of the fire.</p>

And to make the thing more feasible, he addeth the signs how we may know when it is in <hi>primo ente,</hi> saying:
<q>So verily while it is yet in its first being, it maketh the Trees fruitful, and the Earth fertile, it renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth old Trees that of twenty years have brought forth no fruit. For when the first being of Gold hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hold upon them, or their roots, they begin again to live and flourish as before. And a little after he saith; But where flames, or scintillations have been
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102655:72"/>
seen; it is to be judged, and noted, that a Metal is then made <hi>ex primo ente.</hi>
                  </q>And to confirm this in another place, speaking of coruscations, or scintilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions seen in the night; which he saith 
<q>are certain signs of a latent Metal,<note place="margin">Rer. nat. l. 9. p. 112.</note> that is not yet come to perfect maturity; but as yet in its first being. And that further it is to be known, that as long as those efful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gescences or glimmerings appear, whether great or little, whether of this or that colour; that then that Metal is not yet perfect and ripe in its Mine, but as yet is in its first being, no otherwise then the sperm of a man in the matrix of a woman. Also he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that Gold doth grow <hi>ex primo ente auri,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Renovar. p. 45.</note> from the first being of Gold, to such a form from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Gold, that in touch it is like to red Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and is moved and exalted like Gold.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.
And the more to illustrate this, we may call to mind what we have in this Chapter spoken of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalish Gold,<note place="margin">Rer. nat. l. 8. p. 104.</note>that the steams of Gold may be had in divers Earths and Minerals; as <hi>Paracelsus</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, <q> it may be drawn forth of <hi>Marchasites, Granates, Cachimies, red Talk, Lazure,</hi> and the like, by the degree of sublimation. And further saith: But it is to be noted of this <hi>primum ens,</hi> that it is a fugaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spirit, as yet consisting in volatility, as an Infant lies hid in the womb of the woman; and is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times likened to liquor, sometimes to Alcool, or Atoms.</q>

                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:102655:72"/>2. We may now consider whether this <hi>primum ens auri</hi> may be had in an hard and coagulated form or not. And it appeareth plainly that it may; for the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers that sought after that great secret of Nature and Art, the Physical Tincture, or Grand Elixir, do certainly affirm it. And they, though they writ dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet it was truly that there is such a metallick sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that hath in it the seminal principles of Gold and Silver, in vegetability, which was the onely true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance forth of which they accomplished their great work, both as to transmutation, and the universal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.

From whence we may note, that this Sulphur they speak of, is not a combustible Sulphur; for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim is, that no combustible matter enters their work, but that vivifying and incombustible sulphur that is.

                     <hi>Basilius</hi> saith, having spoken of common Gold, Those that dive deeper in this Art, will meet in the same place with a more easie and better known matter, which almost was named and set down, of an effectual quality. And after he saith, In this known and despicable matter and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral substance, is found a Sulphur and Tincture more effectual, and more worthy then the best Gold can afford which is fluid and open, and its mercurial spirit also; and its mystical salt is free, and open, whose virtues may with less pains in a visible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be drawn from it.</q>

<q>They draw Gold in those parts, after three sorts; or at least I have seen all three used: For either they find Gold in grains, in powder, or in stones. They do call Gold in grains, small morsels of Gold, which they find whole, without mixture of any other Metal, which hath no need of melting or refining in the fire;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102655:75"/>
and they call them Pippins, for that commonly they are like to Pippins, or seeds of Melons, or Pumpions: and that whereof <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Job 18.</note>

To this purpose I my self have seen some grain or sand-gold, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sent forth of <hi>Guinea,</hi> some twenty years ago, to his Sister for a token, that was pure native Gold, and had not felt the force of fire; many of the grains as big as the ordinary pippin of an Apple, and some smaller; and one morsel half as long as my little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and as thick.</p>

                  <q>In the sands of all these Rivers is found great plenty of Gold, which the Inhabitants of the same Island which were with us, gathered in this manner: making holes in the sand with their hands, a cubit deep; and taking up sand with their left hands from the bottom of the same, they picked out grains of Gold with their right hands, without any more Art or cunning; and so delivered it to our men, who affirm that many of them thus gathered, were as big as Tares or Vetches. And I my self saw a mass of rude Gold (that is to say, such as was never molten) like unto such stones as are found in the bottom of Rivers, weighing nine ounces, which <hi>Hoieda</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self found.<note place="margin">Decad. 1. l. 3. p. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Amongst all other there came an old man, bringing with him two Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble stones of Gold, weighing an ounce, desiring to have a Bell for the same. And a little after he saith, Beside this old man, there came also divers other, bringing with them Peble-stones of Gold, weighing ten or twelve drachms, and feared not to confess, that in the place where they gathered that Gold, there were found sometimes stones of Gold, as big as the head of a child.<note place="margin">Decad. 1, l. 4. p. 26.</note> He further saith, There was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain King, which gave them a mass of rude Gold as big as a mans fist, weighing twenty ounces.

Again, he saith of another place:
<q>As the Miners digged the superficial,<note place="margin">Decad. 1. l. 4. p. 29.</note> or uppermost part of the Earth of the Mines, during for the space fo six miles; and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places sifted the same on the drie Land, they found such plenty of Gold, that every hired Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer could easily find every day the weight of three drachms.</q>

               <p>We shall add but one instance more from this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, which though it may seem incredible, yet we shall leave the censure to others.
<q>These regions (he saith,<note place="margin">Decad. 1. l. 10. p. 56.</note> meaning <hi>Hispaniola</hi>) are very large; in the which, in many places, here and there are found sometimes, even in the upper crust of the Earth; and sometimes among the stones, certain round pieces or plates of Gold, sometimes of small quantity, and in some places of great weight: Insomuch that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102655:76"/>
there hath been found round pieces of three hundred pound weight, and one of three thousand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten pound weight, which was sent whole to the King, in that Ship in the which the Governour <hi>Boadilla</hi> was coming home into <hi>Spain</hi>; which Ship was cast away.<note place="margin">Of the West-Indies, p. 190.</note>
                  </q>
And this <hi>Gonzales Ferdinandus Oviedus</hi> seemeth to confirm, saying thus: Sometimes there are found grains of Gold, of great quantity, and great weight above the Earth, and sometimes under. And the greatest of all other that was found to this day in the Island, was that which was lost in the Sea, about the Island <hi>Beata,</hi> which weighed three thousand two hundred Castellanes of Gold.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Besides this pure native Gold found in Rivers, Sands, or Earths, there is sometimes some found pure digged forth of the Mines, that needs little or no force of fire, or refining; and sometimes it lies inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed in the clefts of the stones, like thin plates, or spangles, or like threds or hairs, or the small and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sprigs of Plants and Herbs, which are usually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>metallorum efflorescentiae,</hi> the flowers of Metals; but most commonly mixed with Earth, Stones, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasites, or other Minerals and Metals; of which we shall speak promiscuously, as they occur to our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, without regard of any strict order.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Scept. Chym. p. 371, 372.</note>1. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> relateth these two Observations. The first thus.
<q>I remember (he saith) that a very skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and credible person affirmed to me, that being in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Mines, he had the good fortune to see a Mineral that was there digged up; wherein pieces of Gold of the length, and also almost of the bigness of a humane finger, grew in the Ore, as if they had been parts and branches of Trees. Secondly, He saith, And I have my self seen a lump of a whitish Mineral that was brought as a rarity to a great, and knowing Prince; wherein there grew here and there in the stone, which looked like a kind of a Sparr, divers little lumps of fine Gold (for such I was assured
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102655:77"/>
that trial had manifested it to be) some of them seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be about the bigness of Pease.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Besides what we have before proved concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vegetability of Metals in general, this from so honourable, and experienced a man as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> doth confirm it very much, nay even to the growth and increase of Gold: to which therefore we shall add more testimonies. And I my self have likewise seen and handled a piece of whitish Metal sent to a great person, (of which I yet retain a small piece) which being fluxed, was most pure Gold. The Coat in which it was contained, was like white Marble, or our white Plaster Ore, or Stone; and the Metal grew in it like a thin crisped Plate, or like many threds joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed close together; and some of it like two twisted threds one with another, and might have with a little crushing of the stone, been separated from it.</p>
               <p>And further to prove this germination and sprouting of Metals like Vegetables,<note place="margin">Ut supr. p. 94.</note> even of Gold. <hi>Rulandus</hi> tells us, That in the exteriour <hi>Pannonia</hi> thin leaves, and sparks of most pure Gold were found in a white and hard stone. And <hi>Athanasius Kirche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> gives us the like answer to this very question; from those Mine-masters, to whom he had sent, from <hi>Schem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz,</hi> to his second Query concerning the efflore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence of Metals,<note place="margin">Mund. subter. l. 10. Sect. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 183.</note> he hath this answer. 'That some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Mines do occur Crystals wrapt about with most tender silver threds like hairs, and the rest like.
<q>The former years there was found a pure grain of silver in <hi>lapide fatuo,</hi> in a fool-stone (in the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Tongue <hi>Taubenstein</hi>) in a certain white mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like Chalk, which is called <hi>lapidea medulla,</hi> stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marrow, as though it had been there laid up on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

and weighed two pounds.</q>
Again to the same question from <hi>Herrengrundt</hi> in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> from <hi>Iohn Schapelman</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he receives this answer.
<q>There are sometimes found in this Mine, the flowring that are Cupreous, of pure Copper, even as flowers and herbs grow above the Earth.<note place="margin">U supr. p 185, 186, 187, 188, 189.</note> Thirdly, to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion he hath this answer from <hi>George Schuiz</hi>: That in the Silver Mines there are often found silver flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erings, where the bright Silver thrusts forth it self in form of a thred, or hair, out of the Metallick stones. And that there are found shavings (<hi>ramenta</hi>) of pure silver, the thickness of a finger, though black, and as it were of a leaden colour, &amp;c.</q>
Lastly, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable is that passage from Father <hi>Andrew Schaffer,</hi> in these words.
<q>I send here a Mineral altogether precious, seeing any thing like, more rare is not to be found. Where you may see pure Silver flowring into its threds; that which shineth yellow, is most pure gold; that which is blackish, is silver mixed with gold.</q>

Also shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102655:78"/>
Lead Ore, or <hi>Plumbago,</hi> which contained Gold and silver; that likewise there was a Mine of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that held in it some Gold.<note place="margin">Mus. Worm. l. 1.

That a mass of another Vein 1646. did, being purified, yield six drachms of pure Gold, contained in one pound. This Ore shined with lesser grains then the former, and more tending to redness. Likewise that there were other Ores brought from the same place, that were like Talk, and pregnant with frequent granates, which many thought, did abound with Gold, &amp;c. And although before I had omitted it,<note place="margin">Biblioth. l. 2. c. 12. p. 65.</note> I shall here insert what <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> delivers of the <hi>Arabian</hi> gold; who saith, There is Gold digged up in <hi>Arabia,</hi> which is not melted with the fire, as is accustomed amongst others. But as soon as ever it is digged up, it is found like to <hi>Chesnuts,</hi> and is of so lucid a colour, that it makes the precious stones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by Artificers in Gold,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 11. p. 73.</note> most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ficus Mirandulanus</hi> (but he quotes not the place) rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<q>That in his time gold was found in the stomach of Partridges;<note place="margin">Mund. subter. l. 10. Sect 4. p. 200.</note> and addeth his reason, that it was no marvel, for that Hens, Partridges, Ducks, and the like, do much desire metallick bodies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding the raments or small shavings of Gold commixt with the sand, do swallow them; which after by the heat of the stomach do flow into one mass, which is a rational conjecture. And saith, that they report that Goats that are called <hi>Ibices</hi> were seen, whose teeth were spred over with a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den colour, especially in that part with which they did pluck up the grass; which without doubt did happen from the tincture of Gold-bearing spirits, wherewith the grass was imbued. And also tells us, that <hi>Albertus</hi> relateth that Gold was found in an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane scull; which if it were truth, happened from no other cause then the steams of gold, when melted do arise, and no otherwise then quick-silver was coagulated in the brain.

               <p>THe reason why I am so large in this particular is, to mind all ingenious Mineralists to make a more diligent search how all Ores lie, and in what wombs, coats, or substances, then hitherto hath been used; and especially about the Ore of Gold: and to this end we shall transcribe what we find most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to this purpose.</p>
               <p>And in the first place we shall give the Reader an account of what <hi>Basilius Valentinus</hi> hath discovered in this particular; a person of vast experience in these matters,<note place="margin">Last Will and Test. par. 2. c 3. p. 84, 85, 86.</note> who writeth thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>This noble gold-stone and Ore is sometimes mixed, and on its outside there sticketh some obscure and dark matter, having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102655:80"/>
to it some slates and other spermatick matter, which detracts from the goodness of its own nature. And though the Creator hath indued it with great virtues, yet doth it humble it self, and suffers it self to be found in despicable Mineral stones, where it loseth much of its tincture; as is apparent by the Touch-stone, where the mixture of Copper, Silver, Tin, and others, is seen; all these mixed impurities can be separated from it with artificial manuals; and with little ado it may be brought into a perfect state. Gold Ores naturally are wrought thus; that the Gold stands in it close, compact, firm, and good; which is found sometimes in the cross passages. Its fixedness is found in the deepness under ground, where it hath its greatest power; and it is found also sometimes in a speckled Jaspis, full of eyes, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with flints in its passages; where many times Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol flint is found abundantly, which Vitriol is the best among all other sorts of Vitriol. The <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Vitriol hath the precedence before all the rest, which is sufficiently known in their proofs, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, as may be demonstrated to the eye. In its passages are found sometimes fluxes of several co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which are interlined with gold, and must be forced with fire.

                  <p>Gold is wrought also in standing passages, and on level ground; the Ores and such passages are yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish, rocky, and of a iron shot-sand in clifts, as it is on-grown compactly. And generally it is found

It is found also in streaked slate-work in pure passages, mixed with a blue horn-stone, and slate; in flinty glittering passages it is found hoary, and compactly wrought. There are found also flat Marble floats, wherein in all your clifts is wrought inherent gold, mixed with green grit, and iron spots. Sometimes it is found also in square iron shots, or porous marble Marchasites, but for the most part in grits. Sometimes gold Ore is found also compact, and firm, in black passages. Some gold Ores and gold passages are found also to be of Minerals, and of Vitriol; and Miners in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> especially can discourse of it, because gold Ore is found in that manner in those parts.</p>

                  <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, tells us;
<q>That Gold is found in a white stone like marble, the <hi>Germans</hi> call it <hi>Quartz</hi>; as also in a blue and yellow horn-stone: likewise in a blue slate, iron, slats, yellow and of a subtile flaming; and sometimes in corn, tin, and iron-stone.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And once more <hi>Paracelsus</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Rer. Nat. l. 8. p. 102.</note> (speaking of the separating of Metals forth of their Ores, and one from another:)
<q>These sorts of Ores sometimes will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more then one Metal; as it often happens, that Copper and Silver, Copper and Gold, Lead and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Tin and Silver, &amp;c. may be found in one Mineral.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the gradual differences of Gold, they may be, and doubtless are many; for in fineness and purity there may be much disagreement; and therefore <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius</hi> offers us a notable passage,<note place="margin">Last Will and Test. par. 1. c. 11. p. 25, 26.</note> thus.
<q>And take notice that Nature loveth to keep her own ways or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and keeps together two, and sometimes three sorts of Ores in their ascension and descension, whereby she intimateth a way unto the after-work; but men in their fansies think upon other means, though to no purpose.

If you can shew me the contrary, I will assent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And again he saith;<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 12. p. 27, 28.</note>
                  <q>Who could tell what gold and silver were, if they were not known in their perfection; for when they are perfect it appeareth, when they have their colour, their weight, their mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leableness, their flux and hardness. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102655:82"/>
Metal Nature hath produced compactly and purely: for such perfect, pure, and compact gold is found in <hi>Hungary,</hi> in the white marble, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently may be broken: as also silver and copper. The difference betwixt the perfect and pure is, because Metals are not pure before they are perfect, and so there may be a perfect Ore which is not pure, which defect is found in many of our Metals, which come to their perfection as soon as in any other Foreign parts, but in their perfect purity they are defective sometimes.</q>
And this we commend to the Reader to be seriously considered of.</p>
               <p>Now from hence we may gather, that even one sort of gold, as it is gold, may be more fine and pure then another. And the Scripture doth shew us, that in those days gold was found to be, and esteemed, one sort better and purer then another; of which we shall now speak something largely for diversion sake, and to stir up all ingenious spirits to a more narrow scrutiny after these curiosities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first it mentioneth the gold found in the Land of <hi>Havillah,</hi>

And the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest that we have in these days (that I know of) is the sand-gold brought from <hi>Guinea,</hi> and some other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which is so near pure, and unmixt with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metals, that the Artificers that beat, or make leaf-gold, and those that draw gold into small Wire,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102655:85"/>
or fine threds, do commonly buy it, because it will serve their turns, without using the <hi>Aqua separatoria</hi>; and so they do the old gold coined by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, because it hath in it the least alloy of Silver or Copper; and the purest Gold that I have ever seen, was a piece of <hi>Roman</hi> Gold, stamped with the image and name of <hi>Nero,</hi> which was as soft, and would have cut as easily as Lead.</p>
               <p>And the goodness of Gold is commonly esteemed according to the number of Carats, of which there ordinarily are 24. though <hi>Paracelsus</hi> makes them 36.<note place="margin">Nat. &amp; Mor. Hist Ind. c. 4. p. 214.</note> For <hi>Acosta</hi> tells us,
<q>The most famous Gold is that of <hi>Caranana</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> and of <hi>Valdivia</hi> in <hi>Chille,</hi> for that it riseth with his alloy and perfection, which is twenty three Carats and an half, and sometimes more.

                  <q>Gold is the most pure, and most perfect of all Metals, consisting of a most pure Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, most perfectly concocted, and of a red sulphur most excellent, and most fixed, being exactly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and united together: sustaining all the trials of the fire, and of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> most heavy; and above all other Metals extensible, or to be beaten forth, shining with a yellowish colour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:102655:86"/>And these are sufficient, that from hence we may gather some of its chiefest properties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore of all other Metals it is most perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maturated and decocted by Nature, and is of the most equal temper:<note place="margin">Art. Aurif p. 40.</note> for as <hi>Trevisan</hi> tells us, <hi>Quare in auro sunt quatuor elementa in aequali &amp; anatica pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portione coadunata.</hi> Therefore the four Elements are in Gold, joyned together in an equal and anatical proportion. But yet taking his supposition that gold is generated of the four Elements, we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this equality of proportion in respect of their equal quantities, but anatical proportion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of qualities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of all other Metals, Gold hath the least portion of external or separable sulphur (for that it hath some, appears by the authority of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi>; the latter of which tell us, That external sulphur is not possible to be separated by Nature, but by one constructive liquor) and therefore is in that regard accounted more perfect then any of the rest.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gold is more dense and compacted then any other of the Metals, that is, it is less porous then any of the rest, being so closely joyned <hi>per minima,</hi> that little or none of the air, or <hi>globuli aetherei</hi> (as <hi>Cartesius</hi> calls them) can lodge within its particles. And this is the cause of two other of its properties; to wit, its heaviness, and power of extension; both of which are far beyond either of those qualities in other Metals.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It indureth not onely all the force of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fire, but if we may give credit to Writers of sufficient authority, they do inform us that in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test torture of the fire, it loseth nothing of its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or weight, but rather gaineth; for so doth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102655:86"/>
                  <hi>Wormius</hi> tell us in the place above-cited. And it will not onely indure the trial <hi>per cineritium,</hi> or test<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Lead (which silver will also abide without wasting) but also the probat of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> the <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum regale</hi> by <hi>Antimony,</hi> and that which Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers call <hi>Quartation.</hi> All which do sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all those perfections and excellencies that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have attributed unto it.</p>
               <p>As for the beating, grinding, sifting, and washing of Ores in general from their earthy filthiness and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, <hi>Georgius Agricola</hi> hath written very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learnedly,<note place="margin">Lib. de re Met. 8. passim.</note> more then any other Author that I know of. And I could wish that some person that hath ability and leisure, would translate it into <hi>English</hi>; for it might be very serviceable to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Miners, that in that particular have little to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, but what they learn one from another. But we shall onely here note some few particulars of beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or washing of gold Ore, from two or three Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Credit. For <hi>Agricola</hi> tells us,
<q>Seeing that Nature doth for the most part bring forth Metals im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, and mixed with earth, concrete juices, and stones; it is necessary, as far as can be possible, to separate those things from the Metallick veins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be fluxed or molten.</q>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Acosta</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Histor. nar. &amp; mor. of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, c. 4 p 213, 214, 215.</note>
                  <q>Gold in stone is a vein of gold that groweth or ingendreth within the stone, or flint, as I have seen in the Mines of <hi>Curuma</hi> within the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Salines,</hi> very great stones pierced and intermixed with gold; others that were half gold and half stone. The gold which groweth in this manner, is found in Pits or Mines, which have their Veins like to the silver Mines, but it is very hard to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102655:87"/>
draw it forth. And a little after: They refine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered gold in basons, washing it in many waters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the sand falls from it, and the gold as most heavy remaineth in the bottom. They refine it likewise with Quicksilver and Strong-water, for that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom whereof they make this water, hath the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to separate gold from dross, or from other Metals.</q>

                  <note place="margin">Lib 3. c. 11. p. 73.</note>2. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> tells us a strange story both of the getting of gold Ore, as also of its preparing by beating, grinding, and washing, which for brevity sake, we shall onely give in the <hi>English.</hi>
                  <q>In the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Egypt</hi> that joyn to <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> there are places very fertile of Metals; Forth of which with much labour and expence, Gold is drawn. For the black earth by nature hath passages, and veins of most white marble, which shineth above all brightness. And a little after, he saith, That almost infinite thousands of men do dig forth with iron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, the more soft rock, and which is broken with indifferent labour. He that discovereth the Veins of gold, goeth before the Workmen, shewing what places they are to dig. They cleave the stony marble being shewed, by the strength of strong bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, not by Art, but by great force with iron wedges. But they drive shafts or passages not streight, but that way which Nature leadeth, by the gold in the shining marble. But when by reason of the divers bendings, and turnings, they are darkned in their passages, the Workmen carrying lights before them, the rocks by great force being cut in pieces, they carry up, and cast upon the ground. Others cut them so casten into very small pieces, others carry
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102655:87"/>
them away. The pieces taken from these Workmen being cut to a certain measure, they beat in stone Vessels with a pestle or hammer of Iron, unto the smallness of Millet seeds. They then being cast into Mills, are grinded unto the very fineness of meal. Then the Workmen taking it ground, do put it upon broad Tables a little declining, and again beat, or rub the Marble, water being cast upon it: By that means the earth being washed away, the gold by its gravity doth remain upon the Tables. This they often iterating, they rub the Gold with their hands. Then with thin and porous sponges, they press forth the soft earth, until it be made like unto golden sand. Lastly, other Workmen do put it by weight and measure into earthen pots; and do superadd in a certain measure, Lead, Sea-weed, or Tange, and Bran of Barley. These things compounded in a certain proportion, they diligently lome or daub up the pots with clay, or lute. Furthermore, being decocted five whole days and nights in a Furnace, pure Gold is onely found in the Vessel, the other things being wasted, the former weight being little diminished.</q>
I have the rather delivered this at large, because it is a very remarkable passage, and perhaps not taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by many Readers, and may be of some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable use to an ingenious Mineralist.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Gonzalus Ferdinandus Oviedus</hi> relateth two notable ways both of their finding of Gold at the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the West Indies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 188, 189, 190.</note> and of the washing and purifying of it: and that not by hear-say, but upon his own experience; some of which we shall transcribe, because I believe the Book is not very common. Who saith,
<q>This particular of the Mines of Gold, is a thing greatly to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102655:88"/>
be noted, and I may much better speak of it then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other man, forasmuch as there are now twelve years past since I served in the place of Surveyor of the Melting-shops pertaining to the Gold Mines of the Firm Land, and was the Governour of the Mines of the Catholick King <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi>; after whose departure from this life, I served long in the same room in the name of your Catholick Majestie. By reason whereof, I have had great occasion to know how Gold is found and wrought out of the Mines, &amp;c. And a little after he saith: The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how Gold is gathered, is this, either of such as is found in <hi>Zanana</hi>; that is to say, in the Plains and Rivers of the Champian Countrey being without Trees, whether the earth be with grass or without; or of such as is sometimes found on the Land without the Rivers, in places where Trees grow; so that to come by the same, it shall be requisite to cut down many, and great Trees. But after which soever of these manners it be found, either in the Rivers or Breaches of Waters, or else in the Earth; I will shew how it is found in both these places, and how it is separate, and purged. Therefore when the Mine or Vein is discovered, this chanceth by searching and proving in such places, as by certain signs and tokens do appear to skilful men, apt for the generation of Gold, and to hold Gold. And when they have found it, they follow the Mine, and labour it, whether it be in the River or the Plain, as I have said. And if it be found on the Plain, first they make the place ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clean where they intend to dig, then they dig eight or ten foot in length, and as much in bredth; but they go no deeper then a span or two, or more, as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102655:88"/>
shall seem best to the Master of the Mine, digging equally; then they wash all the earth which they have taken out of the said space, and if herein they find any Gold, they follow it, and if not they dig a span deeper, and wash the earth as they did before: and if then also they find nothing, they continue in digging and washing the earth, as before, until they come to the hard rock or stone: and if in fine they find no Gold there, they follow no further to seek Gold in that place, but go to another part. And it is to be understood, that when they have found the Mine, they follow it in digging in the same measure in level and depth, until they have made an end of all the Mine which that place containeth, if it appear to be rich.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Their manner of washing he thus describes,
<q>And when they have digged forth the Mine, they fill cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Trays with that earth, which other <hi>Indians</hi> have the charge immediately to receive at their hands, and to carry those Trays of Earth to the Water where it may be washed: yet do not they that bring it wash it, but deliver it to other, putting it out of their own Trays into others, which they have ready in their hands to receive it. These Washers for the most part are Indian women, because this work is of less pain and travel then any other. These wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men when they wash, are accustomed to sit by the water-side with their legs in the water even up to the knees, or less, as the place serveth their purpose; and thus holding the Trays in their hands by the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles thereof, and putting the same into the Water, they move them round about, after the manner of sifting, with a certain aptness; in such sort that there
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102655:89"/>
entereth no more water into the Trays then ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth their turns; and with the self-same apt moving of their Trays in the water, they ever avoid the foul water with the earth out of the one side of the Vessel, and receive in clean water on the other side thereof: so that by this means, by little and little, the water washeth the earth as the lighter substance off the Trays, and the gold as the heavier matter resteth in the bottom of the same, being round and hollow in the middle, like unto a Barbers Basin. And when all the earth is avoided, and the gold gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the bottom of the Tray, they put it apart, and return to take more earth, which they wash conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, as before. So that to conclude, there are in all five persons ordinarily assigned to every Tray of Washers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have been the more tedious upon this subject, because I judged it very material and profitable; but now we shall come to some higher questions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gold, and so leave it.</p>

               <p>But those that think they come nearest the mark, do fix upon the noblest of Metals, to wit, Gold; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that of <hi>Augurellus</hi> for a truth, (which is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if rightly understood) <hi>In auro, semina sunt auri, &amp; ut ignis est principium ignificandi, sic aurum aurifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi</hi>; and finding the Masters do call the Gold that they use in the first work (for we speak not here of fermentation) their Gold not <hi>aurum vulgi,</hi> they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commonly pitch upon pure Gold, such as is much sand gold, or as the <hi>Germans</hi> call it, Wash gold, that hath not been melted in the fire; and this many of the wiser sort do take to be living gold, strengthened by that subtile assertion of <hi>Sendivogius,</hi> who saith, <hi>Scito enim metallorum vitam esse ignem,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And I shall crave pardon of those that are learned in this point, if I do not adhere to this opinion; for though I may confess that Gold by fusion in the force of fire, is thereby dead, yet my question is, that it was dead before; and so after fusion that may be more amply praedicated of it, though it was truly dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as when a man is slain by a mortal wound, he may be said to be dead, when he is absolutely cold, and no motion of life in him; and much more he might be said to be dead when his body (like the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of the <hi>Romans</hi>) is burned.</p>
               <p>And to confirm that Gold and other particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are dead when they are coagulated into an hard and fixt metallick body, we shall give sufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

<q>Hoc sulphur, si quale in aurifera arbore, &amp; ad hujus radicem in montibus est, Alchymistae invenire &amp; adipisci possent, esset certe, de quo effuse gauderent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From all which it is manifest that common Gold as it is perfected by Nature, and digested to the height of maturity, though it have never been melted, nor felt the force of the fire; yet in respect of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers first work, is but dead, and wants the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of life and vegetability, that necessarily is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their purpose; and that there is another gold not vulgarly known for such, in which Nature hath but wrought her first operations, which above all other they persuade to seek after, and to take. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will conclude this (because we have spoken more largely where we treated of Gold according to the mystical Authors) with the advice of <hi>Iohannes Spagnetus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arcan. Herm. p. 175.</note> who saith,
<q>Now those bodies must be taken which are of an unspotted, and incorrupt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, such as have life and spirits in them, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct as those that are handled of the vulgar; for
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102655:92"/>
who can expect life from dead things? and those are called corrupt, which have suffered copulation; those dead and extinct, which (by the enforcements of the chief Tyrant of the World) have poured out their soul with their blood by martyrdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place many do imagine and urge, that though common Gold be dead, as Nature hath produced it; yet it is to be revised by Art, and that herein lies the great difficulty and mystery of their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and the bringing of it back to its first matter. Of this there is enough said to encourage this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>We shall be a little large in handling this, because it is a deep and mysterious point. And in the first place, we shall find all the Philosophers as it were unanimously agreeing, that the transmutation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals is impossible, unless they be reduced <hi>in materiam suam primam</hi>: which we shall take to be granted as a certain truth, but all the difficulty lies in the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Philosophers meaning, who never speak more truly then when darkly; nor never more equivocally (if not falsly) when they speak plainly. Some understand this reduction of them into their first matter, to be taken to be brought to pass in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; of which we shall say nothing. Others, that it is to be understood of their first matter, that it must be by solution reduced into its first principles, of which it was constituted; and this in a sober and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sense we shall allow of, and inquire what first matter it is that they must be reduced into; and that cannot be understood truly and properly of the first matter of Metals,<note place="margin">No. Lum. Chym. Tract. 4. p. 312.</note> for that is vapour. For <hi>Sendivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> tells us;
<q>Sciant ergo doctinae filli sperma metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102655:92"/>
diversum non esse à spermate rerum omnium, scilicet vaporem humidum; ideo frustra quaerunt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistae metallorum reductionem in materiam primam, quae tantum vapor. Philosophi non talem intellexerunt materiam primam, sed tantum materiam secundam.</q>
So that rationally it must be thought to be that which is the next and proxime matter of Metals, which <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visan</hi> excellently describeth thus:<note place="margin">Thearr. Chym. p. 758.</note>
                  <q>Glorientur Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistae utut volent, nunquam formas transmutabunt metallorum, nisi per ipsorum in primam materiam reductionem: hoc ipsum habent omnes libri qui de forma tractant metallica.

So that it being granted that there is a necessity of reducing the Metals into their first, which was the next matter into which the specifick form is introduced, and those that suppose natural gold, though having not felt the fire, is to be reduced into this proxime matter, which they suppose to be done by their solution; which is accounted so hard and difficult: we shall now examine whether common gold can be reduced into this proxime or first matter, which we suppose simply impossible.</p>
               <p>And first, whereas they alledge that their solution is so extream hard and difficult, we shall oppose the authority of <hi>Sendivogius,</hi>

That this Water doth dissolve Gold without violence or noise, as pleasantly and naturally as Ice is melted in warm water; so that the water once had, the dissolution is easie; and therefore what difficulty soever they speak of in their solution, must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the preparing and attaining of this solvent, and not in regard of the solution of Gold in it.</item>
                  <item>3. I shall commend it to be inquired of by all cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious persons, whether this Gold that is so easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in it be common Gold, or that of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; because I cannot determine it here, for reasons not fit to be divulged.</item>
                  <item>4. Especially to mark that this water is that from which Gold by Nature is produced; so that there is a subject to be had, from whence Gold by Nature is produced, forth of which this their solvent is made and prepared; which is a clearer hint then I know that any other Author hath ever given; and therefore I wish every true Artist to consider, and ponder of it well; for this is the Key of all their secrets, and onely can open the door into the Philosophers Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</item>

To note, that whereas he saith, That although all Metals, and all things have their off-spring from this water, yet nothing is so amicable unto it as Gold, because other things have impurities, but that Gold hath none, which must be taken with a grain of salt; for there is no natural or common Gold but it hath some impurity; and in what respect all Metals, and all things have their rise from it, must be carefully consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, calling to mind that this Author (as well as others) useth contradictions in his Writings, and tells us that the Rose is not found without its prickles.</item>

From whence it is manifest how hard and difficult it is to separate the external sulphur from metallick Mercury, because they were originally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, but that nevertheless by Art they may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. And such an Artist he calls <hi>Peritus,</hi> which doth manifest in part, that the difficulty lies chiefly in preparing and obtaining the solvent, and not in sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the sulphur from the metallick Mercury, when the liquor is once had. For where he is speaking of the <hi>Ludus,</hi> he saith; <hi>Est autem hoc opus longe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillimum, non quidem quoad praeparationem Ludi; sed ipsius Alkahest.</hi> By which it is plain beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that the preparing of this great solvent, is of all other far most difficult, and not in dissolving any other bodies by it when it is once had: and therefore in another place, speaking of the <hi>Alkahest,</hi> he saith it is <hi>taediosissimae praeparationis.</hi>

By which any one would think that vulgar Gold ought to be taken in the beginning, and so long concocted and digested until it be ripened, and then it yields seed or the Tincture.

<q>In propositis autem cupri terminis, contemplare internum illud, quod in albo, anonymo, ac mercuriali metallo, corpus fixat, sive coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulat, efficitque sub malleo ductile: cum alias mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius absque sulphure nunquam in metallum coagulari possit.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:102655:96"/>And after, where he is speaking of metallick Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, which containeth its combustible and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sulphur within it,<note place="margin">Ut supr. c. 8. p. 70.</note> he saith;
<q>Si non vidissem argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum vivum eludere quamcunque artificum operam, adeo quod aut totum avolet adhuc integrum, aut totum in igne permaneat, atque utrolibet modo, servet impermutabilem sui ac primitivam identitatem, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentitatisque homogeneitatem anaticam: dicerem artem non esse veram, quae vera est, sine men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacio, atque longe verissima.

               </p>
               <p>And further;
<q>Imo licet aurum radicaliter in partes heterogeneas, salem scilicet, sulphur, ac mercurium se pateretur sequestrari (quod nullatenus naturae, nisi per unicum liquorem constructivum, est possibile) Istud tamen in mercurii homogeneitate, est naturae &amp; arti impossibile. Quippe qui auro est simplicior, majori anaticaque identitate constructus.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence we may observe; 1. That metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Mercury doth either altogether abide in the fire, or altogether flie from, and both ways remains im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable. And this <hi>Helmont</hi> had seen in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they are ignorant of the nature of Metals, that teach the change of Mercury or Gold.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Gold may be radically separated into Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury; but not possible to Nature to be done but by one onely constructive liquor.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But lastly, That this in the homogeneity of Mercury, is impossible to Nature, and Art. And in another place he tells us:

               </p>
               <p>And further he saith;

                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p 70.</note>And further saith;
<q>Mercurius ergo de mercurio vel in mercurio, sospes manet, tam ignibus, quam li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quore acri.

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So that the force of the Arguments lies thus: That though metallick Mercury by composition, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with metallick Sulphurs, be made a Metal, and this may be destroyed by reason of the duality of its sulphur; yet the mercury of that Metal is not to be destroyed. And if the mercury of Metals when se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from its external sulphur, be not to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged either by Art or Nature, but onely by its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peer, which is the Tincture already prepared, then it must necessarily follow, that common Gold cannot be an ingredient in the work of the Elixir before fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; which was the thing we undertook to prove. Nay further, either the Art of transmutation of Metals is false, or else metallick mercury is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible, for if it were divisible, it would be utterly

more at large anon) but notwithstanding the mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial part of it remains indivisible, and cannot be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the power of that liquor, nor by no sublunary except its compeer.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Butler p. 594.</note>For <hi>Helmont</hi> tells us;

               </p>
               <p>And further he saith,

               </p>
               <p>From whence we may note, 1. That all Metals in respect of their Mercuries are equally shut up and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the seal of anatical homogeneity; so that their Mercuries do yield us no Medicines, however wrought upon by their constructive liquors, but their Salts and Sulphurs do hearken unto us, if rendred fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, and separated with that grand and universal solvent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Mercury of those Metals remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destructible, and not to be changed from a metallick form, or precipitated; but if they be never so oft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102655:98"/>
they will arise more perfect then before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that the Sulphurs and Salts (in which onely consists the Medical virtue) may (but doubtless not without their great solvent) be separated from their Mercurial bodies, which all remain white after their Sulphurs and Salts be separated from them; which white bodies may again be reduced into Anonymous Metals: of which <hi>Paracelsus</hi> saith thus much.<note place="margin">Archidox l. 4. p. 13 13.</note>

That he there nameth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein the Metals must be dissolved and putrefied, but according to his usual custom doth tacitely omit to declare what kind of water it should be; when doubtless according to <hi>Helmont,</hi> and truth it self, it was their constructive liquor or <hi>Alkahest</hi>; for nothing else would radically dissolve Metals, and that not without a praevious digestion or putrefaction.<note place="margin">De Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. That the mercury of the Metals, as well as their Salts and Sulphurs, are brought over the helm, and that the white may be reduced into a metallick malleable white body, which cannot be known under what spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies it falleth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in these Salts or Sulphurs the medical vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue lies hid, and that they are coloured according to the several Metals from whence they proceed. As thus:

We shall onely urge <hi>Helmonts</hi> conclusion from the two former, and leave the mystery and seeming contradictions in

the rest, because we intend but that onely point, and he concludeth thus.<note place="margin">Tria prim. p. 408.</note>

From whence, if it be a truth that <hi>Helmont</hi> holdeth forth, That metallick Mercury, can be changed by no sublunary Agent, except its compeer, but that still it will remain a Metal not to be altered from that state either by Art or Nature: then seeing that it immortally and immutably remains in its metallick form, except changed by its compeer,

which we assert to be the tincture already prepared, then of necessity it cannot be an ingredient in the first work, which was that we undertook to make good.</p>

<q>
                     <hi>One is this by</hi> Iohannes Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hung; <hi>who saith,</hi> Aurum itaque ex mineralibus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum esse mihi haud ignotum est: nihilominus tamen neque in forma, neque materia, ad perfectionem suam transgrediendam, ullam aliquam habet efficaciam.

                  </note>1. <hi>Angelus Sala,</hi> a laborious, learned and honest Chymist, writ a Treatise of common Gold, therein la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring strenously to prove that it cannot by Art be brought into such a condition, as may be properly said to be potable, in either of those acceptations; as either Oyl or Water, which of themselves are liquid, nor as Salts, which though of themselves neither li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid nor potable, yet infused in any moist and liquid substance, will then become potable. But this he meaneth, that though its body may be divided into such small atoms, or particles, that mixed with wine or some other liquor, and so give it another colour, or a new tincture, yet that it is not thereby radically dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but may again be reduced into the metallick form of Gold, of which he giveth many clear and learned instances. Thus far this Author (according to what he knew) hath said right, and so much is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Helmont,</hi>

And in some other places he hath things to the same purpose; from whence we shall commend these particulars to be noted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That common Gold may by vulgar Chymistry be brought into the form of a light red-coloured oyl, but that not profitable at all in medicinal vertue, and may easily be again reduced into the fixt and mallea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body of Gold; and thus far onely <hi>Sala</hi> was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in, and in this respect onely his Arguments are good and conclusive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But that notwithstanding Gold and other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals may be dissolved <hi>per consentanea suis principiis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicalibus,</hi> which thing was unknown unto <hi>Sala</hi>; and therefore we may very well take notice, that conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions drawn from the experience of one man, nay of many, will not necessarily infer a general rule: for <hi>Helmont</hi> was once ignorant of this liquor that was consentaneous to the radical, proper principles of Gold; and therefore for him then to have concluded generally that there was no such liquor as would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically dissolve Gold, had been false, since he knew it afterwards: and what a thousand knows not, one that is none of them may know.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have in this Chapter before sufficiently shewed that the colour, tincture, or sulphur of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gold, may be by Art separated from its body, afterwards remaining white, and an Anonymous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and not to be destroyed by Art or Nature. But
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102655:102"/>
that we may make it clear beyond all exception, we shall add some further proofs. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From whence he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth plainly, That common Gold and other Metals have in them an heterogeneous duality, in regard of their external sulphurs, and that this may be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or in respect of it the Metal may be destroyed, yet that the Mercury of that Metal is indestructible.

Of which we have spoken largely before. And again to repeat some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, he saith:

<q>Quoties namque à merucriis sales, &amp; sulphura distinxi, admiratus sum illorum ignaviam, horumque vero principiorum dignitates.</q>
Where again he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that the Salts and Sulphurs of Metals are to be divided from their Mercuries; and that the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Metals in medical virtue (for we have shewed by his authority before, that the mercuries of Metals are all equally shut up with the seal of anatical homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneity, and yield no medical vertue at all, but that their sulphurs do hearken unto us, if rendred familiar) but did wonder at the efficacy of their Salts and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs. And from this root doth spring and arise those medicaments prepared by the <hi>Alkahest</hi> (but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be had) that <hi>Paracelsus</hi> called <hi>Hematina</hi>:<note place="margin">Pot. Medic. p. 479.</note> of which <hi>Helmont</hi> saith he had taught that which was sufficient, and therefore concludeth thus; <hi>Quapropter ejusmodi Hematina admirandas in re medica operatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes perficiunt. Sensi ergo Hematina Solis &amp; Lunae, quod etiamsi ex puritate sui balsami comfortarent: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aliquid alieni in se continere, respectu nostri.</hi> From whence we may note, that these Hematine medicines may be had forth of Gold and Silver; but not without the help of their constructive liquor, or universal sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: and therefore (as he saith elsewhere) are not ordained for remedies for the Poor; and that scarce one Artist of a thousand, can rightly get these rare
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102655:103"/>
and excellent medicines contained in their Salts and Sulphurs, separated from their Mercuries, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no medical efficacy at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From hence may be resolved that great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether common Gold may be made so pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as never to be reduced again into a metallick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? To which we say that it plainly appeareth both by this Author and <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> that common Gold and Silver may by their great solvent be brought into an oylie substance or liquor, in two forms or colours; the Salts and Sulphurs of them according to the Metals from whence they were taken, of divers colours (which hath been shewed before) but the Mercuries of all the Metals in a white form or colour, which by it self may be reduced into a malleable and metallick body, but their salts and sulphurs never. For as no external metallick sulphur is a Metal, so every metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Mercury is really a Metal. So that if they mean by <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> or any other Metal, the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance brought into a potable liquor, and never again to be reduced into a metallick body, notwithstanding the Arguments of ten thousand to the contrary, we positively affirm with the Adeptists, that the mercurial part of it is always reducible into a Metal, and remains immortal and immutable, never to be divided or changed, but by its compeer. But if they mean by <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum potabile,</hi> or the tincture of Gold, the external sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur (which containeth its salt) separated from its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining white mercurial body (in which is contained its internal and inseparable sulphur, agent, or <hi>verus ignis naturae</hi>) then we absolutely affirm, that it may be brought into a condition of potability, at least like salts to be dissolved in liquors, and that it is never pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102655:104"/>
either to Art or Nature, to reduce that sulphur or salt into a metallick body again; and this when the Philosophers speak of <hi>aurum potabile</hi> drawn forth of common Gold, is that onely which in that respect they truly understand, and the onely end they aim at. To confirm which take these particulars; for <hi>Helmont</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Potest. med. p. 479.</note>
                  <q>Sensi quoque, remedia mineralia, in salis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam mutata (non intelligo, quae per adjunctum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuntur salem) secum gestare, sua semina, in gradum tamen exaltata.

From whence it is apparent, that mineral Medicines changed into the nature of Salt, do bear their seminal efficacy but in an exalted degree; he doth not mean by the adjoyning of salts unto them, but of their own interior and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable salt and sulphur. And that by this their solvent the whole Metal is brought into another disposition, (which he calls a magistery) from whence the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial part being separated, that dissoluble salt is not the internal and immutable kernel of the Metal, but onely its sulphur. Therefore as he tells us in another place,<note place="margin">Pharmacop. p. 461.</note> A magistery is the total substance of a thing reduced into its primitive juice, in which retroition of solution, the heterogeneous juices are separated on their own accord, for the most part with divers bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, swimming in course one above another, one chief remaining, or falling to the bottom, famous in diversity containing the seminal entity. And this way of preparing is unknown to the vulgar Chymists, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102655:104"/>
not to be performed, but by the liquor <hi>Alkahest,</hi> and such a magistery is <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> which when the Gold is dissolved by their liquor, <hi>Paracelsus</hi> tells us, that that which is white swimmeth above, and is the mercurial part that may be reduced into a white anonymous Metal,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 467.</note> and that the Quintessence in which is the Medical vertue, remaineth in the bottom. And of this way of preparing, take <hi>Helmonts</hi> caution in these words;
<q>Haec medendi pars, solertem requirit, ac gnarum naturae Secretarium. Quia in illa parte, amplissimae medicaminum opes, &amp; deaurata glaurae suppellex invenitur.</q>

And so enough of this particular.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Philosophers often make mention of another sort of <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> or the tincture of Gold, which is not drawn forth of common Gold, but forth of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subject; and this we touched where we spake of Astralish Gold, and shall here again mention it more at full.

the <hi>Primum ens auri,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Renovation and Restauration,</hi> and in divers other places, may (if they can understand that dark and subtile Author) find much satisfaction in this particular; to which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the studious and curious searcher of the Secrets of Nature.</p>
               <p>In the next place take what <hi>Rhumelius,</hi> a learned German Author,<note place="margin">Antid.

And he further saith, Out of this spiritual like matter, from whence the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Gold do grow, or arise, may <hi>aurum potabile</hi> be made, that is of more efficacy, and better then forth of common Gold it self.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 245.</note> Again, That <hi>aurum potabile</hi> may be made forth of the <hi>Primum ens vel ex auro im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecto, vel è radice solis</hi>; that is, more perfect, more efficacious, and better then that which is made forth of common Gold it self.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 248.</note> Again he saith, That he did prepare two sorts of <hi>aurum potabile</hi> one forth of perfect Gold, that is, common, and perfect, fine Gold.

Now we come to the last member of this tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chapter concerning the universal solvent, by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelsus</hi> first, and after by <hi>Helmont</hi> called <hi>Alkahest</hi>; about which we shall be brief. For we intend not here to speak either of the subject forth of which it is prepared (which is one of the Adeptists greatest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, nay indeed the onely thing that they have most laboured to veil and conceal, all other points of their great work being for the most part plainly opened, either by one of them or another, in one manner or another, in one place or another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor of its prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which <hi>Helmont</hi> saith is most tedious, nor of its manifold names, and Epithetes, nor of the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable virtues of it in general, because (if it please di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence to grant us health and life) we have something in a readiness to all those purposes, that may come to publick view hereafter, if we can judge the World worthy of it.

                  <note place="margin">Lid. de Febrib. c. 14 p. 52.</note> where speaking of the <hi>Arcanum Corallinum,</hi> which is prepared by drawing of the <hi>Alkahest</hi> from common vendible Quick-silver, which is done in one quarter of an hour: and there he quoteth <hi>Raymund Lully,</hi> who, his friends, and the King being present, did coagulate Quicksilver, and none knew the manner except the King. And saith, <hi>In qua coagulatione istud est singulare. Quod liquor Alkahest, idem in numero, pondere &amp; activitate tantum valet millesima actione, quantum prima. Quia agit sine reactione patientis.</hi> And then telleth that it is to be made into small powder, without any remaining part of the liquor. And to be distilled five times with the water drawn from the whites of Eggs, and then it is made red as Coral, and then concludeth, and saith; <hi>Iste pulvis dulcis est, sixus ferens omnem follium ignem, nec perit in plumbi examine.

Et tunc argentum vivum vulgare dimisissent ad creandum lapidem, &amp; ad exuberandam suam humiditatem, &amp; ideo nos cogit ratio, quodigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranti habeamus illud celare.</hi> From all which we may take these most remarkable observations. 1. That this coagulating common Quick-silver by two such grand Masters as were <hi>Lully</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> was no vulgar knack, but a true Philosophical work, else it had been unworthy the naming by two such serious and learned persons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Helmont</hi> would never have hinted at <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Lully</hi>'s coagulating common Quick-silver, but onely that it was to shew that their <hi>menstruum</hi> was spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically the same in effect and operation, otherwise he would not by his knowledge of the <hi>Alkahest</hi> have numbred himself amongst the Adeptists, as he saith; which is more clearly demonstrated by the Adeptists, <hi>&amp; mecum norint Adepti,</hi> but that the knowledge and possession of this liquor, is the onely key, and the most noble of all their secrets.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may here from <hi>Helmont</hi> note the excellency of this liquor, that it still remained the same in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, weight, and activity, and was as prevalent in the thousand operation, as in the first: which is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and stupendious quality.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:102655:107"/>4. We may observe the great energie and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveness of this liquor, that in so short a time as a quarter of an hour, could so perfectly fix, and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Quick silver.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is as clear as the light of the Sun at noon-day, that this that <hi>Lully</hi> calls a menstrual humour, was of the same specifick nature with the liquor <hi>Alkahest</hi> of <hi>Helmont,</hi> because they both produced the same real effects in fixing and coagulating common Mercury.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the main thing above all the rest, that we are here to take notice of is, That whosoever is the Master, and Owner of this most precious liquor, hath the gates open to the Treasure of Treasures, even to the attainment of the great Elixir, or the Philosophers Tincture: for <hi>Lully</hi> tells us faithfully and truly, that if the standers by had known this menstrual liquor really and philosophically by the speculation of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective power, and its virtues, they had known without doubt, and had had the Art and Science it self.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And therefore because this is the onely key that opens the Rosary of the Philosophers, they are bound in all reason to hide and conceal it from the ignorant and unworthy.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That those that know this will dismiss common Mercury from creating the Stone, or exuberating its humidity; so that common Mercury is no ingredient (as many do too vainly and stiffly maintain) in the composition of the great Elixir.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We may observe from <hi>Helmont,</hi> That this powder of common Quick-silver, when coagulated by the <hi>Alkahest,</hi> is sixt and endures all the blasts of the bellows, neither doth perish in the trial of Lead; and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102655:107"/>
therefore hath as great a fixation and perfection as silver; which is most seriously to be weighed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We may from hence note, That in the coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of common Quick-silver by the <hi>Alkahest,</hi> the Atomes of the homogenous Mercury, are brought more close together and joyned <hi>per minima,</hi> then they were before; and the external and combustible Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, which is less or more in all common Quick-sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and in which is the medical virtue, is, by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical piercing of the <hi>Alkahest</hi> the smallest particles of the Mercury protruded, and extroverted, which Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is without question burned or separated, in flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ing down the fixed and coagulated Mercury into a white Metal, and so of necessity must thereby lose its medical virtue.</p>
               <p>We might here also say something of that which they call Horizontal Gold, but a more fit place to handle it will be where we write of common Quick-silver: onely here we shall say a word or two concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the compeer of their <hi>Alkahest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ign. Act. Reg. p. 334</note> for <hi>Helmont</hi> saith, speaking of that great liquor, and its virtues:
<q>Quibus scilecet unicus &amp; idem liquor Alkahest, omnia totius universi corpora tangibilia, perfecte reducit in vitam eorundem primam, absque ulla sui mutatione, virium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que diminutione. A solo autem suo compari, subter jugum trahitur, atque permutatur.</q>

               <p n="2">2. But that it is brought under the yoke, and

               <p>NExt in goodness to Gold, Silver by all Authors is most esteemed,<note place="margin">Last Will and Test. c. 4. p. 86.</note> and of it <hi>Basilius</hi> saith thus.
<q>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Ore is wrought in its own stone, of a perfect na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and most noble earth, and of a fixt clear sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, salt, and mercury; which with a mixture doth joyn in a fixt and firm uniting, and appeareth of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree lower then the Gold is, and is the best Metal next to Gold; and in the fining of it loseth very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and is separated <hi>per se,</hi> or with other Metals joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fire.<note place="margin">Nat. &amp; Mor.

                  </q>
And of it <hi>Acosta</hi> speaks thus.
<q>And first I will say that the reason why they give Silver the second place among all other Metals, is, for that it approacheth nearer to Gold then any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is more durable, and less indamaged by the fire, and more malleable then any other: yea, it passeth Gold in brightness, beauty, and sound; the which is clear and agreeable; for the colour is more conformable and resembling the light, and the sound more piercing, more lively, and more delicate.</q>
And the description of this Metal,<note place="margin">Spec. Alchym. c. 2. p. 259.</note> 
                  <hi>Bacon,</hi> according to the Ancients, gives thus.
<q>Silver is a clean body, pure, almost perfect, procreated of Argent vive pure, almost fixed, clear and white, and of such a kind of sulphur, and to it is awanting a little fixation and colour,<note place="margin">Phys. Herm. c. 4. p 335.</note> with weight. <hi>Pollius</hi> thus. Silver is a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102655:109"/>
Metal consisting of a white tincture, and Mercury well concocted, and constantly coagulated.</q>
The most of the Ancients do in their descriptions agree with this of <hi>Bacons,</hi> and therefore needless here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat more of them.<note place="margin">Mus. Worm. l. 1 Sect. 3. c. 3. p. 115.</note> The learned <hi>Wormius</hi> gives this description of it.
<q>This perfect Metal is next unto Gold, consisting of Mercury, and Sulphur almost fixt, extensible like unto Gold, but in weight lighter then it, as also then Lead, bearing the force of the fire. They gather that it doth participate more of Mercury then of Sulphur, as well by the colour, as the liquefaction. But an indication of Sulphur, the vehemency of the odour of Sulphur, when it is flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed and refined, to be perceived by the nostrils. But that it doth not reach the fixedness of Gold, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest from this, that <hi>in caemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o Regali,</hi> and Antimony and Sulphur, something of it doth perish, and is burned, when by fusion they are mixed together. And also when it is touched with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or stained with their vapours, it emits a rust of a blue colour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And these may seem sufficient for describing the nature and conditions of Silver, we shall onely add what <hi>Paracelsus</hi> saith to this particular;<note place="margin">Lib. de Min. Tract. 1. p. 348.</note> who, though he may be disesteemed with many, yet is the account that he giveth of it, as good as the best Author we have read; which stands thus.
<q>Silver is generated of a white Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury; which being prepared most subtily, and made diaphanous, are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of a fixed nature; that is to say, they are fixed of their proper nature next unto Gold, abiding in the test by Lead, or <hi>per cineritium</hi>: but not in Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the <hi>caementum Regale,</hi> nor in the Quartation.</q>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:102655:109"/>
All which passages do fully shew the qualities and properties of this noble Metal, so that we need not sum up the particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now we shall proceed to declare from the best Authors, how the Ore of Silver lies in its passages in the bowels of the Earth, the manner of its Coats, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trixes, or Coverings: for though some little may be gathered in small grains in the Rivers, and their muds and sands washed by the force of waters forth of the tops or sides of the Mountains, yet is that so seldom found, and in such small quantities, that Authors do write but very little thereof, and we have not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the sight of any of it, and therefore shall pass it by. And as for our own Nation of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> we have not had the fortune to obtain any Ore of Silver (that we might justly call a Royal Mine, not to speak that all Lead Ore contains some silver in it) except some three sorts, two of which were pretty rich in silver, as containing about sixty six pound in a tun, and was found in a blewish-grey stone, in some places inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with white spar, and the silver mixt with some Lead, appearing like white and bright grains, as small almost as Needle points. The third which contained about twenty seven pound in a tun, was like that which Authors call <hi>Galena,</hi> or the hardest sort of Lead Ore. And these are all that of our own experience we can inform the Reader of; and therefore shall pass to what others deliver to the same purpose.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The diligent Observer <hi>Iosephus Acosta</hi> gives us this account very worthy to be regarded.<note place="margin">Hist Ind. c. 5. p. 217.</note>
                  <q>The Mines of Silver are commonly found in Mountains, and high Rocks very desart, although they have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in Plains, and Champaigns. There are
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102655:110"/>
two different kinds, the one they call stragling, the other fixed and setled. The stragling, are pieces of Metal found in certain places, the which drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way there is no more found. But the fixed veins are those which have a continuance in depth and length, like to great branches and arms of Trees; and when they find any one of them, they commonly find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the same place.<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">Ibid. c. 6. p. 219</note> he saith: The ground and soil of this Mountain is dry, cold, and very unpleasant; yea altogether barren, which neither ingenders, nor brings forth any fruit, grass, nor grain; it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inhabitable, for the intemperature of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the barrenness of the earth.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 223.</note>
                  </q>
He noteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother very remarkable passage, which I cannot but commend to the Reader; and is this:
<q>They say of the rich vein, the first that was discovered, that the Metal lay above the ground the height of a lance, like unto Rocks, raising the superficies of the earth, like unto a crest of three hundred foot long, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot broad, and that this remained bare and uncovered by the deluge. This Vein having resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the violence and force of the Water, as the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest part: The Metal was so rich as it was half Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and this Vein continued in his bounty fifty or threescore stades, which is the height of a man, and then it failed.</q>

                  <q>They find Silver almost in all Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102655:110"/>
but that of <hi>Spain</hi> is the best, which grows and ingenders in a barren soil, upon Mountains and Rocks. It is a certain and infallible thing, that in places where they have once discovered any of these Veins, there are others not far off, which is likewise found in all other Metals, and for this the Greeks in my opinion called them Metals.</q>

<q>Because nothing is so fixt, next Gold, then Silver is in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and is the reason why Silver-passages are accompanied with white fluxes and mineral veins; next thereunto are such passages, in which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated red mineral Sulphur, and red yellow juyces of the noble Gold. Silver metalline Ore is wrought many times in a red goldi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hness, and cometh forth better then the other; a proof whereof may be had, if well ordered. White-gold Ore is naturally thus tinged of white-copper glass, which cause such Ores and passages, by reason of the food of their perfect Minerals; and with the Glass Ore black fumes are exhaled, and feed upon Wismuth, Lead, and Tin Ore, wherein Minerals that strike upon the Lunar passages are greedily refreshed: thus groweth the firmest and compactest Silver Ore of its pure, proper, and unmixed Stone. They carry and produce also, not onely mixed chambers, and Mine-chests, but also several hard and sturdy mixed Ores in whole Flint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and other Copper-flowers, yellow and black Ore, and are found different in their nature, form, and tincture; so that the one is more hard, sturdy, slaty, broader, narrower, whiter, blewer in its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102655:111"/>
thus qualified, and natural in its end, middle, and beginning. This is the reason why these Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fruits and Ores are found differing in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and forms; the one being more compact, fairer, and of a better gloss then the other. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is found in such a Vein or Passage, firm and compact Gold, Silver, and Copper; so it is found sometimes at <hi>Krenach.</hi> There are found and seen also in a certain Vein and Passage in mixed Lime-stones, Lead, Iron, and Copper Ore in one union and juncture. And in one Mine is found Copper Ore, in another is found Silver Ore, and in another Mine is found an Iron stone. Some silver passages are found also in their natural Zachstones, which either are in the hanging or lying ones. Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver passages shew themselves also with blue gritty flowers, in hollowed fluxes, in sprinkled marbles, and carry flint-works of several colours; and these passages and clifts are full of pleasant silver-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, of yellow and green, of a colour of Goslings; the more they are mingled with such colours, the more they have wrought. there are some silver passages and veins which carry three distinct colours, after the manner of a Rainbow; where the one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour worketh in nature either more closely, or more mildly then the other, in a curious order; and the one may be discerned before the other in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing strokes, and shootings, together with their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber colours and floats, as they fell severally, and apart in each Mine-Ore.<note place="margin">Mand.

               <p>WE have in the third Chapter, where we spoke of the growth and vegetability of Metals, shewed that much silver is found pure by Nature, and that needs no refining by the Fire, but is (as they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and properly call it) <hi>statim suum,</hi> which though we have seen now of it our selves (though we have strained our abilities, and the interest of friends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure some of it) yet we are assured from other persons of sufficient veracity who have seen and handled some of it; and that it is often so found, we shall now prove.</p>

And we shall here take that eminent and pleasant relation of <hi>Wormius</hi>; who saith:
<q>That (amongst others which we shall nominate hereafter) he had an elegant, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Mass of silver that was <hi>statim sui,</hi> from the gift of the Lord <hi>Stenon Beck,</hi> the Kings Treasurer, which weighed twelve ounces, that did imitate a Vine, with branches variously spred abroad.

                  <item>4. He had another forked piece, resembling the figure of an Harts horn, to wit, pure, without any mixture of stone, or other thing; branched elegantly, and near the ends adorned with its branches and small twigs.</item>
                  <item>5. Another he had resembling an hook crooked, sharpned at both ends, of a white silver colour, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yellowish like Oker, it sticketh together in notches, plainly in its other part it was like a crooked Tooth-picker, such as by Art Workmen are wont to fashion of silver or gold, in the other part like unto a Crows bill.</item>

               <p>Now we are to handle those several sorts of silver Ore that is not pure of it self, but stands in need of refining, purging, or decocting by the fire to bring it to the perfection of silver, of which there are two sorts: I.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102655:115"/>
these are mixt with other Metals, of which we have spoken something before, and shall now add a little more.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Wormius</hi> tells us that he had <hi>vena Aeris rude argentum continens,</hi> that this was of a golden colour, shewing purple, and red spots of raw silver, having something of the rock mingled with it, in the figure of a rude mass, of a golden fire-stone, or marcasite; or in a more dilute colour, in an ash-coloured stone, having no purple spots mixt with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A black Copper Ore containing silver in it, ponderous, and smooth, tending to whiteness, by that most often betraying that which was lodged in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An Ore of iron holding silver in it, being blackish, and in certain places covered over with an iron co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; but when broken, shining fairly, with almost a silver colour, and is of an unequal colour, shewing various protuberances.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Galena</hi> containing silver of a leaden colour, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and friable, that knocked with iron doth easily fly asunder.

                  <hi>Rulandus</hi> reckons, though not this precise number, yet he enumerates divers sorts, of some of which we shall now speak. To which <hi>Agricola</hi> doth accord; from whence in likelyhood <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> had it.</p>

Of which (he saith) he had one piece excelling the rest in weight half a pound, having divers inequalities and protuberances, shining with a silver colour, and of one part having something of purple coloured raw silver admixed: which <hi>Christian</hi> the IV. with his own hand drew forth of the Mine or Pit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next that succeeds is crude silver Ore, of a leaden colour, which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Glas ertz</hi>; which appellation (he saith) <hi>Agricola</hi> doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily carp at, when plainly it hath no affinity with Glass, but doth emulate Lead, or Plumbago in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, being a little more obscure; so that by the sight of the eye, no man ignorant of metallick affairs, can discern it, though in nature they much differ. For Plumbago or Galena is composed of Lead and Stone; but rude silver Ore of a leaden colour, comprehends little earth and much silver. Plumbago in the Mortar is reduced with the Pestle into Powder; but this rude Ore will be dilated, or extended. Plumbago smitten with a hammer, or pressed with the teeth, or cut with a knife doth break, or leap asunder; but this silver

               <p n="3">3. The third is crude silver Ore that is black, called <hi>Swartz Silber ertz,</hi> and is a blackish stone, shining with frequent sparks of pure silver, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rather to have obtained a grey then a black colour. He saith he hath also a black silver Ore, to which is mixed in thin leaves pure silver, joyned with fire-stone, and silver of a leaden colour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next is crude silver Ore of an ash colour, called <hi>Graw ertz</hi>; and sometimes this aboundeth with much pure silver, sometimes it containeth little. Sometimes it shineth forth of an ash coloured stone like most small grains: of which he saith that he had two little stones, which being held to the fire did seem to sweat forth silver, and therefore was called of some, the Vegetable Moon. And that <hi>Matthesius Sermone</hi> 3. <hi>Sareptae,</hi> did call it <hi>Russ-gesprossen Silber,</hi> that is, sprouting Silver, because that being thrown into the fire, it doth shed forth pure granulated silver, like Hemp or Poppy seed. The other of the little stones that he had of this sort of Ore did contain red silver, inclining to purple. And there was that had a fire-stone joyned unto it.</p>

On the contrary, sometimes for the other part of it, which hangeth forth in a Point or Pyramis, rounded as a Top, it imbraceth some other matter then the Vein containeth: and that in a four-square form like a Die, sometime in a sexangular form as a Diamond; commonly it consisteth of many, and unequal angles as the Iris. Thus doth Nature exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Geometrie in the bowels of the Earth, by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful workmanship.</item>

               <p>Lastly, The same crude red Ore of silver is found interspersed with <hi>caeruleum,</hi> or native blue, after a beautiful manner: so that Nature seeming to be weary in perfecting of Metals, doth recreate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light her self with such colours, which Art with its greatest endeavours cannot attain unto. And these sorts of Ores were (as most of others) utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102655:118"/>
to <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> yea to <hi>Pliny</hi> and all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</p>
               <p>Of this and the preceding sorts,<note place="margin">De nat. Fossll. l. 10. p. 656.</note> that diligent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralist, <hi>Georgius Agricola,</hi> give us an account to this purpose. But (saith he) the unwrought, or crude Ore of silver that is red; if it be soft, it yields not much, or altogether none at all in goodness to the crude Ore of Silver that is of a leaden colour. But if it be hard, as in the plentifulness of silver it is overcome of the other Ore of a leaden colour, so it far excels it in most excellent beautifulness; especially when it is interspersed lightly with <hi>caeruleum,</hi> or natural blue: or hath the greatest similitude to the translucid gem the Carbuncle. For it is no doubt but that it hath grown of the matter of a perspicuous stone, mixed with the juice of that from whence silver was after to be produced. Therefore it is not onely like to the Carbuncle in colour, but also with a transparent faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But notwithstanding they differ betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for the Carbuncles for the most part do shine more fully, and this more weakly. The Carbuncles cannot be filed, but this will be wounded with the file. The Carbuncles either do not at all, or very slowly feel the fire; but this put into the fire, doth dissolve, and is made liquid. This Ore doth vary in figure no otherwise then the crude Ore of silver of a leaden colour, but more often is angular, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times square as a Die, sometimes six-angled as Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal, and sometimes it hath many angles. Also its most thin plates or leaves do adhere to the Rocks and stones. But that silver Ore that is pellucid, is like to the Carbuncle; that which is not pellucid, is like Rubrica, or Ruddle, and doth much vary in colour.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102655:119"/>
That which is most like to mean Ruddle, was digged up at <hi>Sneberg,</hi> forth of that Grove or Pit that hath the name of <hi>Levites.</hi> And (he saith) certain old men have affirmed to us with all asseveration possible, the Mine called <hi>George,</hi> besides other kinds of crude silver Ore, had yielded great store of this sort. But crude silver Ore that is of a red colour, sometimes contains in it Gold; and such (he saith) is digged up in the Mountain called <hi>Carpatum,</hi> at <hi>Baccantium</hi> and <hi>Cremni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium:</hi> and was digged forth of the Grove in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Ioachim,</hi> that is called <hi>Rich Barbary.</hi> That ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure sort which may be dilated with the stroke of the hammer, doth more abound with silver, then that which is transparent, that being smitten with the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, doth flie asunder.</p>

               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Besides the two Authors <hi>Agricola</hi> and <hi>Rulandus,</hi> persons experienced in what they writ, there are some others that do testifie that Ore is found red, and also transparent. As <hi>Iohannes Rhumelius</hi> (whom I have quoted before, though not to this very purpose) doth confess in these words:<note place="margin">Antidotar. Chym. p. 248.</note> That his <hi>Tinctura Solis</hi> was made forth of a Rubie-coloured, red, thorough-shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or transparent, bright golden Ore, &amp;c. And that his <hi>Aurum vitae</hi> was prepared forth of a certain,<note place="margin">P. 261.</note> pure, splendent, or shining Mineral; which in its first coagulation, was found of a red colour. Also that learned Author (whosoever he was) that writ the <hi>Cheiragogia Heliana</hi> doth quote <hi>Paracelsus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theatr. Chym. Vol. 4. p. 306.</note> and to this purpose he saith; The <hi>Helvetian</hi> Doctor, <hi>in libro Thesauri Thesaurorum,</hi> writing of Minerals, saith thus; Nature doth produce a Mineral in the bowels of the Earth, of which there are two sorts which are to be found in many places and coasts of <hi>Europe.</hi> But the best is in the figure of the greater World, in the rising of the Star of the Sphere of the Sun: The other in the Sotherine Star, which is in its first flower, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Star, of the gum of the Earth; and that

                     </gap>lsus,</hi> the aforesaid Author saith thus. Which words literally taken, do seem to be understood of the Ore of Gold and Mercury; because <hi>Theophrastus</hi> doth attribute to Argent vive, as to the Mother of Metals (as also the great <hi>Phraedro</hi>) all the colours of Minerals, as in the Book of the Generation of things in his Metamorphosis is to be seen. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are not a wanting, who do accommodate very stiffly this Mineral to the red translucid Ore of silver (called by the <hi>Germans Rotguldig ertz.</hi>) But I (he saith) should rather think that it doth agree to another certain kind of Mineral, that is truly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Gold, but notwithstanding is not Gold. From whence we may note these things.<list>
                     <item>1. That there were in the time of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> two sorts of Minerals to be found in divers places of <hi>Europe,</hi> that in their first coagulation were found red, in which lay all the flowers, and colours of Minerals; but he doth not speak that they were transparent, nor is it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easie to conjecture what kind of Minerals they were, and therefore we shall leave the search of them to all curious inquirers.</item>
                     <item>2. That many thought that these were the red Ore of silver, by which he plainly grants that there was a red Ore of silver, to be found and had, but thinks it not the same that <hi>Paracelsus</hi> meant or intended.</item>
                     <item>3. But conceives the Mineral that <hi>Paracelsus</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was an Ore that was fertile of gold, but not gold; which for some weighty reasons we shall not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, but leave it to be discussed by others.<note place="margin">Fascie, Chem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Corollar. c. 2. p. 41.</note> And the learned <hi>Arthur Dee</hi> (who in his younger years

had with his own eyes often seen the truth of the Art by projection made by his Father and Sir <hi>Edward Kelley</hi>) tells us that their matter was taken from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mineral mass, coagulated, lucid, red, and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, being perfect metal in the nearest power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it self vive-spermatick sulphur, and vive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature Mercury, multiplicable in it self.

                     <item>1. This mentioned by <hi>Agricola</hi> and <hi>Rulandus,</hi> that did contain silver in it, and therefore by them ranked in the number of silver Ores.<note place="margin">Lex. Chym. p. 458.</note>

                     <item>2.

                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Iosephus Quercetanus</hi> speaking of native Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nober,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102655:121"/>
tells us: That Nature did bring forth in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gold Mines in <hi>Hungary,</hi> a certain kind of mineral Cinnober most ponderous, and of a far more red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour then artificial Cinnober. And that it was so far transparent, and thorough-bright, that it was of no less price and esteem then Gold it self. And this sort, (though I have used mine ultimate endeavours) I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet could procure nor see any, though I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a learned <hi>German</hi> Physician, that there is of it in some places of his Country, but rarely to be had.</p>
                        <p>These sorts (if to be met withal, which I fear can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but with difficulty and much diligence) may doubtlesly be indifferent easily distinguished one from another. 1. For the Ore of native sulphur, though transparent, seems not to be so highly red as the other. 2. But rather yellowish; and again, it containeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quick-silver, nor any other Metal, as the other do, the one containing Quick-silver, and the other Silver. And also the combustibleness and strong smell of this Sulphur doth difference it from both the other; the red transparent Ore of Silver, being (I suppose) neither so inflamable, nor of so strong a smell; and the native Cinnober will hardly burn, and scents very little of Brimstone. 2. The transparent Ore of native Cinnober will (as I imagine) with an easie fire yield Quick-silver, which the other Ore of Silver will not.</p>

of Rubies) and that these metalline Carbuncles (as they call them) differ from the other, in that they are of less lustre, more soft, and will yield to the file, and dissolve in the fire, it may be a reasonable conjecture, here fit to be proposed to the Learned to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whether these be not of that kind that <hi>Paracelsus</hi> calleth Granates,<note place="margin">Lib. de Miner.

<q>Besides these there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother peculiar Metal, which is found in Rivers and Ponds or Fens, in the form of a grain, like a greater or less Bean. It of it self is to be melted, or fluxed, and may be hammered, but not to the aptitude of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments. This is of no great use, neither is its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety known, what it may contain. And if herein Alchymy discover nothing, it will not easily appear what at last it may be. It sustaineth many adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Silver and Gold, which do pierce into it, as into Copper or Lead. And further giveth us this note. Furthermore also some Granates are perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in the form of Crystal, in which Silver and Gold do lie hid.</q>

               <p>BEcause the Natural and Moral History of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> written by that learned and experienced <hi>Spaniard,</hi> is not in the hands of many, I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore transcribe some particulars that may be of very good use to an ingenious Mineralist, as followeth, where he saith thus:<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>The Veins, as I have said, where they find silver, runs betwixt two Rocks, which they call the Chase, whereof the one is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly as hard as flint, and the other soft and easie to break. This Metal is not always equal and of the same bounty; for you shall find in one and the same Vein, one sort of Metal very rich, which they call <hi>Cacilla,</hi> or <hi>Tacana,</hi> from which they draw much sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and another is poor, from whence they draw little. The most rich Metal of this Mountain, is of the colour of Amber, and the next is that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to black. There is other somewhat red, and other of the colour of ashes: finally of divers and sundry colours, which seem to such as know them not, to be stones of no value: But the Miners do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently know their quality and perfection, by certain signs and small veins they find in them. They carry all this Metal they draw out of these Mines upon <hi>Indian</hi> Sheep, which serve them as Asses to carry it to the Mills; the richest Metal is refined by melting in those small furnaces which they call <hi>Guayra's,</hi> for
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102655:123"/>
that is most leady, by reason whereof it is most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to melt; and for the better melting thereof, the <hi>Indians</hi> cast in a matter they call <hi>Soroche,</hi> which is a Metal full of Lead. The Metal being in these fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, the filth and earthy dross, through the force of the fire, remains in the bottom, and the Silver and Lead melt; so as the Silver swims upon the Lead, unt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l it be purified; then after they refine the Silver many times, after this manner of melting.</q>
And a little after he saith.
<q>At this day the most usual manner of refining in <hi>Potozi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ut Supra c. 12. p. 243.</note> is by Quick-silver; as also in the Mines of <hi>Cacatecas,</hi> and others of <hi>New-Spain.</hi> Then after, having related the manner of their get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and purifying of Quick silver, he sheweth how with it they refine silver Ore after this manner. We must understand (he saith) there are divers sorts of Metals, for some yield much Silver, and waste little Quick-silver; others consume much Quick-silver, and yield little Silver; and there are others which consume much Quick-silver, and yield much Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and others that consume little Quick-silver, and also yield little Silver: and as men encounter in these matters, so they grow rich or poor in their traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique. Although commonly the rich Metal yields much Silver, and consumes much Quick-silver; and likewise that which is poor yields little Silver, and consumes as little Mercury. They first beat and grind the Metal very small with Hammers and other instruments, which beat this Stone like unto Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills; and being well beaten, they searce it in a Copper searce, making the powder as small and fine, as if it were Horse-hair. These searces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well fitted, do sift thirty quintals in a day and a
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:102655:123"/>
night; then they put the powder of the Metal into the Vessels upon Furnaces; where as they anoint it and mortifie it with brine, putting to every fifty quintals of Powder, five quintals of Salt. And this they do, for that the Salt separates the earth, and filth, to the end the Quick-silver may the more easily draw the silver unto it. After they put Quick-silver into a piece of Holland, and press it out upon the Metal, which goes forth like a dew, always stirring and turning the Metal, to the end it may be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate. Before the invention of these Furnaces of fire, they did often mingle their Metal with Quick-silver in great Troughs, letting it setle some days, and did then mix it, and stir it again, until they thought all the Quick-silver was well incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the silver, the which continued twenty days and more, and at the least nine days. Since they discovered (as the desire to get is diligent) that to shorten the time, fire did much help; to incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Silver with Quick-silver the sooner, they inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted these Furnaces, whereon they set Vessels to put in their Metal, with salt and quick-silver; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath they put fire by little and little, in Furnaces made for the same purpose; so as in five or six days the quick-silver is incorporate with the silver. And when they find that the Mercury hath done his part, and assembled all the silver, leaving nothing behind, but is well imbrued as a Sponge doth Water, dividing it from the Earth, Lead, and Copper, with the which it is engendred. Then afterwards they separate it likewise from the quick-silver, the which they do in this sort; they put the Metal in Caldrons, and Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels full of Water, where with certain Wheels they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102655:124"/>
turn the Metal round about, as if they should make Mustard, and so the earth and dross goes from the Metal, with the Water that runs away: The silver and quick-silver, as most ponderous, remaining in the bottom, the Metal which remains, is like unto Sand: Then they take it out, and wash it again in great Platters of Wood, or Keelers full of Water; still drawing the earth from it, until they leave the silver and quick-silver well cleansed.<note place="margin">Ut supr. p 244, 245.</note> There slips away also some small portion of silver and quick-silver, with the earth and dross, which they call washings; the which they after wash again, and draw out the remainder. When the silver and quick-silver are cleansed, and begin to shine, and that there remains no earth, they put all the Metal into a cloth, which they strain out very forcibly, so as all the quick-silver passeth out, being not incorporate with the silver, and the rest remains as a loaf of silver, like to a mark of Almonds pressed to draw oyl. And being thus pressed, the remainder contains but the sixth part in Silver, and five in Mercury. So as if there remain a mark of threescore pounds, ten are of Silver, and fifty of Mercury. Of these Marks they make Pins (as they call them) like Pine Apples, or Sugar loafs, hollow within, the which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make of a hundred pound weight. Then to separate the silver from the quick-silver, they put it into a violent fire, which they cover with an earthen vessel like to the mold of a Sugar loaf, or unto a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin or Hood, the which they cover with coals, and set fire unto it, whereby the quick-silver exhales in smoke, the which striking against the Capuchin of earth, it thickens and distils, like unto the smoke of a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102655:124"/>
pot covered, and by a pipe like unto a limbeck they receive the quick-silver which distills, the silver re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining without changing the form, but in weight is diminished five parts of that it was, and is spungeous; which is worthy the observation. Of two of these loaves, they make one bar of silver, in weight 65 or 66 marks; and in this sort they carry it to the touch, custom and mark. Silver drawn with Mercury is so fine, that it never abates of two thousand three hundred and fourscore of alloy; and it is so excellent, that the Workmen are inforced to allay it, putting some mixture to it, as they do likewise in their Mints where as their money is stampt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the next Chapter he sheweth the manner of their making of Assays,<note place="margin">Ib. c. 13. p. 247.</note> which he describeth thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To give the alloy to every piece, they carry the bars of silver unto the Assay-master, who gives to every one his number; for that they carry many at once, he cuts a small piece of every one, the which he weighs justly, and puts them into a Cruset, which is a small vessel made of burnt bones beaten: after he placeth every crucible in his order in the Furnace, giving them a violent fire; then the Metal melteth, and that which is Lead goes into smoak, and the Copper and Tin dissolves, the Silver remaining most fine, of the colour of fire. It is a strange thing, that being thus refined, although it be liquid and molten, yet it never spills, were the mouth of the crucible turned downwards; but it remaineth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ixed, without the loss of a drop. The Assay-master knoweth by the colour, and other signs, when it is refined; then doth he draw the crucibles from the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102655:125"/>
fire, and weighs every piece curiously, observing what every one wants of his weight; for that which is of high alloy wastes but little, and that which is baser diminisheth much; and according to the waste he sees what alloy he bears, according to the which he marks every bar punctually. Their ballance and weights are so delicate, and their grains so small, as they cannot take them up with the hand, but with a small pair of Pincers: and this trial they make by Candle-light, that no air might move the ballance. For of this little the price of the whole bar depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now though this way of the refining of silver Ore by quick silver cannot, in great quantities, be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>Europe,</hi> by reason of the scarceness, and high price of quick-silver: yet in these passages of <hi>Acosta,</hi> there are many things worthy of a deep remark, and may by diligent and ingenious persons be promoted to great advantages, both in regard of severing the dross, and baser Ores from the more noble; and also in relation to the Art of testing or Assaying of Metals, which wants much of that perfection, that careful skill and observation may bring it to.</p>
               <p>But however the way of separating silver from ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Ores by quick-silver in small quantities, we have found very effectual, and cannot but commend it (if performed by a knowing and careful Artist) as the most certain way of probation of Metals, that we have known, and in some respects excelling that by Lead, the Test, and Fire. Which way of separating the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Metals from the baser, and one from another, was well known unto that learned and experienced Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher and Chymist,<note place="margin">Lib. de Separ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> who very curtly and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102655:125"/>
acutely (according to his accustomed manner) doth mention the several ways of purifying several Ores by means of quick-silver, giving therein exquisite Rules, and excellent cautions, to which I commend the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and inquisitive Artist, the mystery of which, trial and diligence may find out.</p>
               <p>But the way of separating Silver from Lead in great quantities, so as to save the greatest part of the Lead, hath been little known or practised in <hi>England,</hi> that I could ever understand, saving by one experienced person that had been in <hi>Holland,</hi> and seen it done there; and did affirm that they could separate the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the Lead, and in a Tun not lose above two hundred weight of the Lead: and that if it held above 5 l. a Tun, they would separate it with the charge of fifty shillings, and make gain by it; and to that end they bought much of our English Lead, and did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it, and so make a gain of it. And he made me a pattern of the Furnace and Vessel, such as they used, which (to me) seemed a feasible and rational way.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The whole company of common Chymists do tell us great stories of <hi>Argentum potabile,</hi> and other medicines drawn forth of this Metal, which they cry up to be excellent remedies for the <hi>Epilepsie,</hi> and other nervous distempers: but they must pardon me if I give no credit to their hyperbolizing fansies; for I dare affirm that they are nothing but vain and ignorant brags, and will perform no more then the small fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or powder of Silver laminated, which (indeed) is nothing at all, except prepared by the universal sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or <hi>Alkahest,</hi> as was that blue or azure coloured tincture or oyl, containing the saline and sulphureous part of the Metal, the mercurial and indestructible

                  </note> which <hi>Paracelsus</hi> mentioneth. And the reason of this my so positive assertion, I shall give from the experience of that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chymist <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> which may bear credit against a thousand of the others; who tells us, That the bodies of Gold and Silver are so closely shut, that for the most part they elude the whole endeavours of Artists (especially those that have not the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned key of the <hi>Alkahest</hi> to open them) so as when they think they are most of all opened, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing at all of their former bars or clausure. And that quick-silver, although it seem a tremulous and open body, yet notwithstanding nothing in the whole order of Nature, is more closely shut up then it; and therefore few of a thousand Artificers obtain effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual remedies forth of Gold, Silver, or Mercury; but the other four do more easily and freely obey the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of Operators.<note place="margin">Ut supr. p. 594.</note> And further he saith, That metallick bodies in respect of their Mercuries, are all equally shut up, with the seal of anatical homogeneity; but that their sulphurs afford us acquaintance and help, if they be rendred familiar.

               <p>So we have finished this tedious discourse of these two noble and perfect Metals of Gold and Silver, and shall now descend to the other, that are called (in comparison of these) imperfect; of which two are compact and hard, of which we shall now treat: and first of Copper.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Copper Ore
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102655:127"/>
is wrought in its own and proper stone, of good pure Salt, and over-hot-burning sulphur, through an heavenly impression into all its parts, tinged red thoroughout, not quite freed from a superfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, in an affinity with iron; because their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or houses, are set one by another, and is the reason why the one may easily be transmuted into the other.</p>
                  <p>This metalline Ore is much wrought in slat float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, which are green flinty; many times it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in a red or brown form, and is seen also like lime-stone, in black, and yellow slat-works, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Coals, in green flinty passages, in a twofold man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, either current, or in the manner of a float. Sometimes it is red and brown, mixed with a green colour: some are of a lazure colour, some of a Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-glass, flinty, and iron shot, or of a white food. The Copper Ore in its passages, is sometimes rich of Gold and of Silver; as it is accompanied with curious Zach-stones, and inclosed with passable stones, if so be that other Metals and Minerals do not intrench upon them, which corrode and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them. And Copper Ore is a slat-work also, mixed with foliated Earth, and the mercurial Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is hardly brought out of it, at, or in an ordinary melting, affords store of iron, and unripe Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>food, which rub very much the Copper in roasting, and make it unmalleable.</p>
                  <p>The richest Copper Ores are found in <hi>Hungaria, Bohemia, Silesia, Thuringia, Hassia,</hi> and <hi>Voightlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>; the like is found about <hi>Trantevan,</hi> where it is every where in the manner of a float mixed with Sand Ore; and where it breaketh vehemently in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102655:127"/>
the slat work, they call that <hi>Slat of Clifts</hi>: they are poor in silver, and such must be roasted, or calcined: in some places it breaks in a fair blue and brown co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or it looks ruddy, of a Copper-glass, and like unto green Oker: and sometimes it is white-goldish, which is called white Copper Ore. It groweth white at an effectual mixture, because at its uniting, it assumeth or taketh in much of Silver, and of Lead. It breaks also of a yellowish, and lazure-like colour, green flinted upon floats and moving passages, in lime and spongeous stones. It breaks also of a blue colour, like blue Oker; is Copper, glassy, and flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in great and huge rocky and marble passages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixed with a white marble. They are rich in silver, in green slat stones, which are clear and brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. It lieth dry and green in clifts, open caves, and passages, like green frogs insprinkled one in another, in a strange manner distinct, or parted with strange pleasant colours; which graduated works are losers in half their works; in these rocks are strange clifts of marble, and of white Veins; yellow flint is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkled, and mixed with Copper passages, which yield much Silver, have few flowers, are of a ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous form, break very flinty, of a red glass, of a green colour mixed with yellow flowers; these flints are joyned with white gold marble, of a green colour, beside the rocky passage. There is sound also Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ore which is rich of Silver, flinty and not white-goldish is of a white shining glass, mighty in dry hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low flat Mines, some whereof are mixed with iron or sorts of Wismuth, or fire-stones. At the one hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some passages, is wrought the <hi>Chrysocolla,</hi> and Copper Ore; on the other hanging of the Mine, is
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102655:128"/>
wrought pure flint, all according to the quality and condition of the Ore. And it is to be observed, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Copper Ores are usually mixed with sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, easily unite with the nether Metal, and joyn with their stones; therefore green flinty copper Ores, which carry in the drie Lead slatty passages, a black molben, are minerallish, and are not rich in silver, nor rich in species, encompassed with immature iron, and perfect Copper Ore; and some are free of it, if far separated asunder from dry mineral slats, are richer in Gold and Silver, according as the stones take in a good natured Ore, they usually entrench upon Gold and Lead Rocks, or Antimonial Ore; as also upon Iron and Silver stones. There are found also flinty passages, that have their mineral juices of Vitriol and Sulphur, some whereof partake of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, and <hi>alumen pluviosum.</hi> These commonly have the best and most Copper passages, which are least mingled with other Metals, as lime and tartareous stones, in which black floats and slats do break, are inclosed with green, and are of mild quality: at <hi>Eisleben</hi> and <hi>Mansfield,</hi> Miners put there several proper names to it very exactly, according unto their nature. Miners in <hi>Misnia</hi> know least how to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish these; the upper part of clay earth they call <hi>Putredo,</hi> in which the true earth is also; and when they come to the stones, they call it the Day-work, because they cover all the rest, and turn quite to stone. The third place they come unto, they call Night-work, because it is easily lifted, and heaved one after another, and is pure: then they come to the Cave or Hole-work, which must be hollowed, and set; here are the stones that must be broken:
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102655:128"/>
then they come unto the slat, and below that slat, they come unto the Sand-Oar, though sometimes it be overgrown at the <hi>Lockwerg,</hi> or Hole-work above the slat; then they turn unto the dead earth again. Slat and richest Copper Ore at the Silver breathing, lieth also on the rocky, horn-stony combustible Ores, which have their Gold and Silver passages of your special kind, among which there are found several forms how each of them are discerned. In <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Carinthia</hi> the passages yield Copper Ores, which Copper is very malleable, and is at a dearer rate then any is in the whole <hi>Europe</hi>; as their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals also, and especially the Vitriol there, is held to be the best, as also their Antimony is counted the best. The Vitriol hath the best and rarest vertues, which is known to true Naturalists, and experience hath found the same to be true. I speak something now, which if reason and understanding were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable, many expences, hard work, and good time could be saved; and it comes onely from hence, because Gold breaks so near it, and of the same Ores is found, where that earth is impregnated with goldish seed, and make use of the same food in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny subtile unitings. Minerals in their generating qualit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is a remarkable difference found among Minerals which have their descent from Gold and Silver Ores, and partly from Copper Ores; they are Minerals and Metals, each have their particular nature, and

being, among which some Ores look green, and bleach at the day, and grow near other Metals; but their stones are most like unto Lead-stones, some whereof are grosser, softer, and harder then others, and some are more obscure, dark, muddy, and some more green, and so forth.</p>

But this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them both, that the male doth not suffer it self again to be destroyed, and the female doth not any more send forth dross or scorias; and they are different in their fusion and malleability, as Iron and Steel differ. And also if this separation be used, either of them being severed into its nature, there do arise two Metals different one from another in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, species, kind, and propriety. And further saith, that though commonly the male and female go together, yet they ought to be separated.</q>

That where plenty of the clifts and sissures of stones are, that shew of a yellow and blewish colour, there is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Copper Ore. 2. That whensoever we find stones of a blue colour in or among other stones of a grey colour, shadowed with little Veins of a green colour, then this is a certain token of the best and most plentiful vein of Copper Ore. 3. That when we see the rocks or stones in the Mountains to shine like Talk, which is nothing else but the birth or folia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted off-spring of a <hi>Marchasite,</hi> or fire-stone, that it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the next discovery of an hidden vein of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ore. 4. Furthermore, when the vitriolate wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters flowing from the Mountains, are of a somewhat green colour, and of a metallick smell, and which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver over the bottoms of the flouds or rivers, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain putrid, green, tenuious, and slimy matter, as with a skin; it doth shew that the Mountains from whence the water comes, are pregnant with Copper Ore.</p>
               <p>Now for the sorts of Copper Ore, they are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, the one when pure Copper is found in the Mine, which is <hi>statim suum,</hi> and needs not to be purified by the fire, and the other must be refined, and that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ere it be brought into pure clear Copper.</p>

But <hi>Agricola</hi> saith, If it be found mixed with the substance of the stone, it is not pure; that is to say, it is not <hi>statim suum,</hi> and much less most pure, but is purified by the help and workmanship of the Furnace. but he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith, I do not know that great masses of Copper, as there hath been found of Silver, have been digged up; but rather certain little masses of a very various figure: to wit, sometimes in the figure of drops or isicles, of little rods, or little rundlets, or globes. Also its most small leaves or plates do cleave to the stones. But this native Copper, for the most part, containeth somewhat of Silver in it.<note place="margin">Mus. Worm. l. 1.

of most small grains joyned together, by reason of which it was very brittle and friable, yet it did cleave together, and was hardly to be separated into smaller pieces.

Some of the Ore I have, which is like a greyish kind of <hi>Marchasite,</hi> glittering with some goldish sparks, and very ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.

                  <hi>Wormius</hi> tells us thus much, saying, Crude Copper Ore obtaineth various differences, in respect of its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, consistence, goodness, and coction. For the most part it is drawn forth of a <hi>Marchasite,</hi> or Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, or forth of the <hi>lapis scissilis,</hi> which I take to be some sort of that which we call slat stones. Among thirteen peculiar kinds (he saith) I find great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in respect of goodness and fertility, though they all arise forth of a granulated fire-stone or <hi>Pyrites.</hi> 1. One kind of this golden <hi>Pyrites</hi> is plainly barren, yielding no Copper at all when it is excocted in the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102655:131"/>

<list>
                           <item>1. Of which the first is the crude Pyrites or fire-stone it self, of a golden colour, as it is digged forth of the Mine, and rich with copper.</item>
                           <item>2. The second is of the Ore, burned by the space of fourteen days, or three weeks. For then the mass is rendred copper-like, of a blackish colour, forth of which <hi>viride aes</hi> doth flower.</item>
                           <item>3. Thirdly the Ore so excocted and fluxed, that it is reduced into thick plates, which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Ruffer-stein.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>4. Fourthly, These plates being put into other Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, are burned six or eight times, and are carried forth of one Furnace into another, until they acquire a rubicund colour; this they call <hi>Robber werk.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>5. Fifthly again, it is excocted into a spongious and light matter, black and porous, which they call Raw copper.</item>
                           <item>6. Sixthly, It is melted again, and then becomes pure copper, fit for uses. So many mutations it is meet that the Ore of copper undergo, before it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pure Copper.</item>

Which is hard, tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the hammer, and to be drawn forth into thin plates or leaves, which being tinged with gall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes like gold, and is called of <hi>Pliny, Aurum Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> because the Players did use it for Garlands and Crowns about their heads; which is that which we commonly call Horse Gold, used for Embellishments in Pageants, Plays, Shews, and such like pastimes. And of this sort some is more malleable then other, and will suffer it self to be drawn forth further; and some is of a deeper, and some of a lighter colour. Again, There is by Art made divers sorts of this <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalcum</hi> or Brass, some that (as I believe) will abide the hammer in some measure, of which is made fire-tongs, fire-shovels, snuffers, Mathematical instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of many other sorts and kinds, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well reckon up. Some that will hardly abide the hammer, but either cleave, or break asunder, which is called <hi>Aes Caldarium,</hi> and we call it Pot Metal; of which is made Pots, Pans, Chafing-dishes, Candle-sticks, and abundance of such like utensils, some of a fair golden colour, some more whitish, and some more inclining to redness, according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the commixture. Again, Copper is mixed
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102655:134"/>
often with Iron, Lead, and some other materials, of which is made bullets for great Cannon, Bells, and many other such like things. Sometimes they mix a certain proportion of Copper and Tin, of which lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bells for House-Clocks, and little Alarum-bells, and some things else are made; and those Bells will sound sharp and shrilly. And of this Composition may be made fine Seeing-glasses and Burning-glasses, if they be well polished and smoothed, and made of a right figure and bigness, of which I have seen divers sorts. And with a mixture of Tin and Brass are made Vessels that appear very like unto Silver: all which Compositions and many more of this Metal of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with other Metals and Minerals, we shall leave as sooner to be learned by practice, and sight, from Artificers and Mechanicks, then from Books and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As for the making of Copper white it is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sundry ways, some do it with Talk, some with the <hi>Magne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>snick</hi> and <hi>Nitre</hi>; the way of doing which may be found in many Authors, as also in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts, and written Processes; but I do not account the knack so much worth, as to be at labour to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it. For both Copper when it is whitened, or made <hi>Orichalcum,</hi> or of a golden colour, will with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fluxing, and keeping long in the fire, burn out the Minerals commixt with it, and return to red Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per again as it was.</p>
               <p>Now whatsoever common Chymistry may boast of the medicaments prepared from Copper, as its Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Tincture, Salt, Crocus, or the like, we have not seen, or experienced any that do deserve any great commendation, and therefore shall forbear to say any
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102655:135"/>
more of them. Onely we shall add this; That even Vitriol, such of the blue transparent sort that is brought forth of <hi>Germany,</hi> and commonly called <hi>Roman Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> and by Quacks, and others, called <hi>Lapis Coelestis,</hi> which is of great affinity with Copper; nay, indeed the very off-spring of <hi>Venus</hi>; and that which many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the best, that holds the most Copper, is a most noble Mineral, and even of it self affords much help to an expert Chirurgion; for it is one of the mildest Corrosives that an Artist can use for making of Fonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels or Issues, and is far better then any actual Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and serves better then any thing else for stopping fluxes of Bloud, especially in Amputation, or dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, where the great Arteries and Veins are laid open. And the Powder of it is very prevalent in cleansing old ulcers and sores, and by its astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency leaves a good ground for breeding new flesh, and healing. The waters of it also are exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for many distempers in the Eyes, sore and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med mouths, and for all Erysipela's and the like. And the Phlegm, and oyl of it, as also the Colchotar freed from its Salt, will do a Chirurgion much credit in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate ulcers and old sores, though but prepared by the way of common Chymistry, if he know how to apply them with judgment and discretion. I speak this to encourage young practitioners, having my self had experience of this Mineral for near forty years, in all things that Chirurgery can require properly to use it in. Yet notwithstanding as to Medicines that may be taken inwardly, prepared the common way, I have not seen any such effects by them as may any way answer the high Encomiums that many Authors that write of common Chymistry, do attribute unto
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102655:135"/>
them; for except that the oyl or spirit of Vitriol (as some call it) mixed with liquors of Juleps, doth in some measure allay, and abate the heat and thirst in Fevers, and hot distempers, and sometimes to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Epileptical diseases, I have known or seen little effect by it. The <hi>Vitriolum vomitivum</hi> (I confess) being duely prepared, and purified, is a laudable Vomit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Phlegm, and such like crude humours annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and over-burthening the stomach; and is a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of much efficacy and value against the Worms, and all Verminous generations.</p>
               <p>But there are far higher and more noble Medicines to be had from <hi>Venus,</hi> or Copper (if we may trust the writing of <hi>Helmont,</hi> whose veracity and experience few learned men will question or doubt of) then any of those that are prepared by common Chymistry; by the help of that immortal and immutable liquor the <hi>Alkahest,</hi> by which (he declareth) that the body of Copper is totally destroyed, and the external Sulphur and Salt (in which the medical Virtue lies) is separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the internal Sulphur that is inseparable from the Mercury, either by Art or Nature remaineth, by which it may be brought into a white metal. But of this as far as by the <hi>Alkahest</hi> the medical sulphur is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it, by which that universal medicine called by <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and <hi>Helmont Mercurius Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticus,</hi> and <hi>Aurum Horizontale,</hi> by mixing with Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate prepared after <hi>Vigo</hi>'s order, is made; we shall give here, as far as concerneth the Copper in <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi> own words, and the rest we shall mention when we come to speak of Mercury; and thus he saith.
<q>For the Sulphur of <hi>Venus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Lithias. l. 1. c. 8. p. 64.</note> after its separation from its body, and arising again, is made as it were a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102655:136"/>
sulphur, and therefore it tingeth the sulphur of Mercury (which in the powder of <hi>Iohannes de Vigo,</hi> by corrosive Mineral spirits is extroverted) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and do mutually imbrace themselves in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable bed: and therefore the force of both sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs do then stand outwardly.</q>
And a little further he saith.
<q>Therefore the fire of <hi>Venus,</hi> is not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vitriol, however exquisitely rectified: But this fire is the volatile sulphur of the Copper, in form of a green oyl, more sweet then honey, and fully se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the mercurial body of it Copper. But the remaining part of the Copper doth abide white, nor ever waxing green with rust, as neither any more of the number of the seven Metals; because it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new and anonymous Metal. But the fire of <hi>Venus</hi> cannot be had, except by the full or plenary destruction of the Copper, and the volatization of the mercurial body of the <hi>Venus</hi> it self. Which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be made volatile in the form of oyl, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing with an easie labour, it is after again reduced into a white unknown Metal, and extensible under the hammer. But the fire or sulphur of <hi>Venus</hi> is not any more reduced into a Metal by it self, because as no sulphur is a Metal, so every metallick Mercury is a true Metal. For the Adeptists teach, that the sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous part of a Metal cannot be separated from its mercurial and metallick body, except by its total destruction; which therefore (although abusively) they call elemental; because, to wit, in Metals there are two sulphurs; one therefore they deservedly call external, the other internal. But in the proposed terms of Copper (he persuadeth) to contemplate that which is internal, which doth fix the body in
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102655:136"/>
the white anonymous and mercurial Metal, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ductible under the hammer: when otherwise the Mercury without the Sulphur could never be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated into a Metal. But that external sulphur of <hi>Venus,</hi> is that green sweet oyl which cannot be brought back again into a Metal. Therefore the <hi>Symmistae</hi> or Secrataries of this Philosophy, do univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally testifie, that the external sulphur cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from its body, no not by fire in imperfect Metals, but also the mercurial part doth perish to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it. Therefore seeing that external sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur (such as is drawn forth of Copper) is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the perfection of the Metal: but that sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is added of God to the Copper. Therefore it is necessary that that sulphur of <hi>Venus</hi> should have its ends, conducing to the necessities of ungrateful man, to wit, for humane infirmities, above all the dignity of metallick perfection.</q>

We are to note that this fire, or sulphur of <hi>Venus</hi> when volatized and separated from its white mercurial anonymous body, is in the form of a green oyl, never again to be reduced into a metallick body, and that in this the whole medical virtue lies.<note place="margin">C. de Metal. p. 7, 8.</note> And this is doubtless the same green oyl that <hi>Paracelsus</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Separatione Elementorum,</hi> saith is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether green, and drawn from the body of <hi>Venus</hi> left white, that may be again reduced into a white Metal, that it cannot be known under what species is falleth.

For these kind of Sulphurs, because they are farther distant from humane Nature then the whole company of Vegetables, and in the mean time do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain notable gifts from God the giver of them; so also they most fully and pertinaciously resist, that from the digestive faculty they bend not into the Commonwealth of Aliments, and therefore they do preserve their native powers free and unbroken, to wit, the <hi>Crasis</hi> or temperament of the Minerals doth remain whole or compleat, and more fit to disperse their ray into <hi>Duumviratum,</hi> the seat of the Soul. For hitherto the sulphur of Minerals under <hi>Vulcan,</hi> or the Fire, do obtain their highest complement of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Physicians.

For there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sulphurs, to which being corrected and perfected, the whole company of diseases do hearken: whose plurality as it were is contracted into the unity of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> as into the fist of a man fighting. From whence we may note:

                     <item>1. That the farther a Medicine is from being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or brought into aliment, the more it is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

                     <item>2. The chief point in curing diseases, consists not so much in the purging of humours, as in the pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Archeus.</hi>

                     <item>3. That the chiefest medicaments for curing the generality (if not all diseases) consists in mineral sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, especially when they are despoiled of their strange and virulent force, which every Artist ought to labour to attain unto.</item>
                     <item>4. That one of these chief sulphurs is this of <hi>Venus,</hi> before spoken of; another is the sulphur of Antimony, which doubtless must be prepared by the Alkahest; for those two sorts that are prepared by common Chymists, whereof the one is fixed by a <hi>Lixivium</hi> or <hi>Alcali</hi>; and the other volatile, of another way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, though they will do some pretty things, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which is volatile; yet come they far short of the vertues of that of <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Paracelsus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations: for this sulphur I take to be his <hi>Tinctura Lili Antimonialis,</hi> and account it one of the <hi>Arcana's</hi> of <hi>Paracelsus</hi>:<note place="margin">Arcan. Parac. p. 790.</note> for he saith, In the third place is the tincture of <hi>Lili</hi> also Antimonial, almost of the same efficacy with the former (which is his <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi> which is the off-spring of the whole <hi>Stibium</hi>) although of less force. The last Mineral sulphur that he most respecteth, is that of the <hi>Glaura</hi> of <hi>Augurellus,</hi> which hath no other proper name; and what Mineral it is, many make a great doubt; and truly all I dare reveal of it is, that it is a very common and known Mineral, and of a metallick root and principle, if not the very root of all Metals and Minerals: but I would not have the Reader suppose that I mean it to be (as many that
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102655:138"/>
think themselves very knowing, do imagine) native Mountain <hi>Cinnober</hi>; for I must assure them it is not, for that is not the root of Metals, as the <hi>Glaura</hi> is. But it cannot be better known then by that apposite descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that learned <hi>Augurellus</hi> hath given it.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We shall here with <hi>Helmont</hi> wish all ingenious Students, and Searchers after Natures Secrets, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider of, and ponder this white anonymous Metal of Copper, after the external sulphur is separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it, that it remaineth a true and real Metal still; and that the external sulphur of Metals is not anatically homogeneous, nor essentially necessary to the constitution of that which may be truly called, and is a Metal. And if they heedfully weigh this, and compare it with what <hi>Helmont</hi> elsewhere saith of common Quick-silver; that all of it hath in it less or more of an external Sulphur, that may be separated from it: as also with what <hi>Paracelsus</hi> saith in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Book of <hi>The Separation of Elements,</hi> that though the sulphurs of the seven Metals being separated from their mercurial parts, and are of divers colours, which he there describeth; yet that the mercurial part of all, or any one of them, doth after that separation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main white, and may be reduced into a metallick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which cannot be known of what species any of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102655:139"/>
them are of. If this be well considered, it will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that the Adeptists were not men led by Opina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fansie, (as many that would seem Masters of no little Learning, do vainly dream and object) but men that fundamentally and experimentally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the nature of Metals, and the subject they writ of, otherwise then thousands that are, and have been rigid censurers of them and their Works; but blind men are not fit to judge of colours. And further, if all Metals when divested of their external and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible sulphurs, be and remain Metals still, although of a white colour; as appeareth plainly from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable experience and authority of these two persons; then let the Artist and Learned consider what is the difference among them one from another. Is it specifical, or only gradual? Let them speak that are fit to judge, and by this those that can understand and take it, may perceive what that transmutation is that the Philosophers speak and write of, and will open to the Learner the true way he is to walk in, and the real end that Alchymy aims at. And above all it will open the reasons of that most assured and true maxim of theirs, which is, that <hi>omnia metalla in suo interiori sunt Sol &amp; Luna.</hi> Compare this with what we have said before of the Hematine Metals of Gold and Silver. So we will conclude this tedious discourse of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, willing the Reader to look upon what <hi>Sebastian Munster</hi> hath said in his Geography,<note place="margin">Geograph, c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Aerc. p. 8.</note> concerning Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and its kinds; and so we shall descend to the next of the harder sort of Metals, which is Iron.</p>

                  <p>Iron is a metallick body, much livid, little red, hard and participating of a whiteness not pure. For if a fixt earthy sulphur be commixed with <hi>Argent-vive</hi> fixed, and earthy, and both these be not pure, but of a livid whiteness, if the sulphur bear sway, it becomes Iron. In brief, if the <hi>Argent-vive</hi> shall be porous, earthy, and impure, and the sulphur also impure, foetid, and earthy, and of a fixt substance,<note place="margin">De Mineral. p. 348.</note> Iron is generated. <hi>Paracelsus</hi> saith of it thus: But on the contrary, Iron is generated of a sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, Salt, and Mercury; of all the least fluxible, contrary to the nature of Tin and Lead; and is coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated into an hard Metal, and is coupled in it self. For in one two Metals are conjugated, to wit, Iron and Steel: Iron is the female, and Steel the male. And this conjugation is like to that wherein Gold and Silver, to wit, the male and female, do also grow up together. So they may be separated one from another, the female into her sex, and the male into his also. And the male may be imployed to its uses, and the

                     <hi>Basilius Valentinus</hi> gives us its description, and the manner of its Ore lying after this order. Iron-stone and Iron Ore is wrought in its Mine-stone, according to the heavenly influence of <hi>Mars.</hi> For he is <hi>Trinus Magnus,</hi> the great Lord of War, and an instrument whereby others are forced and compelled: of an hard earthly impure sulphur, of putrefied Salt, and gross Mercury; which three principal pieces in their juncture mix much of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, therefore it is a difficult labour to mollifie Iron with, or in the fire, carrying much of impurity, by reason of its sulphur; and above other Metals, it hath a deep, red, quick Spirit, which if it be taken from <hi>Mars,</hi> then is the Iron gone also, leaveth again a putrid earthliness. Iron is not easily mixed or joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other Metals, or united in the casting. Iron hath a threefold partition, and several parts in its earthly Ore, namely a magnet, a quick metalline Ore, which hath its quality from quick Mercury, and must hold communion and affinity with Iron, must be quickned and renewed with Iron filings, in which he lieth like an Hedge-hog, and is indued of <hi>Sol</hi> in Nature with glorious gifts and Adamantine vertues; at one place and side it attracteth, and at the other side it refuseth; which vertues may be augmented and increased in it. A true type of just judgment, it sheweth after the Sun the true hour in the body of the Compass, by Water and by Land.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Steel, the hardest and purest, most mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable Iron, of its proper light draining place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it lieth close tied and knit together in all its parts most compactedly, which in all Iron-works is usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put to the edge and point.</p>

                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:102655:140"/>
Thirdly, there comes the common Iron Ore, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered together by its earthly sulphur; which three ministred good thoughts to the first expert Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list, that Master of Mine-Works, <hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi> who made his three principles in all things, and made his dimensions in the Mines in three parts, in which such metalline Ore was: he found at first the Iron-stone wrought in several ways, namely upon standing pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, and floats, fallings, and proper pieces tinged after the four Elements, and colours of the Rain-bow. Then he considered exactly its flowers, according to the condition of each stone-work, how and out of what the Iron may most conveniently be melted, and what manner of instruments may be used thereunto, where it may best and most fitly be wrought; for its Ore affords a threefold ferocity and wildness, which are useful; as namely, Glass-heads, which are like a sharp blood-stone, breaking in the manner of a skull, are scaly, and brown spissie. Secondly, The brown stone out of which is made Glass, and iron-colour. Thirdly, Granulate iron-filings in the float work; which is so hard, that it can scarcely be forced to be gotten off, or be brought to right; and when the iron-stone is come to its perfectness, then it breaketh off by piece-meal, through the Stone, and Rock, that there are found whole mines of iron-stone, such is the Iron Ore in <hi>Styria.</hi> The best iron-stone is black, or red-brown, sometimes it inclineth to a yellowishness, some is of a Cherry-brown in the floats and stocks, some are black, and small spissie, some yellowish, which glittereth among the rest, like a Copper stone, of a brown black marble, and of a fair Glass; some looks like separated float work throughout the whole

Mine, some is cloddy and hoary in clayish fields, which only is called the driving, is as the sand-stone, most hurtful unto Gold, because it affordeth most of the slacks, and very little of Iron. Some sticks in the grey clay, which affords most malleable Iron, but is of a brownish colour. There breaks also good iron-stone in tartareous and limy Mines; and the most running is on the standing passages, in cristy sandy Dalk stones. The gross clift stones break some in their slats. It usually breaks also in the fore and after Mine-works, where some of it lieth off-washed among the Roasts, like a brown earth, and on the day there is no Ore so common as the Iron-stone; because it assumeth, and taketh in other Ores, and setteth it thorough: thus often it changeth its colour and nature; after it there ensues Glass-heads, Hemasites, Brown Stone, Osemund, Bolus, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Red Oker, and Iron-shell, all these assume the nature of Iron; and the Iron-stone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the highest Metals, Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Lead, whereby it groweth untoward; but Gold and Silver are not hurtful unto it, they make it malleable; that which is mixed with Copper, or with other poor Metal, easily falls asunder, is brittle; of the same condition is Iron flint, producing out of many passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges an huge flint, partly porous like unto a black slat, which beside the Iron-stone, yieldeth another grosser or subtiler Iron. Thus the Iron-stone is associable unto other stones, be they metalline, or mineral. At <hi>Musbach</hi> there is Copper shot Iron, which hath a Lead joyning thereunto. Founders must be expert to deal with such Ores in their melting. Iron-stones have in many Countries decreased, all other metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line

               <head>CHAP. XX. Of the several sorts of Iron-stone, or Ore, and of Medicines prepared forth of this Metal.</head>
               <p>OF Iron there are two kinds, one which is native, being found such in the Mines, the other that which is excocted. The pure Native Iron, that is found so, of the <hi>Germans</hi> called <hi>Gediegen Eisen,</hi> (<hi>Wormius</hi> saith) is found in the Mine,<note place="margin">Mus. Worm. l. 1. Sect. 3. c. 6. p. 23.</note> either like grains, or a mass. That which was like a mass (he saith) was found in many places in <hi>Norway:</hi> one kind sharp, rough, and very porous, tincted without with rust; but when it was broken, the genuine colour of Iron did shine forth, which also within a short time would be covered with rust. And that he had lately received such like clods or pieces from <hi>Island.</hi> That he had another mineral piece, whose third part was the best and pure Iron, of which he had a little square portion of the length and weight of an ounce. That it was black, porous, and compounded of small lamels or plates unequally, being disposed like unto Talk, and while it was turned towards the Sun, would shew a Violet colour. That there were many other pieces shewing the best Iron, for the most part black of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and ponderous, which did not stand in need of a
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102655:142"/>
longer description.<note place="margin">Lex Alchym. p. 208.</note> We shall add some sorts of pure native iron to these, named by <hi>Rulandus.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Pure Iron, of its own colour, found in its own Vein or Mine, in a white flint.</item>
                  <item>2. Pure Iron found in <hi>Styria</hi> in the sand of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</item>
                  <item>3. A vein of Iron at <hi>Gishubeliah,</hi> of a liver colour, solid, pure, and ponderous.</item>
               </list>
               <p>These are the sorts of Iron found pure, that we in particular can find recorded by any Authors of credit, which may be sufficient to clear the matter, that pure native Iron may be found, which we commend to all inquisitive Miners to search after, that they may be able to satisfie themselves, and others of the truth in this particular, seeing we have seen none such to aver it of our own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now for the several sorts of Iron-stone, Ore, or Earth, (for there are of all these sorts, that yield Iron plentifully) there are so many named by Authors, and also such plenty and variety found in his Majesties Dominions, that we account it needless to enumerate them, being so commonly and vulgarly known. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we shall say thus much, that of those sorts that we have, or have seen gotten in <hi>England,</hi> some are of a black colour, and ponderous; some more brown, and reddish; some more yellowish, and some of a grey whitishness, that all yield plenty of indifferent good Iron. The Veins or Ore of Iron, when they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, do melt so that they may be poured out, which when it is cooled, the dross and recrements being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, it is heated in the fire, and doth grow so soft, that it may be beaten with the hammer, and doth suffer it self to be extended into Plates, and sometimes into
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102655:142"/>
very thin ones, as are those that are after covered over with Tin, and called commonly <hi>Long-lane</hi> Tin, and Plate; of which are made very many utensils for houshold, and divers other uses, though they last not long, but the Tin weareth from off them, and then the Iron rusteth, and so they soon decay. But Iron thus excocted and depurated, is not all of one sort of goodness: for some is very tough and limber, which is accounted the best; some is Copperish, rough, or brittle, and frangible; of which they make bullets for Cannons, and cannot commodiously be beaten forth with the hammer, but is burst, and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted more base. Another sort holds it self in a middle manner, and may in part be beaten forth with the hammer in great Works, in part not. But we here in <hi>England</hi> do for the most part make choice of Iron according to the several uses men intend it for, and so sometimes choose <hi>English</hi> Iron, sometimes that which was brought from beyond the Seas, and both of these of divers sorts, which are better known to the Merchants and Mechanicks that work in this Metal, then to me.<note place="margin">Mus. Worm. ut supr.</note> Now for Steel, which <hi>Paracelsus</hi> makes but the male, and Iron the female; some make it to have a proper Vein, or Ore of it self, others to be but the purest part of iron, drawn from the other that is more drossie and earthy: Of which <hi>Wormius</hi> saith, Of Iron more often molten and purged, is made Steel; which also is brought forth by nature in some certain places. Elsewhere Iron is often being hot extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in certain waters, that thereby it may be made very hard, but ever thereby loseth much of its weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rulandus</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Lex. Alchym. p. 448.</note> that a pure Vein of Steel, was
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102655:143"/>
found in <hi>Voidtland</hi> near to <hi>Fichtelberg,</hi> and also that it was excocted forth of a Steel Ore, as also drawn forth of pure Iron. Our Workmen at the Forge do usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinguish it into two sorts; one they call <hi>Coldsel,</hi> and another <hi>Redsel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, as to this point I shall onely mind the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in this metal of a passage in <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi>

For they hiding Iron plates in the earth, did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be there so long, until the weaker part of the Iron was wasted, and the stronger remained. Then of that they made Swords, and other Arms for the use of the War. To these thus made, all things or Arms would yield, that neither shield nor helmet, nor any other Armour could resist them. And I have known some that have found old rusty Knives that had long lain in the earth, that being grinded anew, would cut better then the best new Knife that could be found. But this I leave to be considered of by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers.</p>
               <p>For the medicaments that are by common Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry prepared forth of this Metal, they are either used in outward applications in Chirurgery, or are inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly administred. For those that are used externally, as the <hi>Crocus martis,</hi> it will in some measure help to stop small Haemorhages or fluxes of bloud by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinative quality, or help phlegmatick and watery ulcers by desiccation. Also there is an oyl made sometimes of it, with the help of Salt Armoniack, that is a very fierce and painful Corrosive, but will (for those that can abide it) cleanse rotten and filthy ulcers, and painful and virulent scabs: but this that seemeth
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:102655:143"/>
of an oyly substance, will with long keeping decay; and the Salt will separate it self in the form of Water, and leave the parts of the Steel, as a red earth, or Crocus; because it was but a forced confusion or mixture, and not an homogeneal union, nor any true oyl from the Steel, but wrought by the sharpness and pungency of the Salt, more then by its own nature, except some of the atoms of its Salt might commix with the Sal Armoniack. But there is another oyl of <hi>Mars</hi> to be prepared according to the order set down by that learned and experienced Chirurgion, <hi>Felix Wurtzius,</hi> which appeareth in the true form of an oyl, and will swim upon the top of water; that will much honour a Chirurgeon in curing malignant and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ulcers.</p>
               <p>Now for the medicaments prepared forth of it by common Chymistry, neither the <hi>Crocus</hi> for astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, or staying fluxes, nor the <hi>Aperitive Crocus</hi> (as they call it) for opening obstructions, will perform half so much as they have been commended for. But I rather extol the <hi>Sal martis</hi> (if prepared by a careful and expert Chymist) then either of the two former; a Medicine that some of the most learned Physicians that <hi>England</hi> had, have much praised, and have gotten both profit and credit by it. And I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that those medicaments drawn forth of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, so extremely extolled by <hi>Basillus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Butler. p 594.</note> were not had but by the help of their universal dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or <hi>menstruum,</hi> though they do not openly declare as much. For the later of them saith thus. And that nothing doth so equally gloriously work upon the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical moysture, as the first <hi>ens</hi> or Being of Copper; nor that is more benigne, or beneficial to long life,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:102655:144"/>
then the sulphur of Vitriol, which notwithstanding doth indigitate the sulphur of the Philosophers. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this with what we have before written concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sulphur of <hi>Venus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Mars,</hi> though most vile in price, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised by reason of a numerous issue, notwithstanding is not reputed by <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> the last in a war-like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

               <head>CHAP. XXI. Of the description of Lead, its Ores, Mine, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and striking passages.</head>
               <p>NOw we come to the softer Metals, of which Lead is the most soft of any that is in an hard and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated form (not to mention Quick-silver that is fluid) and is by the <hi>Latines</hi> called <hi>Plumbum nigrum,</hi> to distinguish it from Tin, which they called <hi>Plumbum album</hi>; and from <hi>Bismuth</hi> or Tin-glass, which they called <hi>Plumbum Cinereum,</hi> because of its colour. And many accounted these three sorts to be all but Lead, and so to differ but in some degrees, accidents, and the like: but omitting this opinion, we shall handle them as distinct Metals.</p>
               <p>And this Metal which they called <hi>Plumbum nigrum,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> call simply <hi>Bley,</hi> and we Lead, without any other addition,<note place="margin">Lex. Alchym. p. 263.</note> and of <hi>Rulandus</hi> is thus largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. Lead is a metallick body, livid, earthy, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:102655:144"/>
ponderous, participating of a little whiteness, and hath much of an earthy substance, and is turned into Tin by lavation, or washing. From hence it is manifest that Tin is a certain thing more perfect then Lead. And Lead hath more of the substance of fixed sulphur to its composition then Tin hath. For Lead is an impure body, imperfect, procreated of <hi>Argent-vive,</hi> not fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, earthly, and feculent, a little white in appearance, but red in secret, and compounded of such a like adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible sulphur in some part. It wants purity, fixation, colour, and ignition. And to this doth <hi>Eucelius</hi> agree word for word, as though <hi>Rulandus</hi> had transcribed it from him,<note place="margin">Mus. Worm. l. 1. Sect 3. c. 7. p. 124.</note> as in likelihood he did. <hi>Wormius</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it thus: Lead is an imperfect Metal, soft, livid, ponderous, not sustaining the fire long, infecting the hands of those that handle it with blackness, generated of much crude Mercury, and impure and foetid sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and comes nearest unto Gold in weight and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. And <hi>Caesalpinus</hi> saith:<note place="margin">De Metal. l. 3. c. 7. p. 180.</note> For Lead doth imitate Gold in heaviness, and giveth forth no sound, therefore they call it mute. I desire those that have opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, exactly to try whether it come near to Gold in weight or not, for I much doubt of it.</p>
               <p>It is not amiss here to give the differences betwixt white Lead, or Tin, Bismuth, Tin-glass, or ash-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Lead, and this common Lead, which they call black Lead; according as <hi>Agricola</hi> hath set them down:<note place="margin">Lib. Fossil. 7. p. 644, 645.</note> who saith; The white Lead or Tin, before it be polished, doth shine much; but polished, much more; the ash-coloured much less, the black not at all. The white is more perfect and precious then the black, the ash-coloured holds the mean betwixt them. The black is most easily melted, and doth not long indure
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:102655:145"/>
in the melting-pot, nor conserve its species, but is partly changed into that which we call the Spume of Silver, partly into that we call the foam of Lead, or <hi>Molybditis.</hi> The black is soft, and therefore most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily handled, and dilated with the hammer; the white is more hard, the ash coloured most hard of all. The white is tough, the black fragile, the ash-coloured most fragile of all. The black doth not give forth any sound, the ash-coloured doth sound, the white doth make a noise or crash. The white is light, the black is ponderous, the ash-coloured keeps a mean betwixt them. The vapour of Vinegar doth make Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>russ both of the white and black, being corroded. That white is made of the white, or of Tin, is called <hi>Spanish</hi> White, that which is made of the black, is called white Lead, or Ceruss. Also of the black being burned, or calcined, is made a sort of artificial Minium, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of an high red colour, which we call red Lead; and sometimes of a lower yellowish red, which we call <hi>Calx Saturni.</hi> The white hath more of driness, the black more of moisture. Therefore of the ash-coloured and the white, without the mixture of the black, ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, or utensils can hardly be made; but with the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the black they may be made easily, as are many and sundry sorts, and all our common Pewter. There is also made of Tin by calcining, a Powder which the Artificers call <hi>Putty,</hi> of great and excellent use for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing or polishing any instruments made of Iron, Steel, Copper, Brass, Glass, and the like. As also a very fine curious powder of a yellow colour, called <hi>Masticot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. Agricol l. Fossil 9 p. 651.</note> of singular use for Painters. Also that which we commonly <hi>Litharguron</hi>; adding, because that some of it is of a white silver colour, and some of a
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:102655:145"/>
more red-goldish colour, that it is Litharge (and that, to speak in <hi>English,</hi> is but stone-silver, or stone of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) of Gold and Silver, when it is known to all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced persons, that it is nothing of Gold or Silver, but onely the Lead, that in the separating of the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from it, is by the force of the fire, and the Bellows blown into, and (being cooled) hardened into those lumps like stones, and may all or the greatest part of it, be again melted down into Lead as it was before. Now we shall shew something what <hi>Basilius Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> saith of this Metal,<note place="margin">Last Will and Test. c. 7 p. 95, 96, &amp;c.</note> its Ores, and the manner of their passages in the earth.</p>
               <p>The Lead Ore (he saith) is wrought under that heavenly impression of the black and cold <hi>Saturn,</hi> by an undigested waterish Sulphur, impure Mercury and Salt. First, there is wrought generally a brittle glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Lead colour in that Ore, which is called Glass Ore (the <hi>Germans</hi> call it <hi>Glantz ertz,</hi> because being broken, it is smooth and shining, though <hi>Agricola</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the reason of this appellation of his Countrymen; but without reason, for they call it not by this name because of its transparency, but because it is smooth, and shining, as that which we call Pottern Ore is) breaking in many rocks, containeth Gold and Silver, yields gross and lasting Mine-works. Some Lead-stones are very broad, because Glassie Ores are mixed with it, with flints, or marchasites, partly they are glassie, red-goldish, white-goldish, silvery, Copper-glassie, and of Copper. Some Lead Ores turn to a blue colour, mixed with a white transparency, like unto a shot Bolus; some is like unto the Stone-salt and Allom; some are of a dark green like unto green floats, which lie gritty in a yellow or Glue-coloured clay;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:102655:146"/>
some are of a brown black, some are yellow-red like Minium, some is pure and compact, some is insprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled and moving, some is mixed with Iron, some with Silver and Lead, some are mixed with Marbles and Flowers, some breaks also upon standing and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel moving passages, and some is wrought in pieces here and there in slate Mines, where black Lead lieth along through the whole Mine, some is Glassie in Lime-stones, and some is very rich of Silver in huge marble passages. There is a two-fold Marble; the silver passages have an earthly mixed gross marble, white, red-goldish, red-glassie, and ponderous. But the Lead passages have a subtile light, and glassie brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle marble, which looks like the glass upon Gold Mine-works, is of a curious white glittering qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>Lead Ore is wrought several ways, and the colour of it changeth after the manner of the Ores, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the sorts of Glass Ores. For if <hi>Saturn</hi> lieth below, or is in subjection unto others, then the Glass hath no power to bring <hi>Saturn</hi> unto <hi>Saturn,</hi> an imperfect mineral, which either is too hard or else untoward; and the <hi>Nodus</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> is a <hi>Mispukel,</hi> or a mixture of Lead, and Silver, which is knitted very hard; but if soft, then it is Water-lead glass, of the which is found in Gold juices, and Tin Ores, a kind of Iron-glass, or Iron-mole, but is heavier and more brittle then Iron-glass, by reason of its terrestreity or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, which keeps in the Metal, and is neither too soft nor too hard, and is glassie, white-goldish, red-goldish, and falls into the best metalline Ores. True Lead-glasses and Ores afford half, or the third part of Lead, mixed with some other Metal, and if one of the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102655:146"/>
other Metals be found in the Glass, which keeps the predominancy, then Lead passages are simply good, and Lead is united with Gold, and these are mixed stones; for the Stones of Mine-Ores are more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in their singular accidents.</p>
               <p>Thus is here the Lead also in its fall, and bleak, after the heavenly impression, which the Highest hath so indued, that it is subject to other Metals, and is the supreme Finer in the essential fruits of others. It easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingleth naturally with other Metals, and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of other Ores, together with the leaves, bulk and roots, into other stones of Earth. And <hi>Saturn</hi> in his degree and power is the highest, in a singular divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all his Works, in which he sheweth himself in a clarified transparent soul, runneth into Antimony with its sweetness, which should merely imbrace the Gold: This is done so, not without a cause, for in its ponderositie it yieldeth the lightest remedy to all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and heavy bloud. As heavenly Astrals are several, the clouds under them are of all sorts of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; so the one Lead is purer and more malleable then others, as that in <hi>England,</hi> and at <hi>Villach</hi>; it is seen in the Lead-stones also.</p>
               <p>For Lead Ores which are mixed with other stones, especially with such as contain Silver, Iron, or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yield much of light stones and Lead work, which are pickt out for separating, and the rather if they be rich of Gold. Such worthy Metals there are in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi>; less pains are taken about them in their fining mineral flints with their unripe juices in the weak joynings of Lead Ore, unite the Saturnal Glass; if without any mixture, affords to Potters a green gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure, if all be not melted into Lead: but if you get a
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:102655:147"/>
brittle mixed flint, there the glass is half upon Iron, and such that are most pliable afford melting glass, for fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such sturdy wild Ore, which will not melt. Artists may prepare such Saturnal glass, mingling with it a small quantity of metalline flowers, which will look as fair as if it were a natural one. There may be extracted from Lead an effectual medicine for Mans health.</p>
               <p>If slate Ores are found with another mixture, there are generated most fix and firm Copper, Vitriol and Calamy also, as they are at <hi>Goslar</hi> in <hi>Harlynia.</hi> The best Lead is in <hi>England,</hi> and at <hi>Villach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man cannot well be without any of his members; Metals according to Gods Ordinance are of the same quality, if Man knew to make good use of them; for Nature hath provided richly for him in that way: if men work these ignorantly, what utility can they have of them? Of the metalline Soul is made a chain which linketh together the junctures of Gold and Silver: these are indued with a special spirit, which is distilled into a Water, through a transparent head. Nature congealeth under ground in the passages such Water into Ice, for a sign that there is at hand a Vein of Lead, and Silver, or of pure Lead; and if there be a mixture of other Metal about it, it is the better.</p>
               <p>The best Lead passages are such Waters, blue, scaly, Talky, slate stones and fluid streaked Marbles at length, or curled insprinkled ones, and not wrapt or wound about with moving passages, almost not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like unto Silver Ores. Some Lead Ores are of a white, scaly, Talk-slate, full of wild Granats, in which Lead Ore doth appear, which is rich of Silver.</p>
               <p>If the Reader think we have been tedious in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing so much forth of <hi>Basilius,</hi> he may very well
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:102655:147"/>
believe it was not done without cause, neither in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the common Miner, nor of the mystical Philosopher, for there is matter enough for them both, if they seriously weigh it, and can penetrate the depth of his meaning, which I commend to them both heedfully to ponder and judge of.</p>

               <p>LEad hath such several sorts of Ores, and is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so base a Metal, that few Authors have given description of them. But we shall note such as we find, and add those several that our own Country yieldeth.<note place="margin">Lex. Alchym. p. 365.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rulandus</hi> reckoneth these: 1. Lead Ore, of its own colour, but impure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A vein of Lead among the <hi>Ubii,</hi> that is whitish like unto white Spar or Fluor, that is not pellucid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Vein of Lead that is like to transparent Spar, or Fluor, which is very rich; for forth of an hundred pound weight, they draw above sixty pound of Lead.</p>
               <p n="4">4. At <hi>Caldeborn,</hi> like unto ash-coloured Marle.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Like unto a white Sand-stone.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Like unto a metallick flint, in which little veins of live Sulphur appear, and forth of <hi>Poland</hi> mixt with native Oker.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:102655:148"/>The experienced <hi>Ercker</hi> enumerateth these sorts.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Lib. Mineral. 4. p 113.</note>1. That which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Glantz ertz</hi>; and it is commonly called, or rendred Glass Ore, or Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Ore, that is, that hath a fine shining gloss, and is smooth; not because it is transparent as Glass: and this is often rich, and holdeth more then half Lead.</item>
                  <item>2. Also a white Lead Ore, which they call <hi>wiess Bley ertz,</hi> like unto a Sand-stone.</item>
                  <item>3. Also a red Lead Ore, which they call <hi>Rot Bley ertz.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Also yellow Lead Ore, mixt with grey; also found in Pebbles, which they call <hi>Riess.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>For the Ores of Lead that are gotten in <hi>England,</hi> they are very many and of divers sorts, Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> reckons these, Frim Ore, Steel Ore, Pottern Ore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And I shall number up some of the sorts that I have either seen, or that I keep by me.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. And first, That which the Workmen common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call Potters Ore, because therewith (being beaten to powder) the Potters do glaze their pots, of a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, pale blewish, or brownish colour: and this Ore is hard and brittle, of a fair shining glass or gloss, and is (as I conceive) the very same that the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Glantz ertz,</hi> and is easie to be broken with the stroke of a stone, or hammer, and doth commonly break into smaller square pieces; wherefore some of our Miners do call it Dice Ore: and this is generally the most rich of Lead, and easie to be molten.</item>
                  <item>2. The Ore that they call Steel Ore, either of its blackish dark colour like Steel; or because of its hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, being more hard then any other sort of Lead Ore, and very ponderous, and sometimes containeth something of Silver in it, and is so hard to melt, that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102655:148"/>
they are fain to mix two or three sorts of the softer Ore with it, to make it run, or melt the more easily, and this oft containeth store of Lead in it.</item>
                  <item>3. The Ore that they call Frim Ore, is that which is very brittle, and will almost crumble with the hand like a Sand-stone, of a whitish or grayish colour, and sometimes of other colours, and holdeth not so much of Lead as the former.</item>
                  <item>4. Soft-Ore, that is near the colour of Lead it self, and is far softer then any of the former; insomuch that sometimes in beating it bruiseth, and spreadeth abroad with the hammer, so that the Workmen are fain to mix much of the harder sorts with it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they could not get it beaten small enough for their purpose; and this sort often containeth good store of Lead.</item>
                  <item>5. There is Ore of Lead that lieth insprinkled in Spar, Cauk, or grayish stones in small grains of a bright colour like silver, and yet containeth very little of that Metal in it, but holdeth very well of Lead; and of this sort there is very much gotten in these Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts, and so there is of all the other forts.</item>
               </list>
               <p>There is besides these named, which may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny subdivisions, and are of exceeding great variety, a sort of Ore found in the Lead Mines, that looks well, and in appearance is like other Lead Ore, but yieldeth no Metal at all, but being mixt with good Ore, doth rather hurt and consume it. And this the Workmen (if they mean to melt their Ore themselves, and not sell it) pick forth, and separate it from the good Ore: but if they mean to sell the Ore when beaten and washed, then they beat and mix this with the good Ore, and oftentimes Spar or Cauk beaten with
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102655:149"/>
it, which this kind of barren Ore will in the washing colour of a leadish hue, and so doth augment it in bulk and weight; but then it yields not so much Lead in the fusion, as in proportion the Ore would do, if it were separated from it. And this kind of barren Ore our Miners commonly call blue Blindake, and I judge it to be the same that the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Blend,</hi> which they say is barren, and containeth no Metal in it all.</p>
               <p>Here it cannot be amiss to say something of that which we commonly call Black-Lead, because it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloureth the hands far more then common Lead, and is that whereof Pencils are made for Painters and Scriveners, and many other such like uses. In the North we usually call it Kellow, and some call it Wadt; of which there is still a Mine near <hi>Keswick</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> which is opened but once in eight or ten years; either by reason of its scarceness, or to keep up the price of it, of which learned <hi>Cambden</hi> saith thus: Here also is commonly found that mineral kind of earth,<note place="margin">Britan. p. 767.</note> or hardned glittering stone (we call it Black Lead) with which Painters use to draw their lines, and make Pictures of one colour in their first draught: which whether it be <hi>Pingitis</hi> or <hi>Melanteria,</hi> spoken of by <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> or Oker, a kind of earth so burnt with heat, that it becometh black; or whether it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the old Writers, I cannot certainly aver, and let others for me search it out. But I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded with Dr. <hi>Merret,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Ores that are commonly gotten in these parts
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:102655:149"/>
lie either dispersedly, which some call floats, some loose or shaken Ore; and this is for the most part in black bituminous earth, or in yellowish red clay (which some call the Brown Hen, and then say her blue Chickens are not far off) Marle, and among small stone; or in a continued course, or line, which some call strings, some veins, which commonly lead to a greater stock or trunck; and these are enclosed sometimes in one sort of Coat or Matrix, and some in another.<note place="margin">Ut supr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> In <hi>Darbyshire</hi> these commonly lye near the Lead, Cauk, Bastard Cauk, Black Chert, Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, Sheaf. In these Parts most usually in Spar, or in Cauk, or in Flints, Slates, and other kind of Stones of divers colours, but most what of a grey or ash-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The Spar is something transparent, the Cauk not so, but more ponderous, and both help the fluxing of the Ore.</p>
               <p>For Spars which the <hi>Latines</hi> call <hi>Fluores,</hi> the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Flusse,</hi> they are Stones found in the Mines like unto Gems,<note place="margin">Lex. Alchym. p. 217, 218.</note> but less hard. The Miners call them <hi>Fluores,</hi> because with the heat of the fire, as Ice by the Sun, they melt and flow. And they are the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gems, and the like, and are of these sorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of a Red colour, and seem at the first view crude red silver Ore, although this be sometimes trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucid. They look also like Carbuncles, but though perspicuous they shine more faintly. And those that are not transparent, are by that distinguished from Carbuncles; but the <hi>Fluores</hi> or Spars, as soon as they feel the fire they flow; but Carbuncles will not melt with the fire.</item>
                  <item>2. Of a dilute purple colour. They look like the more greenish Amethysts, such as are found in many
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:102655:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
places in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and are not very much unlike them; and therefore many are deluded by them.</item>
                  <item>3. Of a white colour like Crystal.</item>
                  <item>4. Of a yellow colour like a Topaz.</item>
                  <item>5. Of an ash-colour.</item>
                  <item>6. Of a very black colour.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And of all these sorts, and some more, he reckoneth many diversities and differences both in colour and figures. To whom and <hi>Wormius</hi> we refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>As for Spars or <hi>Fluores</hi> either transparent or not, I shall recite some sorts, such as I have in my custody.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. And first I have divers sorts that are white, and very transparent, like the coarser sort of Crystal, and in some of them the Rudiments, as it were, of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds growing in them, finely angled, and more bright then the Spar in which they seem to grow.</item>
                  <item>2. I have some that is black as Jett, with fine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and pointed Diamonds, (if I may so call them) of the same colour, that notwithstanding the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, will against the light shew a kind of lustre, or resplendency.</item>
                  <item>3. I have Spar purely transparent, that is of a fair blue sky-colour, very delightful to the eye.</item>
                  <item>4. And some of the very colour of the Amethyst, that if polished, and set in Rings with a right soyl or water, were able to deceive a very skilful Lapidary.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now though we have spoken something before concerning <hi>Gur,</hi> that is a peculiar mineral juyce, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle know nor enquired after; we shall here add some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the <hi>Medulla lapidis,</hi> or <hi>Lapidea,</hi> which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Stein marck</hi>; some of which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the <hi>Gur,</hi> or of its nature, and some of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent temper; of which sorts <hi>Rulandus</hi> reciteth these.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:102655:150"/>
                  <item>1. Of a white and fluid kind, which was found in the Rocks of <hi>Torgense.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. A sort that is white and fatty, found in the same place.</item>
                  <item>3. A white metallick matter growing in the Veins of silver, which when it is first taken forth, it is in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour like liquid Cheese, but forthwith in the air it waxeth hard, so as notwithstanding, being holden in the mouth, it melteth like butter.</item>
                  <item>4. A sort that is a metallick substance most white, fat, and soft, found in the Iron Mines of <hi>Sachsenfield</hi>; and in touch not unlike to that which is called Soap-stone or Earth.</item>
                  <item>5. A red soft matter, found in the Mines of <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>license,</hi> which they use with great profit, in stead of <hi>Bole</hi> of <hi>Armenia.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Lastly, As for Medicaments prepared forth of Lead, there are some store used in Chirurgery, as Litharge of both sorts, Ceruss, Red Lead, <hi>Plumbum Ustum,</hi> and the like, which are common and vulgar.</p>
               <p>For Medicaments prepared forth of Lead by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chymistry, I know none of any value, (an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT seems that betwixt the <hi>Stannum</hi> or Tin of the Ancients, and that which later Authors call <hi>Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum album,</hi> White Lead, which now is taken to be our common Tin, there are many that have made a difference.

                  <hi>Basilius</hi> writeth thus of it.<note place="margin">Last Will and Test. c. 8. p. 99, 100.</note> Tin Ore is wrought in a Sand-stone, having its influence from <hi>Iupiter</hi> above, wrought of a dark brown purple coloured, grayish, black, shining mercurial salt, and some sulphur mixed with it, interlined with an unkind gross sulphureous fume; all these incorporate together, making the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Tin. This unkind fume is the cause of the brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness of Tin, and maketh all other Metals that are melted with it, unkind and brittle. This Tin or Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter groweth or breaketh in a threefold manner, <hi>viz.</hi> it slideth, it is full of fumes, and it groweth in pieces. It hath a threefold wildness also, as Shoal, Flint, and Iron-mold, which causeth Lead-works. Their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are black slate, brown, and yellow. These Sand and Quitter Ores, are environed or inclosed in mighty broad standing passages, which appear to the day with Quitters: some contain also rich paint-work, some of these flints must be calcined, some are mixed with store of Talk and Cat-silver, which is a food un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Quitter, and loveth to stay there; some there are which groweth in a Glimmer, or Cat-silver, and is Iron-mold; others also do strike in a Fire-stone or Flint, so that fire must be applied thereunto, others are in a soft stone, and as it were swimming along: some are richer then others. That which groweth pure, and in black small stones, and heapeth together that natural work, that giveth the greatest gain. And because <hi>Iupiter</hi> is the potent Lord of it, therefore it hath a mighty Throne and seat, that is, a mighty huge
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:102655:153"/>
Mine-Ore, out of which Tin is made by heaps, and is of that nature and property, that it presseth outward, and blossometh to the day, thrusteth off Soap-work, whence come the wash-works of Tin-Soap. For Quitter doth not grow in the sand of Earth, besides in its body it is removed further from the seat of its Throne to the Foot-stool, maketh for it self a two-fold dominion; in one it bordereth, and reacheth to slates, and other stones that lie about it, insomuch that his dominion increaseth; in which is not a little, but much on the blue stones, fallings, floats, passages, shoals, and clifts, which incline one upon another, and do joyn. Many times a mighty Tin-stone is wrought, which sinketh down among its own cinder and slate, and at its sinking purgeth it self, and there come other fumes like clouds, which at all sides shoot into, and then breaketh again as good as ever it did before; and it is of that good condition, that it despiseth no lodging, nor passeth by any; but as poor and as despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable the stone is in that place, be it red, brown, fresh, or stale, broad or small, it will press into, and mingle it self with it, and will not be forced out of it, making it self great, little, gross, mild, tame, subtile, and pliable, even as the rest will have it, and all this in a natural way. It loveth to border upon Silver, and Iron-stone, that Tin and Iron be united in a mighty fixt Silver and Copper Ore; all which are found at their several marks. Tin Ore is in this place better and malleable; if found afar off from flint-passages, and are less mingled with Iron-mold, especially of Copper-stones, which in calcining can hardly be separated, proves Lead work, without any fair glass. Some of it is so mild and soft, that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:102655:153"/>
when they are cleared, and calcined, still lose some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for flints and sulphureous matters which are volatile, and cannot indure any great heat, corrode somewhat of the metalline Tin, which appeareth by the white thick fume, at the calcining. They are calcined thus hard by reason of Bake-Iron, else they might yield as much again, for they lose extreamly in calcining. It is strange to some why they shrink together to so small a quantity, being they get a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantity of Lead, with good Qwitter, at first brought out of the Mine.</p>
               <p>As for the several sorts of Tin Ore, I find little mention of them in Authors,<note place="margin">Rer. natur. Pinax. p. 208.</note> onely Doctor <hi>Merrett</hi> saith that the Mine-men in <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire</hi> do distinguish their Tin into that which they call Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, Murdick, and Block Tin, and that they call their Tin-stones Shoad.<note place="margin">Philos Trans. n. 19. p. 337.</note> And the learned Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> doth tell us, that store of excellent Tin is said to be found in some parts of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> at the sides, and in the channels of running waters, in grains like Sand or Gravel, which they call Corn-Tin.</p>
               <p>Now for the Tin Mines in <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> which have been so ancient, that it may well be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that Nature neither decays, nor that Minerals cease to grow,<note place="margin">Brit. Cornw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 185.</note> take what learned <hi>Camden</hi> saith in these words. The Inhabitants do discover these Mines by certain Tin stones lying on the face of the ground, which they call Shoad, being somewhat smooth, and round. Of these Mines or Tin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Works, there be two kinds, the one they call Load-Works, the other Steam-Works. This lieth in lower grounds, when by trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they follow the Veins of Tin, and turn aside now and then the streams of water coming in their way:
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:102655:154"/>
That other is in higher places, when as upon the hills they dig very deep pits, which they call Shafts, and do undermine. And a little after he saith, There are two sorts of Tin, Black Tin, which is Tin Ore broken and washed, but not yet founded into Metal, and white Tin that is molten into Metal; and that is either soft Tin which is best Merchantable, or hard Tin less Merchantable. And again: That the ancient <hi>Britans</hi> practised these Tin-works (to omit <hi>Timaeus</hi> the Historian in <hi>Pliny,</hi> who reporteth, that the <hi>Britans</hi> fetched Tin out of the Isle <hi>Icta</hi> in Wicker Boats, covered and stitched about with Leather) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth for certain out of <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished under <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> For he writeth, that the <hi>Britains</hi> who inhabited this part, digged Tin out of stony ground, and at a low Water carried the same in Carts to certain Islands adjoyning.</p>
               <p>Now I shall give the Reader such informations as I received from one <hi>Thomas Creber</hi> of <hi>Plimpton St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> who was one (and all his Ancestors before him) that had wrought in the Tin-mines; and these particulars I had from him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Hills where they get Tin Ore, near that place where he lived, are called <hi>Yelsborrow</hi> and <hi>Woollack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Black stones that hold Tin, they call Tin-stones, and lie either in a load, or in a string.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is other Tin Ore that is softer, and lies in a dun stone, and is of a yellowish colour, but will melt neer both alike.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Pure Ore, which they call Corn Tin, being found in grains, and is the hardest to melt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another place they call <hi>Armed Pit,</hi> which holds
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:102655:154"/>
Ore they call <hi>Zill Tin,</hi> which is as small as Grit or Sand, and needeth nothing but washing, and is the most easily melted of all other sorts of Tin Ore, and lieth in Chalk and Clay; and this small Ore, because it is rich, they call it fatty Ore.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The black stones, if they find them at the top, do continue in the whole Mine or Work. Sometimes it is in that they call strings, running through earth, or stones, like small twigs or strings: and sometimes it is all in one, like a great branch or trunk, which they call a Lode. Sometimes it runneth in Spar, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a black stone that will strike fire, sometimes in white stones that are soft.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their smelting houses roofs, after certain years they pull down, and find store of Ore in that stuff, that in their former meltings was forced from the fire.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Corn Ore is found at the bottom of the Hills, being there digged into, and lieth sometimes in one sort of earth, and sometimes in another. And the Zill Ore is found in the same order.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The uppermost part of their Work they call Cooping; and if it be good or rich, the Lode or Strings underneath are good: If bad or indifferent, those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, are sometime good, and sometime bad.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They call that part of the mineral, that is found washed down, or otherwise brought down into the Valleys, Shoad.</p>
               <p n="11">11. They have a thing they call Mundick, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in the Ore, which they separate lest it should spoil the Ore; some of it is yellow, which is the worst, and sometimes of other colours: and the Mundick after smelting the Ore,<note place="margin">Philos Trans. n. 19. p 317.</note> is blackish and hard. Of it Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> saith thus. Mundick I have had of a
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:102655:155"/>
fine golden colour; but though it be affirmed to hold no Metal; yet I found it in weight, and otherwise, to differ from Marchasites, and the Mine men think it of a poysonous nature.</p>
               <p n="12">12. They have a thing they call <hi>Maxy,</hi> mixt with the Ore, which cannot be separated by the water, but by the fire, and then smells very ill, and is of a blewish colour.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Lastly, They also find something like bright Ore, which they call <hi>Shim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much of this Metal, seeing there is no need to speak of any Medicaments prepared forth of it, because I have not had experience of any such.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. Of the several sorts of Mercuries according to the Mystical Philosophers, or Adeptists.</head>
               <p>THough I may be censured variously by several sorts of men for intermeddling in such a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious and high a subject as this Chapter importeth; yet without valuing them, I shall lay open some things that have not been much noted, or understood by many that think themselves sufficiently knowing in these matters, and leave them to those, that with me do understand the Authors from whom I have these things I now treat of; being assured that these things are not for those that are led by fansie and opination, but for those that are understanding, and the genuine Sons of <hi>Hermes.</hi> I find in the heedful and diligent search of the Writings of that profoundly learned, and experienced person <hi>Paracelsus (absit invidia verbis)</hi> that he understood four several sorts of Mercuries, which we shall rank in this order, and so handle them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the Mercury of the Philosophers, which is a thing in a various sense, <hi>Mercurio vulgi commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is that which he calleth <hi>Mercurius Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris,</hi> which is made <hi>astraliter</hi> by the Tincture forth of another Metal, as when Lead, Tin, or Copper is transmuted into true running common Mercury, or Quicksilver;<note place="margin">Ret. natur. l. 9. p. 113.</note> or it may be (as <hi>Libanius</hi> recordeth of <hi>Kelley</hi>) that common Gold is changed into Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:102655:156"/>
of which he thus speaketh. <hi>Sic etiam Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Corporis è metallo alio factus astraliter, multo nobilior, &amp; fixior est Mercurio communi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is <hi>Mercurius Metallicus,</hi> or <hi>Corporalis,</hi> that is extracted, drawn and separated from the perfect or imperfect Metals; as is that mercurial part of Copper mentioned by <hi>Helmont,</hi> after the external and combustible sulphur be separated from it, which may be reduced into a white and anonymous Metal; and this not to be had but by the help of the Alkahest.</p>
               <p>4. The vulgar Mercury, or common Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver.</p>
               <p>And of two of these we shall speak, to wit, of the Philosophers Mercury, and of common Quicksilver.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Concerning the Philosophers Mercury, we would admonish the studious searcher after Natures Secrets, that these kind of Authors did not write to such ends and purposes as the most of other Authors did, plainly and openly to reveal their Art; for it was not lawful for them so to do, and that for weighty reasons known to themselves, and not fit to be divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But to declare the truth in riddles and parables;<note place="margin">Arcan. Herm. p. 168.</note> therefore let them take this rule from a learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who saith thus: Let a Lover of Truth make use of a few Authors, but of best note, and experienced Truth; let him suspect things that are quickly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, especially in mystical names and secret opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for truth lies hid in obscurity, nor do Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ever write more deceitfully, then when plainly, nor ever more truly then when obscurely. And therefore <hi>Geber</hi> tells us, <hi>Ubicunque aperte locuti su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ibi nihil diximus, sed ubi sub Aenigmate aliquid posuimus, &amp; figuris, ibi veritatem occultabimus.</hi> Again,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:102655:156"/>
Let the studious Reader diligently mark, in what points they agree in, for there necessarily the truth is to be found, for Concord is the strongest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Truth consists onely in unity.<note place="margin">Bern. Trevisan. de Alchym. p. 756.</note> For <hi>Trevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san</hi> saith, <hi>Consideravi potius quibus locis, libri maxime convenirent in eundem sensum, ibidem existimavi latere potissimum veritatem, quae non potest in pluribus, sed in uno tantum existere: hac viâ mihi fact a est obviam veritas: In quibus enim maxime convenire videbam in unum, hoc ipsum fuit, quod tam anxie quaesieram.</hi> Lastly, observe this. Let the studious Reader have a care of the manifold signification of words; for by deceitful winding, and doubtful, yea, contrary spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (as it should seem) Philosophers vent their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, with a desire of keeping and hiding, not sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticating or destroying the truth.<note place="margin">Ut Supr. p. 188.</note> And in nothing have they been more dark and obscure, then about this that they call their Mercury, which they have made manifold; four sorts of which we shall onely handle.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They do sometimes call perfect Elixir, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring medicine their Mercury (though with some impropriety, as to other appellations of it, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fixt, and not volatile) because of the likeness and great conformity it hath with heavenly Mercury, or with the Planet so called, which accommodateth it self, to the nature and quality of every thing it is joyned withal. The like this uncertain Elixir wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, for that being tied to no proper quality, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the quality and disposition of the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is mixed, and wonderfully multiplieth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and qualities thereof. And in this sense for the most part the Philosophers understand it, and not in
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:102655:157"/>
respect of common Mercury, or its volatility. For <hi>Sendivogius</hi> saith thus:<note place="margin">Nov. Lum. Chym. Tract. 6. p. 320.321.</note> 
                  <hi>Dicitur Mercurius propter ejus fluxibilitatem, &amp; uniuscujusque rei conjunctionem, non propter essentiam, assimilatur sulphuri propter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum calorem, &amp; post congelationem est humidum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicale.</hi> For the Philosophers Sulphur or Tincture before Fermentation is (in this sense) truly mercurial and universal; but after it be fermented, that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality is determined, and specificated according to the nature of the Metal with which it is fermented, and so it is no more an universal,<note place="margin">Theatr. Chym. Vol. 4. p. 471, 472.</note> but a particular. <hi>Et ante fermentationem tamen est catholica ac universalis vere, &amp; in omnia sublunaria agit universaliter, &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholice. Post fermentationem autem est specificata ad naturam metallicam.</hi> And again; <hi>Et est vere univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salis ante fermentationem, post eam specifica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another matter which they call their Mercury, which is the most universal that is in nature, and forth of which in the first creation all specificated bodies were produced, and still continueth both the efficient and material cause, and matter of all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and productions, and this they called Hyle or Chaos, and <hi>Raymund Lully</hi> the <hi>genus generalissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi> of all things. And doubtless was no other then <hi>Aristotles materia prima,</hi> fift Essence, or fift Element, which few of his Interpreters understood, and many others derided, as though because they did not know it, therefore others did not: when indeed that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Graecian</hi> understood much, that in his Writings he opened but darkly, and therefore however the proud and ignorant may scoff and jeer, we do affirm that there is such a matter <hi>in rerum natura</hi>: though in some respects it be a truth, that it is, <hi>neque quantum,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:102655:157"/>
neque quale, neque quid, neque quicquid eorum, quae cernuntur</hi>; and this the ancient Sages knew and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood well enough, and sometimes called it <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> or <hi>Spiritus Catholicus,</hi> and by many other such like names. And it is of this that the learned Lord of <hi>Nuysement</hi> epitomized by <hi>Combachius,</hi> writ that learned Treatise,<note place="margin">De sal Philos. c. 4. p. 158.</note> 
                  <hi>De vero Sale secreto Philosophorum, &amp; de universali mundi spiritu</hi>: who saith in one place thus; <hi>Ego vero tracto de materia universali nondum specificata, quae proprie materia prima hujus materiae primae metallicae appellari potest, tanquam generalissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum genus generum, à Raymundo Lullio adeo celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> And as the Philosophers did understand this to be the first true matter of all things, so they had an universal matter that was mineral, from whence all Metals did spring and arise; so that by allusion and comparison, they often expressed the nature of the one by the other; which many (and they very learned too) not discerning the confounding of these two together, have often taken the one for the other, and so have both been deceived, and also deceived others; of which thing learned <hi>Ripley</hi> giveth us this caution:

Here the careful Reader may observe, not onely the description of this matter that he calleth Globous, known, and understood of so few, as also the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of it, to the matter of their great Stone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The matter forth of which they prepare their artificial Water, they call their Mercury; which thing Nature hath produced ready for the Artist to begin his work withal. And though it be conversant before the eyes of all the World, and be a common known despicable matter, yet it is one of their greatest secrets, which they have most hid and veiled, and the most difficult for an Artist to know, that this is the true subject that he must begin to work upon. But when it is truly known, men will rather wonder why they knew it no sooner, then at their knowing of it after they do understand it; for the Ancients have declared the proper marks and tokens so fully, that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102655:158"/>
hardly can it be done more largely, except they should in plain and vulgar words have named it, and said this is it: which hath caused divers of the later Adeptists the more to obscure it, and to put their Readers into the greatest dubitation about it. This is it that they have called their metallick seed (and indeed is really so) and have given it so many various names and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, according to its furthest, midd, or near na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that without divine assistance, or a faithful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, it is hardly to be comprehended, or known.

               <p>From whence we may consider the reasons why they use this propriety in calling all these Mercuries theirs, or Mercuries of the Philosophers; and those chiefly we conceive to be these two following:
<list>
                     <item>1. The most of these (or at least two of them) are called theirs, because Nature hath not brought them forth in that perfection that the Philosophers desire and stand in need of. But it is the Philosophers Skill, Art, and Industry, that exalts them to this prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, which Nature had not contributed unto them, and therefore are truly and properly called theirs, for none but true Philosophers indeed can bring them to that height of perfection.</item>
                     <item>2. The other universal Mercury or Hyle, hath not its vertues and excellencies known to any but to true Philosophers, who well understand the nature and qualities of it. And that other Mercury which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture produceth of it self without Art, and is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal matter, and seed of which Metals are generated in the bowels of the earth, they also call (as they do
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102655:160"/>
many other things) theirs; and that because though it be commonly known, and be to be had; yet none but true Philosophers know the hidden, and secret vertues thereof (though it be conversant before the eyes of all the World) nor that it is the seed from whence Metals are produced.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all this that hath been said, there are many so wedded to the great Opinion that they have of common Mercury, that either they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is that true seed of Metal the Philosophers speak of; or at least that forth of it the Philosophers Mercury may be made; both of which are clear wide from the mark:<note place="margin">Nov. Lum. Chym.

               <p n="1">1. The Mercury of the Philosophers is a meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Art forth of a fit natural subject, and is never to be had but by the assistance of Art. But common Quicksilver is a product of Nature without the help of Art; for there is much of it found in its own form, which the Workmen call Virgin Mercury.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Chymical Fountain, or Philosophers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, doth produce all things, and vivisie all things; and on the contrary, it destroyeth all things, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, and worketh all other things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern life and death; but so doth not common Mercury.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:102655:160"/>3. The Chymical Fountain is fiery and hot, but common Argent vive is cold and moist.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Chymical Fountain with the most easie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation is changed into a spirit, and a volatile body. But the common Argent vive is all spirit, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation is not changed into a watery spirit, but ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth corporally, no whit changed from it self.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The spirit drawn from the Chymical Fountain, is fiery, and pontick, and so penetrating and subtile, that it also dissolveth Metals, and being so dissolved, doth deliver them to death. But common Argent vive cannot be converted into a watery, pontick spirit by distillation, nor kill or destroy the Metals, but only hides them in its belly, and doth vomit them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by separating it self from them, with any easie heat.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Chymical Fountain doth dissolve it self, and congeal it self, and perfect it self, without any other thing added unto it. But common Quicksilver doth not dissolve it self, unless it be dissolved of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor congeal it self, nor by any means perfect it self.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Chymical Fountain hath in its belly and inward parts, salt fixed, red, and white, yea it is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally salt, and springeth and ariseth forth of a saline den. But common Argent vive is nothing else but a running Metal, movable, and slippery.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Chymical Fountain hath <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> in the nearest power, and with only simple coction, they are reduced into the ultimate act: which we can bring forth of common Argent vive by no kind of Artifice.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Of the Chymical Fountain, without any thing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:102655:161"/>
added to it, is made the Elixir, and true Philosophick Tincture: which by no means we can obtain from common Argent vive.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Chymical Fountain hath in it self in the nearest power all Metals, seeing it is the immediate, and next seed, forth of which they are generated and compounded. And it is the father, efficient, and material cause, out of which common Quicksilver is produced, which cannot be said of the other.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Chymical Fountain doth compound pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones in the bowels of the earth, and all those others which Nature hideth in her bosom, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation, and coagulation of the Fountain into stones, which we cannot say of vulgar Mercury. <hi>Hydrogr.

               <p n="13">13. Vulgar Mercury doth not so dissolve Gold and Silver, that it never can again be separated from them. But the Philosophers Argent vive doth so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve Gold and Silver, that it is never again separated from them, but is as water commixt with water.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Vulgar Mercury hath combustible and evil sulphur, with which it is made black. But the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers Argent vive hath in it self sulphur incombusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, fixt, good, white, and red.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Vulgar Mercury doth make bodies black, and staineth them. But the Philosophers Mercury doth make bodies white as Crystal.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Vulgar Mercury by praecipitation is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Citrine or red powder, and an evil sulphur. But the Philosophers Mercury by virtue of heat, is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into most white sulphur, good fixt, and fluxible.</p>

               </p>
               <p>These are the differences that these two Authors quoted have given of the differences of common Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and that of the Philosophers, but indeed are so full of equivocations and evasions, one while mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Elixir, another while the catholick Mercury or Hyle, sometimes their artificial Mercury, and but seldom, if at all, the matter out of which they prepare their own Mercury, or universal liquor. So that they may well buzzle the brains of a person reasonably well versed in their terms, and Art. But to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more candid, we shall shew some agreements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the matter of which they prepare their Mercury and common Quicksilver, that the doubt of their being both one, may be put forth of all scruple.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their matter, and vulgar Mercury agree in this, that they are both of a mineral and metallick root and principle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ in this, the Philosophers matter is the true root, seed, and principle of all other Metals, as is known by observation and experience; but vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Mercury is not the seed nor root of Metals, nor ever was known to grow, or change by nature into a more perfect Metal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Philosophers matter is no one of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly known Metals, but is rather <hi>omnia metalla,</hi> and the true Lunary and Solary Tree; but common Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury hath ever been taken for one of the vulgar Metals, and is no true <hi>Electrum,</hi> nor hath plurality in it at all.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:102655:162"/>4. The Philosophers matter is a thing that is far more common then common Mercury, and is never so well apparelled, nor so specious to the eye, as is common Quicksilver.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That it is threefold both in Name and Nature, and yet is but of one and the same root, and so is not common Quicksilver.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That it hath both fixt and volatile parts, and so hath not Quicksilver.</p>

We come now to the second main point that we proposed in this Chapter; to wit, to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of common Quicksilver, as some have given it forth; and herein we must propose something from <hi>Paracelsus</hi> that is singular, and (that we know of) not mentioned by any other Author; which is this.</p>
               <p>He saith that Mercury containeth in it self three bodies.<note place="margin">Chir. magn. p. 152.</note>

               <p n="2">2. The second requireth that the Ore be separated from the Mercury by the artifice of fire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is, that the same Mercury be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the form of an adust, or burnt Metal.</p>

               <list>
                  <item>1. First, As it is in its Mineral, or Ore, with its bloud, and is to be as Mercury prepared by Art.</item>

                  <item>3. But that the third body is that when it is reduced into an adust Metal.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now for the two last we shall speak of them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, onely here we shall say something of the first, which seemeth a strange matter; for he seemeth to shew that the Ore of Quicksilver may be found and had in its Mine, when it is in its flower, and before it be hardened into that body which we call Cinnober; for in his Preparations he saith:<note place="margin">Ut supr. p. 244.</note> Take the Ore out of which Mercury doth arise or grow, as it is found in its first coagulation, before it grow hard, or be made into a body: And calls it after it be prepared, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of the immature Mineral. Again he saith, Take of that Ore forth of which Mercury is generated, as it is found to consist in its first coagulation: but yet it ought to be so coagulated, that it hath not yet passed into an hard and solid body. By all which it plainly appeareth that this experienced Author (than whom, no man that we read of, had seen more Mines, nor was more expert in Mineral knowledge) had seen, found, and had the Ore of Cinnober, or Quicksilver soft, which is a thing (doubtless) of that rarity, that few have had knowledge of it. And therefore I heartily desire all the Learned that have Interest in foreign Parts, and all other ingenious persons that travel, to be inquisitive, whether any such Ore of Cinnober be known, found or to be had as is soft, and not yet grown hard, because besides the knowledge of such a mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral secret, there may no doubt some excellent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine be made forth of it.</p>

This description any one half-eyed may see will not altogether agree with the nature of common Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver, but so they use to mock with fresh-water Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Wormius</hi> of it tells us thus;<note place="margin">Mus. Worm. l. 1. Sect. 3. c 9. p. 126.</note> That by proper speaking it cannot be said to be a Metal, seeing the definiton doth not agree unto it, for it melts not in the fire, it is not hard, solid, ductile, nor malleable. But it is a mineral liquor consisting of a viscous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick water, and a sulphureous earth, full of spirit, volatile, cold to the touch, but indued with an hot virtue, ponderous, of the colour of silver, fluid as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but not wetting the hands. And of this he reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two sorts, first either native or factitious, for that which is factitious we do not now meddle. And as for the Cinnober, or <hi>Minium,</hi> it is either mixed with stones, or pure. For that which is mixed with stones, it is sometimes found in a slate-stone of an ash-colour, grown together in the manner of leaves, or plates, sometimes in a most white metallick stone, as at <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenstein.</hi> Of pure Minium, or native Cinnober (he saith) he had two sorts; one rubicund, like the crude Ore of red silver, ponderous and elegantly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with a most subtile, red sulphureous digested earth, with a most weak slow binding, like an unripe pleasing fruit, of all particular Metals. Mercury sheweth its virtue in many things admirably, and worketh effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually upon Minerals and metalline Sulphurs, and upon such which border upon Antimonial stones or Ores, it loveth to be in such places where the Tin Ores lie higher then Silver passages. It requireth many iterating effectual operations unto other Ores, and is multiplied upon other strange stones, and is drawn through the juices of Minerals and Metals which are in affinity one to another, and produce many miscreants, this is the reason why it is so pleasant unto Metals, Goldsmiths amalgame and gild with it. It is used also for metalline colours, and is prepared to an oyl, and water, for mans health, and is sublimed to corrode the worst of poysons, and is a true robber, taketh along whatever costs have been bestowed on him; but if he can be catched in his nature, then is he in subjection and obedience unto quick and dead. He is very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual in Medicines, especially for outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His metalline stones are of the same nature with pure white slate earth, inclined to a water-blue, in fresh intermingled white marbles, in a glassie, grayish or porous Glimmer, or Cat-silver, which lie beneath betwixt the slates, in a float way, which are mingled in their metalline passages with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sled matchasites, and with the subtilest small streaked white Talk, and are thorow grown with two sorts, standing and float-striking passages, in which is wrought a curious red-shining Quicksilver Ore, not

                  <hi>Paracelsus</hi> tells us these things of Quicksilver.<note place="margin">De Miner. l. p. 346.</note> For that they say Argent vive is a Metal, is far from the matter. For it is of the kind of other Minerals, not a Metal, not a Stone, not a Marchasite, not a Saphir, &amp;c. It is a peculiar product of Nature, gifted with its body,<note place="margin">De Element. Aq. Trac. 3. c. 7. p. 281.</note> and endowed with its proprieties, as the rest. Again he saith, Argent vive is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, not admitting ductibility, but opposing it self against it. This the <hi>Archeus</hi> doth cast forth, changing it into a singular Metal void of ductibility. And though of all Metals it be most especially assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated to Mercury, notwithstanding it differs in this, that it doth not obtain ductibility, by reason of its debility, which it conceived from Salt and Sulphur en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into it, in too little quantity. From hence it is manifest that by Spagyrical practice, to wit, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it may be made a ductible Metal, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy of transmutation doth demonstrate. For it may be turned and changed into every, or any Metal: Therefore, to wit, because it remaineth from the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all Metals that may be drawn into ductibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.<note place="margin">De Mineral, Tract. 1. p. 349.</note> In another place he describeth it (almost to the same purpose) in this manner. Moreover there is a certain kind of metallick body, that can neither be hammered, nor fluxed, or melted, and it is a mineral water of Metals. As water is amongst other things, so is this amongst Metals. But it therefore ought to be a Metal, because it is reduced by Alchymy into malleation and fabrication: notwithstanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:102655:165"/>
it is not constant, sometimes it is constant. It is to be holden that it is the first matter of the Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, who of it do prepare Silver, Gold, Copper &amp;c. which the event sheweth. And perhaps Tin and Lead may be made of it: for its nature is manifold, and wonderful, neither altogether to be sought out with easie pains or labour. But this notwithstanding is evident, that it is the first matter of the Alchymists, in the generating of Metals; and furthermore, is a most noble medicine. It groweth by such a subtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt, that it floweth, or is liquid, and yet doth not moisten; it runneth and yet hath no feet, and is the most heavy of ail Metals.</p>
               <p>From these dark sayings of this mystical Author, we may gather these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in propriety of Language it is not a Metal, as abiding neither fusion nor malleation; and that it is a Metal, or may be made one by the Art of Alchymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, but not without addition of something, which doubtless is their Tincture, or Elixir. And then it may be turned into any other Metal, according as the Elixir was fermented, and so in that respect is by them truly called Mercury: and yet that of its own kind it is a mineral water, and of a metallick nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is of a strange and wonderful nature not easily by labour found out: which made <hi>Helmont</hi> confess that he had spent thirty years <hi>sub ferula Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curii,</hi> and that it had not its compeer in Nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That when he saith that it is the first matter of the Alchymists in generating of Metals, he speaketh the positive truth, yet must he not be understood to mean that it is the first matter that Nature useth to frame or generate Metals of in the bowels of the earth,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:102655:165"/>
for that first matter it is not, neither the first matter (as too many vainly dream) whereof they make their Elixir: But it is the first and principal matter by which with their Elixir they change, or generate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals by the rules of Art.<note place="margin">Progy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Ore he describeth thus. They (he saith) dig the Mineral with Pick-axes following the Veins: 'tis for the most part hard as a stone, but more weighty, of a liver-colour, or that of <hi>Crocus Metallorum.</hi> There is also some soft earth, in which you may plainly see the Mercury in little particles. There are also several Marchasites, and Stones, which seem to have specks of Gold in them; but upon trial they say they find none in them. These round Stones are some of them very ponderous, and well impregnated with Mercury, others light, having little or none in them. And so he describeth the manner of getting the Mercury forth of the Ore or Stone; which for brevity I omit, and leave the Reader to the more full relation of the Extract it self. Onely he relateth that they have their Mercury two ways, the one is by the means of the fire; the other he relateth thus. All the Mercury got without the use of fire, whether by washing, or found in the Mines (for in the digging some little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles get together, so that in some places you might take up two or three spoonfuls of pure Mercury) is called by them Virgin Mercury, and esteemed above the rest. I enquired (he saith) of the Officer, what virtue that had more then the other; he told me, that making an Amalgama of Gold and Virgin-mercury, and putting it to the fire, that Mercury would carry away all the Gold with it, which common Mercury would not do.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. Of several sorts of Medicaments prepared forth of common Mercury, both by the way of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Chymistry, as also by the mystical way. And of the <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are so many several Medicaments prepared by common Chymistry forth of Quicksilver, that it would be very tedious, and too large to recite them all; as is easie to be seen in <hi>Crollius, Beguinus, Hartman, Schroderus, Quercetan, Vutzerus,</hi> and the like; and therefore we shall onely enumerate some few of the principal of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first there is that which they call <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> which whether it participate solely of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or solely of the Mercury, is not so easie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, there being Authors, that hold it stiffly on either side; and we never accounted the Experiment either so luciferous, or frugiferous, to make it our business to attend trials, and exact observations about it. As for the <hi>Mercurius vitae</hi> we have administred it very frequently for the space of near thirty years, and can give it no further commendations, then that it is a strong, and churlish Vomit, fit only for robust bodies, and beneficial onely in some Phlegmatick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, and far unworthy of those high praises that are usually attributed unto it, and therefore now we do very rarely, or never use it, having found other
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:102655:168"/>
mineral Vomits, that are far more safe, and of more effectual operation then it; and I wish all Tyronists to take care of its preparation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next we shall name is their <hi>Turpethum Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi> which is indeed a mercurial one, and that sharp and desperate enough, if not very carefully and skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled. In our younger years when we had too high an esteem of Chymical Medicines, we have often used, and administred the same, and that with no bad success, especially in some sorts of Epileptical distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: But shall warn all young Physicians to be both careful in their preparing of it, and in their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of it also, especially in that great point <hi>de ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione victus.</hi> And all I can commend it for (if that may be called a commendation) is for that woful and dishonourable way of curing by flux or salivation, which indeed is a way of cure, almost as bad as the worst of diseases.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next we shall name, is that preparation of it which they call <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> which is of very frequent use, and exceedingly extolled by many; we confess it may have a commendable use in Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and may to sundry good purposes be mixed with Plasters and Unguents; and is of singular effect in Ointments against all Verminous distempers, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken inwardly doth the same; and is a pretty purger, or promoteth the working of other Catharticks; but heed must be taken, that it be not administred too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten near together, for fear of a sore mouth, loosness of teeth, or a flux. And yet for the Worms may the crude Quicksilver it self, or the water wherein it is boyled, be taken with as much or more safety, and as good effects.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:102655:169"/>4. The last we shall name, is some sorts of Praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates prepared forth of Mercury; not to mention the common Praecipitate prepared after <hi>Vigo</hi>'s order, or the white one, which (if used inwardly) are far more likely to kill then to cure. One of the best, is the Quicksilver praecipitated <hi>per se</hi>; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is a violent Vomitive Medicine, yet may be tolerably used by a skilful and careful Physician. But the best that ever we have seen, is a Praecipitate prepared with the good and pure spirit of Nitre, and afterwards often cohobated with the distilled water of the whites of Eggs, whereby it will become of a fine red colour as any red coral, and almost as sweet as honey, and hardly to be distinguished from the true <hi>Arcanum corallinum</hi> that is prepared with the great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor <hi>Alkahest</hi>; and though it be vomitive in some measure, and be far short of the eminent vertues of the other <hi>Arcanum,</hi> yet will it never disgrace a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Artist, that knows its due preparation and way of administring, but will without vomit or purging (if rightly handled) even cure desperate Agues by sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely.</p>
               <p>But I will conclude of all these with that of <hi>Helmont,</hi> who saith, <hi>Antimonium dum vomitum movet, &amp; Mercurius dum vivificari potest, non sunt boni viri remedia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We descend now to treat of those great <hi>Arcana's</hi> that are no ways to be obtained but by that universal solvent, the <hi>Alkahest,</hi> that noble liquor, that is the sole glory of a Philosopher in this frail life. Which is that Key that onely opens the Rosary of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and revealeth the hidden secrets of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, Vegetable, and Mineral kingdom; without the

And after he telleth us, that the glorious Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Venus being raised again doth tinge the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of the Mercury (that in the Powder of <hi>Iohn de Vigo,</hi> by sulphureous corrosive Minerals was extro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted) immediately, and did mutually imbrace one another in an inseparable bed: And that therefore the vertue of both the Sulphurs did stand outwardly. And therefore by this conjunction the Diaphoretick Mercury from thence arising, did perform whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Physician or Chirurgeon could wish, either in respect of curing acute or chronical diseases.

Again,<note place="margin">De Febrib. l. c. 14. p. 52.</note> in another place, he largely describeth the vertues and effects of this <hi>Mercurius Diaphoreticus,</hi> in relation both to Internal, and External Distempers. And of its Preparation tells us thus much; Its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription (he saith) is as well in <hi>Paracelsus</hi> Book <hi>De Morte Rerum,</hi> as in his <hi>Chirurgia Magna,</hi> and saith, he will declare it something more manifestly. Take the Powder of <hi>Iohn de Vigo,</hi> prepared with thine own hand: For otherwise it is adulterated with artificial <hi>Minium</hi> or red Lead; as the most Chymical medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that are to be sold, are full of deceit. This Powder, the element of fire extracted from the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol of Venus being affused, or poured upon it, is five times to be cohobated with <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> at the end increasing the fire; for it is fully fixed, and is a Powder very corrosive. Which then is to be coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated ten times, with <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> dephlegmed the best that may be, and renewed at every time, until it have carried off all the corrosiveness with it. And then this Powder is sweet as Sugar. Therefore the Spirit of Wine is there called <hi>Saltaberi,</hi> or <hi>Tabar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet,</hi> which soundeth Sugar, not that it is sweet in it self, but that it carrieth away the corrosive spirits with it. So far, that the remaining Powder doth excel in its own sweetness, not with a sweetness borrowed elsewhere. For besides, that the fire of Vitriol is sweet, the very Sulphur of the Mercury, then turned outwardly, is of greatest sweetness. This Powder is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ixed, and is called Horizontal Gold. Therefore (he saith) I have finished a secret in few words, which doth ennoble a Physician. But to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it the first time, is of huge labour, and its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection dependeth of his hand, to whom all honour is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:102655:170"/>
due, because he revealeth these secrets to little ones, which the world knoweth not of, and therefore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteemeth. From all this we shall animadvert some few things to be considered of, by the learned and ingenious.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To consider the high excellency of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that is so noble, that in operation it effecteth whatsoever a Physician or Chirurgeon can desire: And therefore may well instigate all of those Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that they may bend all their studies and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours both day and night to the obtaining of the same.</item>
                  <item>2. That it is no wonder that they call it Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal Gold, which if one seriously consider the great medical vertues, is an apposite name, and to be esteemed far more precious than common Gold, that cannot afford such rare and almost incredible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</item>
                  <item>3. To remember that it cannot be perfected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sulphur or fire of Venus, which though he call the Sulphur or fire of Vitriol, yet it is not the Spirit of Vitriol, however rectified; but is the Sulphur of Copper it self, which cannot be had, but by the total destruction of its body, and the leaving of its internal and incombustible Sulphur, inseparable from its remaining white, anonymous metallick mercurial body; and this to be performed by no sublunary body but only by the Alkahest.</item>
                  <item>4. To note that the fire of Venus must be poured upon the Powder of <hi>Iohn de Vigo,</hi> prepared by ones own hand, whereby it appeareth that it must be in a liquid form, otherwise it might be mixed with it, but not poured upon it, and therefore certainly is in the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:102655:171"/>
form of a green Oil, as both he and <hi>Paracelsus</hi> do make manifest. But one chief point is here tacitely concealed, that is the quantities of either of them, which the studious Reader must labour to find out.</item>
                  <item>5. It may be some that are very critical, may que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion what sort of <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> this Author meaneth, but it is plain that it is the common sort, and no my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical kind, because he telleth us plainly that after five times cohobation with it, and increasing of the fire, it remaineth an exceeding corrosive Powder; and therefore must be cohobated ten times with the best dephlegmed <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> every time being renewed, or fresh used, and that thereby the corrosive spirits are all carried off with the Spirit of Wine, and the Powder left as sweet as Sugar. And if we consider what this Author hath told us elsewhere, then we are to know, that it is no rectified Spirit of Wine by any common way, but prepared by the Alkahest, which is required twice in this Preparation, once for the fire of Venus, and also for the Spirit of Wine.</item>
                  <item>6. As for the places in <hi>Paracelsus</hi> in his Book <hi>De Morte Rerum,</hi> and in his <hi>Chirurgia Magna,</hi> though that Author seem dark enough, yet to an attentive and understanding Reader he hath shewed things that are sufficient to understand its Preparation by, and hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing in the forecited places, but only the naming of the Alkahest, which in all his great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations he commonly leaveth out: Though in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of his Writings he hath spoken more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (both as to the matter forth of which, and the manner how, that great liquor is to be had, and prepared) than any other Author that I know of, and those that cannot learn it from his Writings,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:102655:171"/>
will hardly understand it in other. Authors.</item>

               <p>The next great Arcanum to be had forth of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Mercury, is that which he calleth <hi>Arcanum Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallinum,</hi> or <hi>Corallatum,</hi> of which he saith this. And there is the purgation <hi>Diuceltatasson,</hi> which cures the Gout no less than Fevers.<note place="margin">De Febr. l. c. 14. p. 52.</note> And its Arcanum is called <hi>Corallinum,</hi> which is prepared out of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Horizontal gold, after this manner: Draw off the liquor Alkahest from vulgar vendible Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which <hi>Paracelsus</hi> remembreth 2. <hi>de viribus mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brorum, c. de hepate,</hi> which is done in one quarter of an hour. For <hi>Raymundus</hi> saith, my friends being by, and the King present, I have coagulated Argent-vive, and none except the King knew the way or manner. In which coagulation, this is most singular, that the said liquor Alkahest doth prevail the same in number, weight, and activity, so much the thousand action, as much as in the first; because it acteth without the re-action of the patient. Therefore the Mercury be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so coagulated, without any remnant of the thing coagulating, then make small powder of it: and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil from it five times, the water of the whites of eggs distilled, and the Sulphur of the Mercury, that by its former coagulation was drawn outwardly, will be made rubicund as Coral: and although the water of the whites of eggs doth stink, notwithstanding this powder is sweet, fixed, bearing all the fire of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. Neither doth it perish in the examination of Lead, notwithstanding it is spoiled of its medical virtue while it is reduced into a white metal: but it is given to eight grains for the most part, because it purgeth the body of man as long as it is foul, and not perfectly sound. Also it healeth Ulcers of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102655:172"/>
of the Larinx,<note place="margin">Arcan. Par. p. 790.</note> and Oesophagus. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he reciteth it almost in the same manner, but not so fully. In another place he saith of it thus. Therefore the purgation by the Arcanum Coralli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,<note place="margin">Vol. Vivent. &amp;c. p. 387.</note> doth destroy the Gout in its seed. But this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum is not the colour or tincture of Coral, (as the ignorant company of Chymical Writers, to be laught at, do interpret) because the apposite words of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelsus</hi> (which is of the essence of Gold) do sound another thing.</p>
               <p>Also the colour of Gold, the Sulphur, or Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, do not loose the belly, or purge: but this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum is in substance, metallick; in colour, coralline; in taste, like honey; and in essence, golden. Truly not that ever it was a malleable body, but is the Horizon of Gold, a shut-up body, and fixed; whose Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is sweet, and to be commixed with our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive parts. In this Sulphur the Omnipotent hath collected all the virtues of the Sun, to whom only all honour and glory is due.</p>
               <p>We have before, where we spoke of the Alkahest, said much to what from all this might be observed: only we shall add these few things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Learned may note, that the Writings of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> (by many so much condemned) do bear in them a far deeper sense and meaning than even common Chymists do imagine; and are not to be weighed according to the letter, but according to the depth of that Learning the Author was master of. And therefore we may here observe that <hi>Helmont</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood him otherwise (and that according to the truth of his meaning) than many hundreds have done besides.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:102655:172"/>2. That he that will understand the matter out of which the Alkahest is prepared, and its manner of preparation also, can never find either of them by any surer way than by truly considering and understanding the effects of that liquor. And I am bold to tell all searchers, that no effect of it doth more declare the matter from whence it is taken, than this that he hath related in what I have before quoted; and therefore let it be observed.</item>
                  <item>3. Where he saith, That the Mercury being coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the liquor Alkahest, hath its Sulphur ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted: but if it be melted down into a white me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that then it loseth its medical virtue. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which is, (though we may be condemned for disclosing it) that the medicinal virtue consists only in the external and separable Sulphur, and not in the Mercurial part, which is not to be destroyed either by Art or Nature; and therefore in fluxing it down into a white metal, the external Sulphur is wasted in the fire, or burnt off, and so the medical virtue must needs be lost, which consisted only in the Sulphur.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The last thing that we purposed to handle here, is the Praecipiolum of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> for from him <hi>Helmont</hi> had it; and therefore might well confess (though in many things he is very injurious unto him, even some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to attribute those Theorical notions to himself, that he plainly stole from him, and yet laboured to deprive him of the honour) that by his Writings he had profited much. But ere we give our censure about this Praecipiolum, we shall fully give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account what they both say in the matter. And first, <hi>Paracelsus</hi> thus: The condition of Mercury is, that it be precipitated in its Mineral or Ore, and be
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:102655:173"/>
separated from it dead;<note place="margin">De Hydropis. l. p. 623.</note> for so it is not Argent-vive, but Mercury: for when dead, it is Mercury; but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it is Argent-vive. If therefore, as the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed manner of its preparation, it be mortified; its dose is two grains, the process being observed, that the Schole delivereth, neither need it be included in the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ignor. Hydrop. p. 521.</note>The relation of <hi>Helmont</hi> is thus. But <hi>Paracelsus</hi> approveth his Praecipiolum or Mercury, drawn forth dead out of its Mineral or Ore, above other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: but other simples, for the degree of affinity, by which they come near this metallick Mercury. And a little after he saith, In the mean time I confess, that that same Mercury hath always answered to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Truly its acquisition is difficult, but the dose of two grains three or four times exhibited doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But the Diaphoretick Mercury once being had, it sufficeth to many myriads of diseased persons, as well for the Physician as for his posterity.</p>
               <p>That which we shall move from hence is this, That there are some learned men with whom we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed, or had intercourse by Letters, that are of opinion that this Praecipiolum, or dead Mercury, is some artificial preparation by the Alkahest: but sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the judgments of those men, we cannot be of their opinion, for these reasons.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Because both the Authors say that it is drawn dead forth of its Mineral or Ore, and therefore in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood must be by nature mortified in its Ore, or else it could not be so drawn forth of it, except it were dead before.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Helmont</hi> saith it is of difficult acquisition, not of difficult preparation, so that only the difficulty must
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102655:173"/>
be in finding or obtaining such of its Ore as hath the Argent-vive mortified in it when it is digged forth of the earth, and not made so by Art.</item>
                  <item>3. He compareth the Diaphoretick Mercury with it, and extols it far above it, as able to serve the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician and his posterity, being once but had, but doth not say so much of the Praecipiolum.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Therefore I would intreat all ingenious and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons to take notice of these two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That <hi>Paracelsus</hi> tells us, that while Argent-vive is living, it is Argent-vive, but Mercury when it is dead, or so fixed that it cannot be revived again; for then it is like the Planet <hi>Mercury,</hi> able to exert its virtues, when before it is (though a tremulous body, and seeming open) most of all shut, and doth utterly deny its help to humane bodies. So that <hi>Longè alius est sensus Sophorum, quam vulgarium literatorum.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. To move all inquisitive persons that either tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel where Mines of Quicksilver are, or have corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency with any that live near them, or work in them, to endeavour if any such thing may be found as the Ore that hath the Argent-vive dead in it.</item>

But if the Workman will take a pound of the poorest Lead that may be, (that hath not been refined before) and calcine it in an Iron Vessel until all that can of it be turned to Litharge, then let him take that small quantity, and purifie it upon the Test, he then shall find it will yield some Silver, whose quantity in a pound or more of the Lead may soon be calculated.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:102655:181"/>
And therefore the most experienced Essay-masters will not use any Lead that hath not been calcined into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge, and blown up again into Lead, lest thereby they be deceived in their trials. But however, that in this respect they may be accounted all one, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that there is none of them but they hold both Lead and Silver, yet notwithstanding I hold that the main difference lieth in this, that it is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Galena</hi> when it holdeth a sensible quantity of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or however when it holdeth as much Silver as may make it a Mine Royal: but if it hold no sensible quantity of Silver, then it may be called <hi>Plumbago</hi>; and this I wish every Test-master and every Miner se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to mind and consider of.</p>

                  <hi>Wormius</hi> saith thus of it: It is a soft stone like to the <hi>Lapis Specularis,</hi> to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into plates, bending, and variously intricate, of a Silvery white colour, bluish gray, sometimes black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, unconquerable by the fire, for it is neither to be melted nor burnt, nor loseth its colour, except by great violence. It is found in many places of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> and its kinds are distinguished accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its colours.

There was also black brought from <hi>Norway,</hi> which had joined the Ore of Gold with it, that gave great hope of gain. The Talk that I have commonly seen and had, is much agreeable to these descriptions, it being white and Silvery with some greenishness, and may be severed or cleft into small tires or threds, and doth long resist the fire, and hardly to be consumed by it. It is a good vendible Commodity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may concern the Miners to take care to enquire and search after, for there is little question but some of it may be met withal in some of our Mines in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

Worm. l. 1. Sect 2. c. 9. p. 62.</note> 
                  <hi>Wormius</hi> describes it thus: It is an hard Stone, ferrugineous, or irony, and blackish, which draweth or rejecteth Iron, or another Loadstone, and sheweth the quarters of the World. It is found in divers places, for the most part in Mines of Iron, from whence also it containeth much Iron in it self. For all that body that doth attract, is not the Magnet, but there is in it a Magnetick Vein: Therefore in certain places in <hi>Germany</hi> they draw most excellent Iron forth of it. In <hi>Italy</hi> in the mountains of <hi>Viterby,</hi> and in <hi>Ilna</hi> where it is found, outwardly it is of a ruddish colour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in when it is broken waxing black, and a little tending to blewishness though obscure; in attracting very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious, while it is smitten it trembleth, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a certain dawn which goeth to the Iron, if it be admoved unto it. Also it is digged up in divers places in <hi>Germany,</hi> near the Valley <hi>Ioachim, Swartz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, Sneberg,</hi> &amp;c. Also (he saith) they had it brought from <hi>Norway</hi> of great strength, of which he could shew some. Like this description are those fragments that we buy at the shops, as also that which we have capped with Steel, and bound with Brass or Silver, and those round ones that we call Terrella's. Doctor <hi>Merrett</hi> saith, That there is of it of good note found in the Rocks of <hi>Dartmoore</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and of worse sorts elsewhere. And I have had it from some Gentlemen of very great worth, that lately there is found good store of it in the foresaid County, of very
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:102655:184"/>
excellent force and virtue. And I make small doubt, that seeing we have so many Mines of Iron-stone in his Majesties Dominions, if the Workmen had skill in knowing of it, and were diligent and observant, it might be found in many places; which I commend to all ingenious and laborious Miners.</p>
               <p>Of this stone Haematites <hi>Wormius</hi> saith, That it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> so called either because it is of a sanguineous colour,<note place="margin">Mus.

It is a stone of the colour of coagulated blood, but more obscure, hard, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with streaks like Antimony; it is cloddy, and stayeth bleeding. It seemeth to be of a middle nature, betwixt Earth, Stone, and Metal, when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted into a stony substance, from the shavings or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment which the water hath worn from Ruddle, or some red stone.

As well the Schistus as the Haematites are either like to concreted blood, or to Iron, and then sometimes some of the external parts are of the colour of Saffron. In this at the least it seemeth that a difference is set, that the Haematites or Blood-stone is almost always in the figure of a clod; but the Schistus, either in one part or both, is formed like a Wedge. The sum is as much as may be gathered from <hi>Agricola,</hi> that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth no difference betwixt them, but that which consisteth in the figure.</p>
               <p>To this (as near a kin) we may subjoin the stone called <hi>Smiris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mus. Worm.

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:102655:185"/>
do use it to ingrave in Gems, and to polish Arms. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to the watery Touchstone or Whetstone it yieldeth a sanguineous juyce; of some it is accounted a certain hard species of the Haematites. It is found in the Iron Mines. These we have enumerated, that all ingenious persons might search after them; for if we could find any Smiris, or Emery in our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it would be of great profit unto many.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Lasur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein,</hi>

It hath great affinity with the <hi>Lapis Armenus,</hi> according to colours: but the <hi>Lapis Armenus</hi> is not so hard, neither hath it golden veins, and easily yieldeth into Powder and friability. They set down two sorts of it, one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the force of the fire, the other not. That which is fixed, and doth not change its colour in the fire, is brought forth of the East, from <hi>Asia</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> and is called <hi>Oriental,</hi> and is known by its fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness. That which is not fixed, is found in certain places of <hi>Germany,</hi> and is of a middle kind betwixt the <hi>Armenus</hi> and <hi>Lazulus,</hi> for this is softer, that is harder. I have spoken thus much of this Stone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a good Commodity, and sold dear, and it may be that some of it might be found in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That which I have seen of it is of a fine blue colour, interspersed with little lines, or small sparks of a pure golden colour, and is very hard: Some have called it the Marchasite of Gold, and do believe that Gold doth grow in it, and may be drawn forth of it; but I could never yet procure so much of the best sort of it, to wit, that which is full of golden streaks, as to make any certain or considerable trial of it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIX. Of the Transmutation of Metals.</head>
               <p>COncerning this great dispute of the transmuting of one Metal into another, we intend not here to demonstrate the possibility of it, for as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher said well: <hi>Qnae experimento oculari videntur, probatione non indigent.</hi> Only we shall labour to examine, and open the nature of Transmutations, and to shew some sorts of Transmutation, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and obvious, and full as strange as this of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and thereby shew that it is no such impossible or wonderous thing, as many that would seem wise and learned do labour to make manifest. So leaving general Arguments, as either to confirm or confute, we shall stand upon some instances that may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently demonstrate the way and manner thereof.</p>
               <p>And as for Mutation, Transmutation, or that which is commonly called Generation, we shall not stand upon the strict logical definition, which we do not perceive, yet is perfectly known, but rather make a search what the nature of it may be; that hereafter it may be better understood and sought into, yet (we suppose) that thus much may be granted, that there can be no Generation, but of necessity there must be Mutation; for though that all Mutations be not Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, yet must every Generation of course be a Mutation, and it is most certain that no Mutation can be but by motion; so that in this the Schools have not far missed it (to give them their due, where, and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:102655:187"/>
when they deserve it) that all Generation is some kind of Mutation, and so must needs be a species of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But yet by all this we come not perfectly to know what Generation is in its true nature and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical essence and operation,<note place="margin">

               <p>We might here fall into those strange Mutations that happen in the Animal and Vegetable Kingdom, that appear in the Generation of those things; but that would lead us at too far a distance, though they would mightily conduce to open and illustrate the matter we have in hand; and therefore we shall leave them, as things that have been both learnedly and accurately handled by that learned Physician <hi>Sennertus, Fabritius ab Aqua pendente,</hi> the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Iohannes Marcus Marci,</hi> in that curious piece of his styled <hi>Idaea Idaearum Operatricium,</hi> by our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-sufficiently-praised Country-man Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> in his profound piece <hi>De Generatione,</hi> as lastly, by that learned Physician and Anatomist Dr. <hi>Highmore,</hi> in his Treatise <hi>Of Generation,</hi> which though little in its bulk, is not little in weight and worth.</p>
               <p>But we shall contract our selves into a closer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass to fall upon some mutations, (or transmutations rather) produced by Nature, or Art, that will suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently serve to make forth what we intend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Transmutation of Metals, only we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise this,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:102655:188"/>That all Transmutations are made some of these three ways, or by two of them, or all joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By adding of something to the thing or subject to be changed that it had not before.</item>
                  <item>2. Or by taking away, and separating from the subject that is to be changed, that was in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</item>
                  <item>3. Or by reason of motion so to alter, dispose, and order the contexture of the parts, that thereby it appeareth another thing than what it was before. And either all of these, or some of them do concur in every transmutation, or else there cannot be any: Now we shall give some Instances to make good these Particulars, and examine the manner of Transmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And first of that Transmutation which is produced by Nature, in which Art hath little or nothing to do, as in petrifying of wood, leaves, moss, grass, and the like, which is for the most part done either by Water or other lapidescent Juyces, or steams turning the forementioned things into a stony matter or substance. The first we shall name (as being most known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us) is that famous Dropping Well near the ancient Town of <hi>Knaresborough</hi> in the West-riding of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> mentioned in our <hi>British</hi> Authors, by our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Antiquary Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> and of late written by Dr. <hi>Dean,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Yorkshire Spaw, c. 16. p. 117, 118.</note> and Dr. <hi>French.</hi> The latter of which saith of it thus; If any stick or piece of wood lie in it some weeks, it will be candied over with a stony whitish crust, the inward part of the Wood conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of the same nature as before. But any soft spungie substance, as moss, leaves of Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:102655:188"/>
which the Water can enter, will thereby in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come seemingly to be of a perfect stony nature and hardness. Now the cause of this petrifying property, as Philosophers call it, is <hi>succus lapidescens, i. e.</hi> a stony matter, which is in its <hi>Principiis solutis,</hi> for indeed the <hi>Principia soluta</hi> of all things, whether Animals, Vegetables, Metals, or Minerals, are in a liquid form, and are concreted by degrees, by a natural heat se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from them all accidental humidities, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into their proper species. When the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with which this <hi>Succus lapidesceus</hi> is mixed, is in part wasted by the Sun and Air, it doth then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite it, as being too heavy for it any longer to bear it. And when that is deposited, and faln down, it doth by a continued addition and concretion in time amount to a considerable stony moss, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence we may note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That by his observation and judgment, the stony substance bred by the water, is nothing but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and fixing of the small stony particles hid in the water one unto another, which is meerly Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and so comes to increase the bulk or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity by continual addition. And thus far according to this ingenious person and learned Chymist, here is nothing at all of Transmutation, but that the moss, leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> become seemingly of a perfect stony na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and hardness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet if we look a little more warily, we shall find not only an Aggregation of these small stony par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and an Incrustation upon the out-side of the moss and leaves, but even that the substance of the moss and leaves, and the small atomes of them are meerly petrified as far as our eyes, or the best
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:102655:189"/>
Microscopes can inform us. And though the thicker and greater pieces of Wood, be not in so short a time petrified, as are moss, grass, and the leaves of Trees, yet in a longer continuance of time, Wood of a considerable bulk, will be totally stonified both in the Internal and External parts: So that by this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the dropping Well, stones are not only bred by Aggregation of small stony particles, nor Wood and Moss only crusted over with a stony Concretion, but also that the Moss, Leaves and Wood, are really changed into a stony substance. And though the Explication of the true manner and way how it is done may be occult, and yet require the study of many Observators, and doth not belong to our present enquiry, curiously to search forth: Yet thus much is evident, that upon the supposition, that the Moss, and Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the small parts of them are truly changed into a stony nature, that then the aerial part, or the <hi>Globuli aetherei</hi> (as <hi>Cartesius</hi> calls them) are by the entry of the stony particles contained in the Water, extruded, and so separated. Whereby two of the particulars are made clear; First, that there is something separated from the thing changed that was in it before, and also that there was something added, as the stony Particles, or petrifying Steams or Atoms that was not there before, and consequently that there must be an alteration of the contexture and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the particles of the body changed. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the stress of the matter lies what Transmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, which we are searching after, and yet it may be doubted whether or no there be any real Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation at all, <hi>quoad naturam, sed solummodò, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad nos,</hi> as when by a due proportionable commixture
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:102655:189"/>
of Sand and Ashes, Glass is made, which <hi>quoad nos,</hi> and in relation to our sight is transparent, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sand nor Ashes are; and yet the Sand and Ashes in their primitive nature and principles remain as they were, the individual particles of either of them being not changed, as may appear by the reducing them to the same Sand and Ashes that they were before, which may be made manifest not only by the Alkahest, (only known to Adeptists) but also by other means that may and can be shown by expert Artists: And also when that Silver is dissolved in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> according to our sight it is changed, and the water remaineth transparent, and the Silver may again be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it, as is known unto every expert Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith: it may very well make us doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any real Transmutation or not, but what is by addition, diminution, or altering of parts.<note place="margin">Hector. Boctii Scot. regn. descript. p. 9. Sect. 50.</note> And therefore we shall quote some more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, omitting that of <hi>Hector Boelius</hi> of the Pond in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that if a piece of Wood be stuck down in it, at much of it as is in the earth or mud, is in the space of a year turned into Stone; that part which is in the water, is turned into Iron; and that which is above the water doth remain Wood; so that the same en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire piece is Stone, Iron, and Wood; which were a most strange relation, and fit instance if true. But though we have had it affirmed by a learned Physician that lived long in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that others do maintain that our Irish Stones or Whetstones are of the same petrified Wood, (as the grain or bait would almost perswade) yet because the forecited Author is noted to be fabulous; and much suspected in many things, and it not proved by later Authorities; therefore (I
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:102655:190"/>
say) we shall omit it, and so come to some of those that the faithful and Learned <hi>Helmont</hi> hath noted from Authors of better credit,<note place="margin">De Lithias. l. c. 1. p. 13.</note> who telleth us; For so the hand-glove of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour was petrified in that one part of it that lay wet in the Spring, but the other part being fenced with a seal, remained Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so that not only Herbs, Woods, Bread, Iron, Eggs, Fishes, Birds, and Quadrupedes, were by a wonderful Metamorphosis petrified; but by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Ambrosius Pareus,</hi> a Child at ripe age was cut out of the Womb petrified, which his friend told him that made Mathematical Instruments, that used the back of that petrified Child for a Whetstone; and more to the same purpose he relateth in the same Chapter, from whence amongst others he draweth these Conclusions.</p>

That whereas other seeds require that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, or subject matter be reduced into a sequacious, or an obedient liquor, and susceptible of the seed, which they have called the first matter of Generation, and do require that also that the figure, and all the comeliness of the precedent Concrete be destroyed: yet the petrifying seed, the humane figure, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, without any intervening putrefaction, or disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the matter, doth petrifie the whole through the whole, to wit, as well the bones as the skin.</item>

               <list>
                  <item>1. That whereas he placeth this petrifying quality in an odour or steam, which he maketh invisible and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:102655:190"/>
incorporeal, I take him by incorporeal, not to mean meerly that the steam is altogether spiritual, as the Schoolmen and Metaphysicians understand, but that it is so subtile, tenuious and fine, that it is not liable to our sight; and in regard of other more gross bodies, may be called and accounted incorporeal.</item>
                  <item>2. He plainly holdeth forth petrifaction, not only in the superficial parts, but that it is <hi>totum per totum,</hi> as well in the bones as in the skin, not only by incru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, or adhesion of the stony matter to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts, but by a real changing (in Animals) of the bony, sinewy, musculous, and fleshy parts intrinsically and thoroughout, into a stony substance; to verifie which,<note place="margin">Micrograph. observ. 17. p. 107, 108, &amp;c. Vid Philos. Trans. n. 6. p. 101.</note> more Authorities may be added to <hi>Helmont,</hi> as that of <hi>Pensingius historia infantis, in abdomine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venti, &amp; in duritiem lapideam conversi.</hi> And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature in that accurate and ingenious piece of Mr. <hi>Hooks</hi> Micrography, as also much of this nature may be seen in Mr. <hi>Boyles</hi> Essay of firmness, and in some other places, to which I remit the Reader.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now in all this that the Learned <hi>Helmont</hi> hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or the rest, it will appear that this saxeous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, or seminal Ferment, how thin or fine soever it were, is of a bodily nature, and so piercing the body to be changed, whether of Animals or other things, as Iron, Eggs, Leather, or the like, it doth add some such steams and particles as were not there before, and so doth augment the quantity or weight, if not both; which was one of the things required to be proved. Again, by the ingress (which must be by motion) there must of necessity be a cession of another body, which can be nothing but the Aiery Atoms, or Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Steams, contained before in the porous parts of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:102655:191"/>
the body to be changed, which are thereby extruded and separated; which was another thing to be proved. And as for the third, it necessarily follows, that when a softer body is changed into an harder, or a more flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id body into a firm, the parts are joined more close together; and however all motion in bodies must of necessity make a change of the position, contexture, and order of the minute or smaller parts. By all which we shall only urge thus much, That this petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is as strange as that which the Philosophers call the Transmutation of Metals; as may appear by the comparing of their efficient causes, the manner of their operations together, and also of their effects. To make which plain, we shall here once for all lay down the requisites, and manner of metallick Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation; and so as we go, shew their accord or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement.</p>
               <p>And first, in the Philosophers Transmutation of Metals, they have their subject which they intend to transmute, (to use that common word, though truly the thing that they do, is only to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urate and melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) which is some of the more base Metals (as they are commonly stiled) for as they never mean to change Gold into Gold, for that would be no change: so in the intent of Nature and its Operation, a Stone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be changed into a Stone. And in this the Transmutation of Metals, and of changing Wood, Moss, Leaves, Animals, Iron, and the like, into Stone, doth agree that they both have a substrate, or subject matter to work upon, and so the one not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at more than the other: but there are two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties wherein they differ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For first, in the petrification wrought by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:102655:191"/>
the things changed are not always contained under the same proxime <hi>genus,</hi> and the thing working the effect of stonifying is of a Lapideous or Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nature, and (according to common opinion) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contained within the Animal nor Vegetable Kingdom, and yet are wrought upon by that petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying agent, when in the Philosophick Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the thing changed is under the same proxime <hi>genus,</hi> with the nature of that which it is changed into, being both of a metallick root and nature, and so is less wonderful than the change made by Petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, the things wrought upon by the petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying agent, are more remote from that stony nature into which they are changed, whether they be Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals or Vegetables, as having had no praevious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, to fit them for the susception of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that petrifying power: whereas in the Transmutation of Metals, the Metal to be changed is to be made as clean as Art is able to perform, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that true and certain rule of our Country-man <hi>Ripley,</hi> who saith:
<q>
                     <l>For who that joineth not the Elixirs, with bodies made clean,</l>

               </p>

So that as they agree in having a subject matter to work upon, and in their agents, that they are both of a seminal power; so there is no cause to account the one strange or impossible, and the other not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be by reason that petrifying is more common, and the change of Metals, but seldom or rarely seen, which though it might stagger vulgar brains, yet can be of no moment to a learned and considerate mind.</p>

So in the Transmutation of Metals, there is added some small part of the Philosophers Tincture unto the Metal (as suppose it Lead, or Quicksilver) that is to be changed: And also there is something that is separated from the body changed that was in it before, as less or more of that which some call the external, separable and combustible Sulphur; but <hi>Trevisan</hi> calls it <hi>Scoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drosse,</hi> which being indeed of an Heterogeneous and differing nature from the Homogeneous Mercury, did make its small parts that were Homogeneous one to another, that they could not so nearly be joined <hi>per minima,</hi> which by the ingression of the small quantity of the Tincture are extruded and separated.

And this he inclosed in Wax, lest in throwing it into the Crucible, it might be dispersed by the smoke; which he projected upon a pound of hot Quicksilver, newly bought, and put into a Crucible: And forthwith the Quicksilver, with a little murmuring noise, staid from the flux, and settled to the bottom like a lump. And that the heat of the Quicksilver was but so much as might

               <p n="3">3.

Yet here <hi>Helmont</hi> tells, that it need but be easily hot, and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:102655:194"/>
not violently to any great degree, but as much as may keep melted Lead from recongealing. And this praevious artificial help, besides the cleansing of the Metal to be changed as much as Art can perform, is requisite in metallick Transmutation, though in that wrought by Nature in Vegetables, or Animals, in petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of them, there is no such precedent Preparation, nor adjuvant cause, as external heat or fire, but the petrifying steams, or seminal odour, doth effect the thing without such helping Concomitants, so that (if duly considered) the Work of Nature, without the assistance of Art, in petrifying of Vegetables, and Animals, is more strange and wonderful than the Transmutation of Metals.</p>

                  <note place="margin">De Lithias. c. 1. p. 15.</note> which he thus relates. About the year 1320. betwixt <hi>Russia</hi> and <hi>Tartaria,</hi> in the altitude of 64 degrees, not far from the Pond or Fen called <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taya,</hi> it is read, that an Hord of the people called <hi>Baschirdi</hi> with their whole herd of Cattel, their Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons and Carriages were altogether transmuted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rocks or Stones.

But in metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Transmutation, if the exact degree of the vertue of the Powder transmuting be known, and so be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected upon a just and due proportion, the pondero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity will not much differ from what the Metal changed was of before, as appeareth by that experiment of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s, where he projected one fourth part of a grain of the Gold-making Powder, upon 8 ounces of hot Quicksilver, and it produced 8 ounces of pure Gold, wanting eleven grains, so that here was no great difference in the weight: For reckoning that the 8 ounces of Quicksilver, had the fourth part of a grain added to them, and when changed into pure Gold, had but lost ten grains and three quarters of a
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:102655:195"/>
grain, which must be that either the Quicksilver had in it so much of combustible Sulphur (as <hi>Helmont</hi> in a certain place of his Writings confesseth that all common Quicksilver hath in it less or more of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible and separable Sulphur) that was separated or wasted away in the fire: or that so much of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous body of the Quicksilver did evaporate as being made too hot, and either of these ways it might have been, though the first is most certain, that all imperfect Metals have less or more separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and combustible Sulphur, which in projection is separated and wasted. But howsoever that there be little difference of weight in the metallick body chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from what it was before, yet it always becometh less in bulk, and possesseth lesser room, or place, as appeareth by this of <hi>Helmont,</hi> that the Quicksilver setled with a certain noise to the bottom of the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, and so became of less bulk, and possessed less room. And that this is, and must be so in all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick Transmutations, is most clear, not only from the authority of the Adeptists, but from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing reasons, shewing that in their Transmutation, there is a radical Solution and Penetration of all the small parts or atoms of the Metal to be changed, by the subtile penetrability and ingression of their so much purified and exalted Tincture, and thereby all things in it whatsoever that are of an Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous nature, are separated and extruded, and the Homogeneous Particles joined together <hi>per minima</hi> as much as Nature can admit of, and so must needs be of less bulk, and possess less room or place, which is manifest in Gold, that is one of the heaviest bodies in the same bulk that Nature doth produce,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:102655:195"/>
as being most dense, containing most of matter, and having its particles most closely joined together, that there are few <hi>interstitiums</hi> or spaces for the Air or Aether to enter or possess, which is manifest in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension under the hammer, whereby it will be folia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted farther, and be thinner than any other Metal what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; and so a baser Metal changed into Gold, must of necessity possess less room, and be of less bulk.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And that we may come a little nearer to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest this great work of Transmutation of Metals, we may consider, that though in petrification by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Ordour, or saxeous Ferment, it works upon most bodies as it finds them, either more susceptible, or more apt to resist, which might render its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and effects more difficult and strange.

               <p n="7">7. The ancient Philosophers that were Masters of this great secret of Transmutation, and knew it by experience, and had seen it with their eyes, took little care of framing methodical Definitions or Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, as little valuing such trifles and niceties, but contented themselves with the true understanding of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:102655:196"/>
it; and yet to their Disciples which they termed the Sons of Art, they gave sufficient hints of the way and manner of it, but still as veiled and obscured. But I find that <hi>Paracelsus</hi> (however condemned of many for his too dark writing) to have said more of Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in general, than the most of those that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; some of which we shall here recite, where he saith thus:<note place="margin">Lib. ter. natur. 7. p 97.</note> If we shall write of the Transmutation of all natural things, it is equal and necessary, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things we first shew what Transmutation is: Secondly, what are the degrees to come unto it: Thirdly, by what means, and after what manner it is done. Therefore Transmutation is when a thing loseth its form, and is so altered, that it is altogether unlike its former substance and form, but assumeth another form, another essence, another colour, another virtue, another nature or propriety; as if a Metal be made Glass or Stone, if a Stone be made a burnt Coal, if Wood be made a Coal, Clay be made a Stone or Brick, a Skin be made Glue, Cloth be made Paper, and many such like: Now though this be far from a Logical Definition, as written by one that is generally believed to be no friend to Logick; yet is it no bad Description of Transmutation in general, and may well stand uncondemned, unless by those that can produce a better: for if the things that he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in to be changed be duly considered, the most of them have incidents in the way and mode of their Transmutation, that are as difficult to explicate and declare as the principal things in metallick Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

And that we may more plainly understand the manner of this metallick Transmutation, let us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle consider the virtues and properties which they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to their Tincture when perfected, because by it the operation is performed: for if the nature of the Agent be well known, the effects that it worketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Patient may be the better perceived; and they are thus enumerated and described by that ingenious and experienced person <hi>Iohannes Spagnetus,</hi>

                     <item>4. A fourth is, That all Metals are <hi>in suo interiori,</hi> Gold, Silver, and Mercury, and that metallick Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury can no ways be destroyed, or otherwise the Art of Transmutation were utterly false, which is certain, true, and most true.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. From all this we may plainly gather what Transmutation of Metals is, and how it is wrought: So that if Metals be in their root all of one Mercurial and Homogeneous nature, and that there be perfect Sulphur and Mercury equally as well in the imperfect as perfect Metals, then must their Transmutation be easie; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or then the Heterogeneous matter, or combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible Sulphur, Scoria, or Dross, being removed, and some of the Tincture added, the parts are most close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joined, and so united <hi>per minima,</hi> and tinged, by which means they are maturated in a short time by the help of Art, that Nature could not perform in many years. So that all metallick Mercury wants nothing of the degrees and nature of Gold; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of its Heterogeneous parts, and the adding something more of the fire of Nature, and then it becomes most dense, and to have all the requisites that are necessary to Gold. Agreeable to what we say here, is the opinion of an ingenious person, who saith thus:<note place="margin">Phil. Trans. n. 41. p. 823.</note> To conclude, I shall presume to give you some of my thoughts concerning the so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed-of Transmutation of Metals; concerning which I am of opinion, that the change is erroneously apprehended by many, imagining that the whole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Metal is totally transformed into the more
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:102655:198"/>
perfect by the substance mixed with it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the mixture added to the melted Metal, joins it self (as I conceive) to those parts, which being Homogeneal, symbolize together with the nature of the more perfect, whereby the pure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline parts are separated from the other Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneal impure Sulphurs; which, together with other causes, did hinder Nature in the Mine from concocting that substance into the perfecter Metal.</p>
               <p>A second instance that we shall give, is, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> divers Vitriolate Waters do change Iron put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them into Copper, which <hi>Helmont</hi> doth deny to be any Transmutation, and saith thus: But that Vitriol-bearing Juice is thought to change I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron into Copper,<note place="margin">De Spadan. font. l. para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox. 3. p. 692.</note> the Mine-men themselves not acknowledging the delusion, because that the succeeding Atoms of the Copper do fill up the place of the Iron that was wasted; neither regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as Copper doth render or make Silver dissolved in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> that otherwise was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, to appear to the view, and be corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. So that it is the propriety of Iron dissolved in the Vitriol to manifest the Copper by drawing it to it self, and together in the same act, that the Iron it self is dissolved, and doth vanish in the Fountain. My Witnesses (he saith) are the Fountains themselves; because verily the Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Waters are far more poor in Copper than they were before the Iron dissolved in them, and the Copper thereby recovered from them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to wit verily out of the very Fountain (where
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:102655:199"/>
it is often continued, the flux of new Copper doth fail in the Pit or Spring) the putatitious Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Iron doth otherwise not happen. The manner of doing of which in the Mines of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia,</hi> called <hi>Herrengaundt, Athanasius Kircher</hi> doth thus describe:<note place="margin">Mund. Subter. l. 10. Sect. 4. c. 10. p. 223, 224</note> They take rusty Iron that is unprofitable, as the remainder of various and old instruments used in Houses, and being put into the Furnace and made hot, they are upon the Anvile beaten forth into most thin plates. This being done, they put these plates into the bottom of Vitriolate Water, which doth flow in the most deep Pits of the Mines; and being put there, they leave them for certain months. And the due time ended, they come to the Pit, and find the plates to be gone (or changed) into a yellowish stuff, like unto a soft plaister, and these exposed to the Air and Winds, is hardned into Copper of the best account. And it is so used at <hi>Neosel</hi> in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia:</hi> Therefore it is questioned whether this be a true Transmutation of Iron into Copper, or not. But I say that here true Transmutation is not at all given, seeing that all the whole Iron is not changed into the substance of the Copper, but by accident only, I do explain my self. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in Vitriol infinite Copperish Corpuscles do inexist, and as those have the greatest sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with Iron, so that also it cometh to pass, that forthwith they flow unto the Iron, and do most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately insinuate themselves into its pores; but seeing that they abound with Spirits of great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony, from hence being insinuated into the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:102655:199"/>
Iron, forthwith they begin to corrode it, so far, that all the fatness of the Iron being consumed, the irony substance being dissolved, doth pass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dust, or a rusty powder, the Vitriolate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscules substituting themselves into the place of the Iron being consumed, and the native par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles both of the Iron and Vitriolate Water are conglutinated into one mass, which first truly is soft within the Water, but being exposed unto the more free Air, the wind and beams of the Sun are indurated into perfect Copper, and by this means it is made the same thing that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: before verily by the dispersion of its Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscles in the waters, now by the union of the same attracted from the Iron. But if here were given a true Transmutation, nothing of the Iron should remain after. But experience teacheth, that so much of the irony rust doth remain, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as much as the irony mass did weigh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And after he sheweth an experiment, by a rod or thread of Iron put into some of this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolate Water sent him forth of <hi>Hungary,</hi> in this order: I (he saith) put an Iron thread into a Viol full of this water, which in the space of three days was all consumed, a certain soft mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remaining in the bottom, which separated from the Dross, did yield pure Copper; but the Dross remaining, did almost come to the weight of the thread of Iron; so that from hence no man need further doubt of this matter. Thus far the experience and opinions of these two Learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons touching this kind of change, which they
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:102655:200"/>
will not allow to be a true Transmutation, from whence we shall move some considerable Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and submit them to the judgment of those that have Learning and leisure to examine the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency and validity of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first, if this (in their sense) be not a true mutation, yet of necessity it is an apparent one: for the Iron not only to sense had in it the requisites that are accounted proper to that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, but also really had that which all account the properties of that Metal, as to indure igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, extension by the hammer, and fabrication into instruments, which by being brought into Copper, hath not only a more glorious colour than that of Iron, but will indure ignition even to fusion, and that more easily than any Iron, and is become more extensible than Iron, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of more easie fabrication into instruments. So that this change, (of what sort soever it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be) is a meliorating of the thing, a gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and exalting of it both in intrinsick and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick virtue, the metallick root or nature still remaining. So when the Philosophers mention the Transmutation of Metals, as the changing of Lead or Quicksilver into Gold or Silver, they do but understand a bettering, exalting, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duating of them, the metallick root still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: so that there is no such great difference as many ignorantly do conceive and imagine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, if they mean (as they seem to hold forth) that no Transmutation is true, but where all the Atoms and Corpuscles of the Body
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:102655:200"/>
to be changed, are every and all of them transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without separating of any of them, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any thing unto them, then we must say, that (as far as we either know or understand) few such Transmutations will be found in <hi>rerum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi> brought to pass either by Nature or Art. And for the metallick change that the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers speak of, they never held that all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms or Particles of Lead and Mercury are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted into Sol or Lune, but that the Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous parts onely are, and the Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous parts separated by the addition of some part of their Noble Stone, which is not much differing from this mutation of Iron into Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may consider the manner how this change is done, and that is by taking it for granted, that in the Iron before it be changed, there are store of Corpuscles of Copper, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the Vitriolate Water, and the Water by its Acrimony corroding the Iron, and thereby sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Atoms of the Iron, those of the nature of Copper residing in the said Water, do substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute themselves in the place of the Atoms of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, being separated; and so being Atoms of a congruous Figure, Size, and other Properties, do easily couple themselves together, as being Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneal, and refusing others as of a disagreeing nature. So the Masters do hold that their Stone when exalted and prepared to the red, is <hi>aurum intensum, exuberatum &amp; animatum,</hi> as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed brought and wrought from a Golden Seed;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:102655:201"/>
and that the Homogeneous Mercury of all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, is <hi>in suo interiori</hi> of a golden nature, these two easily unite most closely together, and refuse union with any Heterogeneous body, and so the manner of both these changes are alike.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It would be worth labour to examine the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, whether all Iron, or the Ore from whence it is drawn, have something of the corpuscles of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in it, and (if possible) in what proportion: That thereby it may be considered whether the atoms of Copper be in the Iron, and the atoms of Iron in the Copper, by accidental commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that they come to be so by progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Generation. And then it may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that where there is particles of Copper and Iron mixt in one body, which seemeth to be Iron, and to which we give that denomination, be when it will, or its Ore is found so, in its ascension or descension, as the Mineralists speak, that is, whether in continuance of time more Copper would increase and grow in it, or that in length of time the Copper Atoms would decay or grow into Iron? A Quaerie that may be necessary for all Lovers of Mineral knowledge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is a passage in that profound, though dark piece, written by <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Coelum Philosophorum,</hi> or <hi>Liber Vexationum,</hi> though some of great judgment call it <hi>Liber Fixationum,</hi> which here may well be considered of,<note place="margin">Can. 1 p. 121.</note> and that in this, <hi>Omnia sunt in omnibus occultata. Unum ex ipsis omnibus est occul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator eorum, &amp; corporeum vas, extrinsecum, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibile,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:102655:201"/>
&amp; mobile.</hi> This hint with divers others in that obscure and aenigmatical Writing, though not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by many, that are so idle and lazy, that they will not take pains to break the hard shell, thereby to gain the precious kernel, not minding that <hi>Rosa non nascitur sine spinis,</hi> and that <hi>Dii sua bona laboribus vendunt,</hi> do sufficiently shew, that the nature of Metals is not yet perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. And to me by this he seemeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that all Metals are hid in all Metals, and that one is the hider of them. And therefore the question pertinent to this case, will be, whether the Iron doth hide the Copper, or the Copper the Iron, and so of other Metals; which we shall not decide, but leave it to the judgment and trial of others.</p>
               <p>A third Instance that we shall give, is in an artificial Transmutation (if we may call it so) and that is of Quicksilver, which is a fluid, open and volatile metallick body, and yet is and may be by Art brought into a firm, close and fixed body,<note place="margin">De Febrib. c. 14. p. 52.</note> as <hi>Helmont</hi> declareth thus at large.

               <p>But from hence we shall observe these few things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That this seemeth to be a more strange mutation than any other we can meet with, for by this the common Mercury, an open, flu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> tremulous and volatile body, is made a shut, firm, setled and fixed body, even to abide all the fire of the Bellows, and not to perish in the trial of Lead, which is all that Silver will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</item>
                  <item>2. Here is nothing at all added unto it, but which is again wholly separated from it, for the Alkahest is drawn of the same in number, weight and activity, leaving not the least atome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:102655:202"/>
with the Mercury: Whereas in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Metals by the Elixir, the part of the Powder projected doth remain inseparably with the Metal changed, so that of the two, this act of the liquor Alkahest upon the Mercury is more strange than that of the Elixir upon another Metal.</item>
                  <item>3. They agree in this, that in the Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Metals by the Elixir, the extraneous Sulphur, and Heterogeneous parts (which in quantity less or more are in all Metals) are removed and separated, and so in the fixing of the Mercury the extraneous Sulphur, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted and turned to the outside, by the operation of the Alkahest, which Sulphur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in it the Medical virtue, which by melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down is wasted, consumed, or separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so the change in both is made by separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting something from the body changed, that was in it before.</item>
                  <item>4. By this it is manifest that in both these Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the Mercury by the Alkahest, and some other Metal by the Elixir, both after the change become of less weight than they were before, according to the quantity of the Heterogeneous parts separated from them.</item>
                  <item>5. Lastly, The Mercury is fixed by having the extraneous Sulphur thrust from betwixt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous atomes of the Mercury, and thereby they become more closely united <hi>per minima,</hi> which is the cause, or rather the fixation it self:
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:102655:203"/>
and the Transmutation of imperfect Metals is not only performed by the Extrusion and Separation of their combustible Sulphur, whereby their parts may lie more closely together, but also by the perfect union of the Power projected, with the Mercury of the Metal changed, being both of one radical nature, and of a symbolizing and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous quality and condition.</item>
