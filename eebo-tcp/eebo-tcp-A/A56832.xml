            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>, who is not troubled?</p>
            <p>Among the rest, I (who brought some Faggors to this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion)</hi> stood astonisht, and amazed; to whom the <hi>mischiefe</hi> was farre more manifest then the <hi>Remedy:</hi> At last, I laid my hand upon my heart, and concluded, <hi>It was the hand of God:</hi> Where being plundered in my understanding, I began to make a scrutinie, where the first <hi>Breach</hi> was made, that let in all these <hi>Miseries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I found the whole Kingdome now contructed into a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which consisted of three Estates; A <hi>King,</hi> a House of <hi>Peeres,</hi> and a House of <hi>Commons;</hi> by the <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Unitie</hi> whereof, all things conducible to the <hi>Weale-publique</hi> were to be advised upon, presented, and established.</p>
            <p>I found this <hi>Unitie</hi> dis-joynted, and growne to variance even to <hi>Blood:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Adherents</hi> on the one party; and his two <hi>Houses</hi> and their <hi>Adherents</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>presence</hi> of this division, was the true <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> which both protested to maintaine; <hi>the Libertie of the Subject,</hi> which both protested to preserve; <hi>the priviledges of Parliament,</hi> which both promise to protect: Yet neverthelesse, the <hi>first</hi> never more profaned; the <hi>second</hi> never more interrupted; the <hi>third</hi> never more violated.</p>
            <p>Standing amazed at this <hi>Riddle,</hi> I turned, mine eyes upon his <hi>Majesty;</hi> and there I viewed the <hi>Lords Annointed,</hi> sworne to maintaine the established <hi>Lawes</hi> of this <hi>Kingdome:</hi> I turned mine eyes upon the two <hi>Houses;</hi> and in them I beheld the <hi>Interest</hi> of my Countrey sworne to obey his <hi>Majestie</hi> as their supreme <hi>Governour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I heard a <hi>Romanstranoe</hi> cryed from the two <hi>Houses</hi> I read it; I approved it; I inclined unto it: A <hi>Declaration</hi> from his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;</hi> I read it; I applauded it; I adhered to the justnesse of it: The Parliaments <hi>Answer:</hi> I turned to the <hi>Parliament:</hi> His Majesties <hi>Reply;</hi> I returned to his <hi>Majestie.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64887:4"/>
I resolved it impossible to serve two <hi>Masters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I fled to <hi>Reason;</hi> Reason could not satisfie me: I fled to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies</hi> Policie could not resolve me: at length, finding no <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,</hi> but that which first I should have sought; I hyed me to the <hi>Book of God</hi> as the <hi>Great Oracle,</hi> and ushering my Inquest with <hi>Prayor &amp; Humiliation,</hi> I opened the sacred leaves, which (not by chance) presented to my first eye the 20 of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi> v. 2. <hi>The fear of a King is as the roaring of a Lyon, &amp; who so provoketh him to Anger, sinneth against his own soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I began to search, and found as many places to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as would swell this Sheet into a <hi>Volume;</hi> so that in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short space, I was so furnished with such strict <hi>Precopts,</hi> backt with such strong <hi>Examples,</hi> that my <hi>Judgement</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and my wavering <hi>Conscience</hi> so throughly convinced, that by the Grace of that <hi>Power</hi> which directed me, neither <hi>feare,</hi> nor any <hi>By-respects</hi> shall ever hereafter remove me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse some <hi>cleaner</hi> light direct me.</p>
            <p>But, above all the Rest, a <hi>Precept</hi> and an <hi>Example</hi> out of the Old <hi>Testament</hi> (strongly confirmed by a <hi>Precept</hi> and an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> out of the <hi>New)</hi> setled my opinion and established my <hi>Resolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first <hi>Precept</hi> out of the Old, <hi>Jeremy,</hi> 27. v. 6. Where it pleased <hi>God</hi> to owne <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> his servant, (although a <note place="margin">Pre. 1.</note> a known <hi>Pagan,</hi> a profest <hi>Idolater,</hi> and a <hi>fierce Porsecuter</hi> of all Gods Children) concerning whom he saith, v. 8. <hi>They that serve not the King of Babylon, and that will not put their necks under his Yoak, I will punish them with the Sword, Pamine, and the Pestilence, till I have consumed them.</hi> v. 9. <hi>Therefore hearken not to your Diviners and Prophets, that say unto you, You shall not serve the King of Babylon, for they prophosio a lye unto you,</hi> v. 10. <hi>But the nations that shall serve the King of Babylon, and bring their necks under his Yoak, those will I let remain in their own land, (saith the Lord) and they shall till it, and dwell therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can there be a stricter <hi>Precept?</hi> or could there be a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious <hi>Prince?</hi> And yet this <hi>Precept,</hi> and yet this <hi>Prince</hi> must be obeyed nay, <hi>sub paena</hi> too; Upon the paine of <hi>Gods</hi> high wrath, fully exprest in <hi>Famine, Sword</hi> and <hi>Pestilence,</hi> not onely
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64887:5"/>
upon the <hi>People,</hi> but upon the <hi>Priests</hi> also, that shall perswade them unto <hi>disobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second <hi>Precept</hi> is enjoyned us out of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. <hi>Let every soule be subject to the higher Powers, for</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pre. 2.</note> 
               <hi>there is no power but of God; the Powers that be, are ordained of God: whosoever therefore r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Gods <hi>Command</hi> should be a sufficient Argument, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is enough: But when he adds a <hi>Reason</hi> too, he answers all <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:</hi> But when he threatens a <hi>punishment</hi> (no lesse then <hi>damnation)</hi> upon the resistance thereof, he hath used all means to perswade a <hi>necessitie</hi> of obedience.</p>

               <hi>Let every soule be subject.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not equall, much lesse superiour. And what is taking up of <hi>Armes,</hi> but an implyed supposition of at least <hi>equalitie?</hi> What are the hopes of conquest but an Ambition of <hi>Superioritie?</hi> What is condemning, judging, or deposing, but <hi>Supremacie?</hi> For it is against the <hi>nature</hi> of an Inferiour to condemne, judge, or depose a Superiour.</p>
            <p>And, lest the Rebellious should confine his obedience to a <hi>good Prince,</hi> the next words reply.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Who limited it? God or man? Man could not limit the <note place="margin">Ans</note> Power he never gave: if God, shew me where; till then, this objection is frivolous.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But admit it lawfull, (though neither granted nor warranted) that subjects may upon such tearmes make a defensive Warre; does it not quite crosse the nature of a defensive Warre, to <hi>Assayle, pursue,</hi> and <hi>dis-possesse?</hi>

            <p>When you shot five peeces of <hi>Ordnance,</hi> before one was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> was that defensive?

               <note place="margin">Ans.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If ye feare the <hi>alteration</hi> of the Old, (having your Soveraigns <hi>Oath,</hi> which you dare not beleeve) what other assurance can you have?</p>
            <p>The Blood you shed, is <hi>certaine;</hi> the change you feare, is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine:</hi> It is no wisedome to apply a <hi>desperate</hi> Remedy to a <hi>suspected</hi> disease.</p>
            <p>If the enjoyment of Peace depends upon a full <hi>assurance</hi> of Truth, our discords may beare an everlasting date: God hath threatned to remove his <hi>Candlestick</hi> and our wickednesse just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feares it; And so long as we feare it, shall we abjure <hi>Peace,</hi> the blessed <hi>meanes</hi> to prevent it? He that seekes to <hi>settle</hi> Truth by the sword, <hi>distracts</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Or, is it a Truth ye <hi>want?</hi> If so, Is it of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline?</hi> If of doctrine, <hi>Actum est de nostra Religione,</hi> Farewell our Religion. Or, is it of <hi>Discipline?</hi> Discipline is but a <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> And did the Lord of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> dispence with a <hi>morall</hi> Law, for the preservation of an <hi>Oxes</hi> life, or an <hi>Asses?</hi> and shall we, to alter some few indifferent <hi>Ceremonies</hi> (allowed by the Parliaments of three <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> Princes, and the practise of many holy <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who sealed the true Protestant Religion with their <hi>Blood)</hi> cry down <hi>Peace,</hi> and shed the blood of many thousand <hi>Christians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>seduced</hi> Protestants will have no <hi>set Forms</hi> of Prayer but what proceed immediatly from their owne <hi>Fancies.</hi> This is their Truth.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Semi-separatists</hi> wil heare our Sermons (if they like the Teacher) but no <hi>Divine Service.</hi> This is their Truth.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Separatists</hi> will not <hi>communicate</hi> in our Churches, nor
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64887:9"/>
               <hi>joyne</hi> in our Congregations. That is their Truth.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Anabaptists</hi> will not baptize till yeares of discretion, and <hi>re-baptize.</hi> That is their Truth.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Antinomians</hi> will have no <hi>Repentance.</hi> This is their truth.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Independents</hi> will have an universall <hi>Paritie;</hi> This their Truth.</p>
            <p>Good God, when shall we have <hi>Peace,</hi> if not till all these <hi>Truths meet!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>Christ</hi> sayes, <hi>I come not to bring Peace, but the Sword:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ob.</note> therefore, for the propagation of <hi>Peace,</hi> it is lawfull to use the <note place="margin">Mar. 10. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, He is tearmed a <hi>stumbling block,</hi> and does that warrant us <note place="margin">Ans.</note> to <hi>stumble?</hi> So, He sayes, <hi>All you shall be offended because of me;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Co. 1. 23. Mat. 26. 31. Rom. 7. 7.</note> and does this patronize our Offences? The Law is good and just: Because <hi>then we had not knowne sinne but by the Law,</hi> is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lawfull for us to <hi>sinne?</hi> God forbid.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour brings the <hi>Sword</hi> among us, as <hi>wholesome meat</hi> brings sicknesse to a <hi>weakely sick</hi> stomack, or physick to a body abounding with <hi>Humours;</hi> not intentionally, but occasionally.</p>
            <p>Thus, by your erroneous and weake mistakes, you make the <hi>Prince of Peace</hi> the Patron of your unnaturall Warre; and the God of <hi>Truth,</hi> the president of your unexamined <hi>errors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Almightie God, the <hi>Champion</hi> of his owne Truth, and maintainer of his own <hi>Cause,</hi> hath (to mere then common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration) appeared in this great <hi>enterprize.</hi>

            <p>He that delivered <hi>Israels handfull</hi> from the hand of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roahs Host,</hi> hath shewed himselfe in the (almost incredible) proceedings of this heaven-displeasing <hi>Warre;</hi> the brief relation whereof may move those hearts, that are not seated, or stone, to melt into a thankfull acknowledgement of his <hi>Power,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as Monuments of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> that children (yet unborne) may say hereafter, <hi>God was here: viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two Houses of Parliament made first a generall seizure of all the <hi>Armes, Ammunition, Castles, Forts, Magazines,</hi> and <hi>Ships,</hi> (being the whole visible strength of this unhappie King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) to whom (having now setled the <hi>Militia,</hi> both by Sea and Land, in their own hands) tides of Proposition-<hi>gold</hi> came
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64887:9"/>
in upon the <hi>Publique Faith; Money</hi> (like blood from the Liver, conveighed through all the veines) issued to make a large sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and where it stopt a while, mountains of massie <hi>Plate,</hi> from the vast <hi>Goblet</hi> to the slender <hi>Thimble,</hi> this <hi>Faith</hi> removed into their safe possession: And when the great <hi>Milch-Cow</hi> began to slake, they prest her nipples, and by hard streyning <hi>renew'd</hi> the stream. As Physicians evacuate the Body, sometimes by <hi>Vomit,</hi> sometimes by <hi>Purge,</hi> sometimes by <hi>Phlebotomie,</hi> sometimes by <hi>sweating,</hi> sometimes <hi>fluxing,</hi> sometimes <hi>diuretically,</hi> yet purge but the same <hi>peccant humour;</hi> So did they, first by <hi>Proposition,</hi> then by way of <hi>Contribution,</hi> now by way of <hi>Loan,</hi> then by way of <hi>Subsidie</hi> (no lesse then 50 at one time) here by way of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessement,</hi> there by way of <hi>Twentieth part,</hi> then by way of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,</hi> one while by way of <hi>Sequestration,</hi> then by way of <hi>Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> but still the issue, MONY: And to work the better upon the Affections of the Multitude, all this for the behoof of <hi>King and Parliament,</hi> for the pretended defence of (God knowes what) <hi>Religion;</hi> insomuch, that men came in like <hi>Swarmes</hi> to the next Tree, or rather like treacherous <hi>Decoys,</hi> with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent multitude, into the <hi>Net,</hi> and <hi>Horses</hi> without number.</p>
            <p>Thus were they supplyed with all necessaries which the <hi>Arme of flesh</hi> could provide for the waging of an <hi>unconquerable</hi> War, whereon the Money alreadie expended, makes no lesse figures then 17. <hi>Millions</hi> Ster. besides the Revenues of the <hi>King Queen, Prince, Duke of Yorke,</hi> and the <hi>whole Estates</hi> of all such as take up Armes against them, besides free <hi>Quarter,</hi> and Souldiers yet unpayd.

            <p>Neither does he call in <hi>Papists</hi> as Papists, to <hi>maintaine</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (as himselfe hath often manifested) but as subjects to <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due,</hi> or at least qualifie Sedition.</p>

Or, put the case, this necessary <hi>Consequence</hi> could be avoided, think you the ambition of some <hi>new</hi> States-men accustomed to such Arbitrary, and <hi>necessitated</hi> power, on the one side, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining loyaltie of His Majesties <hi>dis-inherited</hi> Subjects watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all opportunities to right their injur'd Soveraigne, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, on the other side, would not raise perpetuall <hi>tempests</hi> in this Kingdome?</p>
            <p>Or, if such an (almost) unpreventable <hi>evill</hi> should not ensue, think you, such swarmes of <hi>Sectaries</hi> sweat for nothing? Are their purses so apt to bleed to no end? Will not their costs, and paines expect, at least, a <hi>congratulatory</hi> connivence in the <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of their consciences? Or, will their swords, now in the strong possession of so great a multitude, know the way into their quiet <hi>scabbards,</hi> without the expected <hi>liberty</hi> of their Religions?

            <p>Nay, more, did not his Majesty so promise the severe execution of the <hi>Statute</hi> against all <hi>Recusants,</hi> that if he failed, he desired not the <hi>ayde</hi> of his good Subjects?</p>

            <p>NOw thou hast heard the Harmony of Scriptures, without Corruption; and the Language of Reason, without So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry.</p>
            <p>Thou hast not only heard Divine Precepts, but those Precepts backt with holy Examples: Neither those out of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, but likewise out of the New. Being now no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lest for thy Exceptions, prevaricate no longer with thy own soule: And, in the feare of God, I now adjure thee once againe, as thou wilt answer before the Tribunall at the dreadfull and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day; that thou faithfully examine, and ponder the plaine Texts which thou hast read, and yeelding due obedience to them, stop thine eares against all sinister expositions; and remember, that historicall Scripture will admit no allegoricall interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If any thing, in this Treatise, shall deserve thy Answer, doe it punctually, briefly, plainly, and with meeknes; If, by direct Scripture, thou canst (without wresting) refute my Error, thou shalt reforme, and save thy Brother; If not, recant thine, and hold it no dishonor to take that shame to thy self, which brings Glory to thy God.</p>
            <p>1 PET. 3. 15.</p>
            <p>Be alwayes ready to give an answer to every one that asketh you a reason, with meeknes and feare.</p>
