            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Should the same Fate, call us to do the same Part over again, (as things look scurvily) we would as chearfully lay down our <hi>Rags</hi> and <hi>Carkasses</hi> to serve his <hi>Majestie</hi> in <hi>Being,</hi> at the same rate, as we have <hi>Hazzard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and wasted them: First, to <hi>Defend</hi> the <hi>Murthered Father;</hi> and then, to <hi>Restore</hi> his <hi>Royal</hi> and <hi>Banish'd Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.</hi> This we would do, upon a single and changeless Principle of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> without the aid of <hi>Borrowed CORDIALLS.</hi> And yet we thank you for supplying us even with what we did not want.</p>

               <p>In Fine: he that presses a Prince to any action of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Incovenience, does his endeavour to divide him from the hearts of his people.</p>
               <p>Those that would make him <hi>Cheap,</hi> go other wayes to work: and when a Prince is neither <hi>Lov'd,</hi> nor <hi>Fear'd,</hi> hee's in an ill Condition.</p>
               <p>He that disputes the <hi>Mandates</hi> of his Prince: neglects his <hi>Proclamations:</hi> behaves himself <hi>Rudely,</hi> or talkes <hi>scurrilously</hi> in his Presence,â€”lessens the <hi>Reverence</hi> of Majesty.</p>

               <p>To conclude; Those discontents must needs be dreadfull, where <hi>Want, Disgrace, Revenge, Number,</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> meet to promote a Common mischief, and only <hi>Passive Christianity</hi> to keep the Peace.</p>
               <p>Although we have been larger then becomes us pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, in the Discourse of publique <hi>Enemies,</hi> and <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> it remains yet that we say something concerning his Majesties <hi>Friends:</hi> That is, <hi>Those</hi> of his <hi>Friends,</hi> of whom we have said nothing among his <hi>Enemies.</hi>

               <p>The Number of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> is no ill Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the others strength: for (except <hi>Romanists</hi>) the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> have certainly the same <hi>Friends,</hi> and for the most part, the same <hi>Enemies.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Reckoning will arise the odds of at least <hi>Thirty</hi> for <hi>One</hi> throughout the Nation.

               </p>
               <p>What was the Reason, that the <hi>Godly Legions</hi> after

they were baffled by the <hi>Independents,</hi> would never yet joyn frankly with the <hi>Royalists,</hi> but upon all occasions left them still in the Lurch?

               <p>He that would take a just accompt of the <hi>Other</hi> side, let him begin with the first War, and see how much <hi>Noble,</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi> Blood was spilt before the devout Traytors reach'd the <hi>Kings;</hi>â€”How many Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Wealthy Families were brought to Beggery;â€”How many <hi>Poyson'd,</hi> and dispatch'd in Gaols, and for no other Crime, but that they lov'd his Majesty.</p>

               <p>This is not yet to say, that we are bound to thrust our Necks into the Nooze, and offer up our selves as willing Sacrifices, to appease the Spirit of Rage and Cruelty.

the Kings Authoritie to be above that of the Two Houses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Other side; <hi>We</hi> are not lesse perplexed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about our <hi>Soveraign;</hi> all Meanes are used to <hi>Create, Quicken,</hi> and <hi>Foment Mis-understandings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Last</hi> was <hi>Our</hi> King, the Godly Party tells us, but <hi>This</hi> is <hi>Theirs;</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> must be now the <hi>White Boy,</hi> which looks as if 'twere so indeed, if we compare <hi>Conditions,</hi> and search no further then the <hi>Outside</hi> of the Differenee.

               <p>These Incongruities may trouble us, but to impute them to the King, were to commit a sin against <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> So far is his Majesty from <hi>Allowing</hi> or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting</hi> them, they are kept as much as possibly, from his bare <hi>Knowledge:</hi> The Plot is laid against <hi>Him,</hi> and as they did before, they do but now remove his <hi>Friends,</hi> to make way to his <hi>Person.</hi> The Reason why we are not Relieved, is <hi>This,</hi> we put our Businesse into wrong hands, and apply to the <hi>Causes</hi> of our mischief for the <hi>Remedy</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>If we look close to the matter, we shall perceive that many of the Kings Favours were <hi>Extorted; Some Surreptitiously</hi> obteyned; <hi>Others, Abus'd</hi> and <hi>Misapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by second hands, that were entrusted to dispose of them better.

               </p>
               <p>There are another sort also of <hi>cold Comforters,</hi> that tell us, <hi>'tis not Time yet.</hi> This, to a company of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that can <hi>stay</hi> no longer then they can <hi>Fast,</hi> yields lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Are we such <hi>Owles,</hi> as not to see the Sun at Noon? 'Tis time <hi>Enough</hi> for some that tell us these fine things, (even before the <hi>Kings Revenue</hi> is setled) to beg their <hi>Fourty, Fifty,</hi> nay their <hi>Hundred Thousand Pound</hi> a man, and when the Nation shall be drawn so low, that every <hi>Tax</hi> runs <hi>Blood;</hi> 'tis then <hi>Prognosticated,</hi> that something shall be done for <hi>us:</hi> That is, the Honour shall be ours, to finish the undoing of the Nation, and furnish Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for another War.</p>
               <p>This consequence looks not much wide, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the worst, <hi>rather let us Resolve to suffer any thing for his Majesty, then cause him to suffer in the Least for us.</hi>

               <p>By this Course, they purpose to lessen both our <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> and <hi>Number,</hi> for <hi>Poverty</hi> is a fair step toward <hi>Contempt,</hi> and they think <hi>want</hi> will drive men any whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to seek their <hi>Bread.</hi> They are not Ignorant of the Likelihood of (what they more then Covet) a <hi>Forrein War,</hi> from whence (how fatall soever it prove to the Publique) they may pretend to reap these two Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. <hi>First,</hi> they may pack their Gang with more Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity at <hi>home,</hi> when the Peoples eyes are all <hi>abroad: Secondly,</hi> they fore-cast to have the Quarrel fought by the Hands of <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> which is no other then to commit that Businesse to be dispatch'd by <hi>Foreigners,</hi> which they cannot so conveniently do <hi>themselves.</hi> That it will come to this, may rationally appear from the Constitution of those Missions allready designed.</p>

                  <hi>Confession,</hi> (sayes he) <hi>is requisite to true Repentance, not onely That to God, but to Men also; (such as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it) that is, to Those against whom the offence was committed, and to such as to whom occasion was thereby given of offending.</hi> Judas <hi>his sinne was against Christ; but in Betraying the Innocent Bloud, he ministred occasion to the Priests and Elders of Sinning, <hi>by giving them the means of Taking and Condemning him, for a summe of mony:â€”</hi> so he confessed as well before the Priests and Elders, as to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>have sinned</hi> (sayth <hi>Iudas) in Betraying Innocent bloud.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non-Restitution is Damnation; and Restitution is the way to Salvation,</hi> (saies <hi>Stock</hi> of Repentance, p. 102.) and again: <hi>If it be a sin to Take, it is a sin to Keep.</hi> (Ibid. p. 92.)</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Perkins, Dike, Calvin,</hi> all the world agree upon the Necessity of <hi>Restitution.</hi> In fine, <hi>Non-Restitution</hi> is <hi>Theft.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The use we are to make of All, is onely to look to our selves, and to commit nothing to <hi>Hazzard,</hi> that may be secured by <hi>Prudence.</hi> Which cautionary <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> must not yet carry us beyond the line of <hi>Duty:</hi> For tho' as <hi>Christians, they</hi> are not <hi>absolved</hi> by the Act of Indempnity; yet as <hi>Subjects, Wee</hi> are <hi>Obliged</hi> by it, nor shall we start an Inch from the Literal strictnesse of it.</p>
               <p>It is an Act of <hi>Free,</hi> and <hi>General Pardon, Indempnity,</hi> and <hi>Oblivion,</hi> granted upon such <hi>Reasons,</hi> and <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> with such <hi>Provisoes</hi> and <hi>Limitations</hi> as are therein expressed; extending from <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1. 1637. to <hi>Iune</hi> 24. 1660.</p>
               <p>As it is a <hi>Pardon,</hi> we complain not; Nor doe we pretend any <hi>Legal Right</hi> to what we have <hi>Lost,</hi> in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning their <hi>Consciencious Right</hi> to what they have <hi>Taken.</hi> If <hi>They will</hi> do what they ought <hi>not</hi> to doe;â€”<hi>Keep it;</hi>â€”<hi>We</hi> shall however <hi>doe</hi> what we <hi>ought</hi> to do;â€”Sit down with <hi>Submission</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> so that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity</hi> is safe too.</p>

               <p>Let us not be too Credulous then, and gape after empty Hopes that will deceive us.

               </p>
               <p>Let us a little observe, how they have already strew'd the way to their Design.</p>
               <p>With Reverence to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Act of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity,</hi> and with submission to the <hi>Force,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of it: wee'l begin <hi>There;</hi> and understand it as a mixture of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Expedience,</hi> granted on their behalfe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64324:18"/>
whose <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> were forfeited to the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Act makes them Masters, in effect, of the Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Three Nations: (bating <hi>Crown,</hi> and <hi>Church-Lands</hi>) and all they have gotten by a Griping <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Usurpation</hi> of allmost twenty years Continuance, they may now call their Owne; those People that Contested to preserve the Law, being, by these <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi> abandoned to the Comfort of an <hi>irreparable,</hi> but an <hi>Honourable ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To what they had <hi>gotten</hi> before, let us adde the <hi>Debt</hi> they left in <hi>Arriere</hi> both at Sea, and Land; together with what they have begg'd since, in <hi>Mony, Land,</hi> and <hi>Office.</hi> Truly all this put together, one would think might satisfie a Reasonable sort of People.</p>
               <p>Now to look a little the <hi>other</hi> way. The <hi>King</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have contracted great Debts, his <hi>Active</hi> Friends are <hi>Begger'd:</hi> and Those whose <hi>Inclinations</hi> were but <hi>suspected Loyal,</hi> have smarted sufficiently for it. Come to the <hi>Generality;</hi> ye shall not find quick Mony enough to keep <hi>Commerce</hi> alive, all wanting, and complaining. Now let us Rationally consider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whither does this Condition of the Publique tend; and whence does it proceed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Kings Debts</hi> must be <hi>Payd,</hi> his <hi>Revenue setled,</hi> his <hi>Guards maintained;</hi> and beyond all This, (in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon view, a <hi>Forein war</hi> inevitable. (The Relief of his Majesties Friends, is a thing but by <hi>the By;</hi> that goes for nothing.) All this is necessary to be done; but <hi>Where, How, Whence,</hi> (without a <hi>Mine</hi>) who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine? A General Imposition will hardly furnish it, the Treasure of the <hi>Nation</hi> being drawn into so <hi>few hands,</hi> and <hi>They</hi> too have the wit to keep it close, for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64324:18"/>
divers reasons; as well to conceal their prodigious, and most unconscionable <hi>Gettings,</hi> as to <hi>secure</hi> their <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game;</hi> which they are provident enough to expect.</p>
               <p>To rayse these <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Large Summes,</hi> if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and formal wayes will not suffice, Others lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable must be thought upon. So that upon the whole, either his <hi>Majesty</hi> cannot be <hi>supplyed,</hi> even in those Exigencies which most concern the <hi>Honour,</hi> and the <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Nation:</hi> or else the <hi>Generality</hi> must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer exceedingly by the Pressure; to which some further trouble may possibly arise even from the manner of Imposing it.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Discontents</hi> come to this <hi>Ripenesse,</hi> then is the time for the <hi>Old Patriots</hi> to put in again, <hi>and mourn over the Oppressed.</hi> They shall shew the People what is against <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right, the Law of the Land, and the Liberty of the Subject.</hi> Then shall they <hi>with all Dutyfull Reverence humbly declare to his Sacred Majesty that it is their Antient and Undoubted</hi> RIGHT, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In short, <hi>Great Payments</hi> will certainly cause <hi>Great Disquiets;</hi> and there are those will take advantage of them.</p>
               <p>This is the Clear and natural tendencie of Affairs; and it behoves us to provide and Arm our selves against the Malice of it: which may be done, by a sober En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie into the <hi>Grounds,</hi> and <hi>Causes;</hi>â€”by <hi>whose</hi> Contrivance and Design, the Publique lyes reduced to this <hi>Extreme Necessity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>War</hi> occasioned our <hi>Destruction:</hi> but who occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned the <hi>War?</hi> wee'll only answer for our selves: that the <hi>Cavaliers Cause</hi> was as good as the <hi>Kings Title</hi> to the Crown. Briefly, Those that have robb'd the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64324:19"/>
to <hi>Enrich</hi> themselves, are the Cause why the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique is not able to <hi>Support</hi> it self: <hi>Forfeited Estates</hi> would have set All clear, without taking in either the <hi>Army Officers,</hi> or the <hi>Converted Cavaliers</hi> into the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning. Nay more, they might have been left yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they began, for they have been no ill Husbands of their Pillage. But so was the State of the Nation represented to his Majestie, and such was his Royal Goodnesse, that he thought fit to remit all; and 'tis our Duty not to murmur at it: only let us not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, when it comes to the Question, by what hand we perish.</p>
               <p>To conclude, their Designs are frivolous, if we our selves do not assist them, either by <hi>Crediting</hi> against our <hi>Reason,</hi> or by <hi>Ioyning</hi> with them against our <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are our <hi>Open</hi> and <hi>Known</hi> Adversaries, (if we can <hi>see</hi> or <hi>know</hi> any thing) but there's another sort, which only time must unmasque, and against whom, this Caution (for the present) shall suffice.</p>
