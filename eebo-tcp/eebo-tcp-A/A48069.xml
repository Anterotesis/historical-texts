         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE:
A
DISCOURSE
OF
DEATH.</head>
            <p>IT is no little advantage we receive from our Religion, that it is ſo
mightily effectual to free us from all troubleſome and diſquieting
thoughts, and to produce in us a ſettledneſs and firmneſs of mind,
not apt to be eaſily ſhaken or moved; nay it inſpirits men with courage
and an ingenuous confidence, raiſing us above thoſe fears and cares
that follow falſe Opinions, and like Ghoſts are wont to torment ot<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ſerable
This is a great kindneſs that the Faith of Chriſt doth to thoſe w<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
live according to it, that it puts them into ſuch a ſtate, that they
need fear nothing but diſpleaſing, or offending God; eſpecially our
Chriſtianity is the moſt proper remedy againſt the unreaſonable fear
of death, for that muſt neceſſarily diſtract the mind, and interrupt
its peace by continual vexation and perplexity, in all thoſe who are
under the power of it, and therefore moſt fitly call'd by the Apoſtle
here a ſtate of Bondage. And deliver them who through fear of
death, were all their life time ſubject to Bondage.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not diſpute here, whether by death is meant onely that
which is temporal, or that which is eternal, ſince it is the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
or fear of eternal death chiefly that makes the other ſo tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and affrighting. It would be an eaſie thing to conquer the fear
of death, one might ſoon be able to think of it with the greateſt
indifference and unconcernedneſs, if we could but once thoroughly
<pb facs="tcp:101167:3"/>
perſuade our ſelves that it would put an utter end to us. It is the
Judgement to come, the never dying worm, the everlaſting flames
and immortality that are to follow, that make men ſo loth to think
of dying, ſo unwilling to hear of it, ſo ſurpriſed at any ſign or ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of it. Were there no other ſtate after this, the generality of
men would be ſo far from fearing death, that they would fly to it
as the onely certain cure for the evils of this life, any little diſeaſe,
pain and burthen that they could not eaſily get rid of, they would
ſeek a remedy for in death. Were there not, I ſay, in all men a
natural dread of the ill Conſequences of death, I cannot but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that mens own hands would ſend more daily to the cold Grave
than all the diſeaſes and caſualties that our bodies are liable to, and
it would be ſo far from an inſtance of courage and bravery to
deſpiſe death, that the greateſt Cowards would moſt deſire
it and ſooneſt fly to it. But let them doe what they can, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
wholly free their minds, at leaſt, from all ſuſpicion of another
world, and that makes them moſt commonly ſo fearfull of dying.
So that it comes to the ſame, whether by death be meant here of
the body onely, or a future ſtate, for that which makes us fear death
is becauſe it leads us into another life.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall now explain to you,</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>I.</hi> How men by the fear of death are ſubjected to Bondage.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>II.</hi> Inquire what this fear of Death is that Chriſt delivers us
from.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>III.</hi> How Religion doth free us from it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> How men by the fear of death are ſubjected to Bondage. For
this is the natural effect of any fear whatſoever, that it makes men
ſlaves, it cowardizes them, and renders them mean and abject;
particularly the fear of death ſo enſlaves thoſe that are poſſeſſed of
it, that they can neither think freely nor act freely, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
can neither be truely good nor really happy in this life.</p>
            <p>This fear doth hinder men from thinking freely. And therefore
we read of thoſe that have commanded that none ſhould name this
word death in their hearing. Such perſons who are afraid to die,
dare not give themſelves free liberty to exerciſe their minds, and
are fain to take all occaſions of diverting themſelves, and find any
entertainment rather than be put in mind of their continual danger.
<pb facs="tcp:101167:3"/>
They uſe all arts to ſtifle and ſmother ſuch thoughts as ſoon as
they riſe. Their hearts are ready to ſink within them when they
hear of any diſmal calamity that hath happen'd unto a Neighbour
or Friend, leſt the ſame ſhould betide them, and their own turn
ſhortly come. And this is generally true, that he can neither fully
enjoy himſelf nor take pleaſure in himſelf, who hath not maſtered
this fear of death.</p>
            <p>It hinders men from acting freely. He is a ſlave to every man,
that hath power enough to doe him a miſchief, who is afraid of
death. Whatever Religion or Profeſſion he is now of, you may ſoon
threaten or ſcare him out of it, and make him whatever you pleaſe.
Such a one cannot promiſe to-himſelf that he ſhall continue one day
longer in that mind, that faith that he now holds. There is no
ſin ſo vile or heinous, but what he may be brought to commit. Put
but his life in danger, fright him thoroughly, and he will renounce
all the Articles of his Creed, and break all the Commandments his
Religion lays upon him, for every one that doth but wear a ſword.
And is not this a truely ſlaviſh condition, when we can neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
our own thoughts, nor be maſter of our own actions? And
this is certainly the caſe of all thoſe, that do not love God better
than their lives, or that fear death more than ſin. Such a one can
neither be good nor happy; not good longer than while he finds it
ſafe and free from all danger, and how can he be happy who ſtands
in ſuch a continual dread that a thouſand accidents may this hour
happen to him, and that death muſt certainly befall him, and that
it is onely God's infinite patience that it doth not preſently. And
without any more words I know you will all grant this a miſerable
ſtate. But now I do not ſay this is the effect of all kind of fear
of death, I muſt therefore more particularly ſhew what kind of fear
it is that makes men ſo unhappy.</p>
            <p>Moſt men have great reaſon to be afraid of dying, as much as
a guilty Priſoner hath to be afraid of coming to his Tryal and
brought to his Sentence. The more ſome men fear death, the more
troubleſome thoughts and apprehenſions it occaſions in them, the more
capable are they to be wrought upon by it. Nay indeed it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for a guilty perſon not to fear death, although perhaps
ſometimes out of a brave indifferency in the heat of bloud and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
he may deſpiſe it, valiantly ruſh into the midſt of danger,
and with a bold and daring ſpirit voluntarily expoſe himſelf to it,
out of a ſenſe of pretended honour and gallantry; yet let him think
coolly and ſoberly of ſuch a thing, let him conſider of it with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:101167:4"/>
and the conſequences thereof, and I am ſure he will be very
miſgiving and ſuſpicious, and ſtruggle mightily with himſelf at the
thoughts of it. I ſpeak not to leſſen the fears of thoſe who live
in any known ſin; if God be true they have great reaſon to be
afraid.</p>
            <p>Now here it may be asked, ſuppoſing a man brought into extreme
danger of his life for the ſake of his Religion, in a time of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
one that hath long profeſſed the true Religion, but hath lived
very unanſwerably to it, and is guilty of many grievous crimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented
of, which he is accuſed by his own conſcience for; of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
he is commanded to renounce his Faith which in his mind he
is verily perſuaded is true, and to turn to Idolatry, and to deny
and blaſpheme his Saviour, or elſe immediately to ſuffer death;
what muſt ſuch a one doe now in this caſes If he complies with
the command, he ſins grievouſly againſt the light of his mind and
his own conſcience, and yet by ſuch a complyance he gains time of
repentance, to make his peace with God, and to beg his pardon for
his crime, and alſo for all his other ſins which he hath ſo long
lived in. If he chuſes death, it is that which he is wholly unprepar'd
for, he is utterly unfit to appear before God, and he can expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to ſuffer God's vengeance for the ſins of an ill-spent life.
Now what is to be done in ſuch ſad circumſtances as theſe? It is
a caſe that may happen, and therefore to reſolve the doubt I ſhall
propound briefly theſe things to you, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In point of duty what this man is bound to doe. This is moſt
certain, that no ſin ought to be committed upon any conſideration
whatever. Their damnation is juſt, ſaith the Apoſtle, that doe
evil that good may come, <hi>Rom. 3. 8.</hi> It is in no caſe, either juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
or prudent, to ſave our lives by any ſin. It is every one's
duty, nay it is beſt even for the greateſt of ſinners, to looſe his
life a thouſand times rather than to deny God or his Truth. And
as for gaining time for repentance; it is to be conſidered that when we
are in ſuch a ſtrait, as that we cannot live any longer without
ſinning directly and grievouſly againſt our conſciences, it is God's
will that we ſhould then die, the time of our repentance is now over,
and God by this Providence doth call us out of the world. Now
when we will not ſubmit to this call, but will not ſtick to doe the
greateſt villany, how can we expect that God ſhould beſtow any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grace upon us, or that his Spirit after ſuch an Apoſtaſie ſhould
ſtrive any longer with us. Commonly the effect of ſuch things is
a judicial hardneſs, to be given up to a perverſe mind and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
<pb facs="tcp:101167:4"/>
ſtate. After any one hath in ſo groſs a manner violated
his Conſcience, there is very little hope that ever he ſhould be again
renewed in the ſpirit of his mind. For perſons to have obeyed the
truth, and yet in time of perſecution fall away, and for fear of
death renounce it, the ancient Church, that is to ſay, a great part
would never again receive them into their Communion till their death,
and a great diviſion there was among them concerning the reſtoring
thoſe that had once lapſed into Idolatry. What then ſhall we ſay
to thoſe, who after a wicked life, add to their other ſins that of
Hypocriſie? They may for a while lengthen out their wretched lives,
but it is to be fear'd that they have ſhut themſelves out from all
hopes of the means of Grace. It is a very improper and unlikely
way in order to attain the pardon of paſt ſins, to commit the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
we can be guilty of, to renounce our Saviour.</p>
            <p>2. In ſuch a caſe therefore the Sinner is bound to adore the juſtice
of God's Judgment, that by his own groſs neglect and careleſneſs he
is brought into ſuch miſery, for that he ought to have been always
prepared for ſuch a time. Yet however, though he hath highly
provoked God, and diſpleaſed him to the utmoſt, yet he will not
deny or blaſpheme his name, he will not renounce his Saviour, nor
diſown his profeſſion; he will leave himſelf to God's infinite mercy,
and will die rather than offend him: and ſuch a reſolute reſignation
of himſelf, ſuch a generous and noble profeſſion of his Faith, how
far it may be acceptable with God, and prevail with him is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.
In ſuch extraordinary inſtances, God may uſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means in reference to us, and may diſpence even with the
Rules he hath laid down in the Scripture. Indeed I cannot prove
or produce any promiſe for it, but the example of the Thief on the
Croſs, who for an extraordinary inſtance of Faith and Charity,
obtain'd more than common grace, I think, and favour. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the infinite goodneſs of God's nature, I ſhould have far more
hopes of ſuch a perſon, that after a wicked life ends his daies bravely and
couragiouſly rather than againſt his Judgement and Conſcience, than
of a profane, covetous, worldly, unclean Profeſſor, who bewails his
ſins on a ſick-bed while he is wreſtling with a waſting diſeaſe, and
hopes by his prayers and good wiſhes and pious reſolutions to obtain
his pardon. And this was the ſenſe of the Primitive Church, that
an Heathen being converted to Chriſtianity and ſuffering for it,
among other Chriſtians, before he could make a publick Profeſſion of
it, or be baptized into it, that he ſhould inherit the reward of
Chriſtians, this baptiſm in his own bloud ſupplying all other defects,
<pb facs="tcp:101167:5"/>
and expiating all former ſins. I ſay it was the common Opinion of
the ancient Fathers, they thought his death carried with it the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of all paſt ſins. I ſhall not take upon me to determine this,
but thus much I think may be ſaid in the caſe propoſed, that to die
for his Religion is the beſt means ſuch a perſon can uſe to obtain
his pardon, and does expreſs his repentance to be ſure far better
than adding the ſin of Apoſtaſie to all his others. But to make ſure,
the beſt way is to haſten our repentance, and to reform preſently,
before the floods come, and the winds blow, and the ſtorms riſe;
by a new life to arm our ſelves againſt all the powers and rage of
men, and then though we walk through the valley of the ſhadow of
death, yet we need fear no evil. This therefore is as I told you a
great reaſon to fear death.</p>
            <p>For death being in truth the greateſt of all natural evils that can
befall us, there is in all men a natural fear of it, which cannot be
wholly rooted out by Religion, nor is it neceſſary that it ſhould be.
If death had not been a natural evil, it had never been threatned
nor inflicted on mankind as a puniſhment for ſin. There is in all
men a natural dread of it, and we hardly count them worthy the
name of men, that are not affected with a due ſenſe of it. And
this fear is more or leſs according to mens tempers. Some are much
more timorous than others. To ſome the circumſtances that attend
death are much more terrible than death it ſelf. Some fear diſeaſes
and pain more than death. Some are loth to die for fear of their
Poſterity, Friends, Relations, to whom they are uſefull, and for
whom they are mightily concerned. Some are unwilling to go out
of the world becauſe they are in a capacity of doing more good
in it, which was the caſe of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> On the other hand ſome are
willing to die onely through wearineſs of life, out of peeviſhneſs,
diſcontent and impatience, becauſe they are diſſatisfied with their
preſent condition, or cannot bear thoſe afflictions which God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath exerciſed them withall; which cannot be reckoned any
vertue, unleſs in them who in their ſober minds and thoughts can
willingly ſubmit to death, whenever it pleaſes God to call them to
it. And yet ſuch upon a ſudden fright or ſurpriſe, when their lives
are unawares brought into danger, may not be able to conquer their
fear, but may ſhew a great diſquiet. They may earneſtly deſire to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
tarry a little longer, that they may be yet fitter for death, that
they may ſearch and try themſelves yet more exactly and curiouſly;
that they may be farther ſatisfied with the ſincerity and honeſty of
their hearts and intentions. Many more inſtances I might give.
<pb facs="tcp:101167:5"/>

               <pb facs="tcp:101167:6"/>
But now that which our Saviour frees us from is, a troubleſome,
tormenting fear of death, which thing alone diſturbs us, and fills
us with confuſion and perplexity of ſpirit, when ever we chance to
think of it. As when we are unreaſonably jealous and ſuſpicious of
what Trials God's ordinary Providence may put us upon; when we
are unmeaſurably ſolicitous about the preſerving our health, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
our ſelves from danger; when we are concern'd as if we had
no hope, and are as unwilling to ſubmit to the ſtroke of death as a
ſullen Malefactour is to go to execution. Now ſuch a fear of death
is worſe than death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to ſhew how Religion does free men from this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and anxious fear of death. And the,</p>
            <p>1. Means our Religion affords us to deliver us from this fear is,
the conſideration of God's wiſe and gratious Providence over us.
Not an hair of our heads ſhall fall to the ground without his leave.
Our lives are in his hands who hitherto hath taken care of us, and
whatever he calls us to is with the higheſt reaſon, and the moſt excellent
ends, and can we wiſh any thing better to our ſelves than this would
be, to be under the protection of the Almighty? Would we live
longer than infinite Wiſedom ſees fit for us? Can we doubt of his
care who is goodneſs it ſelf? Would we have the diſpoſal of our own
ſelves? Alas! how ſoon ſhould we repent us of our choice, and run
into all the ſeveral caſualties and diſmal dangers that can fall upon
us? If we had nothing to depend on, or truſt unto, but our own
counſels, prudence or carefulneſs, we might then have juſt reaſon to
diſtruſt every man, and to expect death in every place; we could
not be too ſcrupulous or ſolicitous. Could I in the leaſt doubt of God's
Providence over us, then indeed I ſhould neither eat nor ſleep ſafely,
nor live one day in quiet; I ſhould not be able to doe any thing
without anxiety and diſturbance, if I once could perſuade my ſelf
that all the effects that happen were wholly caſual, and not governed
by an infinite underſtanding, that ſuperintends all affairs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
of them as he ſees good. Nor is there any thing that can
well ſettle mens minds in the midſt of ſo many ſecret and open dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
as we are every minute liable unto, in any tolerable patience,
reſt, quiet and aſſurance, but this one conſideration, that nothing
can befall us without the leave and ordering of the beſt and wiſeſt
of Beings. Indeed the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> opinion of Fate, which hath ſtrangely
prevail'd among Chriſtians, ought in reaſon to ſatisfie them againſt
the greateſt dangers, that the number of the days of every man living
is ſo determin'd by an unalterable decree, that it is impoſſible he
<pb facs="tcp:101167:7"/>
ſhould die before, or out live the time appointed him by God before all
the world. This made the Followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who ſo ſtudiouſly
taught this Doctrine, to deſpiſe death and danger, not to fear it when
they were in the extremeſt hazard of it; freely to viſit their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
when ſick of the Plague, which we dare not do to one another in
any ordinary diſeaſe; or to run upon their Enemies ſwords or
Cannons. For what can be ſtrange with thoſe, that are neither
concern'd to prolong their lives, nor to avoid death? But this is no
part of the Chriſtian Faith. We are told indeed the days of our years
are Threeſcore years and Ten, and if by reaſon of ſtrength, they be
Fourſcore years, yet is their ſtrength labour and ſorrow: for it is ſoon
cut off, and we fly away. Behold, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Thou haſt made
my days as an hands breadth. And <hi>Job</hi> tells us, a man's days are
determined, the number of his months are with God, he hath appointed
his bounds that he cannot paſs, and in another place, that all men
have their appointed time. All which ſignifies no more than this, that
God in the general hath ſet bounds to a man's life beyond which he
will not ordinarily extend it; he hath ſet the term of our lives
beyond which we ſhall not ordinarily extend them, which is about
Threeſcore and Ten years, notwithſtanding which ſome die much ſooner,
and ſome few live longer. But the Scripture no where teacheth us, that
the length of a man's life is ſo fixed by God that he ſhall not die
before ſuch a time, nor live at all beyond it. Nay, the contrary is
plainly intimated to us.</p>
            <p>In all thoſe places of Scripture where long life is promiſed for the
reward of obedience in any particular duty, which muſt imply (if
it ſignifie any thing) that we ſhall live longer than otherwiſe we
ſhould have done. Thus, Honour thy Father and thy Mother: that
thy days may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God giveth
thee. Now this promiſe can never reaſonably oblige any man to the
performance of duty to his Parents, if it be abſolutely determined how
long he ſhall live. Thus in the 23. <hi>Exod.</hi> And ye ſhall ſerve the
Lord your God, and he ſhall bleſs thy bread and thy water, and take
away ſickneſs from thee; the number of thy days will he fulfill. Not
that he promiſeth that if they were obedient to his Laws, they ſhould
live out the full age of men, and that he would preſerve them from
ſickneſs and diſtempers. No, for this were to no purpoſe, and they
could expect no otherwiſe if they harkened not unto, or diſobeyed God's
words. So farther, in the 4. <hi>Deut.</hi> God promiſes not any ſhould live
out their days, but that they ſhould live longer than otherwiſe they
<pb facs="tcp:101167:7"/>
ſhould. Thou ſhalt keep therefore his Statutes and his Commandments,
which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and
with thy Children after thee, and that thou mayeſt prolong thy days
upon the earth which the Lord thy God giveth thee for ever.</p>
            <p>To wicked men God often threatens ſudden and untimely death,
that they ſhould die ſooner than otherwiſe they ſhould have done.
The fear of the Lord prolongeth (or, as we have it in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
addeth) days; but the years of the wicked ſhall be ſhortned.
That is they ſhall not live ſo long as otherwiſe they might have done.
Thus many men ſhall not live out half their days; not half the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
time of a man's life. Moſt obſervable is the inſtance of King
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in the 38. <hi>Iſa.</hi> to whom the Prophet poſitively declares;
Thus ſaith the Lord, ſet thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die and
not live: and yet upon his humble Prayer Fifteen years more were
added unto his days, which otherwiſe he ſhould not have had. From
which it plainly appears that by ſin and diſobedience men may ſhorten
their days and cut off from their lives, and by Piety and Vertue
men may procure to themſelves a longer life and encreaſe of days.
Now the length or ſhortneſs of our lives depends often upon our own
voluntary actions, upon our pleaſing or diſpleaſing God, which cannot
agree with that Doctrine of Fate I before mentioned. Nor do we
need any ſuch opinion againſt the fear of death, becauſe we allow that
our life depends upon God's good will and pleaſure; that no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of death, no ill practices, can prevail againſt us without his
appointment. And this is a ſufficient foundation of aſſurance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
notwithſtanding the frailty and uncertainty of our condition
here, that the Watchman of <hi>Iſrael</hi> neither ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth;
that his eye is always upon us for Good; that we ſhall live as long
and as well as is really beſt for us, and then who would not be willing
to die? But,</p>
            <p>Another means our Religion affords us to free us from the fear of
death is a deadneſs to this preſent world and all the trifling pleaſures
of it. For it is an over fond love and doating upon the things of
this world and ſenſual enjoyments that makes perſons ſo unwilling to
die. The more our appetites and deſires are mortified and ſubdued,
the readier we ſhall be to bid an eternal farewell to all theſe things
below. It is no wonder that thoſe who know no other happineſs but
what is to be found in theſe lower Regions, are loth to be torn from
their dear poſſeſſions, and to venture into a ſtrange Countrey which
they have ſo little knowledge of. But by this contempt of the world
<pb facs="tcp:101167:8"/>
which our Religion teaches us, we forſake it in the love of it, even
whilſt we are living, and ſo our buſineſs is better than half done
before hand, and we are freed from thoſe worldly cloggs and encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
that too often hang on our vertue and moſt raiſed affections.</p>
            <p>Farther, the Conſideration of Chriſt's conquering death for us gives
a mighty encouragement againſt the inordinate fear of death. For our
bleſſed Saviour hath taſted death for every man and hath taken away
its ſting, hath quell'd its force and overcome its power, inſomuch
that he is ſaid to have aboliſhed it. He hath made a way through
death and the grave to his Father's Glory, and ſhall we be afraid
like Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to profeſs and fellow him whereſoever he goes? Our
Prince and Redeemer hath voluntarily paſſed through it, and ſhall it
grieve us to follow his ſteps, and to come to him through that paſſage
by which he himſelf entred into his Kingdom?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The hope of ſalvation is another great means that our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
adminiſters to us againſt this baſe fear of dying. I have read
it is an ordinary ſaying among the <hi>Turks,</hi> that if Chriſtians had a right
opinion concerning Heaven, they could not be ſo afraid of death, which
is the onely way to life. And it was reaſonably asked by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
of him that promiſed that all that were of his Sect ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
happy as ſoon as they were dead, why then he did not preſently
die? Do we really believe a future Glory, and are we afraid to enter
into our Maſter's joy? What, are we Chriſtians, and yet would we live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
here? Have we already attain'd all the happineſs which we aſpire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
Can we be contented to know no more of God, to enjoy no more of his
Glory, and to love him no more, than we can doe in this imperfect State?
Are we unwilling to receive that reward which we daily pray for? Thou
knoweſt not what thou art capable of, what perfection, what happineſs thy
ſoul ſhall enjoy, freed from this troubleſome Tabernacle, this luggage
of fleſh, and art thou afraid of being tranſlated into the celeſtial Kingdom?
One glimpſe of that Glory which our Saviour hath promiſed to us, would
make as all long to be with Chriſt. No wonder Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo ready
to die, when he had before hand been rapt up into the third Heaven, and
had ſeen and heard things not utterable. Did we live in the hopes of
the future happineſs we ſhall enjoy, we ſhould not value any of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
here below, nor fear to undergo any thing that ſtood in his way
between us and thoſe bleſſed Manſions of happy Souls, where dwelleth
God, and perpetual peace and ſatisfaction, free from all care and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
from all fear and anxiety, from all pain and danger; where
onely is to be found perfect contentment, eternal joy and immortal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
<pb facs="tcp:101167:8"/>
If Chriſtians perfectly knew the felicity of the other life, they
would be impatient of the preſent; they would be hardly able to brook
or endure living, or any thing that detain'd them from ſuch unſpeakable
enjoyments. Wo unto us therefore, that yet dwell in <hi>Meſhech,</hi> and are
forced to abide in the Tents of <hi>Kedar.</hi> Bleſſed, yea, thrice bleſſed, are
are all thoſe that have paſſed this miſerable world, and are received into
the heavenly Manſions; for one day there is better than a thouſand
elſewhere. One thing have I deſired of the Lord, and that will I ſtill
ſeek after, that I may live for ever with him, and behold his Glory.
When ſhall we arrive at that eternal and celeſtial happineſs, where we
ſhall have no more of theſe ſtorms and dangers? When ſhall we paſs all
fears, and cares, and grief, and troubleſome paſſions? Even ſo ſaith the
Church, all true Chriſtians and ſincere Believers, come Lord Jeſus,
come quickly, and deliver us from theſe crazy bodies, and put on us that
houſe that is eternal and in the heavens. Is it ſo pleaſant to us to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to and fro in this wilderneſs, and be toſſed up and down upon theſe
troubleſome waves? And can it be grievous to us to think of arriving at
our journey's end? How ſoon would all the grief and pain and uneaſineſs
that accompanies ſickneſs, and the very pangs of death paſs away; when
once we have received our Crown? We ſhall be ſo taken up with thoſe
ſurpaſſing joys, that we ſhall have no leiſure to think of what we have
undergone; all the troubleſome paſſage will ſoon vaniſh. I confeſs that
for men who have no well grounded hopes of eternal life, it is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for them to fear death, as the day of their execution, when they
ſhall receive the juſt reward of their evil doings. But to you I now
ſpeak who profeſs to have an hope of this bleſſed immortality; for you it
is a ſhame to be afraid of death. It is for them onely to fear death,
as one of the Ancients ſaid, who would go to Chriſt. This is the onely
thing that makes men take death ſo heavily, they do not really believe
thoſe great things our Saviour hath promiſed; if they did they would look
upon death as the greateſt happineſs that can befall them. Why art
thou then thus caſt down, O my ſoul, Why art thou diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
within me? We contradict, at leaſt we diſparage our faith,
by our fear of death; ſince it is the Gate that leads into the heavenly City,
into the new Jeruſalem. We ought rather to entertain the thoughts of it
with a ſmile, and bid it heartily welcome, as the end of all my labour
and torment, all my ſorrows and cares: as that that would give me a
ſight of him that dyed for me, and convey me into his armes and embraces
who ſhed his bloud for my ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carry me into a Kingdom of peace and
Righteouſneſs and eternal joy, and would bring me into the company of all
<pb facs="tcp:101167:9"/>
the famous Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſours and all holy men
and women; which will again reſtore to me the Society of thoſe Friends,
Relations, dear Children and Parents, whoſe loſs I have ſo ſadly bemoan'd
and reſtore them again refined from all droſs, infinitely more lovely and
amiable than ever they were before. Oh! how ſhall we pleaſe our ſelves
when once our ſouls are diſentangled from this lower world? Thou art afraid
to go to a ſtrange place, where thou never wert before, and from whence no
Friend that is gone thither before hath ever returned to tell thee what it is;
but is it not ſufficient to know it is our Father's houſe, our Saviour's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
a place of uninterrupted joy and happineſs? All the afflictions of this
life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be reveal'd.
Let us fix in our ſelves theſe conſiderations, and we ſhall ſee nothing ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
in death, or think ſtrange of being born into the inviſible world; which
though it may be attended with ſome pain and hardſhip, yet the joy
that we are delivered from this miſerable life will ſoon make us infinite
amends. Nay indeed were there no other advantage, but onely the putting
an end to thoſe diſquieting fears of death, death it ſelf ſhould be leſs
dreadfull to us. In the other life there is no more fear of dying, no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
can overtake us, we ſhall be above all the ſolicitudes and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
concerns of nature. Inure therefore your minds to this, till it hath
reconciled to you the thoughts of death, this is the moſt happy and perfect
ſtate that we can arrive to here, to have as the uſual expreſſion is, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam
in patientia, mortem in deſiderio,</hi> to be content to live, and yet
deſirous to die, and to enter into the poſſeſſion of thoſe great things which
God hath laid up for thoſe that fear him. Such may find it as hard to be
willing to live, as to be deſirous of death. Perſons affected with a due
ſenſe of immortal happineſs, may doubt which is hardeſt, to bear life
or to ſuffer death. Thus hath our Saviour delivered us from this ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
fear of death, by bringing life and immortality to light through the
Goſpel. And it is all the peace and comfort of our lives to be raiſed above
the fear of death.</p>

He had a Son called <hi>John Claude,</hi> a famous Miniſter of the

I had for him, and the gratifying the deſire of ſuch as
onely knowing him by his Writings, will, as is very natural,
be curious to be informed of the principal Circumſtances of
the Life and Death of his great Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101167:10"/>
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was born at <hi>Salvetat,</hi> in the year 1618.
His Father, being a Lover of Polite Learning, took care
of his education during his youth, after which he went
to finiſh his Studies in the Academy of <hi>Montauban:</hi> There
did Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſtudy Philoſophy; his Wit beginning
then to find matter to exerciſe upon, made him quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd
from all the other Students in Philoſophy; and
though he was no harder Student than his Companions, yet
the flame of his imagination carried him ſo far that he made
greater progreſs in that Science in ſix months than his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Students in a year.</p>
               <p>After he had accompliſh'd his courſe in Philoſophy, he
began to ſtudy Divinity under <hi>Meſſieurs Garriſoles</hi> and
<hi>Charles,</hi> Profeſſours in that Academy: he more particularly
applied himſelf to Monſieur <hi>Charles,</hi> whoſe memory he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
all his life long. I know not whether the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of theſe two great <hi>Genius's</hi> might not from that time
contract this Union of Hearts; for as Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> had
an Admiration for his Maſter, we may alſo affirm, that
the Maſter reliſh'd the Character of his Diſciple; that he
lov'd him tenderly, and ſpake of him as of a young-man of
moſt hopefull expectation.</p>
               <p>His Father, being deſirous to ſee him in the Sanctuary,
did a little haſten the time of his reception into the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for he was not full twenty five years old when he was
admitted as Miniſter; he loſt thereby the opportunity of
travelling, of ſeeing other Univerſities, that of <hi>Saumur</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
where were Profeſſours of ſuch vaſt Learning, and
where was to be found that Politeneſs of Language and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
as very rarely paſſes beyond the <hi>Loire,</hi> and which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
was ſo much his Province.</p>
               <p>He was admitted Miniſter in the Synod of upper <hi>Guienne</hi>
and upper <hi>Languedoc,</hi> in the year 1645. he was aſſigned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
to the Church at <hi>La Treyne,</hi> his Father was nominated
by the Synod to ordain him, and he had this Comfort,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101167:10"/>
which is the greateſt a man of his Character can receive,
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſerved this Church but one year.</p>
               <p>The Synod of upper <hi>Languedoc</hi> benefic'd him with the
Church of Saint <hi>Afrique</hi> in <hi>Rovergue,</hi> and this to ſupply
the Place of Monſieur <hi>Martel;</hi> this Church was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
for a numerous Congregation, but had had the good
fortune of being ſerv'd by Miniſters of Extraordinary merit;
Monſieur <hi>Gaches,</hi> who died Paſtour at <hi>Paris,</hi> and Monſieur
<hi>Martel</hi> Profeſſour of Divinity had there exerciſed their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
and this little Flock, glorying in thoſe two great
Names, imagin'd that, for the keeping up its Fame, it could
not doe better than to pitch upon Monſieur <hi>Claude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Sciences, as in War, great Men are not accompliſh'd
in a day, herein Art as well as Nature requires Time and
Induſtry. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſtudies hard at Saint <hi>Afrique,</hi>
though his Sermons took him up leſs time than his other
Studies, he preaching with great facility; he had a Wit that
eaſily conceived things, a Judgment that did not fail of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
each Piece in its due place, an Expreſſion ſo fluent, ſo
eaſie, ſo juſt and ſo maſculine, that People had much adoe to
diſtinguiſh what he ſaid with meditation, from what he had
written. The Church of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> famous for the honour it
had of poſſeſſing in its boſome the Officers of the Chamber of
the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and a vaſt number of other perſons of
Quality and Learning, intreated Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> in his
paſſing that way, to give them a Sermon. He preach'd there
one Sunday, and fill'd his whole Auditory with Admiration,
ſo far as to give occaſion to a very ſingular Declamation which
a very able Man made in favour of him, and which the
publick will poſſibly be glad to be informed of ſince it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds
to his Honour: A numerous Company were diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s Sermon, Ladies there were that
ſpake their opinions, thoſe of the beſt ſenſe were extremely
well ſatisfied with it, others of the order of thoſe that a
little too much mind the Preacher's voice, face and actions,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101167:11"/>
durſt not ſo openly paſs their Verdicts, and ſtaid firſt to know
a worthy perſon's Judgment then preſent; I am perſuaded
they did not expect ſo ſmart an anſwer, when they heard him
ſay, that he could wiſh with all his heart he had but one
Eye, like that Miniſter, provided he was capable of preaching
as well as he. There needed no more to perſuade them that
he had preached very well, ſince this Gentleman, who was
a perſon extremely handſome, valued that Sermon at ſo high
a rate.</p>
               <p>This Sermon made a ſtrong impreſſion upon Peoples
minds, ſo far that the Officers of the Chamber of the Edict,
wanting a Miniſter, ſeveral of them caſt their Eyes upon
Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> but there were motives alſo, that brought
another into the election, the Lot was caſt upon theſe two
Paſtours; and Providence, that had deſtin'd Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>
for ſomething greater, depriv'd the Church of <hi>Caſtres</hi> of the
Comfort it would have received from his Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>But if the Church of <hi>Caſtres</hi> had not the honour of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> for its Miniſter, it had the pleaſure of
ſeeing that he came to chuſe a Wife in its boſom, and that it
thereby acquired a kind of right over this great man. He
there married Mademoiſelle <hi>Elizabeth de Malecare,</hi> on the
eighth of <hi>November 1648.</hi> the bare choice of a man of that
merit ſpeaks in favour of her that was to be his Wife, ſhe
came of a very good Family, her Father was Advocate in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
ſhe made good her Birth and the Declaration which
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> made in her behalf, which will be ſeen in
this Hiſtory, juſtifies the eſteem and affection he had for her
till death.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſerv'd the Church of Saint <hi>Afrique</hi> for the
ſpace of eight years, being belov'd by his Flock, known and
deſir'd by ſeveral Churches, eſteem'd and honour'd in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
of upper <hi>Languedoc;</hi> whereat he was annually preſent;
but amidſt all theſe Bleſſings he conſider'd, as the moſt preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the Birth of a Son which God gave him according to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101167:11"/>
his Heart, on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the fifth of <hi>March, 1653.</hi> and who
was nam'd <hi>Iſaac Claude,</hi> it ſo fell out at this time that the
Church of <hi>Niſmes</hi> which was one of the beſt Churches in
<hi>France,</hi> ſought within and without the Provinces for a man
that could bear the weight of that burthen; a Miniſter, in
ſhort, that was proper for Preaching, for Diſputation and
the Conduct of a great Flock. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s reputation
being ſpread far and near made them quickly determine upon
the choice they were to make; they ſent as Deputies to him
Gentlemen of the greateſt Eminence, that they might not
miſs their aim; theſe Gentlemen diſcourſt him, made him
moſt obliging Offers, and accompliſh'd their Deſign; for he
was appointed Miniſter for their Church by the Synod of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Languedoc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Service of this Church was very painfull, the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there every day, the Sick taking up a great deal of
the Miniſter's time; Eccleſiaſtical matters requiring no leſs
application, Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was not ſtartled at this new
task; he found time ſufficient to accompliſh all his duties,
the beauty of his <hi>Genius</hi> and his Induſtry provided for all the
occaſions of his Flock.</p>
               <p>How much ſoever buſied in the common Functions of his
Office, he found leiſure to begin a Work which he would
have finiſh'd, but for a Diſappointment that broke his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
He was refuting the method of Cardinal <hi>de Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elieu,</hi>
when he heard that the Synod of lower <hi>Guienne</hi> had
given that emploiment to Monſieur <hi>Martel,</hi> Profeſſour of
Divinity, he would not ſtand Candidate with his Brother in
the Goſpel, and the deference he had for the Company,
whence he held his Commiſſion, cauſed him to lay his Pen
aſide.</p>
               <p>As Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was born for a Chair of Divinity, and
that his Wit naturally turn'd that way, there was always in
<hi>Niſmes</hi> a conſiderable number of Students in Divinity ſo far
advanced as to be admitted to make Probationary Sermons, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101167:12"/>
whom he read Lectures of Divinity; his way of Teaching
was ſo neat, the matters he explain'd ſeem'd ſo well medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
and ſo happily fitted to the uſe of the Pulpit and to the
underſtanding of Holy Writ, inſomuch that he cauſed them
to make no leſs progreſs in the knowleged of Divinity, than
in the beſt Academies; hence came that great concourſe of
Divinity Students; nay, and there has been ſeen to come
from this kind of Private School Diſciples of merit, that
made good the Pains of the Maſter that inſtructed them.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s Miniſtery did too much fructifie in
<hi>Niſmes</hi> in the opinions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; the rumour
of his Reputation daily augmenting, was an importunate
ſound, that wounded their ears, a certain preſage that he
would not be long at quiet. And indeed he was ſnatch'd
from that Church by one of thoſe extraordinary ways
which People of his Character and ſingular worth do daily
experience; his knowledge, his ſteadineſs, his zeal, created
a jealouſie in a man whoſe ſentiments were not ſo upright as
his. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> knew that he eſpous'd the project of
our ruine, under the ſpecious veil of an accommodation of
Religion; he openly oppoſed this deſign; he was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratour
of a Synod of lower <hi>Languedoc;</hi> there did he break
his meaſures; and in that Province diſmounted the machine
of re-union, which the Court has abandon'd in theſe latter
days, as being of too ſlow a movement, and that it can more
eaſily effect thoſe ends by other means, there needed no
more to fetch Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> from <hi>Niſmes;</hi> a Decree of
Council was intimated to him, by which he was interdicted
the exerciſe of his Miniſtery throughout the whole extent
of the Province of <hi>Languedoc.</hi> He forbore Preaching, and
went to Court, being onely ſupported by his innocency, he
there proſecuted his concern for near ſix months, but all in
vain, for the Reſolution was already taken, not to revoke the
leaſt of any thing that had been done againſt us; and more
eſpecially to weary out the Miniſters who were not pleaſing
to the Governours of the Provinces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101167:12"/>
In this Journey did he compoſe that little Tract which
anſwers that of the perpetuity of the faith of the Catholick
Church touching the Euchariſt; this was his firſt Piece that
was made publick; this Tract of his made a noiſe in the
World; the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks were at a loſs to know the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour's
Name; the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> who felt the weight of the
blow, would needs know the hand from whence it departed;
but all the pains they took in order to this diſcovery were
for a long while all in vain, and we may ſay that as they
have laugh'd at the uneaſineſs the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had been under to
find out the Authour of the Provincial Letters, they in their
turns made this occaſion their diverſion, as did many other
People who were not ſorry to ſee an Authour ſtand forth, who
allarum'd that party by a Work of thirty Pages.</p>
               <p>This little Tract did Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſo much honour,
that it well deſerves we enlarge a little upon it, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Circumſtances that it affords, will reward the Reader
for the time he may beſtow upon what we are going to ſay
of it.</p>
               <p>The Tract of the Perpetuity of the Faith of the Catholick
Church touching the Euchariſt, compos'd by an able <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt</hi>
believed to be Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> had Monſieur <hi>de
Turenne</hi> in view, the Court had the ſame aim in perſuading
him to change his Religion, and the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> eſpouſing
this deſign hop'd to acquire honour by this Conqueſt; but
as he was a Prince, who without playing the Divine had a
right ſenſe to judge whether the Argument was good or bad,
it was neceſſary to chuſe a matter that was beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reach of his Lights in Religion, and to paſs his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
by drawing him into the vaſt fields of antiquity;
as being a region proper to impoſe upon Strangers and new
Commers, who do not well know the Map of that Countrey.
No fitter Subject for a trepan could have been choſen than
that pitcht upon by this Authour; he pretended to prove
that the Doctrine of the Real Preſence, had been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101167:13"/>
Faith of the Church, till the time of the Reformation,
(a great prepoſſeſſion in <hi>France,</hi> for a heart that wiſh'd for a
Religion that accommodated it ſelf with his fortune) the
turn which this Writer took was very ingenious; how ſaid
he a thouſand years of a peaceable poſſeſſion, and a profound
ſilence do they not ſufficiently juſtifie the Faith of the
Church upon this Article, it peaceably enjoy'd its right till
<hi>Beranger;</hi> and as ſoon as this man offer'd to open his mouth
to combat this truth, all roſe up againſt him, and he
was condemn'd by the firſt Council held at <hi>Rome</hi> by Pope
<hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth, in the year 1053. Before him none had
combated the Real Preſence, therefore it was the univerſal
Sentiment of the Church.</p>
               <p>This Authour does ſtill ſomething more, for to the proof
of the matter he adds that of right, that is to ſay, that he
means to prove, that if the Church had been of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
opinion it would have made ſo ſenſible an alteration
in Chriſtendom, when it chang'd its belief upon this Article,
and that it fell into the Faith of the Real Preſence, that there
is not an individual, but would have ſenſible of this Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſeeing the thing could not fail of being ſo of it ſelf;
Nevertheleſs he is perſuaded, that none ever complain'd of
upon this account; whence he infers that no change has been
made in the Doctrine; nay, and that this change is not
even poſſible after the manner we conceive it; this ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
method affected Monſieur <hi>de Turenne,</hi> he found in this
reaſoning an air of truth of too large extent for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
his doubts were known, and perſons of the firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and of an exemplary Piety endeavoured to diſperſe theſe
eluſions, they caſt their eyes upon Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> who was
then at <hi>Paris,</hi> he would not oppoſe what they deſir'd of him,
becauſe he found himſelf thereunto engag'd by the ſenſe of
his Conſcience, and by the reſpect he had for the perſons
who required his aſſiſtence, thus he writ, and this was the
true occaſion of that Diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101167:13"/>
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> underſtood very well that this was but an
ill way to make his Court for his reſtoration to the Church
of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> but he did not ſtand wavering, what courſe to
take, he ſaw that he was going to enter the liſts with a
Writer of mighty name, he hop'd that God wou'd give him
the grace to maintain his Cauſe. Meſſieurs <hi>Blondel</hi> and
<hi>Aubertine,</hi> whoſe Writings were to be defended, were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
conſummated in the ſtudy of the Fathers; they ſeem'd
to have exhauſted the matter which Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to treat of; if we find that he ſometimes walks in
their ſteps, we ſhall alſo ſee that he makes new diſcoveries,
and his manner of handling this ſubject is ſo fine, ſenſible and
ſtrong that we may affirm it to be a method wholly new,
whereof Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> is the firſt Authour: in ſhort, as he
had tryed the ſtrength of his <hi>Genius,</hi> he was ſenſible of an
air of confidence, which aroſe from the ſtrength of the
truth he was going to defend; this was his diſpoſition when
he began to write upon this matter. His Anſwer is ſhort,
but it is the fulleſt and cloſeſt Work that had till then been
ſeen upon this Subject; the Authour ſpeaks little, but ſays
a great deal in few words; and the Hypotheſes which he
ſtates are ſo well meditated, ſo juſt, back'd with ſuch good
reaſon, that there is no ſtaggering them, whatever onſet has
been made upon them; nay, and we ſhall find that all the
trains of this great Diſpute are ſo many lines that depart
from that center, and which after divers illuſtrations and
long evaſions return thither as to their true Principle.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> undertakes to prove in his Anſwer, that
this change termed a <hi>chimoera,</hi> and look'd on as a thing
impoſſible, did effectually happen; he ſhews the time, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and principal Authours that favour'd it; he makes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
how eaſie it is to alter a Point of Doctrine when thoſe
three things concur together, as has been ſeen in that of
the Euchariſt; firſt, when it is under-hand attacqu'd, and by
way of explication, ſtill retaining the ſame terms, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101167:14"/>
by a long uſe to that tenet; ſecondly, when this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
does not alter any thing in the worſhip; and
thirdly, when the errour finds a happy age wherein to
ſpread its darkneſs: He proves ſo well that theſe three
things have concurr'd in the change of belief, upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that all his reaſons are as ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,
againſt which there is no offering any thing,
that can weaken the proof of them.</p>
               <p>The Authour of the little Tract <hi>of the perpetuity of the Faith
of the Catholick Church, touching the Euchariſt,</hi> hath acted in
this Debate as ſhrewd men do, who have nice concerns to
defend in the Courts of Juſtice, for though you produce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them a vaſt number of Witneſſes, conſiderable both
for their Worth and their Dignity, they plainly perceive that
the onely way to Ward off the Blow that wou'd otherwiſe
deſtroy them, is to endeavour to invalidate the proof by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
good or bad, which robs theſe witneſſes of all Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
and thus you have a vaſt field open to contempt, to
foul language, and impoſture: Nay, and we have ſeen ſuch
as by a cunning ſlight ſuggeſted to them by their danger,
endeavour to derive advantage from the teſtimony that has
been urg'd againſt them, however oppoſite it may be to
their Juſtification, and this is much the Character of that
Authour. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> underſtood his deſign very well,
he trac'd him exactly through all his windings, and as it
highly behov'd him to maintain the Dignity, Integrity, and
Authority, of the teſtimonies which Meſſieurs <hi>Blondel</hi> and
<hi>Aubertine</hi> had produc'd, we may affirm, that he did it with
all the evidence, and all the ſtrength that can be deſir'd in a
diſputation of that nature, which turn'd much more upon
matters of fact, than upon queſtions of right.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> having not been able to get the Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
taken off that had been exhibited againſt his officiating
his Paſtourſhip in <hi>Niſmes,</hi> or in any other Town of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi>
departed from <hi>Paris</hi> after ſix months abode in that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101167:14"/>
Town, and repair'd to <hi>Montauban;</hi> certain it is that he had
not then any ſettlement in his mind, as ſeeing no appearance
for it, yet did he live much at his eaſe, though he was not
altogether unconcern'd at the Troubles he was made to ſuffer,
he overcame them by ſubmitting himſelf with an abſolute
reſignation to the Providence of God, and this courſe of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to the Decrees of Heaven, which is ever the beſt,
did not fail to proſper with him; he had not the trouble
of wiſhing or of being tyr'd with expectation of ſeeing his
deſires accompliſh'd, the Church of <hi>Montauban</hi> prevented
him, and gave him not leaſure to ſolace himſelf after the
hardſhip of a long Journey, he arrived there on the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
preach'd on the Sunday following, being Communion
day. The Church aſſembled for his Vocation, a Place was
offer'd him, he accepted it, and the Synod authoris'd the
choice of the Church. He had ſerv'd eight years the Church
of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> when he ſetled in that of <hi>Montauban,</hi> where he
ſtaid but four years, but with ſo much delight, that I have
heard him often ſay that that time compos'd the ſweeteſt
and happieſt period of his Life. He there liv'd in a perfect
Union with his Collegues, being cheriſht and eſteem'd by
his Church, and being charm'd with the Beauties of that
Climate, which he look't upon as his ſecond place of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
having there perform'd his Studies.</p>
               <p>There did he compoſe his anſwer to the <hi>ſecond Tract of the
perpetuity of the Faith of the Euchariſt,</hi> but did not imagine
that the Manuſcript he had left at <hi>Paris,</hi> wou'd one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a ſubject of Diſputation, becauſe it was onely made for
the inſtruction of Monſieur <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who declar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be ſatisfied with it; nevertheleſs this Work was three
years after taken to task, and the Authour <hi>of the perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Faith of the Catholick Church, touching the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi>
made an anſwer thereunto.</p>
               <p>For a long time not any Book about Religion had been
ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> that made ſo much noiſe as this, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101167:15"/>
not onely attackt the aſhes of a dead perſon that are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fear'd, as he had done in his former Tract, which ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ran over the Book of Monſieur <hi>Aubertine,</hi> he knew he
had to doe with another Authour, who was not to be ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which inſpir'd him with a deſign of writing after a
more ſinewey and more elaborate manner. Whether the
event prov'd anſwerable to his good intentions is a point
which I leave the Readers to judge of; it onely appears as
to me that Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was not of that opinion, and
that if he found more art in the ſecond Tract than in the
former, more wit and more care to conceal the weakneſs
of the matter, which the Authour therein defends, yet did
he not therein obſerve the more ſolidity. He ſaw in it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
leſs ſincerity, and eruptions of mind againſt perſons
of merit and probity, to whom the publick has not done
the ſame Juſtice as this Authour.</p>
               <p>To remain mute when the whole Kingdom ſpeaks, ſuch
ſilence ſeem'd affected to Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
ſaid openly, that this laſt Book made their cauſe
triumph, and that it would not be anſwer'd; the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
did not ſpeak with ſo much arrogance though they had
much greater confidence, being neceſſitated to curb their
ſentiments, when they were treated with ill Language; and
to make ſemblance of fearing Books, that did not perplex
them much at the bottom, and this piece was of that rank.
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ventur'd the repoſe of his Life by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
it, the event did but too well juſtifie him, he never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
determin'd to maintain his firſt Tract, by refuting
the Book which made ſo much noiſe at that time, and this
is the piece bearing the Title of, an anſwer to the ſecond
Tract <hi>of the perpetuity of the Faith of the Euchariſt,</hi> this
work is of a much larger bulk than the former, though it
turns much upon the ſame principles; it was neceſſary to
be more particular in Citations, in the choice of proofs, in
the order and light wherein they were to be ſet, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101167:15"/>
that are to be thence derived, and this courſe is
perhaps what is moſt difficult in a diſputation of the nature
of this under our conſideration. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> knew it
very well, and on that account, did he contrive a method
painfull for himſelf, but eaſie and uſefull for his Readers, he
onely took what was moſt eſſential in the paſſages of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and which was ſerviceable to his Subject; he ſays not
too much for fear of wearying out attention; he ſays ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to illuſtrate his matter; the Arguments he brings upon
theſe teſtimonies are ſhort, but perſuaſive, whether that he
backs his own cauſe, or attacks that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and becauſe it is a ſubject containing ungratefull matter by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the ſame expreſſions of the Ancients, which are often
reiterated in this kind of conflict. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> thought
fitting to enliven his matter with a gayety of diſcourſe, yet
without deviating from the Character of a wiſe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick
Writer.</p>
               <p>The Authour of the Treatiſe of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> made it
matter for his Diverſion, one while to inſult our cauſe
whoſe weakneſs he deplores, another while our Reformers
whom he ſpeaks of with extreme contempt, and ſometimes
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> himſelf, looking on his demonſtrations as
petty eluſions, which vaniſh at the approach of his lights:
I know not whether he imagin'd when he mediated his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
place of Metaphors, that Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> wou'd ſleep
upon that paſſage; he was certainly miſtaken if he had that
opinion: Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> found out the weakneſs of it,
makes merry with it in more than one place, as well as at
that method of the Authours, of putting proofs into ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
and objections into proofs. He commends his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
ſilence, which makes him paſs quick over the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Difficulties, and his Prudence that makes him dwell,
upon things that ſeem the moſt eaſie. This is what Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> calls in the conduct of the Authour, an affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſpeaking in a Slumber, ſo to lull us aſleep by his own
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101167:16"/>
Example. There are places indeed, where he does not ſeem
to be in his wonted good humour, and this is when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear what Writers of that Communion call <hi>Pious frauds</hi>
I mean the manifeſt alterations, which the Authour makes
of ſome paſſages, as to the ſenſe, the terms and expreſſions,
one is in the <hi>Homily</hi> of the <hi>Euchriſt</hi> for conſecration attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> though it be none of his, the other
is taken from <hi>Luke Anacorete.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fame, which delights in magnifying Objects, quickly
gave the alarm among the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> a ſecret rumour was
ſpread about <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that the unknown Authour, was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this ſecond Tract of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> The main body
detach't ſome of its Emiſſaries, to find out whence this
News came, and in what part of the Earth this hardy
Miniſter liv'd, who came to diſturb the Glory of ſuch as had
the Vogue of being the moſt Learned and moſt Polite Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>France;</hi> ſome of them brought back word, that the
Authour they were in queſt of was Monſieur <hi>Claude:</hi> This
was a ſufficient intimation to thoſe Gentlemen, for them to
take their meaſures; they wrote to the Biſhop of <hi>Montauban,</hi>
an Prelate eminent at that time for his Sermons, which the
Court had reliſh't, and for the engagements he had had with
the <hi>Janſeniſts;</hi> they entreated him to know whether Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> was writing, to ſee his Papers if poſſible, and to
acquaint them with the intent of them. This Prelate ſped
according to their deſires, Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to ſee him, he was known by him, if I dare ſay it,
eſteem'd, a thing rare in <hi>France,</hi> conſidering that immenſe
diſtance, which is preſum'd to be between the height of an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Croſier, and the bare crook of one of our Paſtours.
My Lord Biſhop entreated Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> to tell him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was true, that he was anſwering Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi>
for ſo was the ſtyle at that time, that he wou'd doe him a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſenſible kindneſs in letting him ſee his anſwer. Monſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> thinking it did not become him to deny a thing,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101167:16"/>
which he did not at firſt think to be of conſequence, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to let him ſee ſome of his Copy, and accrdingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
what he promis'd.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Montauban</hi> did not fail to inform his friends,
of what he had ſeen, and to let them know that this anſwer
was Printing at <hi>Paris,</hi> under the direction of a perſon of
Merit, who did that good Office to Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> his
particular Friend: I know not how far the reflexions of
that Prelate did proceed; in a ſhort time we ſaw orders come
from Court, that ſnatcht him away from the Church of
<hi>Montauban,</hi> his Friends did not doubt but that his merit had
made him incur this new Diſgrace; he obey'd theſe the King's
Orders, as he had obey'd thoſe that had taken him from
<hi>Niſmes,</hi> and not finding any ſafe Sanctuary in the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he reſolv'd to go lay open his conduct to the Eyes of
the Court, that judges much better by its own lights, than
when it was oblig'd through the great diſtance of places to
truſt to the lights of others.</p>
               <p>On the ſame day that he arriv'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> he had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction
to hear, that a ſtop was put to the impreſſion of
his Book; but though this trouble attended him to Bed, when
he wak't again, he was complemented with better tidings,
for the very next Morning after his arrival, he had notice
that the Prohibitions relating to his anſwer, had been read,
and that it was allow'd the liberty of the Preſs, that Spirit
of intrigue, that intrudes into all humane concerns, wou'd
needs force the experience of its good and ill humour upon
his Book. The <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> are ſaid to have endeavour'd to
have put a ſtop to its Sale by their Credit, which as then
was ſo conſiderable, but the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> through other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
very contrary to the former, did bring again the courſe
of this concern into its natural Chanel; a remarkable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the vanity of the thoughts of men, and of the depth
of the deſigns of the Providence of God, who knows how
to derive his Glory from the good and ill diſpoſitions of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101167:17"/>
their minds. This ſecond anſwer of Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s, had
all the ſucceſs he cou'd deſire; the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> made it the
Buckler of their Cauſe, the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks found it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dangerous, and if the <hi>Port Royal</hi> found therein matter of
Vexation, other people more complying than they, were
not much concerned at the conſequences. The progreſs of
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s ſentiments in this Book extended very
far, he render'd the change of belief as to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> too
ſenſible, every Individual that reads his reaſons, had a ſenſe
of this alteration, and to ſtop the courſe of it, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
themſelves of giving out that the citations of the
paſſages of the Fathers were not faithfull; and as theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
among their people are in poſſeſſion of being believ'd
upon their bare word, it was abſolutely neceſſary, for the
diſperſing this falſe accuſation, that Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſhould
Print, all at length, the paſſages he had cited, and this is
what will be ſound in the ſeventh Edition, that was made
of that anſwer in the year 1668. The work was large, but
the Volume might ſtill have been enlarg'd, by a conſiderable
number of other paſſages, which I have ſeen Written by the
late Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s own hand, which is in the Margent
of that ſecond anſwer which is in his Cloſet.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſtaid near Nine Months in <hi>Paris,</hi> being
uncertain of his Fate, without being able to break through
the barrieres, that hinder'd his return to <hi>Montauban.</hi> This
was an Epiſcopal caſe, and theſe cauſes were ſo priviledg'd,
that a Body was ever ſure of looſing the proceſs that one
had with thoſe Perſonages; Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> underſtood it
ſo too, and with ſubmiſſion and patience arm'd himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all theſe hardſhips.</p>
               <p>During this interval, he was courted by the Church of
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> but <hi>Charenton</hi> had people of too much ſenſe, to
ſuffer their being rob'd of a man of ſuch great merit, who
was already among them, they let him have ſome intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the deſign which that Church entertain'd. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101167:17"/>
was to be had to the inclinations of the Court, the
matter was inſenſibly prepar'd, and as ſoon as they ſaw a
propitious moment, for Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s calling into the
Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> they took him, and he was effectually
call'd to ſerve that Flock in the year 1666.</p>

               <p>IF Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s Books made ſo much Noiſe in <hi>Paris,</hi>
when he was an hundred Leagues diſtant, 'tis eaſie to judge

               <p>A diſcourſe there was of an anſwer, of the Authour of
<hi>the perpetuity of the Faith,</hi> to Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s ſecond
Book, he very quietly expected its coming out; however it
did not appear for ſome time, which is a myſtery I have no
deſign to ſhrift into, it no ways availing my Subject, and
'tis ſufficient, that I ſay how that another Writer ſtood
forth to ſupply Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s Adverſaries room, but I
am as yet a Stranger, whether 'twas out of kindneſs to
Monſieur <hi>Arnaud;</hi> great men are not over fond of ſuch kind
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101167:18"/>
of Aſſiſtance, as being willing to diſtance from them all
that can inculcate the leaſt ſuſpicion of humane weakneſs.
But to what purpoſe all this, when people have diligent
Friends, they prevent us whether we will or no, and it is a
kind of Civility, which we ſhould not dare to complain of.
This Diſpute made too much Noiſe, to leave a Society at
reſt, that preſumes it has a right to decide upon all matters,
its Emulation was rous'd, and for fear any other ſhou'd gain
the Victory, it immediately caus'd one of its Champions to
enter the Liſts, to rob Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> of the Crown he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
laid hold of, and which he is ſaid onely to have loſt, by
being too much a <hi>Formaliſt.</hi> Father <hi>Noüet</hi> a Jeſuite wrote
againſt Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> and they did not ſtay for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being at work upon the firſt Leaf, for the giving it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;
all concur'd towards the ſpeedy ſtopping the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes
this ſecond anſwer made, and Father <hi>Noüet</hi>'s Book
was put forth with all expedition as a happy dike in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this torrent.</p>
               <p>This Father <hi>Noüet</hi>'s work has its Beauties and its goodneſs,
like thoſe actions of great conſequence, which at the Bar
defend an ill cauſe with a great deal of art; a vaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Antiquity, though little back't by truth, a deſign
of writing Gentleman like, but moſt commonly unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
us'd, being ſometimes travers'd by the bare heat of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and for the ſake of the cauſe he defended.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> might handſomely have forborn anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſeem'd to require time for writing, that he might collect all
his Forces, and overwhelm him with his laſt ſtroke; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
he paſt over theſe difficulties, and making it a point
of Honour ſtill to maintain this Diſpute, againſt an able
Doctour choſen by the moſt Learned Society of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> he anſwer'd Father <hi>Noüet</hi>'s Book, and this is the

                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101167:18"/>
This anſwer was Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s favourite Book, he ſpoke
of it modeſtly in the main, which indeed was his Character,
but there was nevertheleſs to be obſerved in his Diſcourſes,
a fondneſs for this compoſure, and I have known deſerving
perſons, that were of the ſame opinion with him upon this
point. The Preface to this Book is admirable, and affords
a moſt noble Idea of the Authour's deſign.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> had occaſion in this Diſpute to follow a
Tract, which Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> had diverted him from.
Father <hi>Noüet</hi> thought fitting to upbraid him in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
for having abandon'd the holy Writ in this controverſie,
this Accuſation is curious falling from a <hi>Jeſuit</hi>'s Pen. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> did not fail to turn it to his advantage, it gave
him occaſion to explain to us, the ſixth Chapter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
according to St. <hi>John;</hi> it was requiſite, that ſatisfaction
ſhou'd be given to a perſon that complain'd of a Miniſters
neglecting the word of God; the Tract of the uſe of the
ſenſes is an accompliſh'd piece, nothing has been ſeen ſo
well meditated upon that matter, as what he ſays of it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo pat or ſo happy as the application he makes of it.
As for the paſſages of the Fathers, which this Authour
produces againſt them, he rids himſelf of them like an able
and gallant man; for when Father <hi>Noüet</hi> produces very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
againſt him, Authours poſterior of <hi>Paſcatius,</hi> he
chuſes them out in the Centuries 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> does not fail to tell him, that theſe are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
pieces, and witneſſes that bear their recuſation in
their Forehead; but he does nevertheleſs often examine his
paſſages, wherein he finds a ſenſe quite oppoſite to Father
<hi>Noüet</hi>'s deſign. The opinions of the <hi>Greeks</hi> touching the
<hi>Euchariſt</hi> is likewiſe brought in play. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
it, and upon that point, acquaints him with more
than one Hiſtory which he knew not, or which he was min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to diſſemble, becauſe it did not favour his cauſe. This
Authour is not ever happy in his citations, as not being
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101167:19"/>
willing to take the pains of going to the Fountain head;
ours complains of his neglects; Father <hi>Noüet</hi> is hardy, and
makes no ſcruple of often altering paſſages. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>
has much adoe to be moderate upon this point; he exclaims
ſufficiently, ſo as that the Reader may be advertis'd of the
Snare that is laid for him. Never did Authour know how
to avail himſelf better of the advantages that are offer'd him,
if Father <hi>Noüet</hi> ſpeaks of reading of the Fathers, as of a vaſt
Foreſt, our Authour draws thence an argument, that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
Faith is leſs involv'd in holy Writ, than in Tradition,
which is a Woody Countrey by a Jeſuits own confeſſion;
when this Writer is angry at the Primitive Ages of the
Church, to which Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> wou'd bring him back,
that he ſays they have given us more Martyrs<note n="*" place="margin">p. 432.</note> than Writers and Doctours; our Authour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
an advantage from his ill humour, and ſhews
the reaſon why the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> refuſes this Teſtimony,
if Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſets Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> againſt Father
<hi>Noüet,</hi> it is without any deſign of ſetting them at odds, 'tis
through the ſilence of the <hi>Pagans</hi> in reſpect of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
and the adoration of the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> Monſieur
<hi>Arnaud</hi> denies that any proof can be drawn from their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and adds, that they have perhaps written Books up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Subject, that have not been tranſmitted to us. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Noüet</hi> on the contrary maintains, that Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s
conſequence wou'd be juſt, if the <hi>Pagans</hi> had not upbraided
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with the difficulties of that myſtery, but he
fancies that he proves it clearer than the day, and this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
point which our Authour does not agree with him
in, refuting very plainly the paſſages urg'd by Father <hi>Noüet,</hi>
and maintaining his firſt Theſis; in ſhort, though Father
<hi>Noüet</hi> had not perhaps a ſet deſign, here to combat Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Claude</hi>'s opinion as to the time of the change, that was
made in point of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> he cou'd not with honour
forbear ſaying ſomething of it towards the end of his Book.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101167:19"/>
Forc'd he was to bear this little torture, in favour of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouteſt
Zealots of his Communion, who wou'd have thought
all had been loſt if he had fail'd of maintaining a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which ſo far influences the goodneſs of that cauſe; but
as he gives this matter onely a tranſitory touch, Monſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> does not enlarge upon this Subject, but nevertheleſs
ſays ſufficient to refute Father <hi>Noüet</hi>'s illuſions, and to back
the good reaſons he alledg'd in the two former Writings.</p>
               <p>This Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s anſwer<note n="*" place="margin">p. 1668.</note> was kindly
receiv'd; the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> found therein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of their Faith, the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> were not
ſorry, that Father <hi>Noüet</hi> had made this diverſion in favour
of them, being ſo much time gain'd to take breath, and the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> on whom all people had their eyes fixt, came off
ſparkiſhly from this affair; they talkt of Father <hi>Noüet</hi> as of
one of their adventures, that had puſht hard at his
Enemy, and came off from the conflict honour'd with
ſome wounds. This diſputation had no ill conſequence, I
mean that the Advocate of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> party was ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and treated more handſomely by the Society of the
<hi>Jeſuits,</hi> which commonly are not of a humour to ſuffer
much, than he had been by the caball of <hi>Port Royal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this attaque a kind of ſuſpenſion of Arms laſted for
ſome time; Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> wanted not Employment, the
bare buſineſs of his Pulpit at <hi>Charenton,</hi> requir'd the whole
application of an ordinary Miniſter. This Church was ſo
celebrated of it ſelf, and honour'd with the preſence of ſo
many Foreigners, that it had been imprudence in a Miniſter,
to have Preach'd unprepared. Thus the bare Office of
Preaching was a Province of Pains ſufficient for Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
who was deſirous to edifie his Flock, anſwer the hopes that
people did conceive of him, and follow the ſteps of his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Collegues. He Printed but few Sermons, as being
more taken up with other matters, which more concern'd
the publick. We may nevertheleſs judge by thoſe he has
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101167:20"/>
Publiſht, that his Talent lay no leſs for Preaching than for
the Cloſet, and I hope his Son will Print a ſmall Tract,
which his Father did compoſe of the manner of explaining
the holy Writ in the Pulpit, ſo juſt and ſo fine, that upon
reading it, people will be throughly perſuaded, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> was a great Maſter in that matter.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> did not onely ſignalize himſelf by his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he was in a Station, that had great influences, to ſhed
over the other reform'd Churches of <hi>France. Paris</hi> was the
Fountain whence proceeded all the miſchiefs, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the Provinces, and <hi>Charenton</hi>
the place whither they repair'd for Council, an excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
in it ſelf, ſo ſharp, violent and obſtinate were the ill
humours. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> conſider'd of this, he acted, he
rouz'd up others by his own example, though he cou'd not
wholly remedy the miſchiefs of ſo many that were afflicted,
and who from far and near required his aſſiſtance, we may
ſay that he mitigated their trouble, by partaking therein
himſelf and by his conſolations. Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Book
came out at length, being entitled <hi>the perpetuity of the Faith
of the Catholick Church, touching the Euchariſt, defended.</hi>
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> thought himſelf bound to anſwer it; this
work of Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s made a noiſe in the World, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
certain Characters fit to excite the admiration of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who onely floridly touch upon matters, to acquire
quickly, and eaſily the quality of Learned. Monſieur <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>
handles a Subject that might paſs in ſome manner for
new at <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe no <hi>French</hi> Writer had yet been ſeen,
that had collected ſo many teſtimonies, and that like him
had ſo profoundly argued about the Religion of the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
this air of Novelty did much ſet off his Book; he cited
paſſages which ſeem'd to bear all the marks of the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Mode. A prodigious reading
was obſerved in his anſwer. This great work, inſpir'd hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
prepoſſeſſions in favour of the Authour; In ſhort, though
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101167:20"/>
Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> had in his other works ſpoke with a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtical
tone, yet he now raiſed his Voice much higher, he
lookt ſo big when he ſpoke of Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> and handles
his Books with ſo much arrogance, that it was a kind of
torrent, which without examination hurried away the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
of thoſe eaſie Judges, that are determined by the bare
accent of the Voice.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> had not the ſame aſſiſtance as Monſieur
<hi>Arnaud,</hi> the latter being ſaid to have had Friends, and ſuch
as furniſht him with proofs. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> cou'd have
wiſht, that the ſame thing had been done for him, but that
this requir'd a happy leaſure, a privilege out of date at
<hi>Charenton,</hi> and granted onely to the Eccleſiaſticks of <hi>France.</hi>
In default of his Friends, he was forc'd to make it out in his
own perſon. I ſhou'd not dare to inſert the number of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
he read, what is ſeen of them in his anſwer, is but the
leaſt part of them. People often read ſeveral Books in hopes
of finding ſomething, that may be ſerviceable to the Subject
we have in our mind, and we find nothing leſs than what
we are in queſt of. Thoſe kind of relations being very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to this imperfection; nevertheleſs a Writer cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
himſelf from this fruitleſs labour, when he is engag'd
in a diſputation of the nature of this, which turns upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that are to be defended or oppoſed.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſtates principles that are a mighty help to
diſperſe all the eluſions of Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> he ſhews that
the buſineſs in this diſpute, is not to know exactly, what
the <hi>Greeks</hi> believ'd in the matter of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but what
they do not believe; and 'tis in this rank that he places the
Tranſubſtantiation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
adoration which the <hi>Latines</hi> pay the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> He draws
up a platform of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which is as it were the
key of that matter, for he ſhews that there are ſeveral <hi>Greek</hi>
Churches, that entertain Communion with the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that it is not among them, that we are to go ſeek
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101167:21"/>
for truths; he alſo juſtifies, that there a great number of
Seminaries in <hi>Greece</hi> and in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> where Youth is brought
up in the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that thence are
taken Prieſts, Biſhops, and ſometimes Patriarchs who are
<hi>Latines</hi> in Faith, and <hi>Greeks</hi> onely in Ceremonies; Money,
fear and other motives do often bring thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors,
dreſt up after the <hi>Greek</hi> Mode, to the Principal Pulpits of
thoſe wretched Provinces, where heavy ignorance does ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
after which it is no difficult matter to derive ſuch
teſtimonies as one pleaſes from thoſe miſſionaries who owe
the Pope all they have, and who require nothing more for
acknowledgment of his favours, than Paper and ink. Theſe are
the points which Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> does make moſt evidently
plain, from the teſtimony of ſeveral Writers moſt worthy of
credit. In ſhort, Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> makes out the opinion
of the true <hi>Greek</hi> Church, that is engag'd neither by love
nor fear with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that then it ſpeaks clearly
of the Faith concerning the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> wherein you neither find
the <hi>Roman</hi> Tranſubſtantiation or adoration; with theſe max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> refutes all Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s arguments,
he unravels the intrigue of the teſtimonies he produces, he
puts his Readers in a way of doing the like with himſelf,
and there is no uſing any evaſion but what this excellent
matter provides againſt. For it ſerves to anſwer all that
Monſieur. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſaid upon this Subject, and ſhews you
what courſe to take for the illuſtrating all the objections that
might be made hence forward upon this matter. This was
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s fourth anſwer,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 1671.</note> upon this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
the publick did him Juſtice in this, as it had
done him in the other, it viſibly appear'd that his
Adverſary granted him the principal queſtion, which was
the belief of the <hi>Latine</hi> Church, in the matter of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi>
till the time of <hi>Paſcatius;</hi> Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> had ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prov'd, that till then the real preſence, Tranſubſtantiation,
and the adoration of the Hoſt were unknown Doctrines to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101167:21"/>
the <hi>Latine</hi> Church; Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> thought fitting to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
no longer upon this point, and to give the change, he
contriv'd to lead Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> and the Reader into the
<hi>Eaſt.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> could willingly have been without
this walk, but having undertaken to cure a perſon of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
he was to be follow'd every where, that ſo he might
diſſipate his illuſions; after which Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> having
all to no purpoſe exhauſted all the ſecrets of his art, thought
it became him to abandon this cure, and to leave it wholly
to the ſole immediate grace of God, who cures when he
pleaſes, the moſt inveterate ills, and that ſeem the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>
               <p>I have been longer than I thought upon this diſpute of
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s and Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s, but as it is what
made moſt noiſe, I thought it requiſite to give a pretty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Idea of it, that it might make an impreſſion upon the
Readers mind. I ſhall be ſhorter in his other works, and
ſhall thereby endeavour a little to recreate ſuch peoples
minds, as were tir'd out by the uniformity of this matter,
and who love novelty and concluſion.</p>
               <p>The deſire of being an Authour, is an uneaſie paſſion,
ſince Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> did not come again into play, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Writer did not tarry long, before he ſuppli'd his room;
he wrote againſt our Reformation in a very bitter ſtyle, he
attackt Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> he pointed him out by his name,
this Book is intitled <hi>Legitimate prepoſſeſſions againſt the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts;</hi>
'tis no longer a matter of Doctrine that is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to be handled, the ſucceſs of the diſpute of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi>
had not been happy for the <hi>Port Royal,</hi> another
courſe was to be taken, and we to be attackt in a place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for declamations, for calumny and the contempt of our
Religion. The Authour of theſe prepoſſeſſions could not
have choſen better, he there found wherewithall to ſatisfie
his ſpleen againſt our Reformers, whom he loads with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious
Language. This was a large Field for to excite the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101167:22"/>
peoples hatted againſt us, by renewing without any neceſſity,
thoſe ſad Ideas of our ancient quarrels, which charity
ought to have buried in an eternal forgetfulneſs. This fine
and crafty policy, which thoſe Gentlemen make profeſſion
of uniting with morals plain and free from all worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
found here a fair occaſion of diſplaying their max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
at Court, where people were not over well ſatisfied
with ſome of their works; the point of favour was to be
weather'd again, by ſpeaking of us and our Religion, after
ſo odious a manner, as that it might make impreſſion upon
the moſt moderate minds, and through this proſpect did
Monſieur <hi>Nicole</hi> write that work, and that's its true
Character.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> anſwer'd it, but he was far from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Authour's violent method, he found it ſo contrary
to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, contented himſelf with ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its poiſonous paſſages, but he does not make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
upon his adverſaries head, thinking it ſufficient that
he renders them of no uſe, and deſtroys them before his
eyes, and for ought I know, this is a greater mortification
for that Authour, than if he had engag'd him after a leſs
civil manner.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> gives us the Portrait of the <hi>Latine</hi>
Church before the Reformation, there is not one ſole ſtroke
in it of his own hand, for he makes onely uſe of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Authours. This caution was
neceſſary on the account of the niceneſs of the piece, and
to avoid the ſuſpicion of falſehood. The idea he gives us
of the Church at that time is ſo ſad, that there is no need
of opening ones eyes, to judge that it wanted reformation.
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> proves that it was deſir'd, that it was
eagerly demanded before our Reformers ſet about it, but
he likewiſe ſhews the evaſions which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> uſed
to elude this propoſition, and the little likelyhood there
was of the Clergy's entring upon ſo holy a project. After
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101167:22"/>
having ſhew'd the neceſſity of the Reformation, Monſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> proves that our Reformers, might goe to work upon
weeding the Field of the Lord, and that they were forc'd
thereunto by their own intereſt, and by the engagement
they were under, of furthering the Salvation of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
He anſwers thoſe petty objections of the miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which the Authour of the prepoſſeſſions does pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſly
diſplay, he ſhews that there is no arguing directly
againſt a doctrine, or in its behalf, by the bare examination
of the lives of thoſe who teach it, that the conſequence is
much more natural, and more ſure to pronounce for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a Religion; after having examin'd its belief, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
ſome of <hi>Luther</hi>'s expreſſions that ſeem too rude, he
ſpeaks of that Authour as a Hero, becauſe he really exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Heroick conſtancy, but he will not warrant all his
frailties; he is ſatisfi'd with ſhewing that the greateſt men
are ſubject unto failings, and by this means does he ſhelter
ſome of our Reformers, over whoſe lives the Authour of the
Prepoſſeſſions was minded to vent his ſpleen. The diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Authour is curious, he ſays that there may be in
the Church a negative ſeparation, that onely conſiſts in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining
from the practice of Doctrines that we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
he is of a pretty temporizing humour, by inſinuating
that it would not have been ill contriv'd in our Fathers, had
they onely proceeded ſo far, but he cannot pardon them the
poſitive ſeparation, which is properly what is called ſet
apart; it appears plainly that this Authour's maxims do
not paſs for Standard truth at this day, when there wou'd
be ſo fair an occaſion to put them in practice. Many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
perſons are there, who wou'd thank this Authour if
he cou'd procure them the enjoyment of that negative ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
whereof he ſpeaks, till ſuch time as we find the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
which nature, reaſon and faith do preſuppoſe. But
perhaps the things wou'd go too far, if ſo great a complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
was had for this negative, for there is found much
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101167:23"/>
leſs danger in ſeeing the myſteries profan'd, than in giving
the leaſt ſuſpicion, that the number of the true Converts
was not very great. This Authour makes a mock of us
with his diſtinction, for beſides that, a good Conſcience
with this worldly management in matter of Religion, the
little ſupport there is at this day from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
for thoſe that do not reliſh its tenets, and the racks which
on this account it puts on their minds and their hearts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us to believe, that the ſame maxims wou'd have been
practis'd upon our Fathers at the time of the Reformation,
and that they would not have ſpar'd the negative ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Our Authours would have written upon this matter, for
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has never ceaſt exclaiming, that the
calling of our Paſtours was not Legitimate, and all that has
followed that ill principle, could not have any character of
Juſtice and goodneſs. The Libraries are full of Books,
that have been written by Doctours of both Parties, but
this Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s work is the beſt that has been ſeen
upon this Subject. Poſſibly time having given occaſion to
new objections, has likewiſe furniſht Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> with
the occaſion of making new diſcoveries in this matter, but
what is particular, and which is a reſult of the beauty of
his Genius, is that he writes with ſo much clearneſs, ſtates
his principles ſo well, and with ſo much exactneſs makes
the application of them to the Miniſtry of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
that we are immediately ſenſible of the neceſſity of their
conſequences. Thus for example, when they debate with
him the calling of the firſt Reformers; he contents himſelf
with proving, that Miniſtry is to the Church even in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the Paſtours, that it is a right that cannot be alienat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either by the conſent of the parties, or by the ſtrongeſt
Law, that is to ſay, by Uſurpation; he adds, that three
wills muſt concur to the forming of a lawfull calling, that
of God, that of the Church, and the conſent of him to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101167:23"/>
whom the Miniſtry is directed; he declares that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
that is exerciſed among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> is not an upſtart
Miniſtry, becauſe it does not Preach up a new Goſpel, but
the ſame which the Apoſtles ſettled in the Church, but
purg'd from the Errours which ignorance had ſhed therein.
With theſe maxims does Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> aſſert our calling,
againſt all the unjuſt reproaches of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
he clearly ſhews its Juſtice and neceſſity. This Book having
theſe great Characters, it is no wonder, that the publick
did with joy receive it, and that it did ſo much honour to
its Authour.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> did in 1676, cauſe five Sermons to be
Printed, which he had Preach'd at <hi>Charenton</hi> the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
upon the 22th. Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe
1, 2,</hi> and 3. and the title of theſe Sermons is the <hi>parable
of the Wedding Feaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould be affraid of doing him an injury, if I enter'd
upon the particulars of theſe Sermons, they are too fine
and too ſhort for an extract of them to be given in this place,
as containing the matter of a vaſt Volume, and if well
ſcann'd, will afford the profit of a bulky piece, which few
Readers run over otherwiſe than in haſte; whereas theſe
Sermons do entertain people of ſound Judgment, a mighty
ſtock of Divinity, morals worthy of the Subject he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
a neatneſs of expreſſion, ſo juſt a way of arguing,
with that heat and vivacity, that they muſt own the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
no leſs fit for the Pulpit than the Study.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> had but one Son, whom he tenderly
lov'd, he was very glad to ſee that his inclinations led him
towards the Miniſtry, and that this choice he made, and
which ought to be ſo free, had anſwer'd the inclinations of
his heart. He had this ſatisfaction to find in him, a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
proper to avail himſelf of his parts and example. He
ſtudied in the Academies of <hi>France,</hi> under the beſt Maſters,
who took great care of him; he returned to his Father,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101167:24"/>
who accompliſh'd him in all things, that might make him a
perfect Preacher. After which he was examin'd at <hi>Sedan,</hi>
in the month of <hi>September 1678,</hi> and judg'd very worthy
of being receiv'd into the office of the holy Miniſtry; he
was demanded by the Church of <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>Beauvoiſis,</hi>
fourteen Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> in a Synod of the Iſle of
<hi>France,</hi> and his Father had the comfort of Ordaining of him,
on the 9th. of <hi>October 1678.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> did more eſpecially excell at the head of
a Company; ſuch did he appear for ſeveral years together,
in the conſiſtory of <hi>Charenton,</hi> ſuch has he been ſeen in
more than one Synod, of the Iſle of <hi>France,</hi> wherein he
was Moderator; one more eſpecially there was, wherein he
gave an inſtance of the ſtrength of his Genius, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
the whole Aſſembly. For after that eight propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
had explain'd the Text he had given them; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being taken up with more important concerns, refer'd
the examination of thoſe propoſitions till the next day.
This was a troubleſome diſappointment to the Moderator,
who was to make report of thoſe actions to the Synod, but
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was not perplext at this accident; the day
following he call'd to mind all his Ideas, put each in its
due place, forgot not ſo much as one ſingle circumſtance,
and after he had perform'd the function of a Reporter, he
perform'd that of a Judge; he examin'd thoſe eight propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
and ſpoke his opinion of them like a Maſter,
though the aſſembly knew his ſeveral Provinces, yet was
it charm'd with his memory, knowledge and Judgment.
In caſe, in the Synod, any matters were propoſed that
were intricate of themſelves, and ſtill more perplexing
through the cloud which the ignorance, or deviſes of the
party did occaſion; Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s wit had ſuch an
excellency, that in a moment it made way through all
this Chaos, form'd a propoſition clear and preciſe, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his ſpeaking his opinion pat, as if opinions were to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101167:24"/>
turn upon a yea or a no, a Character that is never
miſtaken, in the judging of a man that preſides in a
Company, ſince the choice of matters and the making
them plain, is a certain ſign of the preſence, neatneſs,
and ſtrength of a great Genius. But as Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>
was exact in retaining the purity of the Faith, in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
of the reformed Religion, which he has ſo well defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
we may likewiſe ſay, that he acted like a wiſe, and
charitable man in regard of the various ſentiments which
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> entertain upon the Subject of Eccleſiaſtical
Government and Diſcipline, and upon the uſe of ſome
Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>His conduct more eſpecially appear'd, in an anſwer he
made to a Letter of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s; this Prelate
illuſtrious by his Birth, and who with ſo much honour main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the dignity of that great Office, labour'd under ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
for the diviſions with which the Church of
<hi>England</hi> was threatned, upon occaſion of the Epiſcopal
Government. For the preventing of this miſchief, he wrote
to ſome of the moſt eminent <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, that he
might have their advice. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> made too
much noiſe in <hi>France,</hi> not to be conſulted in an affair of
this moment; he received a Letter from that Prelate, this
was a ſlippery ſtep, he had the eyes of all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
upon him, to ſee how he wou'd behave himſelf in ſo nice
a concern; he came off from it with honour, he uſed a
temperament, that was approv'd of by all rational perſons,
he own'd what is good in the Epiſcopacy, but he does not
diſſemble the feebleneſs of ſome Prelates, who ſeem to him
too rigid over our calling; we do not ſee in his Letter,
that ſo deciſive majeſterial air, which other Writers take
upon them, 'tis full of that humble ſpirit of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
which onely breaths Charity and Peace. This Character
pleaſed the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who honour'd him with his
eſteem. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> in return was full of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101167:25"/>
ſpeaking of that famous Prelate, as of one of the
greateſt ornaments of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and pointing
him out under the name of the charitable Father, of all
thoſe unhappy perſons that have taken refuge, who are all
comforted in that they can pour forth their ſighs, into a
boſom, ever open to the complaints and neceſſities of the
miſerable; this Letter was written in the year 1680.</p>
               <p>In 1683, came forth Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s anſwer to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Book, entitled <hi>A Conference with</hi> Monſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Charenton,</hi> and the occaſion which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
him to put it forth was as followeth. Monſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> had a Conference with the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras,</hi> at the Counteſs
<hi>de Roye</hi>'s Houſe, on the firſt of <hi>March 1678.</hi> Some ſmall
time after, that Prelate ſuffer'd a relation of their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to go abroad from out his Cabinet, with a diſcourſe
he had made for <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> upon the matter of
the Church; Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> in his turn, gave one of his
Friends another relation of that Conference, with animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
upon Monſieur <hi>de Condom</hi>'s diſcourſe; his Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
fell into that Prelate's hands, who entreated a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
perſon to know of Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> whether he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
of that Writing which went abroad under his name.
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> peruſed it, to ſee whether it was conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Original, and having found it exact, he wrote
at the bottom that he own'd it for his. This Declaration
was given to Monſieur <hi>de Condom,</hi> who made reflexions
upon Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s animadverſions, for the maintaining
his diſcourſe of the Church; he likewiſe made ſome upon
their Conference, and this was the Subject of the Book he
cauſed to be Printed, having for its Title, <hi>A Conference with</hi>
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Charenton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> fanſied he might in this occaſion, follow
that Prelate's example, wherefore he cauſed his Book to be
Printed, wherein he ſhews three things, he gives us his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101167:25"/>
to Monſieur <hi>de Condom</hi>'s diſcourſe, and therein does
he handle the queſtion of the Church; he anſwers the
reflexions that Prelate had made upon his Tract; he
gives therein a relation of what paſſed in that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and examines the reflexions of that Prelate, and
owns that he gave his cauſe all the livelieſt colours,
which the moſt able Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
uſe, when they wou'd cover an errour with the luſtre of
truth. They parted with marks of a mutual eſteem, and
with a deſign not to publiſh their Converſation, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſiderations prevail'd over Monſieur <hi>de Condom</hi>'s
mind, and we are oblig'd to him for having firſt lept the
bounds they had preſcrib'd to themſelves. For it gave
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> occaſion to handle the matter of the
Church, and to give us a moſt clear and exact Idea of it.
This compoſure was his Darling, and I may affirm, that
he was as much ſatisfied with it, as with any of thoſe
that were the offspring of his Pen; he ſpoke of it to us,
juſt before his laſt ſickneſs, he told us he had meditated
this queſtion of the Church, with all the application he
was capable of, for the giving of it a good light; he
found few Authours that had applied themſelves as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them in illuſtrating that matter; he added, that
Meſſieurs <hi>Cameron</hi> and <hi>Meſtrezat</hi> were thoſe that had beſt
explain'd it, and that by keeping to the maxims he had
ſtated, one might eaſily anſwer all the objections of the
Doctours of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without fearing they
ſhou'd ſtagger his hypotheſes.</p>
               <p>At firſt this Conference onely turn'd upon points of
Diſcipline, and upon ſome ſmall difficulties, touching the
ſubmiſſion which individuals ought to have, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of Eccleſiaſtical Companies. If this diſcourſe had
not been the reſult of a common Converſation, wherein
chance has a greater part than the choice of matters, in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101167:26"/>
all likelyhood a body might have ſaid, theſe queſtions
were not worthy of taking up thoſe two great Genius's;
but the conſequences have ſo exalted this Subject, that
it is the ſame thing with this diſpute, trivial in its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as it is with thoſe ſmall ſprings, which make no
noiſe at their iſſuing out of the Earth, and which are to
be paſt dry footed, but which encreaſe extremely in a
long courſe, often divide the place they water, redound
to the utility of commerce, and thereby occaſion puzling
work to the Learned, who eagerly diſpute about the
ſundry names that have been given to theſe Waters, of
their inviſibility, when the Rivers they form hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Earth, of their privileges and of the rights
the people have thereto.</p>
               <p>The condition of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> was ſuch, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of their Lives might with impunity have been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the peeviſhneſs of a bare Vicar, as ſoon as he
might have entertain'd the deſire of wearying out a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of our Religion; but it was more eſpecially a Capital
Crime in a Miniſter, to attaque the ſentiments of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> had more than once experienc'd even
in better times, how far the power of theſe Gentlemen
extended in this caſe, yet did he not fail, as much as in
him lay, of croſſing the deſign of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi>
in writing againſt the Circular Letters that came from that
Aſſembly, which were ſpread abroad under the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of its name. He imagin'd that he ow'd the Sacrifice
he made them of his reſt to his own Conſcience, and to
the Salvation of his Brethren; for things were then in
ſuch a poſture, that the bare thought of maintaining
our cauſe, was in the opinion of thoſe Gentlemen,
deem'd a kind of Felony as Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> has
publickly ſhewn, when he explains the reſult of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101167:26"/>
that expreſſion, <hi>whatever you may ſay or write 'tis
all in vain,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">p. 109.</note> theſe are the terms of their
Letter.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> does not put his Name
to that little Book intitled, <hi>Conſiderations upon the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Letters of the Aſſembly of the Clergy of</hi> France, <hi>of
the year 1682,</hi> becauſe this piece had other Characters
enough of its Authour, and that <hi>Chriſtian</hi> prudence does
not oblige us to expoſe our ſelves, when there is no
motive of Conſcience that calls us thereunto. The peruſal
of thoſe reflexions is not long, and to it muſt I refer the
Curious. Poſſibly Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> never compoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
work that has done him more honour than this, as
ſmall as it is; he does not deviate from the terms of a
profound reſpect, when he reflects upon the temporal
grandeur of thoſe he ſpeaks of, and to whom he thinks
this ſubmiſſion owing. But after this, he takes upon
him a true air of greatneſs, proceeding from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of the matter he handles; inſomuch, that we ſee
him march as an equal with thoſe againſt whom he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
upbraiding them with their affected mildneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
the Foundations of an abſolute Authority,
which they exerciſe over Souls, and declaring to them
roundly, that he onely took Pen in hand to give a reaſon
of his Faith, not that he does herein own them for his
Maſters, but to render the ſentiments of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
publick; and the reaſon he alledges for it is, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Conſcience onely depend immediately
on God.<note n="*" place="margin">p. 163.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Some time after theſe circular Letters of the
Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> were notified after ſomewhat an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
manner, through all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches
in the Kingdom. The Intendents of the Provinces had
order to convene the Conſiſtories for the reading of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101167:27"/>
them; they had commonly among others, the Prelates
great Vicar, in whoſe Dioceſe the Commiſſion was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.
As this was a caſe wholly new, and whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
created apprehenſions, our Churches waited to
ſee what the conduct of <hi>Charenton</hi> wou'd be in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that ſo they might direct their own courſe, by its
Compaſs; this courſe ſped according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
thoſe of the Conſiſtory of <hi>Charenton</hi> were the firſt
that were ſpoke to; Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was choſen to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
he did it with great Prudence and ſteadineſs, and
his anſwer ſerv'd for a model to moſt of the other
Churches, who were very glad to walk in the ſteps of
ſo able a guide. This anſwer was Printed; 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in few words, but full of ſenſe; Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>
owns the auguſt Character, with which Monſieur the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent</hi>
was inveſted, and for which he declares, that he
and his Church have a profound reſpect; he therein
proteſts that it was from this onely Fountain of ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that proceeded the application they had uſed, in
the reading of a piece, that had otherwiſe nothing but what
was afflicting for our Churches; he farther owns,
the mighty Station which my Lords the Prelates ſtand
poſſeſt of in the Kingdom, by the dignity of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and that they thereby challenge our reſpects, but
that if they pretended to ſpeak to us in thoſe Letters,
as from off an Eccleſiaſtical tribunal, he was bound in
Conſcience to declare to them, that on that ſide we do
not at all acknowledge their Authority.</p>
               <p>Matters in Religion had their mode in <hi>France</hi> like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things; that of Grace had for a long while poſſeſt
peoples minds; Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s diſpute againſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Arnaud,</hi> occaſion'd the ſentiments of grace to be
little talk't of. The two parties wrote as if they had
onely differ'd upon the ſingle article of the real preſence
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101167:27"/>
of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament of the Lord's
ſupper. This battery had no ſooner ceaſed, but that
they erected that of the Authority of the Church, and
this ſeems to be what made the moſt noiſe, and on
which they moſt inſiſted, as ſeeming to thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
of a more efficacious uſe for converſion, than all
the reſt together. During theſe mighty Diſputes,
there was another kind of calmer Writers, who made
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> morals their buſineſs, and who ever and anon
gave the publick little pieces which it greedily receiv'd,
as finding therein wherewithall to recreate it ſelf, from
that great application which was neceſſary to be had for
other, the more lofty queſtions of Divinity.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> knowing that a man of his profeſſion
ought to doe all things for all, in order to the Salvation
of Souls, took the reſolution of writing upon a Subject
of Morality, and compoſed a little Book, whoſe Title
is the examination of ones ſelf, for the being duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for the Communion, the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
Chapter the 11th. Verſe 28. This is a Tract, wherein
man ſees himſelf ſuch as he is, in a faithfull mirrour.
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> does herein make appear, that he
throughly knew the heart of man, no feeble is there
but he has penetrated; he follows him in all the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
he uſes, to conceal himſelf from God, the World
and himſelf; he takes off that Mask, ſhews his Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
his Miſery, conducts him to our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
as to his ſovereign good. In the Goſpel does he take the
Leſſons which ought to ſerve to illuſtrate and inflame
him; he turns all theſe inſtructions to the uſe of the holy
Supper. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> does farther ſhew, that he
perfectly knew the World, as an able Phyſician knows
Poiſons, that is to ſay, with no other deſign but to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
their qualities. Theſe are no outragious Morals,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101167:28"/>
like many others; they are Juſt, yet have their ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but withall, they are ever conformable to the ſtate
of man upon Earth, and to his Duty; and this is what
renders them ſenſible to all the World: Whereas there
are thoſe, that often vend us precepts of morality, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
our reach, that they make no impreſſions upon our
hearts, becauſe our hearts do not find in thoſe pourtraits,
one ſingle Character that ſuits with them. This little
Book met with a very gratious reception from all ſorts
of perſons, and indeed, it muſt needs have a moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
privilege of goodneſs, ſince it carries in its
front a licence of a famous Magiſtrate of <hi>Paris,</hi> of the
7th. of <hi>November 1681.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s Writings made ſo much noiſe in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries, and eſpecially amongſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that
<hi>Groninguen</hi> cauſed a Profeſſours place in Divinity to be
offer'd him in its illuſtrious Univerſity; and this Town
which had ſo highly ſignaliz'd it ſelf in thoſe late Wars
being ſtill cover'd, if I might dare to ſay it, with the
ſweat and bloud of its Enemies, imagin'd that for the
fulneſs of its glory, it ought to get this Buckler of the
Reformation into its boſom, there to cauſe Sciences and
Religion to flouriſh. This calling was directed to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> in all the forms, and with all the inducements
he could deſire, but it was a difficult matter in this caſe,
to ſurpriſe the vigilance and affection of his Church,
which too well knew the need it had of its Paſtor. It
earneſtly intreated him not to abandon it, at a time eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,
when his preſence was ſo neceſſary to all the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Kingdom; he was willing to make
it the Sacrifice of his temporal intereſt and repoſe,
after which he moſt humbly thank't the Magiſtrates
of <hi>Groninguen</hi> for the honour they had done him, and
prepared himſelf to undergo the utmoſt fury of that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101167:28"/>
Tempeſt, which had ſo long been lowring over our
heads.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the Calamities of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did
daily haſten on apace, the Church that met at <hi>Charen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
ſaw the Storm coming, and the privilege of being
enlightned by the eyes of the Court, which it had
made its ſupport for above an age, was no longer a
means to juſtifie its Conduct; it was wholly taken up
in warding off the blows made at it by its Enemies, it
was watchfull for the other Flocks, and the greateſt
weight of this heavy burthen lay upon Monſieur
<hi>Claude</hi>'s head. He ſhewed himſelf indefatigable, he
anſwered the Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, who
ever ſeem to ſingle out him in their works; he preach't
as often as any one of his Collegues, was watchfull
for the inward ſafety, ſo to diſappoint it, rooted it
out of others, and was carefull of the preſent,
nay, and out of a providential Spirit, extended his
thoughts and cares over the ſadeſt futurity.</p>
               <p>This is the true ſcite of Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s heart and
mind, till that fatal day, when he perceiv'd that all
the ſolicitudes of humane prudence were abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>available,
and that he muſt of neceſſity ſee the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion
of all the reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> by the
bare revocation of the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> under whoſe
Faith we and our Fathers had liv'd.</p>
               <p>This Edict was publiſhed under the Seal, on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the 18th. of <hi>December 1685;</hi> the Gentlemen of the
Conſiſtory had notice of it, they thereby apprehended,
that they had no longer the liberty of Preaching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Exerciſe at <hi>Charenton</hi> was no longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
but by virtue of a decree of the Council,
which was revokt by the bare publication that had
been newly made; nevertheleſs it was not perceiv'd, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101167:29"/>
the Eccleſiaſticks made any ſtep to rob them of that ſmall
conſolation, which they ſeem'd to have left of having
the liberty of meeting once again in their Temple.
This favour which would not have been conſiderable in
the bottom, ſeem'd too great to the Miniſters, and to
ſome of the Ancients, that they open'd their Eyes to
know the motives of it, and after a prety exact appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
they perceiv'd it to be one of thoſe preſents,
which were to be diſtruſted, as coming from a ſuſpected
hand; they nevertheleſs liv'd in a kind of uncertainty,
till <hi>Saturday</hi> at ten a Clock in the Morning; the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
appointed to Preach were ready, when that
they were fully inform'd of the deſign that was laid,
of coming into the aſſembly to ſpeak to the people, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
or after the action. The moſt prudent underſtood
the conſequences of that day; Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowing by long experience, how far the zeal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
does hurry thoſe, that are ſtrongly poſſeſs'd with
it, was the firſt that deem'd it fitting not to Preach.
He backt his opinion with ſeveral reaſons, which brought
the reſt to be of his mind. It was expedient to hinder
the people from repairing to <hi>Charenton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the next day
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> took care of this important matter, he
ſaw plainer than the reſt the peril he expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to; but he imagin'd that he was likewiſe thereunto
called by the duty of his Office. That a good Soul
ought not to be much concern'd, for the dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of a good Counſell. He gave all the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
orders, the thing ſucceeded according to his project,
there was no Preaching at <hi>Charenton,</hi> and the event juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that his foreſight was well grounded, that his fears
were Juſt, and that this turn he gave to the Rudder of
a great Ship, that was going to be wrack't, departed from
the head of a moſt able Pilot, who contriv'd to ſave
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101167:29"/>
the people whom God had committed to his charge,
when he cou'd no longer hinder the wreck of his
Veſſel.</p>
               <p>This Ceſſation of exerciſe, which had ſeem'd too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
to ſome, paſt for a Maſterly ſtroke in the opinion
of others. The <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> knew it immediately, to
be Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> that had broke their meaſures, and
to prevent the over officious cares he might have rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to his diſperſed Flock, they wou'd, ſaid they, ſpare
him the pains of that ſad ſpectacle. He had fifteen days
time given him, as well as the other Miniſters to depart
the Kingdom, they found means to abridge that time;
for on <hi>Monday</hi> the 22 of <hi>December 1685,</hi> which was
the day on which the revocative Edict of that of <hi>Nants,</hi>
was Regiſtred in the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> Monſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> received order at ten a Clock in the Morning,
to be gone within four and twenty hours. He obey'd
with a profound reſpect, and went away attended by one
of the King's-Footmen, who was to conduct him to the
Fronteers of <hi>France,</hi> and who faithfully perform'd his
Commiſſion, and yet did nevertheleſs carry himſelf very
handſomly towards Monſieur <hi>Claude;</hi> ſo true it is, that
great merit has an aſcendant over thoſe very hearts, that
do not love our Religion.</p>

               <p>MOnſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was not at a loſs, what foreign
Countrey to chuſe for his retreat, his Son being
Miniſter of the <hi>Walloon</hi> Church at the <hi>Hague,</hi> byaſt him
above all other proſpects that offer'd themſelves to his
mind. At <hi>Paris</hi> he took Coach for <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> his fame
leading the way, occaſion'd ſeveral perſons to viſit him
in his Journey; he paſt through <hi>Cambray</hi> where he lay,
was there preſented with what was in ſeaſon by the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits;</hi>
the Father Rector did him the honour to come
and ſee him, he made due returns to his Civility, and
the diverſity of Religion did not interrupt that commerce
of Compliments, and inſtances of a mutual eſteem. At
laſt he arriv'd at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and the ſatisfaction he had
to be in the boſom of his Family, whom the affairs of
the time had ſeparated, made him for ſome moments,
forget the peril he had been in, and the remains of a
great fit of ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>In a few days after, he had the honour to pay his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
to his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> he found
that his merit had ſpoken in his behalf, he met with a
gracious reception, and however great the Idea was,
which Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> had conceiv'd of his Highneſs,
he own'd that fame, which commonly encreaſes objects,
and which had ſpoken with ſo much luſter of his Life,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101167:30"/>
had not as yet, had Voice ſufficient to Trumpet all the
Heroick Vertues of that Auguſt Prince.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> knew her Royal Highneſs the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of <hi>Orange,</hi> to be a great and illuſtrious ſupport of
Religion, that ſhe underſtands it in its ſource, and that
a lively impreſſion is ſeen of it in her actions. He was
deſirous likewiſe to kiſs her hand, he had that honour,
and confeſt that he had never ſeen ſo enlightned an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
with ſo much Piety and Majeſty united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> did likewiſe pay his reſpects to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of a very conſiderable figure in that State, and he
could not ſufficiently admire the ſweetneſs and goodneſs
of thoſe illuſtrious heads, who at the coming out of their
aſſemblies, where they have appear'd inveſted with the
Majeſty of a Soveraign State, ſpeak and act a moment
after with other men like private perſons, and as if they
were their fellow Citizens.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was no ſooner arriv'd at the <hi>Hague,</hi>
but that the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> did him the honour
to think of him, in order to get him into his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
This great Prince, whoſe bare name will be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Encomium</hi> throughout all ages, cauſed an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and uſefull employment in his profeſſion to be
offered him; but particular reaſons hindred him from
complying, ſo as he could have wiſh't, to this calling.
The reſt of his days were deſtin'd by the Providence of
God, to theſe happy Provinces, and this potent State was
willing he ſhould ſhare in that rich effuſion of its Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which began to pour upon the Miniſters that had
here taken refuge, nay, he was diſtinguiſh't from all the
reſt by a moſt advantagious portion, and all concur'd to
doe him good. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> took delight in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101167:31"/>
his generous liberality towards him by a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Penſion.</p>
               <p>After ſo many troubles, the time now ſeem'd to be
come, for Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> to enjoy all imaginable quiet
at the <hi>Hague.</hi> Nevertheleſs it is certain, that he was
never leſs to himſelf, than when one would have thought
he was the Maſter of his repoſe. His Houſe was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
of all the Unfortunate, oblig'd he was to hear their
Lamentations, and eaſe their grief as much as in him
lay. His diſperſed Flock daily preſented freſh objects to
his eyes, but ſad; and like ſo many Planks that had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capt
Shipwrack. He received thoſe that were expoſed to
temptation, was oblig'd to anſwer them, was inform'd
that others were fall'n under it, and this was for him a
matter of affliction and labour, to raiſe up theſe infirm
perſons again from their fall.</p>
               <p>The laſt work of Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> is of a different
Character from the reſt, his little Book is ſo known by
its ſelf and its adventures, that I ſhould be affraid of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
the Readers leaſure, if I went about to inſert the
particulars in this place.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> being at <hi>Cleve,</hi> Monſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> had the honour to pay him his reſpects, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectoral
Highneſs expreſt to him the particular eſteem
he had for his merit, he was deſirous to hear him Preach,
and accordingly he Preacht in his Palace, at two a Clock
in the afternoon, upon theſe words, the 2 to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
Chap. 5. ver. 17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Chriſt,
he is a new Creature: old things are paſt away, behold all
things are become new.</hi> His Electoral Highneſs ſeem'd
extreamly well ſatisfied with his Sermon, and utter'd his
mind accordingly in terms moſt obliging to its Authour.
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> return'd to the <hi>Hague,</hi> poſſeſſed with
the glory of that great Prince, who may ſerve for a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101167:31"/>
Model to the moſt perfect Heroe's, if it be poſſible that
there is any one that imitates him, in the exerciſe of that
immenſe Charity, which he at this day beſtows upon ſo
many unhappy perſons, and which bears all the marks
of the holy fervency of the Primitive and happy days of
<hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was return'd, we wou'd needs
know of him the means that were to be uſed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting
the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> call'd of the Confeſſion of <hi>Augſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
with thoſe of our Communion. He ſaid that in
all probability this reunion wou'd not be a work of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
which commonly onely ſerves to exaſperate
peoples minds, that we had reaſon to praiſe God, that
there were no tenets eſſential to Salvation, that divided
this holy houſe of the Lord, and that the ſhorteſt and
ſafeſt way muſt be a wiſe temperament, which it wou'd
be eaſie to find out if all parties wou'd concur to this
good work, and lay in a ſtock of reciprocal Charity, as
might reconcile peoples minds, and unite their hearts in
order to the framing one and the ſame Communion,
without declaiming againſt each other. He was more
eſpecially of opinion, that the piety of Sovereign Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
ought to be excited in this occaſion, and that their
zeal for this peace, wou'd be a mighty help for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of this important deſign. This overture,
which we made to Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was again a new
Subject of admiration for him, in expreſſing to us the
ſentiments of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> upon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for he told us that this great Prince had diſcourſed
him about this reunion with ſo much zeal, that he was
perſuaded, that if this piece was to be a preſent from
Heaven in our days, Divine Providence would principally
make uſe of his Electoral Highneſs, to whom this glory
ſeem'd to be reſerv'd as to the Prince, who can beſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101167:32"/>
this project with his own enlightned underſtanding,
and with his ſincere and ardent piety, known and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
by both parties.</p>
               <p>Now for ſome time, Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> had not enjoyed
a perfect health, he was fixt to ſtudy ſo as he would have
wiſht, but his body could not therein follow the motions
of his heart, yet did he not love to have his Study inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in the Morning; he beſtowed the reſt of the day
upon all thoſe that were minded to ſee him. The time
after Supper was reſerv'd for his particular Friends, who
took a moſt profitable delight in ſeeing and hearing him
at thoſe hours of freedom, and in thoſe eaſie converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we ſaw perfect Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> diſcourſing with
great openneſs of heart upon all matters, and eſpecially
of that great revolution which is ſeen at this day in our
concerns. His Character upon this Subject was humble
and ſubmiſſive to the Providence of God, he ador'd its
ſteps, but alſo ſaid that they were abyſſes, which were not
to be too much ſounded; that the ſafeſt courſe was to
avail our ſelves of this Judgment of God, and in ſilence
to expect the aſſiſtance of his grace, theſe converſations
ever ended, with the uſual exerciſes of piety in his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>After this manner did Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſee the days
of his ſad exile run out till his laſt ſickneſs, whoſe dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
remembrance we muſt renew in this place. There
was no regular exerciſe for preaching in the <hi>Walloon</hi>
Church at the <hi>Hague,</hi> he nevertheleſs Preach't there now
and then with ſo much edification, that in ending his
Sermon, he excited in the minds of his Auditours a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
longing to hear him again, and it was to gratifie
that deſire, that he reſolv'd to Preach on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day
the 25th. of <hi>December 1686.</hi> His Son was gone abroad
that day, he ſupplied his place, the circumſtance of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101167:32"/>
ſeaſon determin'd him upon the choice of the matter,
'twas requiſite to ſpeak of the Saviour of the Worlds
Nativity; for that purpoſe did he chuſe theſe words of
the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Chapter the 1. verſe the
30, 31, <hi>&amp;c. And the Angel ſaid unto her fear not</hi> Mary,
<hi>for thou haſt found favour with God, and behold thou ſhalt
conceive in thy Womb, and bring forth a Son and ſhalt call
his name</hi> Jeſus, <hi>he ſhall be great, he ſhall be call'd the Son
of the Higheſt, and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the
throne of his Father</hi> David, <hi>and he ſhall reign over the
Houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>for ever, and of his Kingdom there ſhall
be no end.</hi> This Sermon was very Learned, paſſages it
had of extraordinary perfection, his fancy ever fruitfull
and happy, appear'd as much in this occaſion, as in any
other of his Life. It afforded that turn ſo fine and ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
which he knew how to give to the matters he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
flaſhes there were, that did in no wiſe betray the
drineſs and heavineſs of old Age, and we may ſay in
ſhort, that there was throughout obſerv'd that grandeur
of Spirit which influences all his works, that ſo lively
penetration, that ſo wiſe, ſo judicious a choice, which
made the ruling Character of that incomparable Genius.
He utter'd this Sermon with great eagerneſs, was heated
and inflamed, and in all probability, this was the firſt
point of that fatal ſickneſs which bereft the World of
him. His whole Auditory was charm'd with his action,
Her Royal Highneſs the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> who is no
leſs Illuſtrious, for the vaſt extent of her underſtanding,
and a ſolid piety and without pomp, than through the
bloud of ſo many Kings, whence ſhe derives her extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
liſſen'd to this Preacher, with a moſt ſteady applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mind, and was extreamly well ſatisfied with this
his performance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:101167:33"/>
It were to be wiſht that this Sermon was Publiſh'd;
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> told us, he had writ the greateſt part of
it; I am perſuaded his Son wou'd oblige many people, if
he cauſed it to be Printed as it is, being a fragment that
wou'd doe much honour to his Father's memory.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> was no ſooner at home, but that he
found himſelf extraordinary weary; he was ſeiz'd that
Evening with a moſt violent Rhume, ſpent the Night
with ſome uneaſineſs, and on the Morrow would have
gone and heard the Sermon, whatever endeavours were
uſed by his Family, to hinder him from ſtirring abroad in
that condition. That Night he had a Fever with pains
throughout his whole Body, his Diſtemper was thought
to be a Rhumatiſm, upon this principle did they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
for his Recovery, but the humours were in ſo very
great a ferment, that there was no moderating the courſe
of them by any Remedy. On the 6th. of <hi>January,</hi> he
was preſt by moſt ſenſible pains, he was ſenſible of the
decay of his Senſes, and as if he had had a full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that he ſhou'd not ever have the liberty of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his thoughts; he told his Son that he deſir'd to
ſpeak with me, I repair'd immediately to his Houſe, and
in the preſence of his Family, he told me his mind in
theſe terms.</p>
               <p>I was deſirous ſaid he to me, to ſee you, and make my
Declaration before you; I am, added he, a miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
before God; I moſt heartily beſeech him to ſhew me
mercy, for the ſake of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and I hope
he will hear my Prayer, being the promiſe he made to
repenting Sinners. I have reaſon to praiſe him for the
bleſſing he has laid upon my Miniſtry, which has not
been fruitleſs in his Church, which is an effect of his grace,
for which I adore his Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:101167:33"/>
He took a little breath, and it was to tell us, that he
had with great application examin'd all Religions, but had
found none worthy of the Wiſedom of God, and capable
to lead a man to true happineſs, ſave the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
He then added, that among the divers ſentiments,
which divide <hi>Chriſtians</hi> upon the Subject of Religion,
which he had carefully Studied, he had found that the
Reformed Religion was the onely good Religion which
was to be followed, that it was entirely found in the
word of God, that this was the Fountain from whence it
was to be deriv'd, and that this Religion was as it were
the Trunk and Body of the Tree, to which it became us
to keep ſteady without ever forſaking it. This is my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſaid he to me, and I was willing to declare it to
you.</p>
               <p>I wou'd have told him, that I was not ſurpriz'd to hear
him diſcourſe in theſe terms, towards the end of his days,
after what he had taught the publick by his Books,
which had been of ſo great an Edification to the Church.
Let us break off there ſaid he to me, and let us not ſpeak
of praiſes at a time when moments are ſo precious, and
when they ought to be employed to a better uſe. Here
we let fall the Converſation, for that I perceiv'd his pains
preſt him, and that he askt to be put to Bed.</p>
               <p>A very worthy perſon, and one of his intimate and
ancient Friends, wou'd needs paſs that Night, being Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the 6th. of <hi>January,</hi> in his Chamber, that he might
do him ſome ſmall Services. His pains were moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly
rewarded, he had the opportunity of hearing
him diſcourſe of the happineſs of thoſe that had left
<hi>France</hi> for Religion. He made the application of it to
him, he beſought him, he exhorted him as a Paſtour and
as a Friend, to enjoy that Privilege, as a bleſſing which
cannot be ſufficiently valued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:101167:34"/>
The following days nature ſeem'd to make an utmoſt
effort to bring him off. He complain'd of a great pain
in the Arm that was free, 'twas thought to be a ſpice of
the Gout; he was a pretty while in this pain, and we in
hopes through this new Diſtemper, which in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
wou'd ſave his Life. But his Strength decaying
through the raging of the Fever, and the length of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
did not help nature in that indication it ſhew'd us;
I often ſaw him, and began to deſpair of his recovery
on <hi>Friday,</hi> becauſe I perceiv'd he was threatned with a
<hi>Delirium,</hi> which was a thing we moſt dreaded.</p>
               <p>His Wife askt him if he was not ſorry to leave her; no,
anſwered he, becauſe I am going to my God, and I leave
you in his hands in a free Countrey, what can I deſire
more either for you or for my ſelf?</p>
               <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Evening, Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> wou'd
needs Write to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> he made uſe of the
hand of one of his Friends, for that his own was too
weak; this Letter was ſhort and comformable to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
it expreſt the State of his mind and heart, in
thoſe laſt moments of his Life. He ſign'd it with ſome
trouble, his Highneſs receiv'd it, and that great Prince,
who ever places the concern of Religion in the firſt rank
of ſo many other important matters, which depend upon
his Conduct, underſtood the loſs the Church was going
to have; and all Hero as he is, he was ſenſible upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing
it of his being a man as well as we, it thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
appear'd, that he valued and lamented the dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and ſhar'd deep in an affliction common to ſo many
good Souls.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> askt to ſpeak
with his Son, as ſoon as he was come to him, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
him tenderly, and ſaid, I am leaving you my Son,
the time of my departure is at hand. His Son wou'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101167:34"/>
have told him, that his Diſtemper was not yet deſperate;
but he replied, I have no hopes ſave in the mercy of
God, that is my principal Sanctuary, take it alſo for your
ſelf my Son, and never take any other.</p>
               <p>Preſently after, ſeeing that Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> grew wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
I askt him whether he wou'd give his bleſſing to his
Family, who requir'd it of him through my Mouth; moſt
willingly anſwered he, immediately his Wife fell upon
her knees by his Bed-ſide, and he ſpoke to her in theſe
terms; My Wife, I have always tenderly loved you, be
not afflicted at my Death, the Death of the Juſt is ſweet
and precious before God, in you have I ſeen the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a ſincere Piety, I praiſe God for it, be conſtant
in ſerving him with your whole heart, he will bleſs you,
I recommend my Son and his Family to you, and beſeech
the Lord to bleſs you.</p>
               <p>His Son kneeling by his Mother, did likewiſe ask his
bleſſing, Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> who lov'd him as a Father,
though he liv'd with him as a Brother, expreſt great Joy
at this Requeſt, and made him anſwer; My Son, I have
obſerv'd in you two Characters, which have mightily
pleaſed me, that of an honeſt man, and that of a man of
Honour, maintain theſe Characters to the laſt. You have
choſen the right ſide, perform your Office as a good
Paſtour, and God will bleſs you; I recommend your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to you, love her, reſpect her, I am perſuaded you
will not fail in this, and that ſhe will make you ſutable
returns. Be mindfull, added he, of this Domeſtick, take
care that ſhe want nothing as long as ſhe lives; I give
you my bleſſing. Hereupon theſe two afflicted perſons
had not the power to make him an anſwer, their tears
and ſilence ſpoke for them.</p>
               <p>I crav'd his bleſſing for my ſelf, he was affected and
wearied, yet did he give it me according to my deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:101167:35"/>
After that I ſaid Prayers, he bid me be ſhort, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
this reaſon for it, I am under that oppreſſion ſaid
he, that I am not capable of applying my mind at this
moment, to more than theſe two great truths, to the
Meditation of the mercy of God, and to the Graces of
the holy Spirit. That is a great deal, Sir, ſaid I to him,
they are two moſt abundant Fountains of Comfort for
you, I pray'd God for him, and then it was thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
we ſhould leave him to his reſt.</p>
               <p>After the Sermon in the Morning, they pray'd for him
in the Church, but without naming him. At Noon
Monſieur <hi>Menard</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Jaquelot</hi> came to ſee
Monſieur <hi>Claude;</hi> Monſieur <hi>Menard</hi> had been his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue
at <hi>Paris.</hi> After ſome ſhort diſcourſe upon Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Claude</hi>'s Sickneſs, ſaid Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> to Monſieur
<hi>Menard,</hi> pray, Sir, let's talk of things more important,
and more available for me, I am in a State of Death, but
I hope that God will grant me mercy, for the ſake of
our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his Son, who is my onely Juſtice;
Monſieur <hi>Menard</hi> ſeconded this thought, which Monſieur
<hi>Claude</hi> had ſtarted, and Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s pangs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thick upon him, this converſation ended with a
Prayer.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Jaquelot</hi> expreſt to Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
at his illneſs, to which Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
after a very handſome and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Manner, in
praying God to bleſs him.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Carre</hi> came into his Room at one a Clock,
as ſoon as Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſaw him, he told him that his
laſt hour was drawing on, and that in a little time, his
Son would be without a Father, but that he beſought
him that he wou'd be a Father to his Son.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Carre</hi> told him that he had an eſteem for his
Son, that he lov'd him and ſhould ſerve him in all he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101167:35"/>
could, that they were Collegues, and that onely Death
ſhould part them. Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> the Father thank't
him, declar'd he died ſatisfied, and was very intent upon
the Prayer which Monſieur <hi>Carre</hi> made for him.</p>
               <p>Though Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> had not been nam'd after
the Morning Sermon, the report of the danger he was
in, was immediately ſpread about the Church, and the
affection people had for him, with their pity and fear,
drew a world of people to his Houſe; more eſpecially I
found there ſeveral Ladies of his acquaintance, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
who expreſt how deſirous they were, to hear
Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſpeak and receive his bleſſing: I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
of their deſires, but added, that it would be a
hard matter to procure them that conſolation, becauſe
his Head was not at liberty to talk long together; they
nevertheleſs urg'd me to make the propoſal of it, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
did ſo, and that too immediately, telling him
what was deſir'd of him; I added, that the laſt words
of a man of his Character and Merit, would edifie as
much as ſeveral Sermons, and that he owed this Succour
to the Zeal and Calamities of thoſe good Souls that
requir'd this comfort of him; a God's name replied he,
this deſire is Juſt, appoint a fitting time for it which you
know beſt, and which accordingly was immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
but he was no longer in a condition to ſpeak, he
had had a <hi>Delirium,</hi> which did not allow him the liberty
of proſecuting a diſcourſe, in ſuch a manner as might
have been expected of him.</p>
               <p>He was again pray'd for in the Church, in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
Service, and it was thought convenient he ſhould
be named. Monſieur <hi>Arbuſſe</hi> Preaching at that time, ſaid
before he enter'd upon his Prayer, that there was one of
our Brethren that deſerv'd to be lamented by all good
people, that it was Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> that they were to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101167:36"/>
pray God for him, the whole Congregation ſeem'd much
concern'd at this name; Monſieur <hi>Arbaſſe</hi> pray'd to God
with great zeal, was herein accompanied by the whole
Church, which could not forbear weeping before hand,
for the loſs they were going to have.</p>
               <p>After five a Clock at the Evening Sermon, Monſieur
<hi>Du Vivie</hi> pray'd God for Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> he inſiſted a
pretty while upon this point, his grief and zeal excited
likewiſe the grief and zeal of the Congregation which
diſſolv'd into tears.</p>
               <p>At nine a Clock Monſieur <hi>Du Vivie</hi> came to ſee him,
as ſoon as he drew near his Bed, Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> gave
him his bleſſing; you have prevented my wiſhes ſaid Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Du Vivie</hi> to him, I had a deſign to ask you your
bleſſing; God confirm it to you, Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> made
him anſwer. Some time after Monſieur <hi>Du Vivie</hi> told him,
that it became him to think of a perfect Juſtice, that may
ſerve before the Tribunal of God, where he was going to
appear, and that he knew very well that this Juſtice was
onely to be found in our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who was
made to us by God, Wiſedom, Juſtice, Sanctification,
and Redemption; that's all my hopes anſwered Monſieur
<hi>Claude,</hi> he added this paſſage at length, <hi>I know in whom I
have believed, &amp;c.</hi> After which Monſieur <hi>Du Vivie</hi> ſaid
Prayers, which the ſick-man liſſen'd to with great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Half an hour after, Monſieur <hi>Du Vivie</hi> askt him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he did not find, that his Condition had ſome affinity
with the 73 <hi>Pſalm. My fleſh faileth and mine heart alſo,
but God is the ſtrength of mine heart and my Portion for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> rais'd up his Voice and ſaid twice
Amen, Amen; he gave his bleſſing to ſome perſons of his
acquaintance that askt it of him; there was eſpecially a
deſerving young Lady, who askt him whether he would
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101167:36"/>
impart his bleſſing to her as well as to the reſt, why
ſhould I not give it you he anſwered her, I have ſeen evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
inſtances of your diſcretion and piety, I pray God to
bleſs you.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> falling into a Slumber, his Son wakt
him from time to time, to give him Conſolation; 'twas
done in few words, he being too weak to proſecute a long
diſcourſe, he askt him if he did not place all his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the death of his Saviour, yes Son replied he,
our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is my onely Juſtice, I need no other,
he is all-ſufficient. I askt him whether he was not much
pleas'd in being thus comforted by his Son, I am very
well ſatisfied he replied, let him continue, I ſaid Prayers
and ſtaid with him till eleven a Clock.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 13th. of <hi>January,</hi> a ſad day for us, I
was call'd up at five a Clock in the Morning, to go ſee
Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> who was become extraordinary weak;
I ſpoke to him but little, he being in great Agonies occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
by pains in his Stomach. At ten a Clock I drew
near his Bed, and ſeeing him in a quieter condition, I
askt him whether he knew me, yes ſaid he to me, with
a voice pretty ſtrong, you are my Paſtour, my whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is to the mercy of God, I expect a better life
than this, help me to fortifie me in the exerciſe of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Prayer. Notwithſtanding his pains, finding
him conſtant in his pious inclinations, I took upon me
the right of his Paſtour, that he had conferr'd upon me;
I ſpoke to him of the ſinfulneſs of mankind, and of the
riches of the grace of God, that have appear'd in the
Death of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and I exhorted him
to place his whole confidence in the Death of that good
Saviour. Theſe few words excited his piety, he gave us
moſt ſenſible teſtimonies of his Repentance, and of the
ſtedfaſt Faith he had in our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101167:37"/>
this happy moment did I alſo apply that ſo precious
Balm, which our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has put into our
hands, for the conſolation of repenting Sinners. Be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
ſaid I to him, Brother, that your Sins are forgiven
you, through the mercy of God, I declare it to you in
the name of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who has given us
a Commiſſion for ſo doing; and I beſeech him that he
wou'd ratifie it to you, by the ſentiment of your own
Conſcience, this Declaration which he liſſen'd to atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
afforded him mighty Joy; I am perſuaded ſaid he
to me, that God will hear the ſighs of my Soul, and
your diſcourſes, let us beſeech him ſo to doe, by the
Prayers I beg you would make in my behalf, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we fell upon our knees and I pray'd God for him.</p>
               <p>At two a Clock in the Afternoon, there was no longer
any connexion in Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s diſcourſe, nay, and
we avoided engaging him to ſpeak, for fear of augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his <hi>Delirium;</hi> We pray'd often for him in that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
At five a Clock, he had ſomewhat a violent Potion
given him for to rouſe his Spirits, but all ineffectually.
At ſeven a Clock, he became ſtill much weaker, yet did
he ſtill hear, but was become ſpeechleſs. I bid him give
me a ſign whether he underſtood me, and that he ſhould
give me his hand; accordingly he reach't it to me, I
took his hand, and ſaid theſe words of the 31. <hi>Pſalm</hi> to
him. <hi>Into thine hand I commend my ſpirit, for thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
me O Lord God of Truth;</hi> at theſe words he preſt
my hand, and ſtrugl'd to raiſe his head, I continued to
exhort him and ſaid Prayers.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Arbuſſe</hi> came to ſee him, and pray'd by him,
for he was ſo weak, and his ſenſes ſo ſpent, that Prayer
was the onely aſſiſtance he could receive from us. This
exerciſe laſted till half an hour paſt Eleven at Night. On
the 13th. of <hi>January 1687,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Menard</hi> and I did
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101167:37"/>
not ſtir from his Bed-ſide till his laſt gaſp, when we ſaw
him calmly expire at that time, and reſtored his Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of God.</p>
               <p>Thus Lived, and thus Died <hi>John Claude</hi> in his 68 year,
after having ſo worthily perform'd his Office, for the
ſpace of forty two years or there abouts; he was by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
quick and lively, but ſubmiſſive to reaſon and faith;
he was Civil, Modeſt, Illuminated, wiſe in his Councells,
a true Friend, officious without being troubleſome, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
but with choice, and much concern'd for the evils
the Church labour'd under. He underſtood the World,
ſhrifted into intreagues, and improv'd all theſe lights to
the repoſe of the Flocks of the Lord. He had a ſagacious
Wit, a vaſt Imagination, a nice Judgment, a juſt Choice;
his expreſſion was clear, ſprightly and ſtrong, his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
had paſt the teſt of Meditation, he had fram'd an
eaſie platform of all matters of his Profeſſion; each ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
came in its due place, as ſoon as he ſpoke or writ,
and all this was maintain'd with an exact method and
mighty beauty of Language. He was a learned Divine,
a great Preacher, an able and zealous defender of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
a rigid obſerver of our confeſſion of Faith, an
enemy of all ſuch ſentiments as might have diſturb'd the
peace of the Church, and the purity of Religion, and to
the regulations of our Diſcipline. He was of eaſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
of frank and fluent Converſation, and all theſe great
qualities were ſeaſon'd with ſuch profound humility, that
when he ſpoke, he ſeem'd to forget what he was, to fit
his diſcourſe to the meaneſt underſtandings. In <hi>France</hi> he
liv'd belov'd by his Friends, eſteem'd by his Adverſaries,
and his name which has paſt with ſo much luſtre into fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries, has there gain'd the admiration of thoſe
very people, who did not love his Religion, and ever will
be had in veneration in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:101167:38"/>
Theſe Characters are to be ſeen in the works he has
given us, and if his Son will farther enrich the publick
as is hop'd with other Writings, that have not yet ſeen
the light, they will furniſh us with new ſtrokes, to render
the portraict of this great man the more accompliſht.
For to have an Heroick Idea of him, we muſt ſtudy him
and his works.</p>
               <q>Remember them which have the overſight of you, which
have declared unto you the word of God, whoſe faith fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
