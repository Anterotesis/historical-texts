            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We have briefly opened and analysed the Words, Let us now take a short review of them again for our further instruction and benefit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may observe <hi>a difference</hi> which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle makes amongst the Members of the Church: some <hi>strong,</hi> some <hi>weak,</hi> some <hi>perfect,</hi> some <hi>seduced,</hi> some listning to <hi>Paul,</hi> and others to the <hi>Concision.</hi> As on the same foundation, some parts of the building may be Marble and Cedar, other parts

Lath and Tearing, some strong, and others rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. As in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> so in the <hi>House</hi> of God, <hi>some Stars differ from other Stars in glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 41. He who hath the <hi>fulness</hi> of the Spirit, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue to give still unto him that lacketh, doth yet blow by his Spirit <hi>where he listeth,</hi> Joh. 3. 8. and <hi>divideth to every one severally as he will,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 11. yet alwayes <gap reason="foreign">

Tit. 3. 6.</note> some special service, as <hi>Zachary, Elizabeth, Stephen, Barnabas</hi> and others are said to have been <hi>full of Faith</hi> and of the Holy Ghost. Otherwise the best must say, as our Apostle here doth, <hi>not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect, but I follow after,</hi> and <hi>reach forth,</hi> and <hi>presse forward.</hi> Some have need of <hi>milk,</hi> others of <hi>strong</hi> meat, some <hi>babes,</hi> others of <hi>fuller age,</hi> some <hi>unskilfull</hi> in the Word of Righteousness, others <hi>senses exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised</hi> to discern good and evill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. Some <hi>Fitches,</hi> some <hi>Cmmmin,</hi> some <hi>Bread-corn,</hi> Isa. 28. 27, 28. some have <hi>knowledge,</hi> and others <hi>weak consciences,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 7. some are <hi>first born,</hi> and they have five talents, a <hi>double portion</hi> of the Spirit, as <hi>Elisha</hi> had, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 15. others are yonger Children and have lower abilities, who therefore have not so large a stock, nor so 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49105:8"/>
noble a service. Some Children by reason of their strength do perform work, others by reason of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy and infirmity do only make work, some are for the <hi>Schoole,</hi> and others for the <hi>Cradle,</hi> some for the <hi>Field,</hi> others for the <hi>Couch,</hi> some for <hi>duty,</hi> and others for <hi>Cure,</hi> and yet <hi>all Children.</hi> With such admirable wisdome hath God tempered the body that there might be a <hi>various love</hi> amongst the Members, in the strong to the weak <hi>a love of care,</hi> in the weak to the strong <hi>a love of reverence,</hi> that the strong may learn to <hi>restore</hi> the weak, and the weak to <hi>imitate</hi> the strong, that by those who fall, the strong may learn <hi>to fear;</hi> and by those that stand, the weak may learn to <hi>fight;</hi> that the weak by the strong may be provoked to <hi>emulation,</hi> and the strong by the weak may be provoked to <hi>edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi> that they who <hi>stand</hi> may be for the praise of Christs <hi>power and grace,</hi> and they who <hi>fall</hi> for the praise of his <hi>patience and mercy,</hi> and that in the variety of different supplies unto the Members, the fulness of the head may be admired.</p>
            <p>Let not those therefore who have more eminent gifts superciliously overlook &amp; <hi>despise</hi> their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our brethren, <hi>For who hath made thee to differ, or why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?</hi> rather thus judge, the more <hi>thy gifts are,</hi> the greater must be thy <hi>service</hi> to the Church of Christ here, and the greater thine accompts at his tribunall hereafter.</p>
            <p>And again, Let not those who have not so great a measure, <hi>envy or maligne</hi> the gifts of others, for it is God who hath made them to excell, and <hi>why</hi>

               </hi> rather thus consider, the <hi>Head cannot say to the foot, I have no need of thee,</hi> and the best way to <hi>improve,</hi> and increase the gifts of God, is with humility and uprightness to <hi>imploy</hi> them. The Apostle hath spent one whole Chapter upon this argument to perswade Christians from <hi>unbrotherly censures</hi> of one another upon difference of judgement in smaller things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. pressing this duty by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reasons. 1. God who is the Judge <hi>receiveth men</hi> into his favour notwithstanding their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, therefore they ought not mutually to cast one another out of their own favour, vers. 3. 2. Our brother is <hi>anothers servant,</hi> and not ours, therefore we ought not to make our will or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the rule of his, (servants should have no will of their own, but their Lords) since God can and <note place="margin">Velle non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur qui ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequuntur im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio patris vel Domini Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest. de Regal. juris. leg. 4.</note> will keep him in service and from dangerous falls as well as us, vers. 4. 3. He walketh according to the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>perswasion</hi> of his heart, so that his failing is erroneous only, but not pertinacious, so long as he doth reverence light, and resolve that his <hi>heart shall not reproach</hi> him, he is docile and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible by any clear conviction, his heart is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, though he do sometimes miss his way, vers. 5, 6. 4. We must all be accomptable to <hi>a Common Lord,</hi> and have thereupon work enough of our own to doe, and therefore ought not to make others accomptable unto us, we have none of us dominion over our selves, therefore not over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neither; ver. 7. we have a Lord, who dearly purchased the dominion over us, and before whose
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49105:9"/>
tribunal we must all give an account of our selves, vers. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 5. By judging, despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and offending one another, we break the rules of Christian charity, grieving and endangering the souls of our brethren, vers. 13. 15. we expose those <hi>good things</hi> wherein we agree unto <hi>reproach,</hi> vers. 16. and prejudice the great things of the Kingdom of <hi>God, Righteousnesse, Peace, Joy in the Holy Ghost</hi> (which are the things which render us <hi>acceptable to God,</hi> and therefore should make us <hi>approved of one another)</hi> by our uncharitabe alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in smaller things, vers. 17, 18. We hinder the <hi>peace and edification</hi> of one another, vers. 19. We minister <hi>occasion</hi> of falling, <hi>stumbling</hi> and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to our weak brother, ver. 20, 21. We <hi>abuse our liberty</hi> by making it a ball of contention, when we might enjoy it within our selves, without any such danger, ver. 22. We go about to <hi>entangle</hi> our weak brother by inducing him to act <hi>doubting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and without a warrant and perswasion of the lawfulness of what he doth, ver. 22, 23. So then what ever be the <hi>differences</hi> amongst true believers, who agree in the great things of Gods Kingdom, the <hi>strong</hi> ought not <hi>to despise</hi> the weak, nor the <hi>weak to judge</hi> the strong, neither ought to hurt, grieve, wound, offend the hearts of one another, in as much as we are all <hi>fellow servants</hi> to one common Lord, who will judge us all, and in as much as we are <hi>owned by that Lord,</hi> and accepted, the weak as well as the strong, who doth not so much value us by the degrees of our <hi>knowledge,</hi> as by the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our <hi>love,</hi> who doth not reap any benefit by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49105:9"/>
the difference of our services, but is pleased and glorified by the uprightness of our hearts, yea possibly is more pleased with the <hi>conscionable ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse</hi> of the weak brother that errs, then with the <hi>confident</hi> and inexpedient <hi>liberty</hi> of the strong brother who doth not erre.</p>

               </gap>, to decline all exasperations, to use all meekness and condescention, so farre as our duty to truth will give us leave, that so though we cannot reconcile the judgements, yet we may <hi>gain the affections</hi> of our brethren. It is noted of <hi>Basil</hi> that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie concerning the holy Spirit, he forbore all unwelcome words, and phrases, whereby the <note place="margin">Nazian. Orat. 10.</note> contrary minded were exasperated, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable startled and made jealous, and used such milde insinuations as might win and confirm men in the truth.</p>
            <p>For a more particular stating of this point. Let us 1. distinguish of <hi>Opinions.</hi> Some are in the <hi>Foundation,</hi> in those necessary Doctrines upon which the House of God is built, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 24. the Errors contrary wherereunto are pernicious and <hi>damnable,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. Some are only in the <hi>superstruction</hi> which do not so neerly touch the vitalls and essentials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which are not <hi>fidei</hi> but <hi>quaestionum,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> somewhere distinguisheth. Such were in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time disputes touching <hi>meats,</hi> and <hi>drinks,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49105:13"/>
               <hi>dayes,</hi> and things indifferent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5, 6. and in our dayes touching <hi>Forms of Discipline</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the Church, wherein men abound in their own sense, with meekness, and with submission to the spirits of the Prophets.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are likewise to distinguish of <hi>persons,</hi> fome are <hi>Seducers,</hi> who out of pride, enmity against the Doctrine which is according unto godliness, carnall ends, desire of advantage and domination, do sow tares in the Church, and labour to cause rents and divisions therein. Such were <hi>Hymeneus, Philetus, Diotrephes, c.</hi> Others are <hi>Seduced</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who through ignorance and credulity are led away captive by the cunning craftiness of those who lie in wait to deceive, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. Again some are <hi>pious,</hi> meek, and peaceable men, others are of <hi>turbulent and tumultuating</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who love to kindle flames, and to foment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, and to fish <hi>in</hi> troubled waters. <hi>Joachim. Camerarius</hi> in the life of <hi>Melancthon</hi> complaineth of the faction of <hi>Flacius Illyricus</hi> upon this accompt who loaded with challenges and reproaches as betrayers and deserters of the truth, All who <note place="margin">Camerar. de vita Philippi Melancthones pag. 353. &amp; 385.</note> were not as flagrant and vehement as themselves, contrary to the meek temper of that good man, who would have all things which might without wickedness and with a good conscience, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, rather then new wounds to be inflicted upon the Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>These things being premised, we conclude; 1. That there can be <hi>no Syncretisme</hi> or Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation in case of differences, where the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49105:14"/>
are <hi>against the foundations</hi> of Faith, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Obedience, and Holiness, there can be <hi>no agreement between light and darkness, Christ and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial, damnable Heresies,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine according unto godliness,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 14. 17. 1 Cor. 10. 21. we <hi>must depart</hi> from the impurity of Hereticall Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. Hereticks are to be <hi>admonished,</hi> and in case of pertinacy to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,</hi> Tit. 3. 10. therefore there may be no bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly concord or coalescency with them: but <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced</hi> persons are to be by the spirit of meekness and gentleness <hi>instructed,</hi> and if it be possible be wonne unto the truth, and delivered from the snare of the Divel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the differences be not <hi>prima facie,</hi> so dangerous, yet notwithstanding if it be evident that they be purposely sowed by men of turbulent and ungracious spirits, meerly to kindle flames, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment divisions, to lay the foundation of perpetual broiles and jars in Church and State, to gratifie the common adversary of the reformed Churches, and to be subservient unto his ends and designs, in this case the Apostle hath taught us to <hi>mark such men, and to take heed of them,</hi> Rom. 16. 17. and would not give place by subjection for an hour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where a Syncretisme and agreement is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, yet we must love and joyn <hi>peace and truth</hi> together, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 19. we must not betray the truth, or dissemble it, or make a mixture of truth and falshood, a kind of <hi>Samaritanisme</hi> in Religion (for of them it is said that they <hi>feared the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> 
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49105:14"/>
               <hi>their own gods,</hi> 2 Reg. 17. 33. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods people would not admit them into the society of building Gods house, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3.) we must not adde or diminish one jot or title to or from divine truth, or temper and reduce it to the Rules of meer humane wisdom. <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Abaz</hi> acted beyond their power, when they set up ways of worship, subservient unto carnal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and not according to the will of God, we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the <hi>Foundations</hi> and necessary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Law and Gospel, of Faith, Worship, and Obedience are safe, and on all sides una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously embraced, there in differences of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour nature, which do not touch the Essentials, and vitals of Religion, <hi>mutuall tolerance, meeknesse,</hi> and tenderness is to be used, <hi>as amongst brethren,</hi> and fellow members. In the body, if a finger have a <hi>Gangraene</hi> in it, which cannot be cured, the body cannot without danger of deadly infection hold communion with that member, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is severed and cut off, <hi>ne pars syncera tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatur;</hi> but if it have <hi>onely a bile,</hi> or some other less dangerous sore, the other parts love and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish it, and are not at all cruel and churlish unto it. And this is consonant to the Doctrine of <hi>Scip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> which teacheth the <hi>Strong to bear</hi> with the infirmities of the weak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1. the spiritual <hi>to restore their Brethren</hi> with meeknels, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. the members to have the same care of each other,

Love and a spirit of unity and peace is the <hi>new Commandment,</hi> the <hi>Oyntment</hi> which ran down from the Head to the Members. He that is not a man of peace, cannot be a man of God, this is an Oyntment which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to Christs body, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 33. <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are fruits <hi>of the flesh,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 3. <hi>Contention</hi> a Childe of <hi>pride</hi> Prov. 13. 10. <hi>Light vapors</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times come down in great Tempests, and light differences through pride may grow into great stormes, whereas <hi>Love covereth a multitude of sins,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 8..</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To attend on the Ordinances which open the Scripture unto us, the <hi>Ministery</hi> which Christ hath erected for this very purpose to <hi>perfect the Saints,</hi> and to bring them by the unity of the Faith, and knowledge of the Son of God unto a <hi>full sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> Ephes. 4. 12, 13.</p>

            <p>I conclude all with a very few words of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation unto this Honourable Assembly, all ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the particulars of the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To acknowledge with the Apostle your own <hi>imperfection. Solomon</hi> was sensible of the <hi>disparity</hi> between his <hi>work</hi> and his <hi>strength,</hi> and so all good men are; and thereupon, 1. <hi>Wait upon God for wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> Jam. 1. 5. 2. <hi>Do not precipitate counsels,</hi> but mature them by grave and full deliberation. <hi>Ita enim nati estis ut bona malaque vestra ad Remp. pertineant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To settle and secure the weighty doctrines
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49105:20"/>
of <hi>righteousnesse by Christ alone,</hi> of holinesse and conformity to his death and resurrection, of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection</hi> of humane righteousness, of necessity of <hi>daily progresse</hi> in the waies of grace, and of those means which Christ hath set up in his Church in order thereunto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In making Laws and penalties to be tender towards the weak consciences of your brethren. There is indeed a very <hi>great veneration</hi> due to Laws, and Magistrates do with good reason ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have their Sanctions <hi>obeyed</hi> rather then <hi>disputed:</hi> But they must remember they are <hi>brethren</hi> as well as Magistrates, and therefore must take heed <hi>of writing or binding heavy burdens;</hi> no Law-maker can know the lawfulnesse of his own <note place="margin">Isa. 10. 1. Mat. 23. 4.</note> edicts more certainly then the Apostles knew that <hi>Legal ceremonies were extinguished</hi> by the death of Christ. Yet knowing likewise the weakness of their brethren the Jews, they did not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put forth their Apostolical authority to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting of them, but suffered them to die a lingring death. It is a sad thing to be reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that uncomfortable Dilemma, of choosing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iniquity (as to a mans own conscience I mean) or affliction. And if by any means he be brought unto it, he may take more comfort in suffering it, then others in inflicting it. I speak not this to weaken the hands of Law-makers, or to derogate from the authority of Laws (unto which I shall ever both out of principles of <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> carrie all Reverence and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, either chearfully to do, or meekly to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49105:21"/>
suffer.) But I speak it as an <hi>humble caution,</hi> that since there are some of humble and quiet spirits who may sometimes be <hi>otherwise minded,</hi> Laws may be made so exactly consonant to the general rules of the word, and may have such prints and evidences of their own goodness, wholsomness, and righteousnesse in them, as that they may not by any rational exception or semblance of equity, be declined or objected against.</p>
            <p>And I would here withal distinguish between men of a meek, humble and patient temper, and others of busie, boisterous, turbulent spirits, who under pretence of conscience do at any time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in actions apparently inconsistent with righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and peace; for we are sure that the Laws of Christ do require all men to <hi>lead quiet and peaceable,</hi> as well as <hi>godly and honest lives,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Laws of men. And no man can with any probable pretence of good conscience tumultuate against publick order and peace in Church or State.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Since the Lord doth heale breaches in his Church <hi>by his Spirtt and Word,</hi> as the ordinarie means thereunto, therefore speciall care should be had that these means be duly used and applied by authorizing, countenancing, encouraging, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting, rewarding the faithful Ministers of the Gospel in the due discharge of their duties; not suffering their persons, functions, doctrines, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or comforts to be assaulted by any turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or malicious opposers.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To lay to heart the breaches and differences
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49105:21"/>
which are amongst us, and to pour oile and balm into the wounds of the Church, and to applie all requisite expedients for the closing of them, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great advantages which adversaries take by our differences and divisions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To countenance and <hi>encourage fundamental</hi> truths, wherein all agree, and as much as may be to hinder those <hi>digladiations,</hi> whereby the common enemie is gratified, and his interest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by animosities from the presse, over which it were very needful that there were a more provident superinspection: there being a great difference between a libertie allowed men between God and their own consciences, and a power to sowe their tares, and to spread their leaven into the whole lump.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To mannage all councels and consultations by the <hi>Rule of the Word:</hi> For though I am not of their opinion, who would have no other humane Lawes, but such as are formally to be found in the Scripture, yet there are there <hi>general Rules</hi> of Equity, Truth, Justice, Expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Liberty, unto which all humane Laws should be conformable.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To eye and <hi>minde the same things,</hi> to have all the same joynt and honourable <hi>ends,</hi> to have no divided interests, no domestical Reflections, but single upright aimes at the glorie of God, the truth of the Gospel, the power of godliness, the interest of Christ, the soules of men, the peace, tranquilitie and happiness of these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:49105:22"/>
7. Lastly, to waite continually upon God for <hi>counsel and guidance</hi> by his Spirit, for <hi>Acceptation</hi> with him and his people, for <hi>blessing and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi> upon all righteous and honourable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, that he would give you <hi>one heart and one way,</hi> and cause you to know the way wherein you should walk, and do nothing by you but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone which may promote his <hi>glory,</hi> advance his <hi>truth,</hi> rejoyce his <hi>people,</hi> tend to the calming of unhappy differences, and to the reducing of these discomposed Nations unto unitie and serenity, For which purpose let us pray, &amp;c.</p>
