            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Readers
CONSCIENCE.</head>
            <p>COnscience; how thou wilt
take it I know not: however
I have adventured to write
a few lines unto thee, because
I know thou art well acquainted with
my Reader, and canst do much with
him if thou wilt; and if thou be a Good
Conscience thou wilt. Naturally good
I know thou art, I would hope that thou
art Spiritually good, <hi>purged from dead
works by the Bloud of Christ, Heb.</hi>
9. 14. and made good <hi>by the power of
the Resurrection of Jesus Christ,
1 Pet.</hi> 3. 21. and art able to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
by thy <hi>hope to be saved, 1 Pet.</hi> 3.
15, 16. and that thou standest upon
thy watch and ward <hi>against Sin, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and the World, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 18, 19.
However thou art naturally good;


<pb facs="tcp:37806:3"/>
something thou hast retained since the
Fall, all is not lost: Reason, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and the power of Reflection thou
hast; and to speak according to thy
Knowledge, and to tell every one with
whom thou hast to do the truth how 'tis
with them, is thy essential property.
Even those (<hi>John</hi> 8. 6, 9.) that tempted
Christ, that they might have something
to accuse him of, were convicted of their
Consciences; their Consciences dealt
plainly with them, and told them the
truth, that they were not without sin.</p>
            <p>Conscience, thou art the Candle of the
Lord searching the inward parts, the
most secret thoughts, desires, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 27. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 11.
What man knoweth the things of a
man, save the spirit of a man within
him?</hi> Thou didst tell <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that he
was wicked, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 27. and <hi>Josephs</hi>
Brethren, that they were guilty, <hi>Gen.</hi>
42. 21. and <hi>Judas</hi> that he had sinned
in betraying innocent bloud, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27


<pb facs="tcp:37806:3"/>
3, 4. I pray thee do as much for my
Reader if thou see cause for it. It may
be thou art a well read Conscience in the
Law of God, enlightned and rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
If thou be so, thou knowest
my Readers estate Godward, whether
good or bad, in the state of Grace or
Nature. Thou must needs know, for
thou art always at home with him, and
there is not a thought in his Heart but
thou art privy to it, nor a word in his
tongue but thou hearest it, nor a work of
his hand but thou seest it. God hath
made thee his Spy and Overseer, that so
thou mayst be a true Witness for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conscience, thou canst tell whether
my Reader be</hi> a Child of wrath, as he
was born, Eph. 2. 3. <hi>or whether he</hi> be
born again, and so be a Child of God
by Faith in Jesus Christ, Gal. 3. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou canst tell whether he be as yet
to this day</hi> in the gall of bitterness
and bond of iniquity, <hi>as he</hi> Acts 8.
23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37806:4"/>
Thou canst tell whether he be in the
flesh, and do live after the flesh, or no.</p>
            <p>Whether he be the same that ever he
was, or whether he be a new creature,
the workmanship of God by a second cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
born of God and of the Spirit,
sanctified throughout, cleansed from fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of flesh and spirit.</p>
            <p>Whether he worship God in spirit and
truth.</p>
            <p>Whether he have onely the form of
godliness, or the power also.</p>

            <p>Whether his Knowledge be effective

            <p>Now (Conscience) I have an earnest

canst not want an opportunity to do
what I shall request of thee. My Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
is this, That thou wouldest deal
honestly with my Reader, and tell him
the truth of his estate what it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If he be</hi> a child of wrath, and in the
gall of bitterness and bond of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>tell him so, and say to him as</hi> Peter

thou art in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and bond of iniquity, a child of
wrath, <hi>and the wrath of God will come


<pb facs="tcp:37806:6"/>
upon thee if thou continue so,</hi> Eph. 5. 6.</p>
            <p>If my Reader do <hi>live after the flesh,</hi>
(and sure thou canst tell whether he does
so or no.) Good Conscience, tell him
that he does so, and that if he shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
so to do, he shall die; and shew him
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. and bid him read it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If my Reader</hi> do the work of the
Lord negligently, <hi>deceitfully; if he</hi>
offer to God a corrupt thing when
he has a male to offer, <hi>tell him of the
curse which hangs over his head, and
make him read</hi> Jer. 48. 10. Mat. 1. 14.</p>

            <p>Possibly thou mayest say, That thou

transgressions and sins.</p>
            <p>Be not silent whether they will hear,
or whether they will forbear, yet speak
unto them. I know my Readers, many of
them, will endeavour to silence and stop
thy mouth; they do not love to be told of
their faults, or what their estate is: but
Conscience be not thou rebellious, but do
that which is thine Office to do. I know

Others pray not in their Closets, nor

And then when I have so done, I shall
tell you and prove it, that it should
be your greatest care so to live, that
Conscience may not reproach you
whilest you live; and then give

            <p>1. General. <hi>What Conscience is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly, Conscience is a mans
Judgment of himself: <hi>i.e.</hi> Of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
and Actions; this is Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Or thus, if you will; <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is a Power of the Soul; for the
Soul is endowed with Noble Powers
and Faculties, Vnderstanding, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Memory, Will, and Affections:
and Conscience is not the least of them.
I say, Conscience is a Power of the Soul
taking notice and bearing witness of all
a mans Thoughts, Words, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and as it finds them, either to
agree or not agree with the Rule, it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
or excuses, absolves or condemns
comforts or torments. This is Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
Do you think there is any such


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37806:29"/>
Inhabitant in you? It may be some
have taken no notice of any such Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
in the House of their Soul,
whether there be any such Power of
the Soul, or no. I say it again, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is a Power of the Soul, taking
notice, and bearing witness, (it takes
notice that it may bear witness) of
all a mans Thoughts, Words, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
and as it finds his Thoughts,
Words, or Actions, to be either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
or not agreeing with the
Rule, so it doth excuse or accuse, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
or condemn, comfort or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This is Conscience.</p>
            <p>1. It is a Power of the Soul; it is
called Heart 1 <hi>John 3. 20. For if our
heart coudemn us, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Eccles. 7.
22. For oftentimes also thine own heart
knoweth, &amp;c.</hi> It is called likewise the
Spirit of a man, <hi>Prov. 18. 14. The
Spirit of a man will sustain his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but a wounded Spirit who can
bear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37806:30"/>
2. Conscience is a Power of the
Soul taking notice; it is a most Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Observer. Conscience is very
quick sighted. It is continually pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
though we do not observe and
take notice of it; yet so it is. What
is said of God <hi>Psalm</hi> 139. 3, 4. is true
of his Deputy: Who is that? It is
Conscience. Conscience is no mean
thing, it is Gods Deputy, and what
is said of God in that place is true of
Conscience: <hi>Thou compassest my path
and my lying down, and thou art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with all my ways, for there is
not a word in my mouth, but lo, O Lord,
thou knowest it altogether: Thou hast
beset me behind and before.</hi> So that
a man cannot stir but God seeth and
Conscience seeth, and knoweth and
taketh notice of it; and one would
wonder how Conscience will revive
what was done seven years, and three
times seven years, ago. Conscienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
will whisper in your ear, this was
your heart, and this was in your


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37806:30"/>
tongue, and this was in your hands,
this was thought by you, that was
spoken by you, and that was done by
you; that which we had utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
How fresh many years after
doth Conscience bring it to mind?
Conscience took notice of it, and did
well observe it. Thus Coscience is
a Power of the Soul taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
            <p>3. And bearing witness, it taketh
notice that it may bear witness, if it
should not take notice it could not
bear witness. Can a man bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that which he never knew,
which he never saw, nor heard?
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. The Apostle speaking of
the Gentiles saith, <hi>Having not the
Law, they do by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Law: these having not
the Law, are a Law unto themselves,
which shew the work of the Law written
in their hearts, their Conscience also
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

speech, <hi>Conscience is a thousand


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37806:31"/>
Witnesses;</hi> nay it's more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
or ten thousand Witnesses; that
one Witness is enough to cast us. If
Conscience be a Witness, there is no
need of any further Witness. As
they said of Christ, <hi>What need we any
further witness, we have it from his
own mouth?</hi> So will the Lord say
to the Sinner, What need any further
Witness, his own Conscience is Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
You read of the Testimony of
Conscience, sometimes it is for, and
sometimes against.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is sometimes for us, as</hi> 2 Cor.
1. 12. This is our rejoycing <hi>(saith the
Apostle)</hi> the testimony of our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that in all simplicity and godly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
not with fleshly wisdom, but by
the grace of God, we have had our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
in the world.</p>
            <p>2. And sometimes against us, and
then 'tis a Hell above ground, a Hell
on this side Hell.</p>

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is a Power of the Soul takin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

notice of, and bearing witness of a
mans Thoughts, Words, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so that the Thoughts shall not
escape Consciences observation, nor
shall a Word escape Consciences
hearing, nor a Work Consciences
recording. And as Conscience finds
the Thoughts, Words, or Actions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
agreeing or not agreeing with
the Rule, it will excuse or accuse.
Conscience cannot be a Witness of
our Thoughts, Words, and Actions,
whether they be according to the
Rule, or contrary to it, whether they
agree with the Rule, or warp from
it, unless it be a strict Observer. And
if it find our Thoughts, Words, and
Actions to agree with the Rule, it
excuseth; if not to agree with the
Rule, it accuseth: <hi>Rom. 2. 15. Their
thoughts in the mean while accusing or
excusing one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And then it follows, <hi>absolving
or condemning.</hi> For the truth is, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is a Judge, a Deputy Judge,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37806:32"/>
which God hath set up and given
Power to, that according as it finds
Thoughts, Words, and Actions, to
be according to Rule, or not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Rule, it may either acquit or
condemn.</p>
            <p>5. And then, it comforteth or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth
also, as it findeth thoughts,
words, and actions, either to agree
or not to agree with the Rule. 2 <hi>Cor.
1. 12. This is our rejoycing the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of our Conscience;</hi> there is the
comfort of Conscience. And <hi>Mark 9.
44. It is a Worm that never dieth;</hi>
there is the torment of it. Thus you
see Conscience is a Power of the Soul,
taking notice and bearing Witness,
of all a mans thoughts words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and as it finds them either agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or not agreeing with the Rule,
it excuseth, or accuseth, absolveth
or condemneth, comforteth or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth.

1. God knows if you read <hi>Job 16. 19.

know it too; the Angels are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string

imployed here on Earth, though we
take no notice of it. They are in our
Congregations and Meetings, and
they observe how we carry our selves

You cannot go to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,

Creatures are tempted to destroy

self? how canst thou look any body
in the face without shame? go and
destroy thy self. This was the case of a
poor Creature that I have twice spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with: once she attempted to
drown her self; I spake with her, and
gave her the best counsell could: she
answered me, I am ashamed, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed,
I cannot go about any thing.
Not many days after she went into a
Wood to cut her own Throat, but
God delivered her: but this poor
Creature is still under discontent, the
Devil doth remember her. I beseech
you consider how many Witnesses
there are of all that you do; you
think to sin in the dark, and to do it
so that no Eye shall see you, you think
to draw the Curtains, and then none
can see you; but you deceive your
selves, it is Noon Day with God still,
and so it is with Angels, and with the
Devil too; there is nothing hid fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their heads, and see that which should
make their eyes weep and trickle
down with tears, and if they have
any Zeal for God, the sight of their
Eyes will affect their Hearts. And
besides this Conscience also knows,
and therefore called Conscience (as
some think) because it knows with
others. It knoweth with God, with
Angels, with Devils, and knows it to
be all true which God lays to our
charge, and what the Devil lays to
our charge; so that Conscience is a
Knowledge together with others.
<hi>Rom. 9. 1. My Conscience bearing me
witness.</hi> My Conscience co-witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
my Conscience witnessing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with God; God knows it, and
doth witness it; and my Conscience
knows it, and doth witness it; and
my Conscience together with me
knows it.</p>
            <p>There is a double Act of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
there is a Direct Act
whereby we know a thing, and there


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37806:35"/>
is a Reflect Act whereby we know
that we know it. And this is the
Action of Conscience. <hi>Isa. 59. 12.
For our transgressions are multiplied
before thee, and our sins they testifie
against us; for our transgressions are
with us, and as for our iniquities we
know them, we know that we have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
So that Conscience is a recoiling
or a reflexion of the Soul upon it self;
according to that of <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>General.</hi> I come in the next place
to shew about what Conscience is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it is imploy'd about the whole
man and all his actions. It hath a
Commission thus to employ it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the understanding, how that doth
act, about the memory to observe how
that doth act, about the will how that
doth act, and the Affections how they
do act, it is imployed to observe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the man be sanctified or not, and
it is imployed about his Actions whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be good or bad, about our
actions towards God or Man, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37806:35"/>
our selves or others. And it is
imployed about every thing that is
either a Sin or a Duty. Conscience is
imployed to observe how you eat
and drink, it is imployed to observe
how you dress and habit your selves,
how you buy and sell, and deal and
trade in the World, it is imployed to
observe how you read the Scripture,
pray in your Family, in your Clozet,
and in the Congregation, how you
sanctifie the Sabbath, receive Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
how you spend your time,
how long you lye a Bed in a morning,
how late you set up at night, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
what; to observe how you car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
your selves alone, and how you
carry your selves in Comyany, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
what you do in the Streets, or
in the Field, in this place or in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, in this Company or in the
other Company; it goeth along with
you, and it will never leave you. God
help me to mind this. I hope you will
make the same prayer for your selves,
that I make for my self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:37806:36"/>
III. <hi>General.</hi> How Conscience is
imployed. From the Description of
Conscience which I have given you,
you may understand that Conscience
hath several Offices, the Office of a
Notary or Register, the Office of a
Witness or Accuser, the Office of a
Judge or a Condemner, the Office of
a Comforter or a Tormenter; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is imployed in such Offices as
these are, and Conscience will first or
last be faithful in the execution of
them, and it will do it's Office to
purpose</p>
            <p>1. It is imployed as a Notary or
Register to write down all we do; to
write it down as with the Point of a
Diamond, to Book it down, and Seal
it up, that it may come to Light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>2. It is imployed as an Accuser
when we do amiss, when we warp
from the Rule.</p>
            <p>3. It is imployed as a Judge, to
pass sentence of life or death. Oh,


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37806:36"/>
Sirs, how many poor souls are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by their own hearts? Their
own Consciences tell them, thou art
a Damned Creature, thou art an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
soul; it may be Conscience as
yet doth not set in Judgment, it is
not Sessions or Assizes time with you,
it may be it is adjourned and put of
to a longer time. But assure your
selves the time will come, the time is
at hand.</p>
            <p>4. Conscience is also imployed as
a Comforter, as an Acquitter and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solver
if we do well. 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 12. This
is our rejoycing, the testimony of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that in simplicity and godly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
&amp;c. we have had our conversation
in the world.</hi> What greater rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
then this? When Conscience shall
acquit me in the prescence of God,
when Conscience shall be able to say
as <hi>Hezekiah, Remember, O Lord, how
I have walked before thee in truth and
with a perfect heart, and have done
that which is good in thy sight.</hi> Oh


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37806:37"/>
what a comfort will it be when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
shall reflect upon it's believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Christ, upon it's confession of
sin, repentance and tears, sighs and
groans for sin. This is my rejoycing,
the testimony of my Conscience; that
I have been alone in a corner in my
Clozet, with tears in mine eyes and
sorrow in my heart, that I have rolled
my self on Christ, and cast all my ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
upon him.</p>
            <p>5. Then as a Tormenter Conscience
is imployed. When Conscience shall
recoil and thus reflect upon a man.
When thou shoulds<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Clozet thou wast here or there in the
Street or in the Field, in the Coffee
House or Taverns; when thou shouldst
have been with God alone, thou hast
been elswhere. Thou couldst lye down

               </gap>


               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:37806:37"/>
much danger in habiting and dressing
our selves as in eating and drinking;
O what if this dress should be a snare,
what if this should occasion the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of Adultery, <hi>He that looks
upon a Woman to lust after her,</hi>
(saith Christ) <hi>hath committed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
with her already in his heart.</hi>
Saith one, There is a fine clear skin,
and so saith a second, and a third; but
do you know what temptation may
lye in a naked skin: the Lord help us
to take heed of it. I would commend
you a little Book, it is but 3 pence
price, it is called <hi>The Hairy Comet,</hi>
very fit for an Hairy Age. This is
indeed an Hairy Age; God deliver
us from False Hearts, for we can see
almost nothing but False Heads every
where. Assure your selves, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will have a bout with men for
this another day.</p>
            <p>Conscience will not let this go
unobserved; Conscience doth write
down this, and will hereafter find a

the Wife will say I must please my
Husband, and the Husband will say I
must please my Wise. But have a care
I beseech you to please Conscience,
that it may not be against you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day. See that Conscience be
for you, and that Conscience may
have no cause to upbraid you, and
torment you another day. Let <hi>Jobs</hi>
care be your care; let not Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
reproach you so long as you
live. I beseech you earnestly, let it
be your great care to have <hi>A Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
void of offence towards God and
towards Man;</hi> towards your selves
and others. And if you so do, you
will have no cause to repent your
being here to hear this Lesson.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THis was <hi>Jobs</hi> Resolution,
why should it not be
ours? Those that have
felt the Reproaches of
Conscience once, would be loth to
feel them a second time. The very
bruit Beasts; when once they have been
either in the mire, or in the fire, will
take heed how they come there again.
You can hardly force them into a Bog
wherein they have been mired, they
will turn this way, and that way, and
run back again upon you, rather then
run into the mire wherein they have
been already. <hi>A wounded Conscience


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37806:39"/>
who can bear?</hi> They that have felt
that wound, and have gotten it heal'd,
will take heed how they make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Proposition I gave you was this;
<hi>It should be our greatest care so to live,
that our Consciences may have no occasion
to accuse or reproach us while we live.</hi>
Some do so live that their neighbours
can have no occasion to reproach
them; some there are that so live,
that the very worst have a good word
for them, I have known some that
have been so unblamable, of such a
sweet disposition, so kind and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to all, and have lived so inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
that the worst have had a good
word for them. But where are they
that have or do carry themselves so,
that their Consciences have no occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to accuse them, or to reproach
them? Commend me to that person
if you can. I have already shewed
you what Conscience is, and about
what it is imployed, and how it is
imployed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:37806:39"/>
I come now to the Proof of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
This was <hi>Jobs</hi> care you see; he
was resolved upon it, that he would
so walk and so watch that Conscience
might have no occasion to reproach
him. And hath <hi>Job</hi> no Fellows?
yes many; the Scripture speaketh of
such as have made it their care so to
walk, that Conscience might have
no just occasion to reproach them.
<hi>David</hi> was one of them, as appears
by what he saith <hi>Ps. 16. 8. Ps. 119.
3,</hi> 112, 113. although there was a
time when he gave Conscience too
great occasion to reproach him, and
his Conscience did reproach him to
purpose at last. Ah poor <hi>David!</hi> what
broken bones had he? This was <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah's</hi>
care, else he could not have had
the testimony of his Conscience for
him as he had. <hi>Remember</hi> (saith he, <hi>Isa.
38. 3.) O Lord, how I have walked before
thee in truth and with a perfect heart,
and have done that which is good in thy
sight.</hi> Perfect heart, that is, an upright


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37806:40"/>
heart; perfection, not of degrees, but of
parts, is there to be understood. There
are many such other places in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as in the Book of <hi>Psalms, Mark
the perfect man, and behold the upright;</hi>
where you find one word to explaine
the other. This also was <hi>Pauls</hi> care,
else could not he have had the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his Conscience as he had.
<hi>This is our rejoycing,</hi> (saith he) <hi>the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of our Conscience, &amp;c. 2 Cor. 1.
12. it was Pauls</hi> exercise, <hi>Acts 24. 16.
And herein do I exercise my self, to have
always a Conscience, void of offence, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God and toward Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="reason">
               <head>Reason I.</head>
               <p>The grounds and Reasons of it
follow. One reason why we should
take all possible care that Conscience
may have no occasion to reproach us
is, because if occasion be given; these
reproaches are unavoidable; I say, these
Reproaches, Vexations, and Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Conscience wil be unavoidable
there is no escaping from them: we


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37806:40"/>
may give occasion to others, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
there may be some avoiding that
which we give occasion of; but here is
no avoiding or escaping in this case.
Conscience may be asleep, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
may say nothing a great while,
but at last it will awake and do it's
office, in accusing and in judging, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
and tormenting. <hi>David</hi>'s
Conscience was asleep for a great
while, but afterwards <hi>Nathan</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to him from the Lord, and rouzeth
Conscience, and then Conscience set
most violently upon him; as appears
by the <hi>Ps.</hi> 51. where he complaineth
of broken bones, and prayeth that the
bones which were broken might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.
So <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren, they
heard nothing of Conscience a great
while, but at last Conscience twinges
them, at last Conscience put out his
envenomed sting; (no such sting as
the sting of Conscience) at last Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
taketh them by the throat,
<hi>Gen. 42. 21. And they said one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37806:41"/>
we are verily guilty concerning
[the Blood of] our Brother, &amp;c.</hi> though
men do with the Harlot for a great
while wipe their mouths, and say,
What evil have we done? As <hi>Joseph</hi>'s
Brethren, they sold their Brother
<hi>Joseph;</hi> Conscience said never a word
to them, let them alone a great while:
they came and told their Father a lie,
and Conscience said never a word to
them, when they told their Father
that <hi>Joseph</hi> was slain; they saw their
Father Mourning as if he were going
down into the Grave, Conscience saith
nothing all the while: a Famine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon the Land, Conscience yet
saith nothing to them: at last they
come down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> there they
meet with hard usage, and are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of imprisonment. Now Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
beginneth to rouze up itself like
a Lyon, to tear and devour; then
they cry out, <hi>Verily we are guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the blood of our Brother.</hi> You
see Conscience had an awakening


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37806:41"/>
time, though it had been asleep; the
Morning came for its awakening. So
<hi>Judas</hi> his Conscience was asleep for a
great while; and one would wonder
that it should ever be so fast asleep as
was. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 15. you may read there
some passages of it. He goeth to the
Chief Priests and maketh a Bargain;
<hi>What will you give me, and I will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Jesus to you? and they covenanted
with him for thirty pieces of Silver:</hi>
there he maketh a bargain for a little
Silver to sell his Lord and Master,
and to betray the innocent blood:
Conscience saith never a word to him.
Further, he sought for opportunity
to betray Christ, yet Conscience saith
nothing to him, v. 21. when he was
come into the presence of his Master,
he came with the Disciples to the
Passover, yet Conscience saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him all the while: when he
was at the Passover and eating,
Christ telleth his Disciples that one of
them should betray him, yet <hi>Judas</hi>'s


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37806:42"/>
Conscience saith never a word to him,
but letteth him alone all this while.
Nay further, when the Disciples at
these words were exceeding sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and began to say every one of
them, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> yet <hi>Judas</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
saith nothing to him. And
Christ said, <hi>He that dippeth his hand
with me in the dish, the same shall betray
me:</hi> yet his Conscience was asleep all
this while. Further, ver. 24. Christ
pronounceth a Wo to that man by
whom he should be betrayed; yet the
denunciation of that Wo did not awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>Judas</hi>'s Conscience; <hi>Wo to him;
it had been good for that man he had
never been born.</hi> It is matter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and amazement, that his
Conscience should be so fast asleep;
the Devil entred into him, and rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Conscience asleep, till he might
be sure to do him mischeif enough;
ver. 25. Then <hi>Judas,</hi> which betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, put the question and said,
<hi>Master, is it I?</hi> Methinks his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37806:42"/>
should have flown in his face like
a Mastiff. Nay further, saith Christ,
<hi>Thou hast said;</hi> thou art the man:
and yet for all this <hi>Judas</hi>'s Conscience
was not awake. This is indeed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of admiration, that a mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
should be so fast asleep. But
how many Instances of such sleepy
Consciences doth this very age afford?
But doth <hi>Judas</hi>'s Conscience sleep al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways?
No. <hi>Then Judas, which betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, when he saw that Jesus was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
he brought again the 30 pieces
of Silver to the Chief Priests and said, I
have sinned, in that I have betrayed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood.</hi> But miserable comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were those Christ-Buyers, they
bought him to be crucified; they did
reply to him when he said, <hi>I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
What is that to us? see thou to that.
And he cast down the thirty pieces of
Silver in the Temple, and went and
hanged himself.</hi> And now his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
was so awake that it would
not suffer him to live. I assure you


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37806:43"/>
howsoever Conscience may be asleep
for a great while, yet the time will
come that Conscience will do it's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and therefore it doth greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
us to take great care that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
may have no occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us. O happy <hi>Judas</hi> if thou
hadst never made a bargain to sell thy
Master, and hadst never sought op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to betray him! O happy,
if thou hadst never accompanyed the
Band of Souldiers, that came to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him! But he came along with
the Band of Souldiers, and gave them
the Sign, <hi>The Man whom I shall kiss
is the Man, hold him fast:</hi> yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
did not reproach him. But
let Men do what they can to stop the
mouth of Conscience, it will speak
at last and they will be biting words.
Carnal Reasonings cannot stop it,
Carnal Pleasures cannot bribe it, nor
any variety of diversions silence it.
<hi>Cain,</hi> you know, he was quiet awhile,
<hi>Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 4. 13. But after a while <hi>Cain</hi>'s


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37806:43"/>
Conscience did reproach him, would
not let him alone. <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> he is

one great reason why we should be

this was occasioned through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches

<hi>Prov. 12. 25. Heaviness in the heart
of a man maketh a man to stoop.</hi> I have
known those that have been bowed

much for the Reasons of the Point: I

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse 1. Of Reproof.</hi> The first Use
shall be for Reproof of those that
take no such care to avoid the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of Conscience, but do that
which will be cast by Conscience as a
Reproach upon them another day.
How do some for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heap up Fuel to keep a Fire
burning within them? No sooner
is some Fuel spent, but there is more
Fuel heapt on again; fresh sins are
committed, and after a while these
sins come to remembrance, and set
the Fire a burning. It may be a man
may weather it out a little, but then
more sins come to light, and that sets
the Fire a burning again, and so there
is no end. Conscience hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
any thing done many years
ago, but remembers it as if it had
been done but yesterday. You that
cannot endure to be reproached, that


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37806:45"/>
cannot endure to hear others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
that cannot bear the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of Men, whenas it may be
they reproach wrongfully; how will
you bear (not the false, but) true
Accusations of Conscience? Men
may reproach falsly, but Conscience
will reproach truly. Men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
thee, and yet thine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
may clear thee when they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
thee; but if Conscience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
thee, then who shall clear
thee? Men may grow weary or
ashamed of reproaching thee, but if
Conscience reproach thee, will that
grow weary or ashamed? No, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
If some men reproach us, others
may clear us; but if Conscience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us, who then can clear us?
This should humble us, that we have
given Conscience occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. If you have
not taken this care to avoid the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of Conscience, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you as it did <hi>David,</hi> whose


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37806:46"/>
Heart smote him after he had num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
the People: and <hi>David</hi> said
unto the Lord, <hi>I have sinned greatly
in that I have done; I beseech thee (O
Lord) to take away the iniquity of thy
servant, for I have done very foolishly.
Davids</hi> Heart smote him, now his
Conscience, now his Conscience,
smites and cuts him to the very
Heart. Though his Conscience were
quiet a great while, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 21, 22.
yet afterwards he thus complains;
<hi>Thus my heart was grieved, and I was
pricked in my reins: so foolish was I
and ignorant; I was as a beast before
thee.</hi> If you neglect Conscience when
it points with the finger, and gives
direction; assure your selves, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
will have a time to smite with
the fift, and to give correction, and
then there will be no enduring of it:
as it was with <hi>David</hi> when his Heart
smote him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 7. If shame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<hi>Davids</hi> Face when men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
him, Oh what shame will


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37806:46"/>
cover our Faces when Conscience
shall reproach us! <hi>Reproach hath
broken my heart,</hi> (saith he) <hi>and I am
full of heaviness. I looked for some to
take pity, but there was none, and for
comforters, but I found none.</hi> Ver. 20.
This will be your case and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
when Conscience shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you. <hi>Reproach hath broken
my heart. They gave me Gall for meat,
and Vinegar to drink;</hi> saith he, Ver.
21. Conscience will give Gall and
Vinegar to us, unless some course be
taken for the quieting of it; if you
make it not your care so to live, that
Conscience may not reproach you.
To be able to say, <hi>For Gods sake I
have born reproach, Psal.</hi> 69. 7. will be
a comfort: but if for our Lusts sake
we bear reproach, what a Torment
will that be? When Conscience shall
say, This is for the sake of that proud
Lust, this is for the sake of that drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Lust, that wanton Lust of thine;
this is for that Passion of thine, that


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37806:47"/>
froward and fretful Spirit of thine:
when Conscience shall say, This is for
the sake of such a Lust which thou
didst indulge, and kept as a sweet
morsel under thy tongue, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the persuasions of all Gods
Ministers to the contrary; how wilt
thou be able to bear it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse 2. Of Exhortation.</hi> Take
care that Conscience may not have
occasion to reproach you while you
live. The Reasons before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
may serve as Motives. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidableness
and intolerableness of
these reproaches of Conscience, these
are Motives enough to engage us to
take all care that Conscience may
not reproach us. Let it be your care
to have <hi>a Conscience void of offence,
(Prov. 15. 15. 2 Cor. 1. 12.)</hi> and then
Conscience instead of accusing will
excuse, instead of condemning it will
acquit you. If you hearken to the
voice of Conscience informed and
guided by the Word of God, it will


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37806:47"/>
be a continual feast unto you, <hi>Prov.
15.</hi> 15. and your daily rejoycing.
<hi>This is our rejoycing,</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
<hi>the testimony of our Conscience
that in simplicity and godly sincerity not
with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of
God, we have had our conversation in
the world.</hi> When a man hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
on his side, this will be a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
in any condition whatsoever,
in a Prison, a Cordial in a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
a Cordial in a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and a Cordial in the worst of
sufferings that we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> meet with.
Keep Conscience void of offence, and
so live that Conscience may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you, and all will be well. How
may we so live, you will say, that
Conscience may not reproach us
while we live? or if we have so lived,
that Conscience hath had cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us, how may we get those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
wiped off, and get Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
quiet again? That I shall reserve
for another opportunity.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>HAving already shewed
you what Conscience is,
and about what it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
and how it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
and given you several reasons
why we should make it our great care
so to live, that Conscience may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us while we live; and having
made some Use of the Doctrine, I now
come to resolve two questions or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>1. The first is, how may we so live,
walk and act, and carry our selves,
that Conscience may have no cause to
reproach us another day?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:37806:49"/>
2. If we have so lived, so walked, so
acted, and so carryed our selves, that
Conscience hath had just cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us, and doth reproach us;
what is to be done, that the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of Conscience may be wiped off,
that Conscience may be quiet, and
cease to accuse and condemn, cease
to vex and torment? These are the
two cases I am to answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Case</hi> 1. How may we so live,
walk, act and carry our selves, that
Conscience may have no cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us? You see that <hi>Job</hi> did so
live and carry himself, that though
his friends did reproach him, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
did not reproach him; though
his friends did charge him, yet his
Conscience did discharge him, though
his friends did condemne him, yet
his Conscience did acquit him. He
did so live, that he was able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Integrity and Uprightness;
and doubtless it is not a thing impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
but we do not set to it, we do


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37806:49"/>
not set about it in earnest. If we be
Christians indeed, and not almost
Christians, we might so live as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
might have no just cause to
reproach us. O Sirs, Relations may
reproach us, Wives may reproach
Husbands, and Husbands reproach
Wives, Children may reproach Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and Servants reproach their
Masters, and one Neighbour reproach
another; but it is possible so to live,
that Conscience all this while may be
at peace, and not reproach us. Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
you may be ready to think and
say within your selves, Would we
could tell how we might so live, pray
let us have some directions how we
may so live that Conscience may not
reproach us. But before I give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
should not I know of you whether
you will follow it? And in case
you will not follow it, why should
I give it? Ask your selves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if the Minister shall give us
no other counsel then what God


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37806:50"/>
himself giveth us, should not I follow
it? Sirs, if I give you any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
then what God in his holy Word
doth give you, I would intreat you
not to follow it; nay, if you set it at
naught I shall not be offended. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what <hi>Jethro</hi> said to <hi>Moses, Exod.
18. 23. If thou shalt do this thing, and
God command thee so;</hi> so say I There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consider whether God say as I
say, whether God command you so; if
so, pray take heed how you do set at
naught the Counsel of God. Now
the first Direction which I shall give
you is this.</p>
            <div n="1" type="direction">
               <head>Direction I.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Set God always before you.</hi> And
this will be a means so to live, that
Conscience may not reproach you.
Assure your selves there is no time
wherein Gods Back is turned, no time
wherein Gods Eye is not upon you:
if you can find a time when God is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
you may take your liberty and
do what you list. You know of what


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37806:50"/>
force the Masters presence is among
the Servants; of what force the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
presence is among the Children
to restrain them; of what force the
presence of a Minister, or a grave, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and holy Christian, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
People from what otherwise
they would take liberty to do: Sure
Gods Presence should be of greater
force to restrain us, if we did but
live in the Apprehension thereof. O
if we could but set God always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, what manner of persons
should we be in all holy Conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
all holy cogitation, and in
all holy communication too! <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
did set God always before him,
and why should not we do so too?
<hi>Psal. 16. 8. I have set the Lord always
before me.</hi> O then it was, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
was a man after Gods own heart;</hi>
then it was that <hi>David</hi> was such a
Praying man, and such a Praising
man, and such an Holy and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, when he did set the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37806:51"/>
before him. You know how
persons will carry themselves in the
sight of Men, if they have any thing
to do in the sight of others, how they
will do it; O that we could do all
we do as in the sight of God. This
was the charge that was given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
by God himself, <hi>Gen. 17. 1.
Walk before me, and be thou perfect;</hi>
that is, upright. There is no such
way to be upright. as to live in the
Apprehension of the Presence of
God, and to have this always run in
our thoughts, <hi>God heareth, God sees,
and God knows.</hi> O that this were
written upon your Desks and Shop
Boards, <hi>God sees;</hi> O that this were
written upon your Tables, <hi>God sees;</hi>
Oh that this were written upon your
Looking Glasses, <hi>God sees;</hi> O that
this were written upon all your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37806:51"/>
too. I do assure you (Sirs)
that God does see you; O that you
would live in the continual Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of it. God sees thee, God
knows what all your thoughts are,
what all your designs are, what all
your sayings and doings are. Be ever
thinking, <hi>God knows, God hears, God
sees. In all thy ways acknowledge
him, and he shall direct thy paths, Prov.

keep Gods Precepts, if in all your
ways you look upon God as your
Observer and Overseer. This was
that which made <hi>David</hi> careful to
observe Gods Precepts, <hi>Psal. 119.
168. I have kept thy precepts and thy

                  </gap>hat you would often and seriously
read and consider these three or four
scriptures; <hi>Job 34. 21, 22. For his

                     </gap> are upon the ways of man, and he

sees all his goings.</hi> There is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or shadow of death, where the
Workers of iniquity may hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
There is no hiding from
God, be sees all our goings; we
cannot set one foot before another
but God sees it. Alas, alas, if a
man do but go out of doors God sees
it, if he goes into the Field God sees
it, if he goes to other Houses God
sees it, if he goes to his own House
God sees it too. <hi>Prov. 15. 3. The
eyes of the Lord are in every place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the evil and the good. Prov.
5. 2. The ways of man are before the
eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all
his goings.</hi> I desire you once a week
to read over the former part of the
139 <hi>Psalm;</hi> if I should desire you to
read it once a day, it would not be
lost labour. You will see there is
no going out of the sight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God. Verily (Sirs) to set
God always before us, and to live in
the Sight and Apprehension of the


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37806:52"/>
Presence of God, this would have
such an influence upon our Thoughts,
Words, and Works, that it would
make them pleasing to God; and if
so, Conscience would never reproach
us for them; for Conscience will not
reproach us for doing that which is
pleasing to God. Thus much for the

If you would not have Conscience to

Gods Glory as the end of all that you

God be Glorified by this? When you

our Age. Alas, what Inventions
have we to draw Eyes, both behind
and before, to this part of the Body,
and to the other part of the Body?
The Lord be merciful to us, is this

of Lying for advantage; take heed

Kernel of the Grape? No. <hi>Num. 6.
4. This is the Law of the Nazarite,
All the days of his Separation he shall
eat nothing that is made of the Vine

under a temptation to drink Wine,
he must not meddle with any thing
coming of the Vine, not the very
Husk or the Kernel, lest he be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared.
Our first Mother <hi>Eve</hi> was
drawn to Eating by Seeing: O take
heed of Temptations and Snares, and
be not a Snare or Temptation unto
others; but make Conscience of all
sin, whether great or small. Nay
further, if there be any question or
doubt about any thing, whether it be
a sin or no, what shall we do then?
Some say it is a sin, and some say it
is not a sin; and possibly some good
men may say it is not a sin, and some
good men may say it is a sin; what
shall we do in such a doubtful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
I shall quickly resolve you;
Take the surest side. In such a case
when the matter is doubtful, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
way now is not to make or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
at all with it.</p>
               <p>Was there not Meat enough for
them to eat in the Primitive Times,


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37806:60"/>
besides that which did give offence?
Some doubt whether it was lawful to
eat of this or that meat; what need
we eat of it? <hi>Paul</hi> saith in such a case<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>I will never eat flesh while the world
standeth, rather than offend a weak
brother.</hi> It is not lawful, saith one;
I will do it for all that, saith another.
They are not of <hi>Pauls</hi> Spirit. And
as for Dresses and Habits, are there
not enough besides those which are
questionable, and which both Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and Modern Divines have all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as sinful? Possibly some
will assume a greater Liberty, and
we are now generally grown to a
greater Latitude; but tell me, Is
there not enough of other sorts, but
we must use such Habits and Dresses
as are doubtful, questionable, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive?
God help us to consider
of it. In all matters doubtful and
questionable, still take the surest side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If you do that which is questionable
and doubtful, you may sin, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37806:60"/>
it may be found to be a sin at the
Day of Judgment; and if so, what
will you do then? It was the speech
of Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> concerning Long Hair;
<hi>You say the wearing of Long Hair is
not a sin, but what if it be found at the
Day of Judgment to be a sin? You will
then wish, O that I had left it off, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
used it.</hi> Men are not infallible,
Ministers are not infallible, no not
the best of them; you are not to
ground on them as if they could not
be mistaken; therefore in all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
cases chuse the surest side. There
is Meat enough to eat besides that
which is doubtful; and there is Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
enough to wear besides that
which is offensive and questionable.
If you would so live that Conscience
may have no cause to reproach you,
my Counsel to you is, Take always
in doubtful matters the surest side,
which is not to meddle or make with
it at all; for if you do it you may
sin, and at Judgment it may be found

to be sin. But if you do it not, you
are safe and free.</p>

attiring your selves, and habiting
your selves in the way and manner
that you do? can you pray, O Lord,
let this way of habiting and dressing
my self be for thy Glory, and for my
Good, and for the example of others?
Dare any of you go and make a
prayer to God foe this? Adventure
not upon any thing upon which you
dare not pray for a Blessing.</p>

            <div type="case">
               <head>Case II.</head>
               <p>I come now to speak a little to the
second case. What if we have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
these rules and directions
which have been laid before us. If you
have neglected to walk according to
rule, and have given Conscience just
cause to reproach you; and if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
does reproach you, and if you
ask me, How may we get the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of Conscience wiped off,
and get Conscience quiet again? I
answer in two words, <hi>Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Repent of that before the Lord
which Conscience reproacheth you
for, mourn for it, be ashamed of it,
judge and condemne your selves for


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37806:64"/>
what is past, resolve against it for
the time to come; this is a good
course<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>If we confess our sins, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and just to forgive us our sins, and
cleanse us from all unrighteousness,
1 Cor. 11. 31. For if we would judge
our selves, we should not be judged;</hi> and
if we acknowledg our transgressions,
and accept of the punishment of our
iniquity. Read <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 40, 41, 42.
There is not a better way to wipe off

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he reproaches of Conscience, then by
the tears of repentance. Follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of that Woman that came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
our Lord and Saviour, <hi>and washed
his feet with her tears, and wiped them
with the haires of her head.</hi> A service
perhaps that you would be loath to
put your hair to; but, Sirs, if you
would have Conscience to be quiet,
then seriously set upon the work of
Repentance.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Believe.</hi> By Faith set Christs
Blood on work, to wipe off the asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and reproaches of Conscience,


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37806:64"/>
to purifie and pacifie Conscience, get
Conscience sprinkled with the Blood
of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. You read of one
<hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 28. that set the Pity and
Power of Christ on work to make her
Daughter whole. <hi>Jesus answered
and said unto her, O Woman, great is
thy Faith! Be it to thee even as thou
wilt.</hi> Christ seemed not to regard
her a while, but she followed him, and
set his Pity and Power on work.
Faith will set the Blood of Christ on
work, to wipe of the reproaches of
Conscience. The <hi>Centurions</hi> Faith set
Christ on work to heal his Servant,
<hi>Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>my Servant lyeth at
home sick of the Palsie grievously tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
And Jesus saith unto him, I
will come and heal him. The Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
answered and said, Lord I am not
worthy that thou shouldst come under
my Roof, but speak the word onely, and
my Servant shall be healed. And Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
said unto the Centurion, Go thy way,
and as thou hast believed so be it done


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37806:65"/>
unto thee. And his Servant was heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the self same hour Mat.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>The Lepers Faith did set Christ on
work <hi>Mat. 8. 2, 3. And there came
a Leper and worshipped him, saying,
Lord, if thou wilt thou canst make me
clean. And Jesus put forth his hand
and touched him, saying, I will, be thou
clean: and immediately his Leprosie was
cleansed.</hi> The Father of the Child
that had a deaf and a dumb Spirit, his
Faith set Christ on work, <hi>Mark 9. 23,
24, 25. Jesus saith unto him, If thou
canst believe, all things are possible to
him that believeth. And straight way
the Father of the Child cryed out with
teares, Lord, I believe, help thou my
unbelief.</hi> The Faith of the Woman
diseased with an Issue of Blood set
Christ on work, <hi>Mat. 9. 21. For she
said within her self, If I may but touch
the Hem of his Garment I shall be
whole.</hi> And it followes, <hi>the Woman
was made whole from that hour.</hi> The
Faith of the poor Leper set Christ or


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37806:65"/>
work, <hi>Luke 17. 19. And Jesus said
unto him, Thy faith hath made thee
whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And likewise the Womans Faith
(<hi>Luke</hi> 7. 48.) set Christ on work for
the pardon of her sins; he said unto
her, <hi>Thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi> And
(ver. 50.) Christ tells her, <hi>Thy faith
hath saved thee, go in peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And likewise the Faith of blind
<hi>Bartimeus (Mar. 10. 51, 52.)</hi> sets
Christs Power and Pity on work, and
obtained Healing. And the Faith of
the two blind men in <hi>Matth. 9. 27, 28,
29,</hi> 30. Christ touched their eyes and
said, <hi>According to your faith, so be it
unto you.</hi> And their Eyes were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>O if you could but (according to
these Examples) set Faith on work
for the healing of your Souls, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
would be quiet. Thus bespeak
and expostulate with thine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and say, It is true (Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
I have sinned, and deserved to


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37806:66"/>
be reproached and condemned, but I
fly to the Bloud of Christ for clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and I apply that by Faith. Nay
(saith Conscience) if thou fly to that
City of Refuge, I can then no longer
pursue after thee; thou art safe
enough from me. If thou makest the
Bloud of Christ thy Refuge, thou art
then secured from all the Storms, and
Terrors, and Reproaches of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
If you would not have Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upbraid you, accuse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
you, set about the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Faith, and then whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
cause you have given Conscience
to reproach you, it will reproach you
no more, it will be quiet and at peace
with you; always provided that you
set about this work of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
seriously and in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.
Consider what hath been said,
and the Lord give you understanding
in all things.</p>
