            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> undertook to recount the Famous Men of Old, and record their Worth and Renown, he says of them, <hi>That they were Men of Knowledge, Wise and Eloquent in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, that of these there are, who have left behind them a Name beloved of God and good Men, whose Memorials are Blessed; honoured in their Generation, being the Glory of their times, whose Righteousness, shall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and although their Bodies be buried, yet their Names shall live for Ever.</hi> And as in the former, so likewise in these latter Days, there have been many Men of excellent Endowments, for Wisdom and Learning, for Piety and all other eminent Vertues, whose Memorials are with us in Church and State. Among these of the first Rank, this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Primate, <hi>James Usher,</hi> (whose Life we are about to relate) ought to be reckoned, whether we consider him, as he was indeed, a profound Scholar, exactly skilled in all sorts of Learning, Divine and Humane, or as a Person of unfeigned Piety, and exemplary Vertue and Conversation, or as a Subject of steady and unmoveable Loyalty to his Sovereign Prince, or as a Clergy Man in all his Capacity, from a Presbyter to a Bishop and Primate. So that I think of him, it may be as truly said, as of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> with a kind of Admiration, <hi>O Virum, ad totius Ecclesiae publicam utilitatem, natum, factum, datúmque divinitùs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Character his Writings have justly purchased him among the best and most Learned, whether of these or other Nations, whose Encomiums of him are too many and large for this Place, let me therefore include all, in that of a memorable <note n="*" place="margin">William Juxon <hi>Bishop of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>and Lord High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer in a Letter.</hi> Anno 1639.</note> Bishop of our Church, who upon the Receipt of the Primates  Book <hi>de Primordiis,</hi> thus writes of him; <hi>I may truly say, that the Church hereafter will owe as much Reverence to his Memory, as we of this present Age, ought to pay to his Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore when we have before us a subject of so Eminent Dignity, we shall no need Apology for reviving the Memory of this incomparable <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> and collecting such materials from his Life, his Papers, and the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Wise and Knowing Men, as may render him, as well useful to future Ages in his Example, as a Person truly Illustrious in himself.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> But perhaps it may be a needless attempt to write again the Life and Actions of this incomparable Primate, seeing it hath been performed already by several Persons.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:60492:4"/>
               <hi>2.</hi> And likewise it may be demanded, how it comes to my share, and what were the enducements to undertake this Province</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> To the first I say, that though Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> in the Sermon be Preached at the Funerals of the Lord Primate, hath said many worthy things of him truly, which we have reason to believe (having the joynt Testimonies from Persons of Worth and unquestionable Credit, who had been acquainted with this great and good Man for many years both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland)</hi> and must go along with the Dr. a good way in reciting many material passages, contained in the said Sermon; yet I take leave to say, that he hath omitted very many remarkable things, which perhaps either slipt his Memory, or came not at all under his observation; or because that those then in Power, would not indure that any thing should be said of the Primate, which might reflect upon that Usurpation. Therefore we thought it needful to make up those defects, by adding such Remarks as are wanting in that Description, and likewise to rectifie the mistakes of those Writers of the Lord Primates Life, who Writing after Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Copy, are deficient also in their Accounts and lyable to Question in some instances.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> If it be demanded how it comes to my share, to revive the Memory of this great Man, and to undertake the Task.</p>
            <p>To this I say, that I waited and heartily wished to see, if any Person better Qualified than my self (being sensible of my own weakness) would engage himself in this Affair, to whom I would most readily have Communicated those Materials and Observations, which I had gathered together and lay by me for a long time: but at length perceiving it not likely to be undertaken, I was perswaded by those who have a prevailing Power with me, to take upon me this Task, and to acquaint the World with my own Observations, touching this most Reverend Primate <hi>Usher,</hi> whom I had the Advantage of any Man now living to know, for I had the Blessing of an intimate Acquaintance with his Person and Affairs, by my Attendance on him, during the last thirteen years of his Life. So that I may be thought capable to give a considerable Account, not only of the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> particular Disposition and heavenly Conversation, but likewise of those Passages and Performances of which I was an Eye Witness, and may confidently relate upon mine own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. This is the thing I undertake to perform, especially in that part of the History of his Life and Actions, from the year <hi>1642,</hi> to the time of his Death <hi>1655.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not withstanding my long experience of this excellent Person, and what I had collected from several passages in Letters, and by conference with those who made Observations; yet I had not the confidence to attempt this work by my own strength or skill, without Counsel and Help, therefore when I had drawn together the <hi>Memorials,</hi> I consulted with Persons of better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standign than my self, with request to correct and amend what was misplaced or not well expressed, and to remind me of any remarkable passage that had escaped my Memory. And the assistance I had in this kind, was administred by that Learned and Judicious Gentleman <hi>James Tyrrell</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> Grandson to
<pb facs="tcp:60492:4"/>
the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> one as deeply concerned for the honour of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father as can be; he became helpful to me in hinting many passages touching his Grandfather, which he (tho then young) had himself observed, and had heard from Persons of great Worth and Credit, and of the <hi>Primates</hi> familiar Acquaintance. We also owe unto him the account given of the Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> Printed Works, both of the time and occasion of Writing them, and subject matter treated on, as the Reader will perceive in the following History in their proper places.</p>
            <p>In the next place it is requisite to mind the Reader touching the following Collection of <hi>Letters</hi> herewith published, being for the most part Originals, written by the Lord Primate to learned Men of our own and foreign Nations, or of those written to him, relating mostly to matters of Learning. These <hi>Epistles</hi> I gathered together with what care I could, and when I had selected those out of a far greater number, that I thought might prove most fit for publick view, and useful both in respect of the Learning contained in them, and the various subjects whereof they consisted, I would not presume to publish the Collection, until they had passed the Inspection and Censure of those Learned Men, to whom they were first shown, being Persons of great Judgment and Integrity, and who retain a very high Esteem and Veneration for the <hi>Primate's</hi> Memory.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the <hi>Reader</hi> will expect to meet with, if not all, yet many more of the <hi>Primate's Letters,</hi> in this Collection than may be found; but by all our Industry and search they cannot yet be retrieved, partly because the <hi>Primate</hi> himself seldom kept Copies of his <hi>Lettes,</hi> and many of those he had reserved met with the same fate which many others of his loose Papers and Manuscripts, which were either lost in his often forced removals, or fell into the hands of the Men of those spoiling times, who had no regard to things of that Nature.</p>
            <p>There are other <hi>Epistles,</hi> not numbred with the former, at the end of this Collection, written by Men of great Names, found among my Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's</hi> Papers, which are thought worthy to be inserted and Printed.</p>
            <p>Before I dismiss the <hi>Reader,</hi> I have one thing more to advertise, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two <hi>Letters</hi> in the Collection, one written by Dr. <hi>Bedell,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Kilmore</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Primate <hi>Usher,</hi> then Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and his answer to it, (as you will find Numb. <hi>142.</hi> and <hi>143.)</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting an accidental difference between those two Eminent Bishops, and most intire Friends, touching the Administration and Jurisdiction in <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Courts,</hi> as then exercised in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which <hi>Letters</hi> however otherwise Worthy of perusal, yet are now more especially published for the doing right to the Arch-Bishops Character, which might else have suffered by some injurious Reflections upon him, in the Life of that Bishop lately Written, taken up partly from some uncertain Reports, and partly upon the Bishops Letter to him upon that occasion. But how little Reason there was to say the <hi>Primate</hi> was not made for the Governing part of his Function, (as that Author affirms) besides his known abilities that way, his Answer
<pb facs="tcp:60492:5"/>
to the Bishops Letter, and other Composures of his upon those kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will sufficiently testifie. Of which inadvertency as the Composer of that Life is already made sensible, so we hope that he will do him Right, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he hath promised, when time shall serve.</p>
            <p>The order observed in disposing these <hi>Letters</hi> in the following Volume, is according to their several Dates, that being concluded fittest beth for the use and delight of the <hi>Reader,</hi> only some of them through mistake, are transposed, and others that were brought in late, are Printed at the latter end, of which the <hi>Reader</hi> may consult the Advertisment at the end of the Book.</p>

                  <head>THE LIFE OF The Most Reverend Father in God, JAMES USHER, SOMETIME <hi>Arch-Bishop of Armagh.</hi> PRIMATE of all IRELAND.</head>
                  <p>THIS great Person, whose Life we now write, was Born in the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> upon the fourth day of <hi>January, Anno Domini</hi> 1580. His Father, Mr. <hi>Arnold Usher,</hi> one of the Six Clerks of Chancery, (and of good repute for his prudence and integrity) was of the Ancient Family of the <hi>Ushers, aliàs Nevils,</hi> whose Ancestor (Usher to King <hi>John)</hi> coming over with him into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and setling there, changed the name of his Family into that of his Office, (as was usual in that Age) his descendants having since brancht into several Families about <hi>Dublin,</hi> and for divers Ages bore the most considerable Offices in, and about that City. His Mother was <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter of <hi>James Stanihurst,</hi> who was of considerable note in his time, being chosen Speaker of the Honourable House of Commons in three Parliaments, and was <hi>Recorder</hi> of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and one of the <hi>Mastres</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> and (that which ought always to be mention'd for his honour) he was the first mover, in the last of the three Parliaments, of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for the Founding and Endowing of a Colledge and University at <hi>Dublin,</hi> which was soon after consented to by Her Majesty; and, being perfected, hath ever since continued a famous Nursery for learning and good manners; blessing both the Church and State with many admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men, eminently useful in their several Stations. His Uncle, by the Fathers side, was <hi>Henry Usher,</hi> (sometime Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh)</hi> a wise and learned <hi>Prelate;</hi> one who industriously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60492:7"/>
the founding of that <hi>University,</hi> and by his Zeal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest procured of the said Queen an established Revenue for the maintainance of a Provost and Fellows, Students, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as may be seen by the <hi>Charter</hi> and Statutes of that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and so it has flourished ever since with ample improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: A happy Foundation and great honour to that Kingdom, having (in the space of somewhat more than 90 years) sent out divers Persons very considerable both in Church and State; and yielded more than fifty Bishops, besides others of inferiour Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, who were many of them of great parts, and excellent learning. His Uncle, by the Mother side, was <hi>Richard Stanihurst,</hi> a Learned man, (of the <hi>Romish</hi> Perswasion) an excellent Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Philosopher and Poet, as appears by several of his Works still extant, though some of them (for that reason written) against his Nephew; yet notwithstanding their difference in Judgment, they had frequent correspondencies by Letters, some of which you will see hereafter in this following Collection. He often mentioned two of his Aunts, who were blind from their Cradle, and so continued to their deaths, and yet were blessed with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable understanding, and inspection in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> and of such tenacious Memories, that whatever they heard read out of the Scriptures, or was preached to them, they always retained, and became such proficients, that they were able to repeat much of the <hi>Bible</hi> by heart, and (as their Nephew told me) were the first that taught him to read <hi>English.</hi> He had but one Brother, <hi>Ambrose Usher;</hi> who though he died young, yet attained to great skill and perfection in the <hi>Oriental</hi> Tongues, and did render much of the Old Testament from the Original <hi>Hebrew</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> before King <hi>James</hi>'s Translation was made, which I have seen, and is now in Manuscript with his Nephew Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> Knight, one of his Majesties Privy-Council in <hi>Ireland.</hi> He also Translated out of <hi>Latin</hi> into <hi>English,</hi> that Book written by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>James Usher, De Ecclesiarum Christianarum successione &amp; statu;</hi> which Translation is yet only in Manuscript. And of this <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> being a very young man, the Learned Mr. <hi>William Eyre</hi> in a Letter to Dr. <hi>James Usher,</hi> writes thus, <hi>Interea vero agnosco me valde obaeratum esse tibi, &amp; doctissimo juveni, fratri tuo</hi> Ambrosio, <hi>qui peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissima manu sua quaedam in meum usum ex Alcorano Arabice excripsit;</hi> which knowledge in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue in those days was very rare, especially in that <hi>Country:</hi> But our <hi>James Usher,</hi> as God had furnisht him with excellent endowments of Nature, a treatable Disposition, a strong Memory, and a ready Invention; so by God's blessing, on his improvement of them, by his Learning and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, he arrived to that admirable perfection, that gave him a reputation superiour to all that he could derive from his Family;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60492:7"/>
and rendred his name famous beyond the narrow bounds of his own Country, even throughout the Christian World, wherever true Piety and useful Learning were had in any esteem and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>After he had learnt to read from his Aunts, he entered on the Bible <hi>(that Book of Books, as he ever called it)</hi> in which he made a happy beginning, and a more happy progress (like <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> of whom it is recorded, <hi>That from a Child he had known the Holy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Scriptures, which are able to make a man wise to Salvation.)</hi> According to which excellent Rule he always governed his life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. He began early to have a deep sense of Religion, and to consider the great concernment of his Soul, how he might serve God aright, <hi>Remembring his Creator in the days of his Youth,</hi> even, but in the tenth year of his Age: When he became fit for a Grammar-School, it happened that two eminent Persons of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation (though their business and quality were then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known) came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> being sent over thither by King <hi>James</hi> (then King of <hi>Scotland)</hi> to keep a correspondence with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Protestant Nobility, and Gentry about <hi>Dublin,</hi> in order to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his interest in that Kingdom, when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should happen to die; these for a colour undertook the imployment of School-Masters, to instruct and discipline Youth in Learning and good Education (for the want of such was very great there at that time). The one was <hi>James Fullerton;</hi> (afterward Knighted, and of the Bed-chamber to King <hi>James,)</hi> the other was <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> (afterward also Knighted and created by the King Viscount <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debois.)</hi> To their Instruction and Tuition was our <hi>James Usher</hi> committed by his Parents, with whom he made so great a profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in a short time, that he became the best Scholar of the School for Latin, Poetry and Rhetorick, (all this being within the space of five years.) He would usually say, when he recounted the Providences of God towards him, That he took this for one remarkable instance of it, <hi>That he had the opportunity and advantage of his Education from those men, who came thither by Chance, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so happily useful to himself and others.</hi> He told me, That in this first Scene of his life he was extreamly addicted to Poetry, and was much delighted with it, but afterward growing to more maturity and consideration, he shook it off, as not suitable to the great end of his more resolved, serious and profitable Studies, and then set himself industriously to pursue Learning of a higher Nature: Yet he always loved a good Poem that was well and chastly writ: And lighting once upon a passage in <hi>Tully, (viz.) Nescire quid antea quam natus sis acciderit, id est, semper esse Puerum;</hi> and also read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sleidan</hi>'s History of the four Empires, he presently resolved on the study and search of Antiquity, and all sorts of Learning, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60492:8"/>
how he might contribute to the advancement thereof: this was a brave, and a manly attempt for a Lad, but of 12 or 13 years of age; yet as he attempted, so he conquered all the difficulties which he met with in the search after, and bringing to light those many things, which ignorance had corrupted, and time well-nigh buried in oblivion; especially in a Country where there was then so great a scarcity of good Books, and learned Men. I mention these things so much above his years, for a remembrance of God's spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence over this Person, in endowing him with such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable gifts of Nature, to dispose him so vigorously to Learning, and to fit and qualifie him for such highly serviceable Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; so that he seem'd designed by God, by his Doctrine, and Example to teach men how to live, and by his deep Learning, and strong Reason to confute the clamorous Cavils of the greatest adversaries of our Religion.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1593</label> In the year 1593 was <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Dublin</hi> finished, and <hi>James Usher</hi> then in the thirteenth year of his age adjudged by his School-Masters sufficiently qualified for an admittance into that University, and so was entered accordingly. Dr. <hi>Loftus</hi> (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Fellow of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge)</hi> afterwards Arch-Bishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> being the first Provost of that College, and Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> (one of this our <hi>Usher</hi>'s School-Masters, and Senior Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) was Tutor to this early ripe Youth; whose name (as the first Scholar there) stands to this day in the first line of the Roll: not without a future presage, that he might prove an honour and ornament to that Colledge and Nation, as he afterwards did. And being thus fixed, he sets himself in good earnest to the study of the Languages and Liberal Arts, not neglecting Ecclesiastical History and Antiquity, in all which he improved to admiration; for between fifteen and sixteen years of age he had made such a proficiency in Chronology, that he had drawn up in <hi>Latin</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Chronicle of the Bible, as far as the book of Kings, not much differing from the method of his late <hi>Annals,</hi> excepting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements in some more accurate Observations and Synchronisms of Heathen Stories: Sometime after this (before he was Batchelor of Arts) he had read <hi>Stapleton</hi>'s Fortress of the Faith, and finding his confidence in asserting Antiquity for the Tenents of Popery, and taxing of our Church with Novelty, in what it dissented from theirs, he was in a great dispute with himself where the truth lay, not then knowing but that those quotations, he made use of, might be true: but this he took for an undeniable truth, That the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientest must needs be the right, as the nearer the Fountain the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Streams, and that Errours sprang up as the Ages succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; according to that known Speech of <hi>Tertullian, Verum quodcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que primum, adulterum quodcunque posterius:</hi> He suspected that <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60492:8"/>
might misquote the Fathers, or wrest them to his own sense; which made him take up a firm resolution, That in due time (if God gave him life) he would himself read the Fathers all over, and trust none but his own Eyes in the search of them; and this was the occasion of his undertaking that great work, which he (afterwards) began at twenty years of age, and finished at thirty eight; strictly observing to read such a proportion each day, from which no occasions whatsoever should divert him; the fruits of which labour, as the World hath already tasted in his learned Writings, so had he lived to finish that great work of his <hi>Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca Theologica,</hi> which he intended as the sum of all his Studies on that important subject, whereof we shall give you a further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count hereafter; yet before he was Master of Arts he had read here and there divers Books of the Fathers, and most of our best Authors, who had writ in confutation of the Errors of the Papists, with many of their Writers also; by which he had so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted himself with the state of each Controversie, that he was able to dispute with any of the Popish Priests, as he often did with the chiefest of them.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1598</label> The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> being newly come over Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Chancellor of the university of <hi>Dublin,</hi> there was a solemn Act for his entertainment: Our <hi>Usher</hi> being then Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Arts, answered the Philosophy Act, with great approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But while he was busily imploying himself in these studies and great designs, to fit himself for the Divine Calling of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, (when he should be qualified for so high and great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment) his Father recommended to him the study of the Common Law (designing to send him shortly over to the Inns of Court in <hi>England,)</hi> but to this his Son was very averse, it no ways suiting with his natural Temper and Complexion; yet duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully would have submitted, if his Father could not be brought to alter his mind in that matter: But soon after he died, and the paternal Estate descended to this his eldest Son, being of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable value; but this young Heir was so far from being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by such an accession of Fortune, that it did not in the least shake him from his design; for he finding it somewhat incumbred with Law Suits, and Sisters Portions, and fearing those might prove an hinderance to the course of his Studies (which he still resolved to pursue) he chose rather to commit himself to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God anew, and so very frankly gave his Inheritance to his Brother, and his several Sisters for their Portions; only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving so much of it as might enable him to buy some Books, and afford him a competent maintenance in the College. This act of his perhaps by some may be censured for indiscretion; yet so much may be allowed him in his vindication, that it shews
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60492:9"/>
how little he valued Earthly things, in comparison of true Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Learning: And besides, to let you see that he very well understood what he did in this matter, There is to be seen an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Terrier of his own hand writing, of all the Estate and Leases left him by his Father: And that it might not be thought he did any thing rashly, and with precipitation, he drew up an exact state of all the Suits and Incumbrances that lay upon it, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections what to do in them, which he committed to his Uncle (as Guardian for his Brother and Sisters) to be managed for their advantage, which he so well performed, that most of his Sisters (being seven in all) were afterwards very well married, and some of them to Persons that proved eminently considerable both in Church and State.</p>
                  <p>And now being setled in the Colledge, and freed of his worldly cares, and left to his own choice, he devotes himself entirely to the pursuit of all literature both Humane and Divine; for the service of God's Church, and the good of Mankind, (which he chiefly aimed at next the Salvation of his own Soul:) and in these noble subjects he constantly exercised himself; and did so much increase in all sorts of knowledge, that his Fame (thô he sought it not) went abroad, and he soon became an Example of Piety, Modesty and Learning: But that which administred greatest cause of admiration, was, That so much fruit should be found upon a Plant but newly set, and scarcely ripe for blossoms; so that in this short space (from the thirteenth year of his age to the twentieth) he gave most ample proofs of his learning and abilities in all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Exercises which he performed.</p>
                  <p>About the eighteenth or nineteenth year of his age, he being but Batchelor of Arts, was thought the fittest person to enter the lists of disputation with a daring and learned Jesuite, one <hi>Henry Fitz-Symonds,</hi> then prisoner in the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who sent out a challenge <hi>Defying the greatest Champion, and best Learned to dispute with him about those points</hi> in controversie between the Roman, and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches: Our <hi>Usher</hi> accepts the challenge, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they met; the <hi>Jesuite</hi> made slight of him at first, as but a boy, and thinking it an easie task to baffle him, the Priest admits a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Disputation, (the subject of which was <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies) and because the several matters in debate could not be dispatched at one or two meetings, they appointed to meet once a week to argue the chief Points in Controversie: But it seems that after one or two Conferences the <hi>Jesuite</hi> had enough of it; for though he despised him at first, yet he did not care to have any more to do with him; for, after the second Conference, this boasting <hi>Goliah</hi> declined the Combate with this stripling; and not without cause, for he had felt the quickness of his Wit, the strength
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60492:9"/>
of his Arguments, and skill in Disputation; so that this <hi>Jesuite</hi> quickly left the Field, as will appear by this modest Letter which Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> then writ to him.</p>

                        <p>I <hi>Was not purposed (Mr.</hi> Fitz-Symonds) <hi>to write unto you, before you had first written to me, concerning some chief points of your Religion, (as at our last meeting you promised) but seeing you have deferred the same (for reasons best known to your self) I thought it not amiss to enquire further of your mind, concerning the continuation of the Conference began betwixt us. And to this I am the rather moved, because I am credibly informed of certain reports, which I could hardly be perswaded, should proceed from him, who in my presence pretended so great love and affection unto me. If I am a boy (as it hath pleased you very contemptuously to name me) I give thanks to the Lord, that my carriage toward you hath been such, as could minister unto you no just occasion to despise my Youth; your Spear belike is in your own conceit a Weavers Beam, and your abilities such, that you desire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the stoutest Champion in the Host of</hi> Israel, <hi>and therefore (like the</hi> Philistine) <hi>you contemn me as being a boy; yet this I would fain have you know, that I neither came then, nor now do come unto you in any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of any Learning that is in me, (in which respect, notwithstanding, I thank God I am what I am) but I come in the Name of the Lord of Hosts (whose Companies you have reproached, being certainly perswaded, that even out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings he was able to shew forth his own Praises; for the further manifestation whereof, I do again earnestly request you, that (setting aside all vain comparisons of Persons) we may go plainly forward, in examining the matters that rest in controversie between us; otherwise I hope you will not be displeased, if as for your part you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; so I also for my own part may be bold, for the clearing of my self, and the truth which I profess, freely to make known, what hath already passed concerning this matter: Thus intreating you in a few lines, to make known unto me your purpose in this behalf, I end, praying the Lord, that both this, and all other enterprises that we take in hand, may be so ordered, as may most make for the advancement of his own Glory, and the Kingdom of his Son, Jesus Christ.</hi>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1600.] Being now twenty years old, and having lived in the Colledge seven years from his first admission, he took the degree of Master of Arts; and the same year he was chosen Catechist Reader in the Colledge; in which office and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment he treated of the pure Principles of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in Faith and Practice, as professed and maintained by the Reformed Churches, in opposition to the Errors and Innovations, which had mixed themselves with Primitive Christianity; and sifting the Wheat from the Tares, He did so learnedly and plainly discharge that Exercise to the satisfaction of his then Auditors, that he was much importuned to appear, and Preach in publick, which was (as himself then thought) very much above his years to enter on so weighty a charge. But not being able to withstand the importunity of his Friends, and the commands of Superiors, he yielded, though with some reluctance; so that being thought fit for the Ministry in the twenty first year of his age, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Ordained Deacon and Priest, by his Uncle <hi>Henry Usher,</hi> then Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> with the assistance of others of the Clergy, <hi>Anno</hi> 1601, which though uncanonical, yet his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary merit, and the necessity which the Church then had of such a Labourer, rendred a dispensation in that case very tolerable, if not necessary. And being not long after appointed to Preach constantly before the State, at <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> on Sundays in the afternoon, he made it his business to treat of the chief points in controversie between the Romish Church, and Ours: In which Discourses he was so clear, powerful, and convincing, that he thereby setled many that were wavering, and converted divers from that Superstitious perswasion to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And now this young, but grave Divine applies himself to the study of gaining Souls, as the main end, and design of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and this he continued through the whole course of his life, and was exceeding successful in it. The first Text he preached on Publickly before the State, presently after his Ordination, was <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead;</hi> which fell out to be the day of the Battle of <hi>Kinsale,</hi> and was especially set apart to pray for the good success of that Engagement, which God was pleased to answer with a noble Victory.</p>
                  <p>And it must be here remembred, That in the year 1601, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists, many of them in, and about <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60492:10"/>
some other parts of the Kingdom, had seemingly submitted to the Laws; and came frequently to our Churches; yet there were still very many of the <hi>Irish</hi> that kept their distance from the <hi>English,</hi> and stuck to their old Principles, and earnestly solicited for a Toleration (or at least a Connivance) to use their own way of Worship; which this zealous Divine believed to be Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Idolatrous. And fearing lest a Connivance might be granted to them, and so a lukewarm indifferency to Religion might seize on the Protestants themselves. This pious young man was deeply touched with the sense of the evil of such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and dangerous Consequence of allowing liberty to that sort of People, to exercise a Religion so contrary to the truth; and fearing that the introducing of that Religion tended to the disturbance of the Government in Church and State; on which occasion this newly Ordained Servant of God then Preached a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable Sermon before the same Audience on a great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and did not dissemble, but freely gave his Opinion in reference to a Toleration: And this he did, from that of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision, concerning the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and that Nation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>And thou shalt bear the iniquity of the House of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.</hi> He made then this his conjecture in reference to <hi>Ireland (viz.)</hi> From this year I reckon forty years, and then those whom you now imbrace shall be your ruine, and you shall bear their iniquity. This then uttered by him in his Sermon, seemed only to be the present thoughts of a young man, who was no friend to Popery; but afterwards when it came to pass at the expiration of forty years (that is from 1601. to 1641.) when the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion broke out, and that they had murthered and slain so many thousands of Protestants, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassed the whole Nation by a bloody War, then those, who lived to see that day, began to think he was a young Prophet.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1603</label> Neither must it be forgotten, that after the <hi>English</hi> Forces had beaten, and driven out the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who then came to the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Irish</hi> at <hi>Kinsale,</hi> that Army resolved to do some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy act, that might be a lasting memorial of the gallantry of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary men; and that due respect which they had for true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Learning. To promote which, they raised among themselves the Sum of 1800 <hi>l.</hi> to buy Books to furnish the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary of the University of <hi>Dublin.</hi> And when the Sum was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it was resolved by the Benefactors, That Dr. <hi>Challoner,</hi> and Mr. <hi>James Usher</hi> should have the said 1800 <hi>l.</hi> paid into their hands to procure such Books, as they should judge most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the Library, and most useful, for advancement of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which they accordingly undertook; and coming into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for that purpose; where, as also from beyond Sea they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

the best Books in all kinds, which were then to be had: So that they most faithfully discharged that great trust, to the Donors and the whole Colledges great satisfaction. And it is somewhat remarkable, that at this time, when the said Persons were at <hi>London</hi> about laying out this money in Books, they then met Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley</hi> there, buying Books for his new erected Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> so that there began a correspondence between them upon this occasion, helping each other to procure the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest and best Books on several subjects that could be gotten; so that the famous <hi>Bodleyan</hi> Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that of <hi>Dublin,</hi> began together.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Chancellorship of St. <hi>Patrick, Dublin,</hi> was conferred on him by Dr. <hi>Loftus,</hi> then Arch-Bishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which was the first Ecclesiastical Preferment that he had, and which he retained without taking any other Benefice, until he was thence promoted to the Bishoprick of <hi>Meath.</hi> Here he lived single for some years, and kept Hospitality proportionable to his Incomes; nor cared he for any overplus at the years end, (for indeed he was never a hoarder of money) but for Books, and Learning he had a kind of laudable covetousness, and never thought a good Book (either Manuscript or Printed) too dear. And in this place Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> found him, <hi>Anno</hi> 1607. when he was putting out the last Edition of his <hi>Britannia,</hi> where speaking of <hi>Dublin</hi> he concludes thus, <hi>Most of which I acknowledge to owe to the diligence and labour of</hi> James Usher, <hi>Chancellor of the Church of St.</hi> Patricks, <hi>who in various learning and judgment far exceeds his years.</hi> And though he had here no particular obligation to preach (unless sometimes in his course before the State,) yet he would not omit it in the place from whence he received the profits, <hi>viz. Finglass,</hi> not far from <hi>Dublin,</hi> which he endowed with a Vicaridge, and preached there eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lord's Day, unless hindered by very extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

                  <p>This year also he came over into <hi>England,</hi> to buy Books, and to converse with learned men, and was now first taken notice of at Court, preaching before the Houshold, which was a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in those days.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60492:12"/>
Church History, comparing Things with Things, Times with Times, gathering and laying up in store, Materials for the repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the decayed Temple of Knowledge, and endeavouring to separate the purer Mettal from the Dross, with which Time, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the Arts of ill designing men had in latter Ages corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and sophisticated it: For some years before he began to make large Notes, and Observations upon the Writings of the Fathers, and other Theological Authors, beginning with those of the first Century, and so going on with the rest as they occurred in order of time, passing his judgment on their Works, and divers Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in them, which were genuine, which spurious or forged, or else ascribed to wrong Authors: So that in the space of about eighteen or nineteen years (in which he made it his chief study) he had read over all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers; as also most of the considerable School-men, and Divines, from the first to the thirteenth Century: So he was now well able to judge, whether the passages quoted by our adversaries were truly cited, or not, or were wrested to a wrong sense: And this he did, not out of bare Curiosity, but to confute the Arrogance of those men, who will still appeal (though with ill success) to Antiquity, and the Writings of the Fathers: But these learned Collections of his being a large Volume, and designed by him as the foundation of a more large and elaborate Work, which might have been of great use to the Church, were never finished, but remain still in Manuscript, though he fully intended (had God afforded him life) to have fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as the only considerable work he had left to do, and which perhaps he had performed many years before his death, had it not been for that unhappy <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion, which bereft him not only of that, but of all his other Books for some time (except those he brought over with him, or furnished (himself with here;) so that, when at last this Manuscript (together with the rest of his Library) was brought over from <hi>Droghedah,</hi> they found him engaged in that long and laborious Work of his <hi>Annals;</hi> and when that was done, he had (as an <hi>Appendix</hi> thereunto) his <hi>Chronologia Sacra,</hi> to perfect, though he never lived to make an end of it; so that it is no wonder, if he wanted opportunity, and leisure to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish this great Task. But that he intended to give his last hand to this Work, will appear from this passage in his Epistle to the Reader, before his answer to the <hi>Jesuite</hi>'s Challenge, in these words: <hi>The exact discussion, as well of the Authors, Times, as of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of their Works, I refer to my</hi>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60492:12"/>
be done, may farther appear; that being askt upon his Death-bed, What his Will was concerning those <hi>Collections</hi> He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this effect, That he desired they might be committed to his dear friend Dr. <hi>Langbaine,</hi> Provost of <hi>Queens</hi> Colledge, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, on whose Learning, as well as Friendship he could rely, to cast them into such a Form, as might render them fit for the Press. According to which bequest they were put into the hands of that learned Dr. who in order thereunto, had them transcribed, and then set himself to fill up the breaches in the Original (the quotations in the Margine being much defaced with Rats:) about which laborious Task, that learned and good man studying in the publick Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in a very severe Season, got such an extreme cold, as quickly (to the great grief of all good men) brought him to his end, <hi>Feb. An.</hi> 1657. So that though that excellent Person Dr. <hi>Fell,</hi> (now Lord Bishop of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford)</hi> who has deserved so well of Learning, has endeavoured to get those <hi>Lacunae</hi> filled up, yet these <hi>Collections</hi> still remain unfit to be published; though the transcript from the Original, with the Marginal quotations, and additions are now in the <hi>Bodleyan</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, as a lasting Monument of the Lord Primate's Learning, and Industry; and may be like wise useful to those learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for whom they were designed, and who will take the pains to consult them.

This he wrote to answer that great Objection of the Papists,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60492:13"/>
when they ask us, Where our <hi>Religion</hi> was before <hi>Luther</hi> And therefore the design of this Book was to prove from Authors of unquestionable Credit and Antiquity, that Christ has always had a Visible Church of true Christians, who had not been tainted with the Errours and Corruptions of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church: and that even in the midst of the darkest and most ignorant times: and that these <hi>Islands</hi> owe not their first Christianity to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time also he altered his condition, changing a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for a married life, marrying <hi>Phoebe,</hi> only Daughter of <hi>Luke Challoner,</hi> Doctor of Divinity, (of the Ancient Family of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loners</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire)</hi> who had been a great Assister and Benefactor to the late Erected Colledge at <hi>Dublin,</hi> having been appointed Overseer of the Building, and Treasurer for the money raised to that purpose: He was a Learned, and Pious man, and had such a friendship for Dr. <hi>Usher,</hi> that he courted his Alliance, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, had he lived, to have given him this his only Daughter, with a considerable Estate in Land and Money; but dying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could see it concluded, he charged her upon his Death-bed, that if Dr. <hi>Usher</hi> would marry her, she should think of no other person for a Husband, which command of her dying Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she punctually obeyed, and was married to him soon after, and was his Wife for about forty years; and was always treated by him with great kindness, and conjugal affection until her death, which preceded his about one year, and a half. He had by her one only Child, the Lady <hi>Tyrrel</hi> yet living. Thus he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for several years in great reputation, pursuing his Studies, and following his Calling; and whilst he sat at home, endeavouring the advancement of Vertue and Learning, his fame flew abroad almost all over <hi>Europe;</hi> and divers learned men, not only in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but foreign Countries, made their applications to him by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as well to express the honour and respect they had for him, as also for satisfaction in several doubtful points, either in humane Learning, or Divinity; as the Reader may see in this ensuing Collection.</p>

I was appointed by the Lower House of Parliament, to preach at St.</hi> Margarets, Westminster, <hi>Feb.</hi> 7. <hi>the Prebends claimed the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Church, and their exemption from Episcopal Jurisdiction for many hundred years, and offered their own Service: Whereupon the House being displeased, appointed the place to be at the Temple. I was chosen a second time: And Secretary</hi> Calvert, <hi>by the appointment of the House, spake to the King, that the choice of their Preacher might stand: The King said,</hi> It was very well done. <hi>Feb.</hi> 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>being</hi> Shrove-Tuesday, <hi>I dined at Court; and betwixt</hi> 4 <hi>and</hi> 5 <hi>I kiss'd the King's hand, and had conference with him touching my Sermon. He said,</hi> I had charge of an unruly Flock, to look unto the next Sunday. <hi>He asked me how I thought it could stand with true Divinity, that so many hundred should be tyed (upon so short warning) to receive the Communion upon a day, all could</hi>

He bad me to tell them, I hoped they were all prepared, but wished they might be better: To exhort them to Unity, and Concord: To love God first, and then their Prince and Country: To look to the urgent necessities of the Times, and the miserable state of Christendom with</hi> Bis dat, qui citò dat.

                     <hi>The first Sunday in Lent I preached at St.</hi> Margarets <hi>to them: And</hi> Feb. 27<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>the House sent Sir</hi> James Perrot, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Drake, <hi>to give me thanks, and to desire me to print the Sermon, which was done accordingly; the Text being upon the first of the</hi> Cor. 10. 17. <hi>For we being many, are one Bread and one Body; for we are all partakers of that one Bread.</hi> This Sermon was printed by the desire of the House, and with one more (preached before the King at <hi>Wansted, Jan.</hi> 20. 1624. upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13. concerning the unity of the Catholick Faith) were all the Sermons I can find to have been published by his allowance.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord Bishop Elect returning some time after into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was there Consecrated by Dr. <hi>Hampton,</hi> then Lord Primate, assisted with some other of the Bishops; and being thus advanced to the Episcopal Degree, his Province and Imployment might be altered, but not his mind, nor humble temper of Spirit: Neither did he cease to turn as many as he could from Darkness to Light; from Sin, and Satan to Christ; by his Preaching, Writing, and Exemplary Life; observing that which St. <hi>Augustine</hi> said of St. <hi>Ambrose, Et eum quidem in populo verbum veritatis recte tractantem omni</hi>

                  <p>About this time some violent Papists of Quality happened to be censured in the Castle-Chamber at <hi>Dublin,</hi> for refusing to take the Oaths of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance:</hi> upon this occasion the State ordered the Bishop of <hi>Meath,</hi> on the day of the Sentence, to make a Speech to them, as well to inform their Consciences of the Lawfulness of it, as of the great penalties they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, if they persisted to refuse it: Which he performed in a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Discourse, and highly approved of by His Majesty: Which was as follows.</p>

                                 <hi>A Speech delivered in the</hi> Castle-Chamber <hi>at</hi> Dublin, November 22<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 1622. <hi>At the Censuring of certain Officers, concerning the Lawfulness of taking, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of refusing the Oath of Supremacy.</hi>
                              </head>
                              <p>WHat the danger of the <hi>Law</hi> is, for refusing this <hi>Oath,</hi> hath been sufficiently opened by my Lords, the <hi>Judges;</hi> and the <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>quantity</hi> of that offence hath been aggravated to the full by those that have spoken after them. The part which is most proper for me to deal in, is the information of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> touching the truth and equity of the matters contained in the <hi>Oath:</hi> which I also have made choice the rather to insist upon, because both the form of the Oath it self requireth herein a full resolution of the Conscience; (as appeareth by those words in the very beginning thereof; <hi>I do utterly testifie and declare in my Conscience, &amp;c.)</hi> and the persons that stand here to be censured for refusing the same, have alledged nothing in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but only the simple plea of <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>That this point therefore may be cleared, and all needless scruples removed out of mens minds: two main branches there be of this <hi>Oath,</hi> which require special consideration. The one <hi>positive,</hi> acknowledging the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the Government of these Realms, in all Causes whatsoever, to rest in the King's Highness only. The other <hi>Negative,</hi> renouncing all Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Authorities of any foreign Prince or Prelate within his Majesties Dominions.</p>
                              <p>For the better understanding of the former, we are in the first place to call unto our remembrance that exhortation of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                                 <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14.</note> 
                                 <hi>Submit your selves unto every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be unto the King, as having the preheminence; or unto Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as unto them that are sent by him, for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well.</hi> By this we are taught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the King, not as <hi>the only Governour</hi> of his Dominions simply, (for we see there be other <hi>Governours</hi> placed under him) but <gap reason="foreign">
                                    <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                 </gap>, as him that excelleth, and hath the preheminence over the rest; that is to say, (according to the tenure of the <hi>Oath)</hi> as him that is <hi>the only Supreme Governor</hi> of his Realms. Upon which ground we may safely build this conclusion; That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever power is incident unto the King by virtue of his place, must be acknowledged to be in him <hi>Supreme:</hi> there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so contrary to the nature of Soveraignty, as to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther superiour power to over rule it.</p>

Qui Rex est, Regem (maxime) non habeat.</q>
                              <p>In the second place we are to consider, That God, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter setling of piety and honesty among men, and the repressing of prophaneness and other vices, hath established two distinct powers upon Earth: The one of the <hi>Keys,</hi> committed to the Church; the other of the <hi>Sword,</hi> committed to the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. That of the <hi>Keys</hi> is ordained to work upon the inner man, having immediate relation to the <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 20. 23.</note> 
                                 <hi>remitting</hi> or <hi>retaining</hi> of sins. That of the <hi>Sword</hi> is appointed to work upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, yielding protection to the obedient, and inflicting external punishment on the rebellious and disobedient. By the former, the spiritual Officers of the Church of Christ are inabled to <note n="c" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17.</note> 
                                 <hi>govern well,</hi> to <note n="d" place="margin">Tit. 2. 15.</note> 
                                 <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>exhort</hi> and <hi>rebuke</hi> with all <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> to <note n="e" place="margin">Matth. 16. 19. &amp; 18. 18.</note> 
                                 <hi>loose</hi> such as are Penitent, to commit others unto the Lord's Prison until their amendment, or to bind them over unto the Judgment of the Great Day, if they shall persist in their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and obstinacy. By the other, Princes have an imperious power assigned by God unto them, for the defence of such as do well, and executing <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note> 
                                 <hi>revenge</hi> and <hi>wrath</hi> upon such as do evil; whether <note n="g" place="margin">Ezra 7. 26.</note> by <hi>death,</hi> or <hi>banishment,</hi> or <hi>confiscation of goods,</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,</hi> according to the quality of the offence.</p>
                              <p>When St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that had the <hi>Keys</hi> committed unto him, made bold to draw the <hi>Sword;</hi> he was commanded to <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 26. 52.</note> put it up, as a weapon that he had no authority to meddle withal. And on the other side, when <hi>Uzziah,</hi> the King, would venture upon the execution of the Priest's Office, it was said unto him; <note n="i" place="margin">2 Chron. 26. 18.</note> 
                                 <hi>It per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, but to the Priests, the Sons of Aaron, that are Consecrated to burn incense.</hi> Let this therefore be our second Conclusion: That the power of the <hi>Sword,</hi> and of the <hi>Keys</hi> are two distinct Ordinances of God; and that the Prince hath no more Authority to enter upon the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of any part of the Priest's Function, than the Priest hath to intrude upon any part of the Office of the Prince.</p>
                              <p>In the third place we are to observe, That the power of the <hi>Civil Sword</hi> (the <hi>supreme</hi> managing whereof belongeth to the King alone) is not to be restrained unto <hi>Temporal</hi> Causes only; but is by Gods Ordinance to be extended likewise unto <hi>all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Things and Causes:</hi> That as the spiritual Rulers of the Church do exercise their kind of Government, in bringing men unto obedience, not of the duties of the <hi>first</hi> Table alone, (which concerneth Piety and the Religious Service which man is bound to perform unto his Creator) but also of the <hi>second</hi> (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth moral honesty, and the Offices that man doth owe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man: (so the Civil Magistrate is to use his Authority also in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60492:16"/>
redressing the abuses committed against the <hi>first</hi> Table, as well as against the <hi>second;</hi> that is to say, as well in punishing of an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,</hi> or an <hi>Idolater,</hi> or a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> as of a <hi>Thief,</hi> or a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> or a <hi>Traytor;</hi> and in providing by all good means, that such as live under his Government <note n="k" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>honesty.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And howsoever by this means we make both <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Priest</hi> to be, in their several places, <hi>Custodes utriusque Tabulae,</hi> Keepers of both God's Tables; yet do we not hereby any way confound both of their Offices together. For though the <hi>matter</hi> wherein their Government is exercised may be the same; yet is the <hi>form</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of governing therein always different: the one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the <hi>outward</hi> man only, the other to the <hi>inward:</hi> the one binding or loosing the <hi>Soul,</hi> the other laying hold on the <hi>Body,</hi> and the things belonging thereunto: the one having special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Judgment of the <hi>World to come,</hi> the other respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the present retaining or losing of some of the comforts of <hi>this life.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>That there is such a <note n="*" place="margin">As on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, that a <hi>Spiritual or Ecclesiastical government</hi> is exercised in causes <hi>Civil or Temporal.</hi> For is not <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> a main part of Ecclesiastical government; and <hi>Forest laws</hi> a special branch of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Temporal yet we see in <hi>Sententiâ lat â super chartas,</hi> anno 12.

                                 <hi>Civil Government</hi> as this in <hi>Causes Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or Ecclesiastical,</hi> no man of judgment can deny.

                              </p>
                              <p>But here it will be said, the words of the <hi>Oath</hi> being general, That the King is <hi>the only Supreme Governor of this Realm, and of all other his Highness's Dominions and Countries.</hi> How may it appear, that the power of the <hi>Civil Sword</hi> only is meant by that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> is not comprehended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I answer: <hi>First,</hi> That where a Civil Magistrate is affirmed to be <hi>the Governor of his own Dominions and Countries;</hi> by common intendment this must needs be understood of a <hi>Civil Government,</hi> and may in no reason be extended to that which is meerly of another kind. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I say, That where an ambiguity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be in any part of an <hi>Oath;</hi> it ought to be taken accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the understanding of him for whose satisfaction the <hi>Oath</hi> was ministred. Now in this case it hath been sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by publick Authority, That no other thing is meant by the <hi>Government</hi> here mentioned, but that of the <hi>Civil Sword</hi> only.</p>

For in the Book of <hi>Articles,</hi> agreed upon by the Arch-Bishops and Bishops, and the whole Clergy in the Convocation holden at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1562. thus we read. <hi>Where we attribute to the Queen's Majesty the chief Government, (by which Titles we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended:) we give not to our Princes the ministring either of God's Word, or of the Sacraments (the which thing the Injuctions also lately set forth by</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>our Queen, do most plainly testifie:) but that only Prerogative which we see to have been given always to all Godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself: that is, That they should rule all Estates and Degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal; and restrain with the Civil Sword, the stubborn and evil doers.</hi>

                              <p>If it be here objected, that the Authority of the <hi>Convocation</hi> is not a sufficient ground for the exposition of that which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in <hi>Parliament:</hi> I answer, That these <hi>Articles</hi> stand confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not only by the Royal assent of the Prince, (for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of whose <hi>Supremacy</hi> the Oath was framed) but also by a special Act of <hi>Parliament;</hi> which is to be found among the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes in the thirteenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> chap. 12. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the makers of the Law have full Authority to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Law; and they have sufficiently manifested, That by the <hi>supreme Government</hi> given to the Prince, they understand that kind of Government only which is exercised <hi>with the Civil Sword:</hi> I conclude, that nothing can be more plain than this; That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all scruple of Conscience, the <hi>King's Majesty</hi> may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in this sense to be <hi>the only Supreme Governor of all his Highness's Dominions and Countries, as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal things or causes, as Temporal.</hi> And so have I cleared the <hi>first</hi> main branch of the <hi>Oath.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>I come now unto the <hi>Second;</hi> which is propounded <hi>Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> That <hi>no foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State or Potentate, hath, or ought to have any Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Preheminence or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Ecclesiastical or Spiritual within this Realm.</hi> The foreigner that challengeth this <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Jurisdiction over us, is the <hi>Bishop of Rome:</hi> And the Title whereby he claimeth this power over us, is the same whereby he claimeth it over the whole World; because he is S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successor, forsooth. And indeed, if St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself had been now alive, I should freely confess, that he ought to have spiritual Authority, and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority within this Kingdom. But so would I say also, if St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> St. <hi>Bartholo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>ew,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> or any of the other <hi>Apostles</hi> had been alive. For I know that their Commission was very large; to <note n="l" place="margin">Mark 16. 15.</note> 
                                 <hi>go into all the World, and to preach the Gospel unto every Creature.</hi> So that in what part of the World soever they lived, they could not be said to be out of their Charge; their <hi>Apostleship</hi> being a kind of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60492:17"/>
an <hi>Universal Bishoprick.</hi> If therefore the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> can prove himself to be one of this rank, the Oath must be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and we must acknowledge that he hath Ecclesiastical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority within this Realm.</p>
                              <p>True it is, that our Lawyers in their Year-Books, by the name of the <hi>Apostle</hi> do usually design the <hi>Pope.</hi> But if they had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined his Title to that <hi>Apostleship,</hi> as they would try an ordinary man's Title to a piece of Land, they might easily have found a number of flaws and main defects therein. For, <hi>first,</hi> It would be enquired, whether the <hi>Apostleship</hi> was not ordained by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ, as a special Commission; which being personal only, was to determine with the death of the first <hi>Apostles.</hi> For howsoever at their first entry into the execution of this Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, we find that <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 1. 25, 26.</note> 
                                 <hi>Matthias</hi> was admitted to the <hi>Apostleship</hi> in the room of <hi>Judas:</hi> yet afterwards, when <hi>James,</hi> the Brother of <hi>John,</hi> was slain by <hi>Herod,</hi> we do not read that any other was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in his place. Nay, we know that the <hi>Apostles</hi> generally left no Successors in this kind: Neither did any of the Bishops (he of <hi>Rome</hi> only excepted) that sate in those famous Churches, wherein the <hi>Apostles</hi> exercised their ministry, challenge an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship,</hi> or an <hi>Universal Bishoprick,</hi> by virtue of that Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                              <p>It would, <hi>secondly,</hi> therefore be inquired, what sound Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they can produce, to shew that <hi>one</hi> of the company was to hold the <hi>Apostleship,</hi> as it were in <hi>Fee,</hi> for him and his Successors for ever; and that the other <hi>eleven</hi> should hold the same for term of life only. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if this state of perpetuity was to be cast upon one; how came it to fall upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> rather than upon St. <hi>John,</hi> who outlived all the rest of his follows; and so as a <hi>survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving feoffee</hi> had the fairest right to retain the same in himself and his Successors for ever <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if that state were wholly setled upon St. <hi>Peter;</hi> seeing the Romanists themselves acknowledge, that he was Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> before he was Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> we require them to shew, why so great an inheritance as this, should descend unto the <hi>younger</hi> Brother (as it were by <hi>Burrough-English)</hi> rather than to the <hi>elder,</hi> (according to the ordinary manner of descents;) Especially seeing <hi>Rome</hi> hath little else to alledge for this preferment, but only that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified in it: which was a very slender reason to move the <hi>Apostle</hi> so to respect it. Seeing therefore the grounds of this great claim of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> appear to be so vain and frivolous, I may safely conclude, That he <hi>ought to have no Ecclesiastical or Spiritual Authority within this Realm;</hi> which is the principal point contained in the second part of the <hi>Oath.</hi>

Whereof, as we have received sundry Testimonies both from Our precedent Deputies, as likewise from Our Right Trusty and Welbeloved Cousin and Councellor, the Viscount</hi> Falkland, <hi>Our present Deputy of that Realm; so have We now of late, in one particular, had a further evidence of your Duty and Affection, well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by your late carriage in Our Castle-Chamber there, at the censure of those disobedient Magistrates, who refused to take the Oath of Supremacy. Wherein your zeal to the maintenance of Our Just and Lawful Power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with so much Learning and Reason, deserves Our Princely and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thanks; which We do by this Our Letter unto you, and so bid you fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. Given under Our Signet, at Our Court at</hi> White-Hall, <hi>the eleventh of</hi> January, 1622. <hi>In the twentieth year of Our Reign, of</hi> Great Britain, France <hi>and</hi> Ireland.</p>

                  <p>After the Bishop had been in <hi>Ireland</hi> about two years, it pleased King <hi>James</hi> to imploy him to write the Antiquities of the <hi>British</hi> Church, and that he might have the better opportunity, and means for that end, he sent over a Letter to the Lord Deputy, and Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> commanding them to grant a Licence for his being absent from his See: part of which Letter it may not be amiss to give you here <hi>Verbatim.</hi>

And whereas We are also given to understand, That the said Bishop hath already taken pains in divers things in that kind, which being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, might tend to the furtherance of Religion, and good Learning: Our pleasure therefore is, That so soon as the said Bishop hath setled the necessary Affairs of his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick there, he should repair into</hi> England, <hi>and to one of the Universities here, to enable himself, by the helps to be had there, to proceed the better to the finishing of the said Work, Requiring you hereby to cause our Licence to be passed unto him the said Lord Bishop of</hi> Meath, <hi>under Our Great Seal, orotherwise, as he shall desire it; and unto you shall be thought fit for his repairing unto this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for Our Service, and for his continuance here, so long time as he shall have occasion to stay about the perfecting of those Works undertaken by him, by Our Commandment, and for the good of the Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Upon which Summons the Bishop came over into <hi>England,</hi> and spent about a year here in consulting the best Manuscripts in both Universities, and private Libraries, in order to the perfecting that noble Work <hi>De Primordiis Ecclesiarum Britannicarum,</hi> though it was not published till above two years after, when we shall take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to speak thereof more at large.</p>
                  <p>After his coming over again, he was for some time engaged in answering the bold challenge of <hi>Malone,</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> Jesuite, of the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno </seg>1624</label> Colledge of <hi>Lovain,</hi> which Treatise he finished, and published this year in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which he so solidly, and learnedly performed, that those that shall peruse it may be abundantly satisfied, that those very Judges, the Challenger appealed to, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fathers of the Primitive Church, did never hold, or believe Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, Auricular Confession, Purgatory, or a <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> Prayer for the Dead, or to Saints; the Use of Images in Divine Worship; Absolute Free-Will, with Merits annexed; with those other points by him maintained. And though about three years after the publishing of this Treatise, when the Colledge of <hi>Lovain</hi> had been long studying how to answer it, the said <hi>Malone</hi> did at last publish a long and tedious reply, stuffed with Scurrillous, and Virulent Expressions against the Lord Primate, his Relations and Calling; and full of quotations, either falsly cited out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60492:19"/>
or else out of divers supposititious Authors; as also forged Miracles, and lying Legends, made use of meerly to blind the Eyes of ordinary Readers, who are not able to distinguish Gold from Dross; all which together gave the Bishop so great a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, that he disdained to answer a fool according to his folly, and made no reply unto him, though some of his worthy friends would not let it pass so: But the learned Dr. <hi>Hoyl,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sing,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Puttock</hi> did take him to task, and so fully and clearly lay open the falshood, and disingenuity of those his Arguments and Quotations from the Ancient Records, and Fathers of the Church, which had been cited by this Author, that he had very little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to brag of his Victory.</p>
                  <p>After the Bishop had published this Treatise, he returned again into <hi>England,</hi> to give his last hand to his said Work <hi>De Primordiis;</hi> and being now busied about it, the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>Armagh</hi> became vacant by the death of Dr. <hi>Hampton,</hi> the late Arch-Bishop; not long after which, the King was pleased to nominate the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Meath</hi> (though there were divers competitors) as the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Person for that great charge, and high dignity in the Church, in respect of his own great Merits and Services done unto it; and not long after he was Elected Arch-Bishop by the Dean and Chapter there. After which, the next Testimony that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of His Majesties favour, was his Letter to a Person of Quality in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who had newly obtained the <hi>Custodium</hi> of the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties of that See, <hi>Forbidding him to meddle with, or receive any of the Rents, or Profits of the same, but immediately to deliver what he had already received unto the Receivers of the present Arch-Bishop, since he was here imployed in His Majesties special Service,</hi> &amp;c. Not long after which favour, it pleased God to take King <hi>James</hi> (of Pious Memory) out of this World: Nor was his Son, and Successor, our late Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign, less kind unto him than his Father had been; which he signified not long after his coming to the Crown, by a Letter under his Privy Signet to the Lord Deputy, and Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> That, <hi>Whereas the present Arch-Bishop of</hi> Armagh <hi>had for many years together, on several occasions, performed many painful, and acceptable Services to his Dear Father deceased, and upon his special directions, That therefore he was pleased, as a gracious acceptation thereof, and in consideration of his said Services done, or to be done hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to bestow upon the said Primate, out of his Princely bounty 400 pound,</hi> English, <hi>out of the Revenues of that Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before the return of the said Arch-Bishop into <hi>Ireland,</hi> I shall here mention an accident that happened about this time; to let you see, that he neglected no opportunity of bringing men from the darkness of Popery, into the clearer light of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion. I shall give you his own relation of it; from a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60492:19"/>
Note, (which though imperfect) I find of his own hand writing: <hi>Viz. That in</hi> November 1625. <hi>he was invited by the Lord</hi> Mordant, <hi>and his Lady, to my Lord's House at</hi> Drayton <hi>in</hi> Northampton-shire, <hi>to confer with a Priest he then kept, by the name of</hi> Beaumont, <hi>upon the points in dispute between the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and Ours: And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, That the Religion maintained by Publick Authority in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>was no new Religion, but the same that was taught by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and his Apostles; and ever continued in the Primitive Church during the purest times:</hi> So far my Lord's Note. What was the issue of this Dispute, we must take from the report of my Lord and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and other Persons of Quality there present; that this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence held for some days, and at last ended, with that satisfaction to them both, and confusion of his Adversary, that as it confirmed the Lady in her Religion (whom her Lord, by the means of this Priest, endeavoured to pervert) so it made his Lordship so firm a Convert to the Protestant Religion, that he lived and died in it.</p>
                  <p>When the Lord Primate had dispatcht his Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> he <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1626</label> then returned to be Enthroned in <hi>Ireland,</hi> having before his going over received many Congratulatory Letters from the Lord Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Falkland</hi> (then Lord Deputy,) the Lord <hi>Loftus,</hi> then Lord Chancellor, the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and divers others of the most considerable of the Bishops, and Nobility of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, expressing their high satisfaction for his promotion to the Primacy; many of which I have now by me, no way needful to be inserted here.</p>
                  <p>Being now returned into his native Country, and setled in this <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno </seg>1626</label> great charge, (having not only many Churches, but Diocesses under his care) he began carefully to inspect his own Diocess first, and the manners and abilities of those of the Clergy, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent personal Visitations; admonishing those he found faulty, and giving excellent advice, and directions to the rest, charging them to use the Liturgy of the Church in all Publick Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and to Preach and Catechise diligently in their respective Cures; and to make the Holy Scripture the rule, as well as the subject of their Doctrine, and Sermons: Nor did he only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reform the Clergy, (among whom, in so large a Diocess, and where there was so small Encouragements, there could not but be many things amiss) but also the Proctors, Apparitors, and other Officers of his Ecclesiastical Courts, against whom there were many great complaints of abuses and exactions in his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor's time, nor did he find that Popery and Prophaneness had increased in that Kingdom, by any thing more than the neglect of due Catechising, and Preaching; for want of which instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the poor People, that were outwardly Protestants, were very ignorant of the Principles of Religion; and the Papists continued
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60492:20"/>
still in a blind obedience to their Leaders; therefore he set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with all his power to redress these neglects, as well by his own example, as by his Ecclesiastical Discipline; all which proving, at last, too weak for so inveterate a Disease, he obtained his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Injunctions to strengthen his Authority, as shall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The Winter after his coming over, there were some Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made, and offered to be assented unto by the Papists, for a more full Toleration of their Religion; <hi>viz.</hi> The maintaining 500 Horse, and 5000 Foot, (wherein the Protestants must have born some share also) for the consideration of which, a great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the whole Nation, both Papists and Protestants was called by the then Lord Deputy <hi>Falkland.</hi> The meeting was in the Hall of the Castle of <hi>Dublin.</hi> The Bishops, by the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's invitation, met first at his House, and both he, and they, then unanimously drew up, and subscribed a Protestation against the Toleration of Popery, which was as follows.</p>

This Protestation of the Bishops, Dr. <hi>Downham,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> at the next meeting of the Assembly, <hi>April</hi> 23<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> 1627. published at <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> before the Lord Deputy and Council, in the midst of his Sermon; wherein he spake much against mens subordinating Religion, and the keeping of a good Conscience to outward and worldly respects, and to set their Souls to sale for the gain of earthly matters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord Primate the next Lord's Day preached before the same Auditory; the Text was, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Love not the World, nor the things that are in the World;</hi> when he made the like Application with the Bishop, rebuking such, who for worldly ends, like <hi>Judas,</hi> would sell Christ for thirty pieces of Silver. The Judgment of the Bishops prevailed so much with the Protestants, that the Proposals were drove on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heavily: but yet upon serious consideration, when it was found that the weak and distracted condition of the Kingdom, could not well subsist without some standing Forces, it was resolved by the Lord Deputy and Council, that the Lord Primate (then a Privy-Councellor) should, in regard of his great esteem with all Parties, declare in a Speech to the whole Assembly, the true state of the Kingdom, and the necessity of a standing Army for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof, against any foreign Invasion, or intestine commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and consequently that a competent supply was needful to be granted for that purpose, and that without any Conditions whatsoever, as well by the Roman Catholick, as Protestant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for which end the Lord Deputy having Summoned the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly to the Castle-Chamber at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Lord Primate addressing himself to the Lord Deputy, made this ensuing Speech.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60492:21"/>
Famine grew so great, that the very Women in some places by the way side, have surprised the men that rode by, to feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the flesh of the Horse, or the Rider: And that now again here is a Storm towards, wheresoever it will light, every wise man may easily foresee, which if we be not careful to meet with in time, our State may prove irrecoverable, when it will be too late to think of, Had I wist.</p>
                              <p>The dangers that now threaten us, are partly from abroad, and partly from home; abroad, we are now at odds with two of the most potent Princes in Christendom; and to both which, in former times, the discontented persons in this Country have had recourse heretofore, proferring the Kingdom it self unto them, if they would undertake the Conquest of it: for it is not unknown unto them that look into the search of those things, that in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the Earl of <hi>Desmond</hi> made such an offer of this Kingdom to the <hi>French</hi> King, (the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument whereof yet remains upon Record in the Court of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris)</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> afterwards transferred the Title of all our Kingdoms unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, which by new Grants was confirmed unto his Son <hi>Philip,</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> with a resolution to setle this Crown upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta: Which donations of the Pope's, howsoever in themselves they are of no value, yet will they serve for a fair colour to a Potent Pretender, who is able to supply by the power of the Sword, whatsoever therein may be thought defective. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto may we add, that of late, in <hi>Spain,</hi> at the very same time, when the treaty of the Match was in hand, there was a Book published with great approbation there, by one of this Country birth, <hi>Philip O Sullevan,</hi> wherein the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is taught, That the ready way to establish his Monarchy (for that is the only thing he mainly aimeth at, and is plainly there confessed) is, first, to set upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> which being quickly obtained, the Conquest of <hi>Scotland,</hi> next of <hi>England,</hi> then of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> is foretold with great facility, will follow after.</p>
                              <p>Neither have we more cause in this regard to be afraid of a foreign Invasion, than to be jealous of a Domestick Rebellion. Where, left I be mistaken, as your Lordships have been lately, I must of necessity put a difference betwixt the Inhabitants of this Nation; some of them are descended of the race of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>English,</hi> or otherwise hold their Estates from the Crown, and have Possessions of their own to stick unto, who easily may be trusted against a foreign invader, although they differ from the State in matter of Religion: For proof of which fidelity in this kind, I need go no further than the late Wars in the time of the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> wherein they were assaulted with as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60492:21"/>
temptations to move them from their Loyalty, as possibly hereafter can be presented unto them: For, at that time, not only the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did confederate himself with the Rebels, and Landed his Forces here for their assistance, but the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> also, with his Breves, and Bulls, solicited our Nobility, and Gentry, to revolt from their Obedience to the Queen, declaring that the <hi>English</hi> did fight against the Catholick Religion, and ought to be repugned as much as the Turks, imparting the same favours to such as should set upon them, that he doth unto such as fight against the Turks; and finally, promising unto them, that the God of Peace would tread down their Enemies under their Feet speedily. And yet for all the Pope's promises, and threatnings, which were also seconded by a Declaration of the Divines of <hi>Salamanca</hi> and <hi>Valledolid,</hi> not only the Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telmen did constantly continue their Allegiance unto the Queen, but also were encouraged so to do by the Priests of the Pale, that were of the Popish profession: who were therefore vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently taxed by the Traytor <hi>O Sullenan,</hi> for exhorting them to follow the Queen's side; which he is pleased to term <hi>Insanam, &amp; venenosam Doctrinam, &amp; tartareum Dogma;</hi> a mad and venomous Doctrine, and a hellish Opinion. But besides these, there are a great number of <hi>Irish,</hi> who either bear a secret grudge against the <hi>English,</hi> planted amongst them, or having nothing at all to lose upon the first occasion, are apt to joyn with any foreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader; for we have not used that policy in our Plantations, that wise States have used in former times. They, when they setled new Colonies in any place, did commonly translate the Ancient Inhabitants to other dwellings. We have brought new Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Land, and have left the old Inhabitants to shift for themselves; who being strong in Body, and daily increasing in number, and seeing themselves deprived of their means and maintenance, which they and their Ancestors have formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; will undoubtedly be ready, when occasion is offer'd, to disturb our quiet; whether then we cast our eyes abroad, or look at home, we see our danger is very great.</p>
                              <p>Neither may you, My Lords, and Gentlemen, that differ from us in point of Religion, imagine that the Community of profession will exempt you, more than us, from the danger of a common Enemy. Whatsoever you may expect from a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, you may conjecture by the answer which the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> gave in this case in 88; That his Sword knew no difference between a Catholick and a Heretick, but that he came to make way for his Master: And what kindness you may look for from the Country-men that joyn with them, you may judge, as well by the carriage which they ordinarily use towards
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60492:22"/>
you and yours, both in the Court, and in the Colledges abroad, as by the advice not long since presented by them unto the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein they would not have so much as the <hi>Irish</hi> Priests and Jesuits, that are descended of <hi>English</hi> blood, to be trusted, but would have you and yours to be accounted Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the designs of <hi>Spain.</hi> In the Declaration published about the beginning of the Insurrection of <hi>James Fitz-Morice,</hi> in the South, the Rebels professed, it was no part of their meaning to subvert <hi>honorabile Anglorum Solium;</hi> their quarrel was only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the person of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her Government: But now the case is otherwise, the translating of the Throne of the <hi>English</hi> to the power of a Foreigner, is the thing that mainly is intended, and the re-establishing of the <hi>Irish</hi> in their Ancient possessions, which by the valour of our Ancestors were gained from them.</p>
                              <p>This you may assure your self, <hi>manet altâ mente repôstum,</hi> and makes you more to be hated of them than any other of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Nation whatsoever. The danger thereof being thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to us all, it stands us upon to joyn our best helps for the avoiding of it; only the manner how this may be effected is in Question. It was wont to be said, <hi>Iniquum petas, ut aequum feras,</hi> and such, perhaps, might be the intent of the project the other day propounded unto you; but now I observe the distate you have conceived against that hath so far possessed you, that hardly can you be drawn to listen to any equal motion. The exceptions taken against the Project, are partly general, made by all; partly special, that toucheth only some particulars: Of the former there are two, the quantity of the sum demanded, and the indefiniteness of the time, which is unlimited. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion required for the maintenance of 5000 Foot, and 500 Horse, you alledge to be so great, and your means so small, that in undertaking that which you are no ways able to perform, you shall but delude his Majesty, and disappoint the Army of their expected pay. And although the sum required were far less, and for a time able to be born by you; yet are you fearful that the payment, being continued for some number of years, may afterwards be continued as a constant Revenue to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Exchequer, with which perpetual burden you are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to charge your Posterity.</p>
                              <p>The exceptions of the second kind, are taken against the Grants annexed unto the former demands: the granting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of seemed rather to hinder than further the Service, as not so agreeing with the rules of Equity. For first, some have the full benefits of the Grants, and have their charge little augmented, as the Countries which pay Composition-rents, which by those
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60492:22"/>
Grants, during the time of the new payments are suspended. Secondly, others that have the charge of the payment imposed upon them to the full, are not partakers at all of the benefit of the Grants, as the <hi>British</hi> planted in the six Escheated Counties of <hi>Ulster.</hi> Thirdly, such as the most forward to further his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Service; and to contribute with the most, are troubled in Conscience for yielding thereto upon the terms proposed, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for that condition, whereby the execution of the Statute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Recusants is offer'd to be forborn.</p>
                              <p>Wherein, if some of my Brethren, the Bishops, have been thought to have shewed themselves more forward than wise, in preaching publickly against this kind of Toleration; I hope the great charge laid upon them by your selves in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein that Statute was inacted, will plead their excuse. For there, the Lords Temporal, and all the Commons, do in God's name earnestly require and charge all Arch-Bishops and Bishops, and other Ordinaries, that they shall endeavour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to the utmost of their knowledge, that the due and true execution of this Statute may be had throughout their Dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and charged, as they will answer it before God, for such Evils and Plagues as Almighty God might justly punish his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for neglecting these good and wholesome Laws. So that if in this case they had holden their Tongues, they might have been censured little better than Atheists, and made themselves accessary to the drawing down of God's heavy vengeance upon the People.</p>
                              <p>But if, for these and such like Causes, the former project will not be admitted, we must not therefore think our selves dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from taking farther care to provide for our safeties. Other consultations must be had, and other courses thought upon, which need not be liable to the like exceptions. Where the burden is born in common, and the aid required to be given to the Prince by his Subjects that are of different judgments in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; it stands not with the ground of common reason, that such a Condition should be annexed unto the Gift, as must of necessity deter the one Party from giving at all, upon such terms as are repugnant to their Consciences. As therefore on the one side, if we desire that the <hi>Recusants</hi> should joyn with us in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a common aid; we should not put in the Condition of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Statute, which we are sure they would not yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; so on the other side, if they will have us to joyn with them in the like Contribution, they should not require the Condition of suspending the Statute to be added, which we in Conscience cannot yield unto. The way will be then freely to grant unto
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60492:23"/>
his Majesty, what we give, without all manner of Condition that may seem unequal unto any side, and to refer unto his own Sacred Breast, how far he will be pleased to extend or abridge his favours: of whose Lenity, in forbearing the executing of the Statute, our Recusants have found such experience, that they cannot expect a greater liberty, by giving any thing that is demanded, than now already they do freely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>
                              <p>As for the fear, that this voluntary Contribution may in time be made a matter of necessity, and imposed as a perpetual charge upon Posterity, it may easily be holpen with such a clause as we find added in the Grant of an aid made by the Pope's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>Anno</hi> 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. out of the Ecclesiastical profits of this Land, <hi>Quod non debet trahi in consuetudinem,</hi> of which kinds of Grants, many other Examples of later memory might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: And as for the proportion of the Sum, which you thought to be so great in the former Proposition, it is my Lord's desire, that you should signifie unto him, what you think you are well able to bear, and what your selves will be content vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to proffer. To alledge, as you have done, that you are not able to bear so great a charge as was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, may stand with some reason; but to plead an unability to give any thing at all, is neither agreeable to Reason or Duty.</p>
                              <p>You say, you are ready to serve the King, as your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors did heretofore, with your Bodies, and Lives, as if the supply of the King's wants with monies, were a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to our Fore-fathers. But if you will search the Pipe-Rolls, you shall find the names of those who contributed to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, for a matter that did less concern the Subjects of this Kingdom, than the help that is now deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, namely, for the marrying of his Sister to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. In the Records of the same King, kept in <hi>England,</hi> we find his Letters Patents directed hither into <hi>Ireland,</hi> for levying of Money to help to pay his Debts, unto <hi>Lewis</hi> the Son of the King of <hi>France.</hi> In the Rolls of <hi>Gascony,</hi> we find the like Letter directed by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, unto the Gentlemen, and Merchants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of whose names there is a List there set down, to give him aid in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and for defence of his Land (which is now the thing in question.) We find an Ordinance likewise made in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, for the personal Taxing of them that lived in <hi>England,</hi> and hold Lands and Tenements in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60492:23"/>
Nay, in this case you must give me leave, as a Divine, to tell you plainly, that to supply the King means, for the necessary defence of your Country, is not a thing left to your own discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either to do, or not to do, but a matter of Duty, which in Conscience you stand bound to perform. The Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. having affirmed, That we must <hi>be subject to the higher powers, not only for wrath, but for Conscience sake,</hi> adds this as a reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it; For <hi>for this cause you pay tribute also,</hi> as if the denying such payment, could not stand with a conscionable subjection: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he infers this conclusion, <hi>Render therefore to all their due, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to whom Tribute, Custom to whom Custom is due;</hi> agreeable to that known Lesson which he had learned of our Saviour, <hi>Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which</hi>

                  <p>This Speech, though it had not its desired effect, yet may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declare the Lord Primate's abilities in matters of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when ever he would give his mind to them, and how well he understood the present state of that Kingdom: And it had been well for <hi>Ireland,</hi> if his advice had been then hearken'd to, since those standing Forces then moved for being to have been all Protestants; would in all probability have prevented that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, that some years after broke out in that Kingdom; but a Copy of this Speech being desired by the Lord Deputy, was transmitted to his Majesty, who very well approved of it, as much conducing to his Service, and the publick safety.</p>

                  <p>This year the happy news of the birth of Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> his late Gracious Majesty, then Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> being brought into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

                  <p>My Lord Primate published at <hi>Dublin</hi> his History of <hi>Gotteschalcus,</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60492:24"/>
the Church of that Diocess, as consonant to the Scriptures, and Writings of the Fathers. And that indeed divers dangerous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and Consequences were imputed to this learned Monk, which he was not guilty of. And after an account of the heads of a Treatise written by <hi>J. Scotius Erigene,</hi> in defence of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and the contrary Opinions to those of <hi>Gotteschalce,</hi> the Lord Primate then likewise gives the sum of the Censure, which <hi>Florus,</hi> Deacon of <hi>Lyons,</hi> writ against the same, in the name of that Church: As also of several Writings of <hi>Remigius,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Lyons, Pudentius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Troyes,</hi> and <hi>Ratramus,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Corbey,</hi> in defence of the said <hi>Gotteschalce</hi>'s Opinions, and against the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Tenets of <hi>Scotus:</hi> Which Disputes produced two other Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods at <hi>Bonoil,</hi> and <hi>Neufle,</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> wherein the Opinions held by <hi>Gotteschalce</hi> were asserted, and the contrary, as maintained by <hi>Scotus,</hi> were condemned. Though those Councils were still op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and censured by <hi>Hincmar</hi> in a large Book, dedicated to the Emperour, <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> the heads of which are there set down out of <hi>Flodoard:</hi> Which yet did not at all satisfie the contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nor hinder <hi>Remigius,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and his Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Bishops, from calling another Council at <hi>Langres,</hi> wherein the Canons of the <hi>Valentinian</hi> Council, were confirmed, and those Propositions, maintained by <hi>Scotus,</hi> were again condemned: Which Canons were also referred to the judgment of the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the XII Provinces assembled at <hi>Thoul;</hi> and being there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, were not by it condemned, (as <hi>Baronius,</hi> and others will have it) but for quietness sake were again referred to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the next General Assembly, that the Doctrines of the Church, and Fathers being produced, those should be agreed on, that should then appear most Sound, and Orthodox.</p>
                  <p>And in the Conclusion, my Lord there shews the great constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this poor Monk, who, notwithstanding his cruel whippings, and long imprisonment, to which he had been condemned, by the Council of <hi>Mentz,</hi> till his death, yet he would never Recant, but made two Confessions of his Faith, which are there set down, and by which it appears, That many things were laid to his charge, and condemned in those Councils, which he never held. In this Treatise, as the Lord Primate has shewn himself excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well skill'd in the Church History of those dark and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Ages; so he there concludes, that men should not Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in these Points. And indeed there ever have been, and still will be different Opinions, concerning these great and abstruse questions of Predestination, and Free-will, which yet may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, and consist in any Church, if the maintainers of either the one side, or other, will use that Charity as they ought, and forbear publickly to condemn, rail at, or write against each other.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>MOst Reverend Father in God, right Trusty, and entirely Beloved, We Greet you well. Among such disorders as the Lords of Our Privy-Council, Deputed by Us to a particular care of Our Realm of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the Affairs thereof, have observed, and represented to Us in that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil; We have taken in special consideration the growth and increase of the</hi> Romish <hi>Faction there, and cannot but from thence collect, That the Clergy of that Church are not so careful as they ought to be, either of God's Service, or the honour of themselves, and their Profession, in removing all pretences of Scandal in their lives and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherefore as We have by all means endeavoured to provide for them a competency of maintenance, so We shall expect hereafter on their part a recip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocal diligence; both by their Teaching and Example, to win that Ignorant and Superstitious People to joyn with them, in the true Worship of God. And for that purpose We have thought fit by these Our Letters, not only to excite your care of these things, according to your Duty, and dignity of your Place, in that Church, but further to Authorize you in Our Name to give by your Letters to the several Bishops in your Province, a special charge, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to give notice to their Clergy under them in their Diocesses respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, That all of them be careful to do their Duty, by Preaching and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techising in the Parishes committed to their charge: And that they live an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the Doctrine which they Preach to the People. And further We Will, that in Our Name you write to every Bishop within your Province, That none of them presume to hold with their Bishopricks any Benefice, or other Ecclesiastical dignity whatsoever in their own hands, or to their own use, save only such as We have given leave, under Our Broad Seal of that Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to hold in</hi> Commendam: <hi>And of this We require you to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, because there is a complaint brought to the said Lords Committees for</hi> Irish <hi>Affairs, That some Bishops there, when Livings fall void in their Gift, do either not dispose them so soon as they ought, but keep the profits in their own hands, to the hinderance of God's Service, and great offence of good People; or else they give them to young and mean men, which only bear the Name, reserving the greatest part of the Benefice to themselves, by which</hi>

                           <hi>means that Church must needs be very ill, and weakly served; of which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses, and the like, (if any shall be practised) We require you to take special care for present redress of them, and shall expect from you such account of your endeavours herein, as may discharge you, not to Us only, but to God, whose honour and service it concerns.</hi>

                  <p>By which Letter it is manifest, how highly his Majesty was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the increase of the Popish party in that Kingdom, and therefore would have all diligence used to prevent it, as also other abuses reformed, which had (it seems) crept in, by degrees, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Protestant Clergy there. But how little his Majesty liked the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, the Lord Primate was before very well satisfied by this <hi>Memorandum,</hi> which I have of his own hand writing, in a Book of his, <hi>viz. The King once at</hi> White-Hall, <hi>in the presence of</hi> George, <hi>Duke of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>of his own accord said to me, That he never loved Popery in all his life, But that he never detested it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his going into</hi> Spain.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the matter in hand, the Lord Primate, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of his Majestie's Command, (which so fully agreed with his own desires) set himself diligently to put in execution what had been committed to his care, as well for the good of the Church, as his Majestie's Service: He therefore endeavoured to reform, first, those disorders which had been complained of in his own Province, and which had been in good measure rectified already, (as has been already mentioned) and in the next place, he made it his business to reclaim those deluded People, who had been bred up in that Religion from their infancy; for which end he began to converse more frequently, and familiarly, with the Gentry, and Nobility of that perswasion; as also with divers of the Inferior sort that dwelt near him, inviting them often to his House, and discoursing with them, with great mildness, of the chief Tenets of their Religion; by which gentle usage he was strangely suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful, convincing many of them of their Errors, and bringing them to the knowledge of the Truth. And he also advised the Bishops, and Clergy of his Province, to deal with the Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants in their several Diocesses, and Cures, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; that if possible they might make them understand their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and the danger in which they were: which way, in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where there are no Penal Laws to restrain the publick Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that Religion, was the best, if not the only means, which could be used. Nor was his care confined only to the conversion of the ignorant <hi>Irish</hi> Papists; but he also endeavoured the reduction of the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Sectaries to the bosom of the Church, as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60492:26"/>
it was by Law established, conferring and arguing with divers of them, as well Ministers as Lay-men, and shewing them the weakness of those Scruples and Objections they had, against their joyning with the publick Service of the Church, and submitting to its Government and Discipline; and indeed the Lord Primate was now so taken up in Conferences with all sorts of Persons, or in answering Letters from Learned men abroad, or else such as applied themselves to him for his judgment in difficult points in Divinity, or resolutions in Cases of Conscience; that whoever shall consider this, as also his many Civil, and Ecclesiastical Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, together with the constant course of his Studies, must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that none but one of his large capacity, and who made a constant good use of his time, could ever be sufficient for so many, and so different imployments.</p>
                  <p>About the end of this year, I find, the Arch-Bishop was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by his publishing and printing, at <hi>London,</hi> a small Treatise of the Religion Anciently professed by the <hi>Irish,</hi> (which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends also the Northern <hi>Scots)</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> which he writ in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> to satisfie the Gentry, and better sort of People, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion professed by the Ancient Bishops, Priests, Monks, and other Christians of these Kingdoms, was the very same in the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Points with that which is now maintained by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, against those novel and foreign Doctrines introduced by the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in latter times.</p>
                  <p>The next year, <hi>Anno</hi> 1632. the Lord Primate, after his return into <hi>Ireland,</hi> published his <hi>Veterum Epistolarum Hybernicarum Sylloge,</hi> containing a choice Collection of Letters, out of several Ancient Manuscripts, and other Authors, partly from, and partly to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Irish</hi> Bishops and Monks, Commencing about the year of our Lord 592. to the year 1180. concerning the Affairs of the <hi>Irish</hi> Church in those times; which abundantly shew the great esteem the Learning and Piety of the Bishops and Clergy of that Church had then both at <hi>Rome, France, England,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: Containing, likewise, divers choice matters, relating to the great Controversies of those times, concerning the keeping of <hi>Easter;</hi> as also divers things relating to the Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and Jurisdiction of the Church of that Kingdom, very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the taking notice of.</p>
                  <p>And I suppose about this time, if not before, he contracted a more intimate acquaintance with the Reverend Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> who had for some time managed the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Affairs both in Church and State: And I find by divers of his Letters to the Lord Primate, as well whilst he was Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> as after he was advanced to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that there was scarce any thing of moment concluded on, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60492:26"/>
Preferment bestowed by his Majesty in the Church of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> without his advice, and approbation, which you may see by some Letters in this ensuing Collection, which we have selected from divers others of lesser moment, as fittest for publick view; but the L. Primate always made use of his interest with the said Arch-Bishop, and other great men at Court, not for his own private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but for the common good of the Church, by opposing, and hindering divers Grants and Patents to some great men, and Courtiers, who had under-hand obtained the same; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, he caused a Patent, made to a Person of Quality, of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of several Tythes, to be called in, and vacuated, his Majesty being deceived in his Grant, who would not have done any thing prejudicial to the Church, had he been rightly informed of the nature of the thing; and the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate was so much concerned for a competent maintenance for the Clergy in that Kingdom, that he had some years before this obtained a Grant of a Patent from his Majesty, to be passed in his own name, though for the use of the Church, of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations belonging to the Crown, as were then Leased out, as soon as they should fall; which, though it did not succeed, being too much neglected by those who were concerned more immediately, yet it sufficiently shews my Lord's pious intentions in this matter.</p>
                  <p>About this time there was a Letter sent over, from his late <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno </seg>1634</label> Majesty, to the Lord Viscount <hi>Wentworth,</hi> then Lord Deputy, and the Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for determining the precedency of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Arch-Bishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their Sees, the latter making some pretence unto it; therefore, in regard of a Parliament, intended by his Majesty shortly to meet, it was thought fit, for order's sake, that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie should be decided before their meeting: In order to which, he was commanded by the Lord Deputy, to reduce into writing what he knew upon that subject: But he not desiring to engage in so invidious an argument, and which so nearly concerned himself, and which he did not desire to have stirred, did what he could to decline it; but being still further urged, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do it, he did at last, though unwillingly, write a short, and learned discourse, full of excellent remarks, wherein he proved the Antiquity and Primacy of his See to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded that of <hi>Dublin</hi> divers Ages, which discourse being sent over into <hi>England,</hi> the precedency was determined by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty on his side, as afterwards by another Letter from his Majesty and Council here; he had also, without his seeking, the precedency given him of the Lord Chancellor, which (he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60492:27"/>
being above such trifles) were not at all able to elate him.</p>
                  <p>At the opening of the following Parliament, he preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Deputy, Lords and Commons, at St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s, <hi>Dublin,</hi> his Text was, <hi>Genes.</hi> 49. 10. <hi>The Scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Law-giver from between his feet, till Shiloh come, and to him shall the gathering of the People be.</hi> And in the Convocation which was now Assembled, the Lord Primate, at the instrance of the Lord Deputy, and Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> thought fit to propose, That to express the agreement of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> with that of <hi>England,</hi> both in Doctrine and Discipline, the Thirty Nine Articles should be received by the Church of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which Proposal was thereupon consented to by both Houses of Convocation, and the said Articles were declared to be the Confession of Faith of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but without abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or excluding the former Articles, made 1615, either by that Convocation, or Parliament, as two several Writers of those times, <hi>viz.</hi> a Church, and Civil Historian, have without ground repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to be: And though the <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det Petrus, Sect. IX.</note> latter was at last brought to confess his Error of their being Repealed by Autority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet he still insisted, That the reception of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though it be not an express, yet is a tacite annulling of the former, instancing in the Old Covenant, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves to be abrogated by the giving of a New; which were a good Argument, if the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were as inconsistent with those of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as those two Covenants are with each other, but if they differ no more than the <hi>Nicene</hi> does from the Apostles Creed, (which, though it contains more, yet does not Annul the former) then without doubt the receiving of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was no abrogation of those of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But since it is not my design to write Controversies, I shall not enter farther into this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but shall leave the Reader to consider, whether the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces brought by the Historian, to prove the Articles of these two Churches to be inconsistent, are convincing, or not, and shall <note place="margin">Ibid. Sect. XII.</note> say no more on this ungrateful subject, but that it is highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that the Lord Primate should be so outwitted by the Lord Deputy, or his Chaplains, (as the <note n="*" place="margin">In the Life of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud.</hi>
                     </note> Historian makes him to have been in this affair) but that he very well understood the Articles of both Churches, and did then know, that they were so far from being inconsistent, or contradictory to each other, that he thought the <hi>Irish</hi> Articles did only contain the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> more fully, or else he would never have been so easily perswaded to an Act which would amount to a Repeal of those Articles, which, as hath been already said, he himself made, and drew up: And for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60492:27"/>
a farther proof that this was the sense, not only of himself, but of most of the rest of the Bishops at that time; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at all Ordinations took the subscription of the Party Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to both Articles; the Articles of <hi>England,</hi> not being received instead, but with those of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath informed us;) which course was continued by the Lord Primate, and most part of the Bishops, till the confusion of that Church by the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion: And if, at this day, the subscription to the Thirty Nine Articles be now only required of the Clergy of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I suppose it is purely out of prudential considerations, that any divine, or other person of that Church, may still, either by preaching, or writing, maintain any point of Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in those Articles, without being either Heterodox, or Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.</p>
                  <p>It was likewise reported, and has been since written by some, (with the like truth) that the Lord Primate should have some dispute with Dr. <hi>Bramhall,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> concerning these Articles: Whereas the contest between the Lord Primate, and that Bishop, was not about the Articles, but the Book of Canons, which were then to be established for the Church of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and which the Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> would have to be passed in the very same form, and words, with those in <hi>England;</hi> which the Lord Primate; with divers other of the Bishops, opposed, as somewhat prejudicial to the Liberties of the Church of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and they so far prevailed herein, that it was at last concluded, That the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> should not be tyed to that Book, but that such Canons should be selected out of the same, and such others added thereunto, as the present Convocation should judge fit, for the Government of that Church; which was accordingly performed, as any man may see, that will take the pains to compare the two Books of the <hi>English,</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Canons together: And what the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s judgment was, on this affair, you may see in a Letter of his to the Lord Primate, published in this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                  <p>About the end of this year, the Lord Primate published his <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno </seg>1639</label> long expected work, entitled, <hi>Britannicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates:</hi> In which also is inserted a History of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and his Heresie; which Work I suppose my Lord kept so long unpublished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he still found fresh matter to add to it; as you may see by the many Additions, and Emendations at the latter end of it; and as it was long in coming out, so it did fully answer expectation, when it came abroad into the World, being the most exact account that ever yet was given of the <hi>British</hi> Church, beginning with the earliest notices we can find in Ancient Authors of any credit, concerning the first planting of Christianity in these Islands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

twenty years after our Saviour's Crucifixion, and bringing it down (with the Succession of Bishops, as far as they could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treived) not only in our <hi>Britain,</hi> but in <hi>Ireland</hi> also, as far as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the VII Century; collected out of the best Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, either Printed or Manuscript; and is so great a Treasure of this kind of Learning, that all that have writ since, with any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, on this subject, must own themselves beholding to him for his elaborate Collections.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno </seg>1640</label> with great satisfaction, and benefit to the Church, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this year, came into <hi>England,</hi> with his Wife and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, intending to stay here a year or two, about his private Affairs, and then to return again: But it pleased God to disappoint him in those resolutions, for he never saw his native Country again; not long after his coming to <hi>London,</hi> (when he had kissed his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's hand, and been received by him with his wonted favour) he went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> as well to be absent from those heats and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which then happened in that short Parliament, as also with greater freedom to pursue his Studies in the Libraries there, where he was accommodated with Lodgings in <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Morice,</hi> Canon of that House, and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Professor; and whilst he was there, he conversed with the most Learned Persons in that famous University, who used him with all due respect, whilst he continued with them; so after he had resided there some time, he returned again to <hi>London,</hi> where, after the sitting of that long, and unhappy Parliament, he made it his business, as well by preaching, as writing, to exhort them to Loyalty, and Obedience to their Prince; endeavouring, to the utmost of his power, to heal up those breaches, and reconcile those differences, that were ready to break out, both in Church and State; though it did not meet with that success he always desired.</p>
                  <p>This year there was published at <hi>Oxford</hi> (among divers other Treatises of Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and other Learned men, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>That unhappy dispute between his Majesty and the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, concerning his passing the Bill for the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder, now arising, and he much perplexed and divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60492:28"/>
the clamour of a discontented People and an unsatisfied Conscience, thought fit to advise with some of his Bishops, what they thought he ought to do in point of Conscience (as he had before consulted his Judges in matter of Law,) among which his Majesty thought fit to make choice of the Lord Primate for one, though without his seeking, or knowledge; but since some men, either out of spleen, or because they would not retract what they had once written from vulgar report, have thought fit to publish, as if the Lord Primate should advise the King to sign the Bill for the said Earl's Attainder, it will not be amiss to give you here that relation which Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> had under his own hand; and has printed in the Funeral Sermon by him published; which is as followeth.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That <hi>Sunday</hi> morning wherein the King consulted with the four Bishops, (of <hi>London, Durham, Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Carlisle)</hi> the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh</hi> was not present, being then preaching (as he then accustomed every <hi>Sunday</hi> to do) in the Church of <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> where a Message coming unto him from his Majesty, he descended from the Pulpit, and told him that brought it, he was then (as he saw) imployed about God's business; which as soon as he had done, he would attend upon the King, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his pleasure: But the King spending the whole After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon in the serious debate of the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Case, with the Lords of his Council, and the Judges of the Land, he could not before Evening be admitted to his Majesty's presence.</p>
                     <p>There the Question was again agitated, Whether the King in justice, might pass the Bill of Attainder against the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> (for that he might shew mercy to him was no question at all;) no man doubting but that the King, without any Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Conscience, might have granted him a Pardon, if other reasons of State (in which the Bishops were made neither Judges, nor Advisers) did not hinder him. The whole result therefore of the determination of the Bishops, was to this effect; That therein the matter of Fact, and matter of Law, were to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished: That of the matter of Fact, he himself might make a judgment, having been present at all proceedings against the said Earl; where, if upon the hearing of the Allegations on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, he did not conceive him guilty of the Crimes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was charged, he could not in justice condemn him: But for the matter in Law, what was Treason, and what was not, he was to rest in the opinion of the Judges; whose Office it was to declare the Law, and who were Sworn therein to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves indifferently betwixt Him, and his Subjects: Which gave his Majesty occasion to complain of the dealing of the Judges
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60492:29"/>
with him not long before: That having earnestly pressed them to declare in particular, what point of the Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Charge they judged to be Treasonable, (forasmuch as upon the hearing of the proofs produced, he might in his Conscience, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, find him guiltless of that Fact) he could not by any means draw them to nominate any in particular, but that upon the whole matter, Treason might justly be charged upon him. And in this second meeting, it was observed, That the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> spake nothing at all, but the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> not only spake, but put a Writing also into the King's hand, wherein, what was contained, the rest of his Brethren knew not.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>From all which we may observe my Lord Primate's modesty, who would not set down his own particular judgment in this matter, but only that it agreed with that of his Brethren, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so his charity, and fidelity, who would not (though to acquit himself) betray his trust, and accuse the only person of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who was supposed to have moved the King to the doing of it: Nor is the reason those men have supposed, why my Lord Primate should perswade the King to do this, less false, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, <hi>viz.</hi> Revenge, because the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> whilst Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> had outwitted him, and made him the Instrument (before he was aware) of abrogating the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> above mentioned; the falseness of which Calumny may sufficiently appear from what hath been already said upon this subject, for the Lord Primate did willingly, and upon due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, without any surprise, propose the Admission of those Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor was he ever convinced (neither did my Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> ever insist upon it) that the admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of these Articles, was an abrogation of the former; and if the Lord Primate had any private grudge against the Earl upon this Score, he carried it very slyly, insomuch that the Earl himself, nor any of his friends were ever sensible of it; for whilst the Earl continued in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there was never any dispute, or unkindness between them, but they parted good friends, as will appear by some Letters, which you will find in this Collection. The Earl writ to him after this business, and not long before his going for <hi>England,</hi> full of kindness and respect: So likewise after the Earl's Commitment to the <hi>Black-Rod,</hi> as also when he was a Prisoner in the Tower; the Lord Primate frequently visited him, and the Earl was pleased to consult with him in divers matters relating to his defence at his Tryal. And certainly had the Earl believed that the Lord Primate bore any malice towards him, much more had advised the King to put him to death, (which could not have been well concealed from him) though we may suppose the Earl
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60492:29"/>
had so much Christian charity as to forgive so great an injury, yet it is not very likely, that he should exercise such a piece of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as to chuse him, whom he believed to be the promoter of his death, to prepare him for it; and to be the man to whom he addressed his Speech upon the Scaffold, and whose assistance he desired in that his last extremity. But I shall speak no farther of this matter, till I can in order of time tell you what the Lord Primate himself said unto me concerning it, when he lay (as he thought) on his Death-bed, and not likely to live an hour; and also what his Majesty declared, when he heard the report of his death.</p>
                  <p>Not many Months after the Execution of this great, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Earl, there came over the unhappy news of the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of the horrid <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion, in which, as his Majesty's (with the <hi>English,</hi> and Protestant) interest in that Kingdom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an unexpressible blow, so likewise the Lord Primate bore too great a share in that common affliction; for in a very few days the Rebels had plundered his Houses in the Countrey, seized on his Rents, quite ruined, or destroyed his Tenements, killed, or drove away his numerous Flocks, and Herds of Cattle, to a very great value; and in a world, had not left him any thing in that Kingdom, which escaped their fury, but his Library, and some Furniture in his House in <hi>Droghedah,</hi> which were secured by the strength of that place, notwithstanding a long and dangerous Siege by those Rebels; which Library was some years after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed over to <hi>Chester,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London:</hi> This must needs reduce him to a very low condition, happening not long after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> when he expected a return of his Rents, so that he was forced, for his present supply, to sell, or pawn all the Plate and Jewels he had; this, though a very great Tryal, yet made not any change in his Natural Temper, and Heavenly Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, still submitting to God's Providence, with Christian Patience, and Magnanimity, having long before learned to use the things of this World, as if he used them not; and in whatsoever condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was, therewith to be content: Yet these afflictions were sufficient to move compassion, even in the breasts of Foreigners, for some Months after his losses, the City, and University of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> offered to chuse him their <hi>Honorarie</hi> Professor, with a more ample stipend, than had been formerly annexed to that place: And Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> in the above cited Sermon, likewise tells us, that Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> did about the same time, make him an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to come into <hi>France,</hi> with a promise of a very noble Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and freedom of his Religion there; and that this is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely (though I never heard my Lord Primate speak of it) may be proved from the great honour that Cardinal had for him,

which he expressed by a Letter full of kindness and respect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Gold Medal of considerable value, having his own <hi>Effigies</hi> stamped upon it, which is still preserved; these were sent him upon his publishing his Work, <hi>De Primordiis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siarum Britannicarum,</hi> which Present was also returned by the Lord Primate, by a Letter of thanks, with a handsome present of <hi>Irish</hi> Grey-hounds, and other rarities which that Countrey affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>But it pleased his late Majesty to provide for him much better in <hi>England,</hi> by conferring on him the Bishoprick of <hi>Carlisle</hi> (lately void by the death of Dr. <hi>Potter)</hi> to be held in <hi>Commendam;</hi> this, though very much abated by the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Armies Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon it, as also by the unhappy Wars which not long after followed; yet he made shift to subsist upon it, with some other helps, until that Rebellious House of Commons seized upon all Bishops Lands; and though, in consideration of his great losses in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as also of his own Merits, and to make him some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for what they took away, they Voted him a Pension of four hundred pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> yet I cannot hear that he ever received it above once, or twice at most; for the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Faction getting uppermost, soon put an end to that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty having now left <hi>London,</hi> by reason of the Tumults <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno </seg>1642</label> there, and the undutifulness of the House of Commons towards him, the Lord Primate being more deeply afflicted for these breaches, than for all his own private sufferings: Having now no more satisfaction in abiding longer at <hi>London,</hi> he resolved to remove thence for <hi>Oxford,</hi> not long before his Majesty's coming thither: and here, though the Lord Primate's outward condition was much lessened, to what it was before, yet his greatness being founded upon a more solid bottom than riches, and outward splendor, he was received with the same, or rather greater kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and respect than before. The Reverend Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> (his good friend) lent him his House adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge, which he accepted of, as being near his business at the publick Library, where he now pursued his studies, preparing divers Treatises for the publick view, some of which he also printed there, as shall be hereafter mentioned; nor did he less endeavour to be serviceable to mens Souls, than to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Learning, preaching commonly at one Church, or other, every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and for great part of the time, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons, sometimes at St. <hi>Olives,</hi> and sometimes at <hi>Alhallows,</hi> where he had constantly a great Audience, both of Scholars and others; where notwithstanding the Learnedness of most of his Hearers, he rather chose a plain substantial way of Preaching, for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60492:31"/>
of Piety and Vertue, than studied Eloquence, or a vain osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Learning; so that he quite put out of countenance that windy, affected sort of Oratory, which was then much in use, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>floride</hi> preaching, or strong lines. And I remember, I then heard, that there was a person in the <hi>University,</hi> very much famed for that kind of preaching, who, after he had sometimes heard the Lord Primate's Sermons, and observing how plain, and yet moving they were, and being sufficiently satisfied that it was not for want of Wit, or Learning, that he did not do otherwise, he was soon convinced that this was not the most ready way of gaining Souls, and therefore quitting his affected <hi>Style,</hi> and studied <hi>Periods,</hi> took up a more plain and profitable way of preaching, so that coming afterwards to visit the Lord Primate, he gave him many thanks, and told him, he had now learned of him how to preach, and that since he had followed his example, he had found more satisfaction in his own Conscience, and comfort in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, than ever he had before. And I remember one Sermon above the rest, which he preached in <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge Chappel, about that time; the Text, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 1. <hi>Through desire a man having separated himself, seeketh and intermedleth with all Wisdom;</hi> in which Sermon he so lively, and pathetically set forth the excellency of true Wisdom, as well Humane, as Divine, and that desire which every ingenious, and vertuous Soul ought to have for it, that it wrought so effectually upon the hearts of many of the younger Students, that it rendered them more serious, and made them ply their Studies much harder than before.</p>
                  <p>The first <hi>Sunday</hi> after his Majesty's return to <hi>Oxford,</hi> from the fights of <hi>Edge-hill</hi> and <hi>Brainford,</hi> the Lord Primate was called to preach before him, as he did likewise on divers other more solemn occasions, both in this, and the following year.</p>
                  <p>About this time, likewise, the Lord Primate came acquainted <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1643</label> with the most Learned, and Pious Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> with whom he contracted so intimate a friendship, that it continued to his dying day; and though some persons (I suppose rather out of misinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation than malice) have reported, That the Lord Primate should give a scandalous, unbeseeming Character of the Doctor; he was ever so far from it, that he never mentioned him without due kindness, and respect, as you will find by some Letters in this Collection, wherein you may see the Lord Primate much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for an aspersion, of the like nature with this, imputed to him, but cast upon him indeed by a foreign Writer; a learned, <note place="margin">Blondellus.</note> though violent and obstinate asserter of his own Anti-Episcopal Opinions, contrary to those of the Doctor's.</p>
                  <p>This Summer the Lord Primate was nominated (though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his desire) to be one of the Assembly of Divines at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:60492:32"/>
as were also Dr. <hi>Brownrig,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> Dr. <hi>West field,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bristol,</hi> and divers others of the Orthodox Clergy, but the Lord Primate neither approved of the Authority that named him, nor yet of the business they met about; so that he never troubled himself to go thither; but when that mock Assembly found he scorned to come among them, they complained of him to the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> who soon voted him out again; which yet the Arch-Bishop took more kindly, than their chusing him into it: And now when this prevalent Faction, sitting at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> found that the Arch-Bishop was not for their turn, but to the contrary, had in divers Sermons at <hi>Oxford,</hi> preached against their Rebellions Proceedings, they were so inraged at him, that the <hi>Committee</hi> they had appointed for <hi>Delinquents</hi> Estates, (as they Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named those who now faithfully served their <hi>Prince)</hi> made an Order for the seizing of a Study of Books of a considerable value, which he had either brought over with him, or bought here, and were left behind in <hi>Chelsy</hi> Colledge, which were seized according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had been sold by them, had not Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> who was then in some favour with them, by reason of his being one that sate in that <hi>Assembly,</hi> (though otherwise Orthodox, and Loyal) made an interest with them, by the means of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (a Member of the <hi>House,</hi> as also of the <hi>Assembly)</hi> to obtain those Books for his own use, either as a gift, or by laying down some money for them; and so got them into his hands, and secured them for my Lord Brimat's use, at least as many of them as were not imbezled, or stollen away whilst they were in their custody, as amongst other things divers Papers and Collections of his own Writing, with all his Letters, either to, or from his learned friends (which he had left behind him there) were then plundered, and for which loss, this ensuing Collection does fare the worse.</p>
                  <p>About this time my Lord Primate published a small, but lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Treatise, Entided, <hi>A Geographical, and Historical disquisition, touching the lesser</hi> Asia, <hi>properly so called,</hi> Viz. <hi>The</hi> Lydian Asia, <hi>so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mentioned in the</hi> New Testament, <hi>and by Ecclesiastical, and other Writers, by the names of the</hi> Proconsular Asia, <hi>or</hi> Asian Diocess. Where having shewn his admirable skill in the <hi>Geography</hi> of the Ancients, and also in the <hi>Imperial Laws,</hi> in order to the right understanding the Ecclesiastical, and Civil <hi>Histories</hi> of those Times, out of which he hath fixed and setled the several Provinces of the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> as <hi>Mysia, Caria,</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> (under which latter were comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the adjoyning Countries of <hi>Ionia,</hi> and <hi>Aeolis.)</hi> He then proves, That the <hi>Asia</hi> mentioned in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and the seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> particularly, are contained within the limits of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and that each of these seven Cities was a <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and that according to this division of the Civil Government, they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60492:32"/>
were made choice of to be the Seats of the most eminent Churches of all <hi>Asia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Roman Provinces</hi> were not always the same, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as reason of State required, and for greater ease, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Government, often varied, and admitted alterations, the division of the <hi>Empire</hi> being different in the Times of <hi>Augustus,</hi> from what it was under <hi>Constantine,</hi> under whom the <hi>Proconsular Asia</hi> was confined to the <hi>Lydian Asia</hi> only, the former great extent of its Jurisdiction being then very much abridged, and a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made between the <hi>Proconsular Asia,</hi> which was under the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Proconsul,</hi> and the <hi>Asian Diocess,</hi> governed by the <hi>Vicarius,</hi> or <hi>Comes Asiae,</hi> or <hi>Dioceseos Asianae:</hi> As it was also sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the Times of the succeeding <hi>Emperors,</hi> to variety of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and that in this disposition, made by <hi>Constantine,</hi> it was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That there should be but one <hi>Metropolis</hi> in each distinct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, whereas before there had been several: Though this did not hold always in the Reigns of some of his Successors, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted sometimes two <hi>Metropolitans</hi> in one Province, to satisfie the ambitious humour of several Bishops, who contended for that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, upon the account of the riches, and greatness of each of their respective Cities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That in regard to this Establishment of <hi>Constantine, Ephesus</hi> (where the Deputies of the several Provinces of <hi>Asia,</hi> who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, and made up the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Lastly, That there was a great harmony between the Civil and Ecclesiastical Government; and consequently, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of every Province were subject, subordinate to the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Bishop, (the same then with our Arch-Bishop;) as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, that Ruled in the other subordinate Cities, were to the President, or chief Governor of that Province.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Bishop in these years, whilst he was now at <hi>Oxford,</hi> published in <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> the Epistles of the holy Martyrs, <label type="milestone">

The old <hi>Latin</hi> Version of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> his Lordship publisht out of two Manuscripts found in <hi>England,</hi> noting in red Letters the interpolation of the former <hi>Greek</hi> Impressions. This work was much illustrated by his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of several <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of the Letters and Martyrdom of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp;</hi> as also with a most learned dissertation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those <hi>Epistles;</hi> as also touching the Canons, and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions ascribed to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and to St. <hi>Clement,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>About seven years after which, his Lordship also set forth at <hi>London</hi> his <hi>Appendix: Ignatiana;</hi> wherein, besides other Tracts, there are added the seven genuine Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> (commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Eusebius, Caesare,</hi> and other Fathers) according to the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam</hi> Edition, publisht by the learned Dr. <hi>Is. Vossius,</hi> from the <hi>Greek</hi> Manuscript in the <hi>Medicean</hi> Library, which the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate had some years before given him notice of, and also obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Great Duke's leave to Copy it. The signal use of these Epistles, so eminently asserting that perpetual order, of which his Grace was so great an Ornament, well deserved all that time which himself, Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and the learned Lord Bishop of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> have so usefully imployed therein.</p>
                  <p>This year my Lord Primate publisht his <hi>Syntagma de Editione LXX. Interpretum:</hi> in which he asserts (though with great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,) this particular Opinion. That <hi>Greek</hi> Version of the five Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> under <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus,</hi> utterly perishing at the Conflagration of his Library, <hi>Dositheus</hi> the Jew made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Greek</hi> Translation of the Pentateuch, and the rest of the Old Testament, about 177. years before the Birth of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of <hi>Ptolomey Philometor;</hi> Collecting so much from a Note at the end of the <hi>Greek, Esther;</hi> which latter Version his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship conjectures the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, and all the Eastern Churches cited, and made use of, instead of the true <hi>Philadelphian.</hi> Then he learnedly, and fully discourses concerning the several Editions of this latter Version found in the Library of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the last <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Queen. As also touching the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or vulgar, and that more correct one of <hi>Origen,</hi> those of <hi>Eusebius, Lucian,</hi> and <hi>Hesychius:</hi> and lastly, of the modern ones, as the <hi>Complutine, Venetian,</hi> and <hi>Roman.</hi> Hereunto also is added a Specimen of <hi>Esther</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> according to two Ancient Manuscripts in the <hi>Arundelian</hi> Library, as also after the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Copy in the King's Library.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Syntagma</hi> was followed the next year before his death, by his Lordships dissertation <hi>De Cainane altero,</hi> or the second <hi>Cainan,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>LXX.</hi> and by St. <hi>Luke.</hi> And that was again followed with a Letter to <hi>Ludovicus Capellus,</hi> wherein the Lord
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60492:33"/>
Primate very judiciously moderates, in the Controversie between that learned Professor, and <hi>Ar. Bootius,</hi> concerning the present <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Bibles:</hi> Superadding his own conjectures, That <hi>Dositheus,</hi> the false <hi>Messias,</hi> was the corrupter of the <hi>Samaritan Pentateuch,</hi> as we now have it: And that especially by his Lordships great care, and expence.</p>
                  <p>But to let you see how he further now imployed his time at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for his Majesties Service; I shall give you here his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to several <hi>Queries,</hi> made to him from some at <hi>London,</hi> or other Parliament Quarters, concerning the Lawfulness of taking up <hi>Arms</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> in that unhappy <hi>War,</hi> then newly begun. The <hi>Queries</hi> we have not, but you may easily judge what their sense was by the following <hi>Answers</hi> here inserted.</p>

About this time he also preached before the King on a Fast day; the Text, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways: Then will I hear from Heaven, and will forgive their Sin, and will heal their Land.</hi> In this Sermon, among other things suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the occasion, he had this remarkable passage, <hi>viz. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of our Eyes upon other mens sins more than upon our own, makes us to esteem the things we suffer, to be the injuries of men, and not the punishments of God: When the outward senses fail, we take it to be a sign of approaching death; and so when we are given over, to have Eyes, and see not, Ears, and hear not, it is an argument of decaying Souls: For as no Prayers or Fastings in the World can sanctifie a Rebellion, nor tempt God to own an unjust par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so neither will a good cause alone justifie us, any more than a true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without practice; we must first do our duties, otherwise, neither the one, nor the other will do us any good;</hi> with many other things against that looseness, and debauch'dness of manners, which he had observed in too many, who believed that the being of the right side, would atone for all other faults. Thus he neither spared, or flattered any, when his duty required him to speak the truth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove those sins that were most scandalous at that time, and place: He would also tell them in conversation, that such actions would frustrate all our hopes of success; for how could they expect, that God should bless their <hi>Arms,</hi> whilst they were fighting against him Nor was he less severe against the actions of the then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Houses against his Majesty,) and declared against the <hi>War</hi> they made, as wicked, and of fatal Consequence, and which cast an irreparable scandal upon the Reformed Religion; so that they thereby rendered themselves liable to the Censures of the Church, that might justly have been pronounced against them. And du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Treaty</hi> of Peace at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> he preached likewise before the <hi>King,</hi> on a Fast day, upon <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>The fruits of Righteousness is sown in Peace of them that make Peace:</hi> Wherein he shewed from <hi>vers.</hi> 16. the great evils which come of <hi>Contention, Strife,</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> and from whence they proceed, and the great happiness, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of <hi>Peace;</hi> and wished that those then up in <hi>Arms</hi> in a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious manner against their <hi>Prince,</hi> would seriously consider this, and speedily accept of those gracious Concessions that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty then offer'd, though all to no purpose, for the <hi>Treaty</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after broke off, the Rebels being too stout to yield to any equal Terms, and so that unhappy War (for a short time suspended) broke out again with greater violence, never ceasing, till at last it ended, not only with the murder of the best of Kings, but also with the loss, and destruction of those very Rights, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, for which these men pretended to shed so much blood.</p>

His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's necessities now not permitting him to leave many men in Garrisons, he was now forced to unfurnish this, as well as others, of its Souldiers, and Ammunition; so that Sir <hi>Timothy Tyrrel</hi> was forced to quit that Government; by reason of which the Arch-Bishop, being forced to remove, was in a great strait whether to go, the ways from thence to <hi>Oxford</hi> being all cut off by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, so that he had some thoughts (being near the Sea) of going over into <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> to both which places he had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly invited, as hath been already mentioned: But whilst he was in this perplexity, the Lady Dowager <hi>Stradling</hi> sent him a kind invitation to come to her Castle of St. <hi>Donates,</hi> as soon as he pleased, which he accepted as a great favour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60492:36"/>
But by that time he was ready to go (with his Daughter the Lady <hi>Tyrrel)</hi> the Country thereabouts was up in Arms, in a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous manner, to the number of Ten Thousand (as was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) who chose themselves Officers, to form them into a Body, pretending for the <hi>King,</hi> but yet would not be governed by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Commanders, or suffer any <hi>English</hi> Garrisons in the Country; this gave the Lord Primate a fresh disturbance, the <hi>Welch-men</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ways between that place, and St. <hi>Donates;</hi> but there were some at that time in <hi>Caerdiffe,</hi> who would needs undertake to convey the Lord Primate, and his company through by ways, so that they might avoid this tumultuous Rabble; which, though it might be well advised by the then Governor of <hi>Caerdiffe,</hi> and was faithfully enough executed by them that undertook it, yet happened very ill for my Lord, and those that were with him, for going by some private ways near the Mountains, they fell into a stragling Party, that were scouting thereabouts, who soon led them to their main Body, where it was Crime enough that they were <hi>English;</hi> so that they immediately fell to plundering, and breaking open my Lord Brimate's Chests of Books, and other things which he then had with him, ransacking all his Manuscripts, and Papers, many of them of his own hand writing; which were quickly dispersed among a thousand hands; and not content with this, they pulled the Lord Primate, and his Daughter, and other Ladies from their Horses; all which the Lord Primate bore with his wonted patience, and a seeming unconcernedness: But now some of their <hi>Officers</hi> coming in, (who were of the Gentry of the Country) seemed very much ashamed of this barbarous treatment, and by force, or fair means, caused their Horses, and other things which were taken from them to be restored; but as for the Books and Papers, they were got into too many hands to be then retrieved, nor were these Gentlemen satisfied with this, but some of them very civilly conducted him, through the rest of this tumultuous Rabble, to Sir <hi>John Aubery</hi>'s House, not far off, where he was civilly received, and lodged that Night: When he came thither, and had retired himself, I must confess, that I never saw him so much troubled in my life; and those that were with him before my self, said, That he seemed not more sensibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for all his losses in <hi>Ireland,</hi> than for this; saying to his Daughter, and those that endeavoured to comfort him; <hi>I know that it is God's hand, and I must endeavour to bear it patiently, though I have too much humane frailty, not to be extremely concerned, for I am tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in a very tender place, and He has thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60492:37"/>
Clergy came to Visit him, and to Condole this irreparable loss; promising to do their utmost endeavours, that what Books or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were not burnt or torn, should be restored; and so very civilly waited on him to St. <hi>Donates:</hi> And to let you see that these Gentlemen and Ministers, did not only promise, but were also able to perform it, they so used their power with the people, that publishing in the Churches all over those parts, That all that had any such Books, or Papers, should bring them to their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, or Landlords, which they accordingly did; so that in the space of two or three Months there were brought in to him, by parcels, all his Books and Papers, so fully, that being put altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we found not many wanting; those most remarkable, that I, or others can call to mind, were two Manuscripts, concerning the <hi>VValdenses,</hi> which he much valued, and which he had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward the continuing of his <hi>Ecclesiarum Christianarum Successione:</hi> As also another Manuscript, <hi>Catalogue of the</hi> Persian Kings, <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by</hi> Elikmannus; and one Volume of Manuscripts, <hi>Variae Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiones, of the New Testament:</hi> And of Printed Books, only <hi>Tully</hi>'s Works, and some others of less concernment.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Lord Primate was at St. <hi>Donates,</hi> till he could get his own Books and Papers again, he spent his time chiefly in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Books and Manuscripts in the Library in that <hi>Castle,</hi> and which had been collected by Sir <hi>Edward Stradling,</hi> a great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary, and friend of Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>'s, and out of some of these Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts the L. Primate made many choice Collections of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,</hi> or <hi>Welch</hi> Antiquity, which I have now in my Custody. Within a little more than a Month after my Lord Primate's coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was taken with a sharp and dangerous illness, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at first with the Strangury and suppression of Urine, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of torture, which at last caused a violent bleeding at the Nose, for near forty hours together, without any considerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission, no means applied could stop it, so that the <hi>Physicians,</hi> and all about him dispaired of his life, till at last (when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended he was expiring, it stanched of it self) for he lay a good while in a trance; but God had some farther work for him to perform, and was pleased by degrees to restore him to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer health, and strength; but it is worth the remembering, that whilst he was in the midst of his pain, as also his bleeding, he was still patient, praising God, and resigning up himself to his Will, and giving all those about him, or that came to visit him, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Heavenly advice to a Holy Life, and due preparation for death, e're its Agonies seized them, saying, <hi>It is a dangerous thing to leave all undone, till our last sickness; I fear a</hi> Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <hi>will avail us little, if we have lived vainly, and viciously, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected our Conversion, till we can sin no longer:</hi> Thus he exhorted us
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60492:37"/>
all to fear God, and love and obey the Lord Jesus Christ, and to live a Holy Life: <hi>And then</hi> (said he) <hi>you will find the comfort of it at your death: And your Change will be happy.</hi> While he was thus bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there came to visit him one of the then <hi>House of Commons,</hi> that was related by marriage to that Family: To whom he said, <hi>Sir, you see I am very weak, and cannot expect to live many hours, you are returning to the</hi> Parliament, <hi>I am going to God; my blood and life is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most spent: I charge you to tell them from me, That I know they are in the wrong, and have dealt very injuriously with the King, and I am not mistaken in this matter.</hi> After this, the Room being cleared of company, and only my self left with him, he spake somewhat to me about his own private concerns, giving orders how he would have his Books and Papers disposed of here, and elsewhere; and that those Books which he had borrowed, should be restored; and that if any friend would undertake to finish his <hi>Annals,</hi> he should have the use of his Papers, and Collections; he thought Dr. <hi>Langbaine</hi> the fittest man for that purpose, as being very well vers'd in those Studies, and so most able, (if willing) to undertake it: After some other discourse, I then made bold to ask him, if he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised the <hi>King</hi> to pass the Bill against the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> (as it had been reported.) To which he replyed, <hi>I know there is such a thing most wrongfully laid to my charge, for I neither gave, nor approved of any such advice, as that the King should assent to the Bill against the Earl, but on the contrary, told his Majesty, that if he was satisfied by what he had heard at his</hi> Tryal, <hi>that the</hi> Earl <hi>was not guilty of Treason, his Majesty ought not in Conscience to consent to his Condemnation: And this the King knows well enough, and can clear me if he pleases.</hi> Nor was my Lord Primate mistaken in this; for when not long after it was told his Majesty at <hi>Oxford</hi> that the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh</hi> was dead, he spake to Colonel <hi>William Leggt,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kirk,</hi> then of the Bed-Chamber, (as they were since to his late Majesty) to this effect, <hi>viz. That he was very sorry for his death, together with high expressions of his Piety, and Merits: But one there present replyed, That he believed he might be so, were it not for his perswading Your Majesty to consent to the Earl of</hi> Strafford<hi>'s Execution: To which the</hi> King <hi>in a great passion, returned, That it was false; For, said the</hi> King, <hi>after the Bill was past, the Arch-Bishop came to me, saying, (with Tears in his Eyes) Oh Sir, What have You done I fear that this Act may prove a great trouble to Your Conscience; and pray God that Your Majesty may never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by the Signing of this Bill, or words to that effect.</hi> This is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of two Certificates, taken at divers times under the hands of these two Gentlemen of unquestionable credit; both which, since they agree in substance, I thought fit to contract into one Testimony, which I have inferted here, having the <hi>Originals</hi> by me, to produce if occasion be. And now, I hope, after what
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60492:38"/>
hath been said to justifie my Lord Primate of this calumny, that no honest or Charitable person can believe it; but as for those who are so ill Natur'd, and Censorious, as to think, and speak ill of all men that do not fully comply with their Notions, and Opinions, it is no great matter what they either believe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Lord Primate was in <hi>Wales,</hi> there was published at <hi>London,</hi> under his name, by Mr. <hi>Downame,</hi> a Book Intitled, <hi>A Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Divinity, or the Sum and Substance of the Christian Religion,</hi> which being formerly lent by the Lord Primate, and transcribed by some who had borrowed it, but was not intended by him to be published, being only some Collections of his, out of several mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors, for his own private use, when he was a young man: And though he did, at the importunity of some friends, communicate it to them, yet it was not with a design to have it printed; but the Treatise at the end of this Book, Intitled, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, or the Incarnation of the Son of God,,</hi> is wholly my Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's, and is an excellent Discourse, being the substance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sermons he had formerly preacht upon that subject. There came out likewise, not long after, under his name, a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, Intitled, <hi>The Principles of Christian Religion,</hi> and was an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the former, and which he had extracted for his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Family, without any intention to be made Publick; but seeing, contrary to his mind, it had by many impressions been divulged, and that in a very faulty manner, he was resolved at last to review it, as well for his own Vindication, as the common good; and so much he thought fit to tell the Reader in his Preface to the <hi>Edition</hi> which himself published in the year 1653.</p>
                  <p>After the Lord Primate had fully recovered his strength at St. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1646</label> 
                     <hi>Donates,</hi> and been most kindly entertained, and tenderly used during his great weakness, by the <hi>Lady</hi> of that place, he began now to consider where next to remove, but the <hi>King</hi>'s Affairs growing every day more desperate, and <hi>Oxford</hi> like speedily to be taken; there was no returning thither; nor yet had he a mind to trust himself at <hi>London,</hi> the Faction there being very much exasperated against him, therefore he began to reassume his former thoughts of passing beyond the <hi>Seas,</hi> and upon this endeavoured to get a Vessel for his Transportation (having before obtained a Pass from the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> then Admiral, for that purpose,) but when we had now procured him a Vessel, and that we were preparing to go to it, there came into the Road, before <hi>Caerdiffe,</hi> a Squadron of Ships, under the Command of one <hi>Molton,</hi> Vice-Admiral for the <hi>Parliament:</hi> Whereupon my Lord Primate sent me to him (being then on shoar at <hi>Caerdiffe)</hi> to know if he would suffer him to go by him; and I shewed him the Pass aboye mentioned, to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60492:38"/>
which <hi>Molton</hi> returned a rude, and threatening answer, absolutely refusing it, and saying, If he could get him into his hands, he would carry him Prisoner to the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and threatned like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to send me also to his Ship: By which you may see how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inraged those of that Faction were at this good Bishop, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereing to the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He being thus disappointed in this design, attempted it no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And not long after came to him a most kind invitation from that noble Lady, the Countess Dowager of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> to come and make his abode with her, and she would engage that he should not be molested, but have all accomodations suitable to his condition, and the great affection and esteem she had for him, as a return for those benefits she had formerly received from him, in converting her Lord, and securing her self from Popery, as has been already related: So, after some consideration, he thought fit to accept this kind proffer; and after having obtained Passes for his Journey, he left St. <hi>Donates,</hi> after almost a years residence there.</p>
                  <p>But it must not be here forgotten, That before he left <hi>Wales,</hi> the great expences of his sickness, and removals in the year past, had much reduced him, as to his Purse, nor knew he where to get it supplyed; when it pleased God to put it into the hearts of divers worthy Persons of that Countrey, to consider that the Lord Primate had not only suffered much by the rudeness of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (as hath been already related) but also by a long, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive sickness: So they sent him, unknown to each other, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers considerable Sums; so that he had in a few weeks enough to supply all his present occasions, and also to defray the expences of his Journey into <hi>England.</hi> This the good Bishop accounted a special Providence, and was very thankful for it: And I thought good to take notice of it, that it may serve as a memorial of the high Generosity and Charity of the Gentry of this Countrey at that time. So that considering all those fore-mentioned occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, the Lord Primate might very well say with St. <hi>Paul, In</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Journeyings often, in perils of Waters, in perils of Robbers, in perils among false Brethren, in Weariness, and Painfulness, in Afflictions, Necessities, in Tumults, in evil, and good Report:</hi> Yet in all these Tryals he could still say, <hi>Though chastned, yet not killed, as sorrowful, yet rejoicing, though poor, yet making many rich,</hi> &amp;c. So that in all these dispensations he fainted not, his Faith and Patience were still Victorious.</p>
                  <p>So the Lord Primate arrived safe at the Countess of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>'s House in <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>June</hi> following, where he was most kindly received by her; and from this time he commonly resided with her, at some or other of her Houses till his death; where now he met with a fresh disturbance, there was an Order of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>

                  <p>About the beginning of this year, he was chosen by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Society of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> to be their Preacher, which, after <label type="milestone">

Here

he was most kindly received, and treated with all respect and honour, constantly preaching all the <hi>Term</hi> time, for almost Eight years, till at last his Eye-sight, and Teeth, beginning to fail him, so that he could not be well heard in so large a Congregation, he was forced, about a year and half before his death, to quit that place, to the great trouble of that <hi>Honourable Society.</hi> About this time he published his <hi>Diatriba de Romanae Ecclesiae Symbolo Apostolico vetere, &amp; aliis fidei formulis,</hi> wherein he gives a learned account of that which is commonly called, <hi>The Apostles Creed,</hi> and shews the various Copies which were used in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> with other forms of Confessions of Faith, that were wont to be proposed to the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and younger sort of People, in the <hi>Eastern,</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Churches; together with several other Monuments of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity relating to the same.

finding the Independant party too strong for them, had no way left to secure themselves, but by recalling their Votes of Non-Addresses, and to Vote a <hi>Treaty</hi> with his Majesty in the <hi>Isle of Wight:</hi> And because the differences concerning Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were not the least of those that were to be setled, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at this <hi>Treaty,</hi> and for which it was necessary for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to consult with some of his Bishops, and Divines, the Lord Primate was sent for by the King, among divers others, to attend him, for that purpose; when he came thither, he found one of the greatest points then in debate, was about the Government of the Church: The <hi>Parliament</hi> Commissioners insisting peremptorily for the abolishing, and taking away Arch-Bishops, Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> His Majesty thought he could not with a good Conscience consent to that demand, <hi>(viz.)</hi> totally to abolish, or take away Episcopal Government: but his Majesty then declared, that he no otherwise aimed at the keeping up the present <hi>Hierarchy</hi> in the Church, than what was most agreeable to the Episcopal Government in the Primitive and purest Times: But his Majesty (since the Parliament insisted so obstinately on it) was at last forced to consent to the <note n="*" place="margin">See His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Message sent by Capt. <hi>Titus,</hi> 1648.

But now to stop the present career of the Presbyterian Discipline, the Lord Primate proposed an expedient, which he called Episcopal and Presbyterial Government conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which he, not long after he came thither, delivered into his Majesty's hands, who having perused it, liked it well, saying, it was the only Expedient to reconcile the present differences; for his Majesty, in his last Message to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> had before conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to the reducing of Episcopal Government, into a much narrower compass, <hi>viz.</hi> Not only to the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Institution; but much farther than the Lord Primate proposed or desired, <note place="margin">See his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Message by Major <hi>Cromwal.</hi> 21. <hi>Nov.</hi> 1648.

                     <hi>Prince;</hi> which, as it was the cause of his Majesty's destruction, so it proved their own ruine. But since some of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have been pleased to judge very hardly of this Proposal made by the Arch-Bishop, as if it too much debased the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Order, and levelled it with that of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> To vindicate the Lord Primate from which imputation, I desire them to consider these particulars; first, the time when this Expedient was proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> When his Majesty had already consented to the suspension of <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government for three years absolutely, as also for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Presbytery</hi> in the room of it for that time, and for quite taking away <hi>Arch-Bishops, Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi> &amp;c. (as hath been already said,) whereas the Lord Primate's Expedient proposes none of these, but supposes the <hi>Arch-Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Primates</hi> ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, appointing them to be the moderators of the <hi>Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi> of <hi>Suffragans,</hi> and <hi>Pastors:</hi> And though it is true, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Bishops, as to be only Presidents of the <hi>Diocesan Synod,</hi> yet he no where denies them a Negative Voice in that Assembly; and though he mentions at the beginning of this Expedient, that the Bishops were wont in the Primitive times to do nothing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without the advice of a <hi>Synod</hi> of their <hi>Clergy,</hi> (as he proves from divers quotations out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and Ancient <hi>Councils;)</hi> yet he does not assert this practice, as a thing of Divine, or unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable right, but only as the custom, and practice of the Church in those Times, which being only prudential, may be altered one way, or other, according as the peace and order of the <hi>Church,</hi> or the exigency of Affairs may require; and though in <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. of this Expedient, he proposes the making of as many <hi>Suffragans</hi> in each <hi>Diocess,</hi> as there are <hi>Rural Deanries</hi> in the same, and who should assemble a <hi>Synod</hi> of all the <hi>Rectors,</hi> or <hi>Ministers</hi> of their Precinct; yet their power was only to be according to the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of the 26th. of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, whereby they are expresly forbid to act in any matters, but by the Authority of, and in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to their <hi>Diocesan Bishop;</hi> nor does the Lord Primate here extend their power farther, than to be moderators of this les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser <hi>Synod,</hi> where matters of Discipline, and Excommunication only were to be determined, still reserving the power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Diocesan,</hi> this being no where given from him in this Expedient; neither was this power of Excommunication left ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to this lesser <hi>Synod,</hi> without an Appeal to the <hi>Diocesan Synod</hi> of the <hi>Suffragans,</hi> and the rest of the Pastors wherein the Bishop was to preside: only I shall say thus much, That it was not the Lord Primate's design, or intention, in the least, to rob the <hi>Bishops</hi> of any of those just Rights, which are essentially neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to their Order, and Constitution, and without abasing <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> into <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or stripping the Church of its Lands, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,

                     <q>The <hi>Regal</hi> power which comes by Descent, is described by a double Excellency;</q> 
                     <hi>The Excellency of Dignity, and the Excellency of Power:</hi> By Dignity we understand</p>
                  <q>
                     <p> all outward Glory; by Power, all Dominion: And these are the two branches of Majesty.

But what need I say any more, we all swear that the King is the Only Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in his Dominions.

                     </q> And after he had enlarged somewhat on these points, he added this: <q>
                        <hi>In the word of a King there is power, saith the Preacher:</hi> It was wont to be so; and by the word of God it ought to be so. I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon this, but some Ears will not endure sound Doctrine. The <hi>King,</hi> you see, must be acknowledged to be Supreme, and no Superior to the <hi>King</hi> on Earth: far be it from me to flatter any man, I thank God I fear no flesh, but do deliver the Truth. This day is the <hi>Birth-day</hi> of our Sovereign Lord. <hi>Birth-days</hi> of Kings have been usually Celebrated with great Solemnity in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; it pleaseth God, that this day begins the 49th. year of his Majesty's life, and let me call it the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> to his Majesty. The <hi>Jews</hi> had a Custom, that in the 49th. year of any mans life, he should be at liberty, whatever his sufferings were before. It must be the desire and prayer of every Loyal heart, that the <hi>King</hi> may have a <hi>Jubilee</hi> indeed: This is that which Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty bids us do. I will not stand too much upon this particular; but this I will say, Oh! that we knew our happiness, to have a <hi>King that is the Son of Nobles;</hi> a King that is not a Child; a King that is at full Age to Govern by Wisdom, and Prudence: And truly as God gives us this blessing, so he expects we should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it thankfully, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Wo be to thee O Land,</hi> (saith the Preacher) <hi>when the King is a Child!</hi> To have him, when his experience hath riveted in him sound judgment, and ability to Govern. The Lord threatned <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>I will give Children to be their Princes, and Babes shall rule over them.</hi> Those that would have their own Wills, could (I warrant you) be content that the youngest should Reign. To have a base man exalted, is one of the things that the Earth cannot bear: but some Body must have the <hi>Government,</hi> it doth not belong to  all, you see here is one that alone hath a right to it.</q> After which, he concluded to this effect, <q>That all true Christians are the First-born of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>The Congregation of the First-born;</hi> they are all Heirs of Heaven; in the same relation that Christ is by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are by Grace, and Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This Sermon, together with the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi>'s steady carriage in the point of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> did so much enrage both the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and <hi>Independant</hi> Factions, that in their News Books, and Pamphlets at <hi>London,</hi> they reproach'd the Lord Primate for flattering the King, as also for his perswading him not to abolish <hi>Bishops;</hi> and that he had very much prejudiced the Treaty; and that none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the King's Chaplains had been so mischievous (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Them) as He; which reproaches, whether the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate did deserve, or not, I leave to the candid <hi>Readers,</hi> both of the said Sermon, and Reconciliation above mentioned, to judge; I am sure his Majesty's Affairs were in as ill a condition to tempt any man to flatter him, as the temper of his Soul was then to suffer it: But the truth is, the Lord Primate did no more than assert his Majesty's just Rights and Prerogative, then trampled upon; and it was no more than what he had both preached and written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that Treatise, since published, <hi>Of the Power of the Prince, and Obedience of the Subject.</hi>

Nor will it be impertinent here to relate a passage that happened to the Lord Primate, at the time of his Majesty's murther: The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s House (where my Lord then lived) being just over against <hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> divers of the Countesse's Gentlemen, and Servants, got upon the Leads of the House, from whence they could see plainly what was acting before <hi>White-Hall:</hi> as soon as his Majesty came upon the Scaffold, some of the House-hold came, and told my Lord Primate of it, and askt him if he would see the King once more before he was put to death: My Lord was at first unwilling, but was at last perswaded to go up; as well out of his desire to see his Majesty once again; as also curiosity, since he could scarce believe what they told him, unless he saw it: When he came upon the Leads, the King was in his Speech; the Lord Primate stood still, and said nothing, but sighed; and lifting up his Hands and Eyes (full of Tears) towards Heaven, seemed to pray earnestly; but when his Majesty had done spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and had pulled off his Cloak and Doublet, and stood strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in his Wastcoat, and that the Villains in Vizards began to put up his hair, the good Bishop no longer able to endure so dismal a sight, and being full of grief, and horror for that most wicked Fact now ready to be Executed, grew pale, and began to faint; so that if he had not been observed by his own Servant, and some others that stood near him (who thereupon supported him) he had swounded away. So they presently carried him down, and laid him on his Bed, where he used those powerful weapons which God has left his People in such Afflictions, <hi>viz. Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Tears;</hi> Tears, that so horrid a sin should be committed, and Prayers, that God would give his Prince patience, and constancy to undergo these cruel Sufferings; and that he likewise would not (for the vindication of his own Honour and Providence) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit so great a wickedness to pass unpublished. This I received from my Lord Primate's <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>James Tyrrel.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1650</label> great and long expected work of the <hi>Annals</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> from the beginning of the World to <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3828. as far as to the Reign of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> in which he has very exactly fixed the three great <hi>Epocha's</hi> of the Deluge, the going of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> from their Captivity in the first year of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> which is the only certain <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> or rule of conjoyning the Sacred with Prophane <hi>Chronology.</hi> In this Volume he gives a most exact account of the Reigns of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> with their <hi>Synchronisms:</hi> As also the Succession of the <hi>Babylonish, Persian,</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Monarchs; with the concurrent <hi>Olympiads,</hi> and <hi>Aera</hi> of <hi>Nabonussar,</hi> and the most remarkable Eclypses of the Sun; as they might any way serve to regulate the account of time, which he has collected out of all Authors, both Sacred, and Prophane, with singular Industry, Learning and Judgment.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Lord Primate had finished, and published <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1654</label> the second part of his <hi>Annals;</hi> beginning with <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and continued to the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by <hi>Titus Vespasian:</hi> In which Volume he has given an exact account of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Empire,</hi> under the <hi>Asiatick,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings, reducing their Reigns to a more certain Calculation, than ever had been done before, and restoring several of them to their due Places, and Times, which had been omitted by other writers of <hi>Chronological History:</hi> as also an account of the Affairs of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> especially those relating to the <hi>Oriental</hi> Parts thereof; together with a History of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> from the Birth of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> to <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 73. out of the Holy Scriptures, as also from the best <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors that have written of those Times. So that these two Volumes may well be accounted of as the most useful, as well as the Learned'st Works he ever wrote, and are a Repository, or Common-place of all <hi>Ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot now omit to take Notice, That <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> to make the World believe that he did not persecute men for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had for some time before this shewed favour to some of the <hi>Orthodox Clergy;</hi> as particularly to Dr. <hi>Brownrig,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> whom he had sent for, and treated with great outward respect; and as for Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who had been the Lord Primate's Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was after Dean of <hi>Kilmore, Cromwell</hi> having sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60492:45"/>
his life at the taking of <hi>Droghedah,</hi> had made him his <hi>Almoner</hi> here: So that it is the less wonder if he also sent for the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to come to him; who was at first unwilling to go, but upon 2d. thoughts, considering that his refusal would but exasperate him the more, against himself, and the rest of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the King's party, and that perhaps he might thereby prevail with him to do some Good, or at least hinder him from acting some greater Evil, he went accordingly, and was received by <hi>Cromwell</hi> with great outward kindness, and civility; what the conversation was in particular, I cannot tell, but as I have heard, it was chiefly about advancing the <hi>Protestant</hi> Interest, as well at home as abroad, (to which <hi>Cromwell</hi> made great pretences,) but be it as it will, you may be sure he was too great an <hi>Enthusiast</hi> to take my Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's advice; and so after a great deal of Canting discourse, he civily dismist him: But whether now, or at any other time, <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> bestowed any Gratuity, or Pension upon him, I know not; nor do at all believe, notwithstanding a late <note n="†" place="margin">Before the late Edition of the <hi>Body of Divinity.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> writer of his life, (I know not upon what grounds) has made bold to say so: only this much I remember, my Lord Primate said, that <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> had promised to make him a Lease of some part of the Lands belonging to the <hi>Arch-Bishoprick of Armagh</hi> for 21 years, which my Lord Primate thought it no harm to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, considering it was but his own, and which he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of above half that time, especially in consideration of his <hi>Daughter,</hi> and many <hi>Grand-Children,</hi> for whom he had as yet been able to do nothing: And if the Church did happen to be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before that time, it could lose nothing by this Grant; and if not, he thought his Children might as well deserve to reap the benefit of it, as others; but though Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Reader,</hi> before the life of the Lord Primate, was made by <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Secretary, (who then had the <hi>Copy</hi> in his power) to publish, as if this Grant had been really past; yet the Usurper was craftier then so; and as he delayed the passing of it as long as the Lord Primate lived; so after his death he made a pretence, by imputing malignancy (which was indeed Loyalty) to the Lord Primate's Son-in-law, and Daughter, to free himself from that promise.</p>
                  <p>This year, about the beginning of Winter, the most Learned Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> happening to dye, the Lord Primate was desired by Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> and the rest of his <hi>Executors,</hi> to preach his Funeral Sermon; which (though he had now left off preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great Congregations) yet he now granted, as well out of respect to those two above mentioned, as also to the deceased, between whom, and himself there had been so long an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, so he preached at the <hi>Temple-Church</hi> (where he was buried)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60492:45"/>
giving him all the <hi>Elogies</hi> which so great and Learned a man could deserve, though to the lessening of himself, having this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage (among others) in his Sermon, that he looked upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son deceased as so great a Scholar, that himself was scarce worthy to carry his Books after him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwell</hi> being now highly enraged against the Loyal Party, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1655</label> for their indefatigable (though unsuccessful endeavours) for his Majesty's Restauration to his Throne, after he had shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self very implacable and severe to the <hi>Cavalier Gentry,</hi> (as they then called them) began now to discharge part of his rage upon the <hi>Orthodox Clergy,</hi> forbidding them, under great penalties, to teach Schools, or to perform any part of their Ministerial Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whereupon some of the most considerable <hi>Episcopal</hi> Clergy, in, and about <hi>London,</hi> desired my Lord Primate, that he would use his Interest with <hi>Cromwell,</hi> (since they heard he pretended a great respect for him) that as he granted Liberty of Conscience, to almost all sorts of Religions, so the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Divines might have the same freedom of serving God in their private Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, (since they were not permitted the publick Churches) according to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ministers, nor those that frequented that Service, might be any more hindered, or disturbed by his <hi>Souldiers.</hi> So accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their desires, he went, and used his utmost endeavours with <hi>Cromwell,</hi> for the taking off this restraint, which was at last pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, (though with some difficulty) that they should not be molested, provided they medled not with any matters relating to his Government: But when the Lord Primate went to him a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, to get this promise Ratified, and put into Writing, he found him under his <hi>Chyrurgeons</hi> hands, who was dressing a great Boyl, which he had on his Breast; so <hi>Cromwell</hi> prayed the Lord Primate to sit down a little, and that when he was dressed he would speak with him; whilst this was a doing, <hi>Cromwell</hi> said to my Lord Primate, If this Core (pointing to the Boyl) were once out, I should quickly be well; to whom the good Bishop replyed, I doubt the Core lies deeper; there is a Core at the heart that must be taken out, or else it will not be well; Ah! replyed he, (seeming unconcerned) so there is indeed, and sighed. But when the Lord Primate began to speak to him concerning the business he came about, he answered him to this effect, That he had since better considered it, having advised with his <hi>Council</hi> about it, and that they thought it not safe for him to grant liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conscience to those sort of men, who are restless, and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies to him, and his Government; and so he took his leave of him, though with good words, and outward civility: The Lord Primate seeing it was in vain to urge it any farther,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60492:46"/>
said little more to him, but returned to his Lodgings very much troubled, and concerned that his endeavours had met with no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter success; when he was in his Chamber, he said to some of his Relations, and my self, that came to see him, <hi>This false man hath broken his word with me, and refuses to perform what he promised; well, he will have little cause to glory in his wickedness, for he will not continue long; the King will return; though I shall not live to see it, you may: The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment both in</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> State <hi>is in confusion, the</hi> Papists <hi>are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their</hi> Projects, <hi>and making such advantages as will hardly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after this <hi>viz.</hi> about the midle of <hi>February</hi> following, he went from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Rygate,</hi> taking his last leave of his Friends and Relations, who never had the happiness to see him again: As soon as he came thither, he set himself to finish his <hi>Chronologia Sacra,</hi> which took up most of that little time he after lived; he was now very Aged, and though both his Body and mind were healthy, and vigorous for a man of his years; yet his Eye-sight was extremely decayed by his constant studying, so that he could scarce see to write, but at a Window, and that in the Sun-shine, which he constantly followed in clear days, from one Window to another; so that had he lived, he intended to have made use of an <hi>Ammanuensis:</hi> He had now frequent thoughts of his dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as he was wont every year to Note in his <hi>Almanack,</hi> over against the day of his <hi>Birth,</hi> the year of his <hi>Age,</hi> so I find this year 1655. this Note written with his own hand: Now Aged 75 years, <hi>My Days are full;</hi> and presently after in Capital Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>RESIGNATION:</hi> From which we may gather, that he now thought the days of his Pilgrimage to be fulfilled, and that he now wholly resigned up himself to God's Will, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>Not long before his death, going to <hi>Rygate,</hi> I preached a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon there, where this good Bishop was present, after Church, he was pleased to confer with me in private (as 'twas usual with him so to do) and he spake to this effect; <hi>I thank you for your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I am going out of this World, and I now desire, according to you Text,</hi> To seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the <note place="margin">

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60492:46"/>
been there already, freed from the Body, and all Terrene affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and he seemed as if he were seriously considering his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual State, and making ready for his <hi>departure,</hi> which he now shortly expected. But since it had been usual with him to insist on things of this Nature, when we were together, and that he was at this time in health, I did not believe that his <hi>Change</hi> was so near, as he presaged; yet he himself had other thoughts, and it proved he was not mistaken; for on the 20th. of <hi>March,</hi> (the day he fell sick) after he had been most part of it, as long as he had light at his Study, he went from thence to visit a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then sick in the House, giving her most excellent prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for death, together with other holy advice, for almost an hour, and that in such a Heavenly manner, as if, like <hi>Moses</hi> upon <hi>Mount Pisgah,</hi> he had then a prospect of the <hi>Celestial Canaan;</hi> that Night, after Supper, he first complained of his hip, judging it to be a touch of the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> which he had many years agone; next Morning early he complained of a great pain in his side; a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician</hi> being sent for, prescribed what he thought convenient in that case, but it could not thereby be removed, but rather encreased more and more upon him, which he bore with great patience for 13 or 14 hours, but his strength, and spirits decaying, he wholly applied himself to prayer, and therein had the assistance of the <hi>Countesse's Chaplain;</hi> upon some abatement of the torture, he advised those about him to provide for death, in the time of health, that then they might have nothing else to do but to dye: Then taking his leave of the <hi>Countess of Peterborough,</hi> by whom he had been so long, and kindly entertained, and giving her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thanks for all her kindness to him, with excellent Spiritual Counsel, as a return for all her favours: Then he desired to be left to his own private Devotions: After which, the last words he was heard to utter, (about One of the Clock in the Afternoon) praying for forgiveness of Sins, were these, <hi>viz. O Lord forgive me, especially my sins of Omission:</hi> So presently after this, (in sure hopes of a glorious Immortality) he fell asleep, to the great grief, and affliction of the said <hi>Countess,</hi> who could never sufficiently lament her own, and the <hi>Churches</hi> great loss, by his too sudden departure out of this life. Thus dyed this humble, and holy man, praying for his sins of <hi>Omission,</hi> who was never known to <hi>omit</hi> his duty, or scarce to have let any time slip, wherein he was not imployed in some good action, or other; and if such a man thought he had so much to beg pardon for; what an account must those have to make, who scarce bestow any of their time as they ought to do He had been when he died 55 years a Minister (and almost all that time a constant Preacher,) near 14 years a Professor of Divinity in the Univesity of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and several years <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> of the same,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60492:47"/>
he sat Bishop of <hi>Meath</hi> near 4 years, and one and thirty years Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> being from St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> the 100 Bishop of that See.</p>
                  <p>As soon as his Relations received the sad news of his death, they gave orders for his interment at <hi>Rygate,</hi> where he dyed, the Honourable <hi>Countess,</hi> with whom he had lived and dyed, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to have him buried in her own Vault, in order to which, his Relations (being then not near) it was thought fit to preserve the Corps by such means as are proper in that case; so a <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi> being sent for, the Body was opened, and a great deal of Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated blood found setled in his left side, which shewed that the <hi>Physician</hi> had mistook his disease, not expecting a <hi>Pleurisie</hi> in a man of above 75 years of Age. But now whilst they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring speedily to bury him, some or other put it into <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s head, how much it would be for the Lord Primate's, as well as his own honour, to have him solemnly buried; which he approving of, and thinking it a good way to make himself Popular, because he well knew what great reputation the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed had among all Ranks and Degrees of men: Whereupon he presently caused an Order to be drawn, and sent to the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's Son-in-law, and Daughter, straitly forbidding them to bury his Body any where else, than at <hi>Westminster Abby,</hi> for that his Highness (as he then called himself) intended a Publick Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for him: This Command his Relations durst not disobey, (as the Times then were) though it was much against their Wills, perceiving well enough the <hi>Usurper</hi>'s design, that (as it was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, so) it would make more for his own honour, than that of the deceased Primate, and withal perceiving (what accordingly happened) that he would never defray half the expence of such a solemn Funeral, which therefore would cause the greatest part of the charge to fall upon them (though they were least able to bear it,) and yet he would reap all the glory of it. I should not have said so much on this subject, had it not been to shew the World the intriguing subtilty of this <hi>Usurper,</hi> even in this small Affair; and that for the expence of about 200 <hi>l.</hi> out of the <hi>Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dands</hi> in his <hi>Amoner</hi>'s hands, (which was nothing at all to him) he was able to put those he accounted his Enemies, to treble that charge: However (since it could not be avoided) the Corps was kept unburied, till the 17th. of <hi>April</hi> following, when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from <hi>Rygate</hi> towards <hi>London,</hi> being met, and attended by the Coaches of most of the Persons of Quality then in Town, the <hi>Clergy</hi> in, and about <hi>London,</hi> waiting on the Hearse from <hi>Somerset</hi> House to the <hi>Abby Church,</hi> where the Crowd was so great, that there was forced to be a Guard, to prevent the rudeness of the people: The Body being brought into the Quire, Dr. <hi>Nicholas</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:60492:47"/>
                     <hi>Bernard,</hi> (then Preacher of <hi>Grays-Inn)</hi> preached his Sermon; his discourse was on 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 1. <hi>And Samuel died, and all Israel were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him:</hi> Of which I shall say nothing more, since it is in print, and is but, for the most part, an account of his life, which we now give you more at large. The Sermon ended, the Corps was conveyed to the Grave in St. <hi>Erasmus</hi> Chappel, and there buried by the said Dr. according to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> his Grave being next to Sir <hi>James Fullerton</hi>'s, once his School-Master; there waiting a glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, with those that dye in the faith of our Lord Jesus: Many Tears were shed at his <hi>Obsequies,</hi> the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> being full of the singular Piety, Learning, and Worth of the deceased Primate; which, though it fall not to every man's Lot to equal, yet it is his duty to follow so good an example, as far as he is able, <hi>Quamvis non passibus aequis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place I shall give you a faithful account (without flattery) of his personal Qualifications, Opinions, and Learning. As for his outward form, he was indifferent tall, and well shaped, and went always upright to the last; his Hair naturally Brown, when young; his Complexion Sanguine; his Countenance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Gravity, and good Nature; his Carriage free; a presence that commanded both Respect, and Reverence; and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pictures have been made of him, the Air of his face was so hard to hit, that I never saw but <note n="†" place="margin">Drawn by Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Knighted.</note> one that was like him: He was of a strong and healthy Constitution, so that he said, That for the most part of his life, he very rarely felt any pain in his head, or stomach; in his youth he had been troubled with the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> and some years after that, with a long <hi>Quartan Ague,</hi> besides the fit of the <hi>Strangury</hi> and <hi>Bleeding</hi> above mentioned, but he never had the <hi>Gout,</hi> or <hi>Stone:</hi> A little sleep served his turn; and even in his last years, though he went to Bed pretty late, yet in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he would rise by five, and in the Winter by six of the Clock in the Morning; his Appetite was always suited to his dyet, he would feed heartily on plain, wholsom Meat, without Sauce, and better pleased with a few Dishes, than with great Varieties; nor did he love to tast of what he was not used to Eat: He liked not tedious Meals, it was a weariness to him, to sit long at <hi>Table;</hi> but what ever he Eat, or Drank, was never offensive to his Stomach, or Brain, for he never exceeded at the greatest Feast; and I have heard some <hi>Physicians</hi> impute the easieness of his Digestion to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very particular, in the frame of his Body, for when the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon</hi> had opened him, he found a thick <hi>Membrane</hi> lined with Far, which (as I suppose) was but a continuation of the <hi>Omentum,</hi> which extended it self quite over his Stomach, and was fastened
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60492:48"/>
above to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> somewhat below the <hi>Diaphragma,;</hi> so that I have heard him say, he never felt his heart beat in the most Exercise; and the <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi> said, That had it not belonged to the Body of a Person of his Eminency, he would have taken it out, and preserved it, as a rarity which he had never found, or heard of in any other Body besides, and therefore the quickness of his Digestion considered, it was no wonder if he bred blood so fast as he did, so that he used to have frequent Evacuations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, from the Veins on one side of his Tongue, but more usually in some lower parts of his Body, to the stopage of which (for some time before his death) may very well be ascribed that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper which was the cause of it.</p>
                  <p>As for his natural temper, and disposition, he was of a free, and easie humour, not morose, proud, or imperious, but courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and affable, and extremely obliging towards all he convers'd with; and though he could be angry, and rebuke sharply when he ought, (that is, when <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Vertue</hi> were concerned,) yet he was not easily provoked to passion, rarely for smaller matters, such as the neglects of Servants, or worldly disappointments: He was of so sweet a nature, that I never heard he did an injury, or ill Office to any man, or revenged any of those that had been done to him, but could readily forgive them, as our blessed Lord and Master enjoyns: Nor envyed he any man's happiness, or vilified any man's Person, or Parts; nor was he apt to Censure, or Condemn any man upon bare reports, but observed that rule of the Son of <hi>Syrach, Blame not before thou hast examined the Truth;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>understand first, and then rebuke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His natural endowments were so various, and so great, as sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are to be met with in one man, <hi>viz.</hi> a Fertile Invention, a Tenacious Memory, with a Solid and Well-weigh'd Judgment; whereby he was always, from a young man, presently furnished for any Exercise he was put upon, which lay within the compass of those studies he had applied himself to; so that in short, that Character given of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> might be very well applied to him, <hi>viz. Insignis erat sanctissimi praesulis mansuetudo, ac miranda animi lenitas, &amp; quaedam invincibilis clementia: Linguam habebat ab omni petulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, &amp; convitiis puram, Ingenii felicitas prorsus erat incomparabilis, sive spectes ingenii acumen, vel obscurissima facile penetrans, sive capacis memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae fidem, sive vim quandam Mentis indefatigabilem,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But that which is above all, he was endowed with that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from above, <hi>Which is Pure, Peaceable, Gentle, easie to be Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi>

that when he was in prosperity (besides the large <hi>Alms</hi> with which he daily fed the attendants at his door) he gave a great deal away in money, keeping many of the <hi>Irish</hi> poor Children at School, and allowing several Stipends to necessitous Scholars at the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,</hi> not to mention other Objects which he still found out, on whom to bestow his Charity: And after the <hi>Irish Rebellion,</hi> when he himself was in a manner bereft of all, it is incredible to think how liberal he was to poor Ministers, or their Widows, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that had been undone by that wicked Insurrection; and I scarce ever knew he refused an <hi>Alms</hi> to any person, whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be really in want, insomuch that I have heard this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage from his Servant, who then waited on him, That once at <hi>London,</hi> (when he was out of the way) there was brought to my Lord a poor <hi>Irish</hi> Woman, pretending great necessity, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either somewhat displeased to be called off from his Study, (upon which he was then very intent,) or perhaps he might not have at that time much to spare, told her in short, He was not able to relieve all that came to him upon that account, if he did, he should soon have nothing left for himself; which this poor Woman was so far from taking ill, that she went away praying for him, which he immediately reflecting, was much concerned at, for fear he should have neglected his duty, when a fit <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> was offered him; wherefore he presently commanded some of my <hi>Lady</hi>'s Servants, to run after her, and if possible, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her and bring her back, but they could not light of her: So when his Servant returned home, he told him this accident with great concern, ordering him to go the next day to some places, where such people used to resort, to inquire out such a Woman, (whom he described, as exactly as he could, to him) which orders his man obeyed, though without success: At which his Lord was much troubled; and could she have been found, no question but she would have been very well rewarded for her being sent away empty the day before by him.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithstanding all these Vertues, none was more humble, and free from vain glory, than this person, who was endowed with them; so that what high esteem soever others might have of him, he never put any value on himself, but was little in his own thoughts, and would often bewail his own infirmities, and the want of those Graces he thought he saw in others, and which he most earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired: He was so great a lover of real <hi>Piety,</hi> that he thought no other accomplishments worth speaking of, without it; and he heartily loved, and respected all humble, devout Christians, and would always say, they were <hi>God's Jewels,</hi> highly to be valued, and with these (though of the meanest condition) he would gladly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, speaking kindly to them, causing them to sit down by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60492:49"/>
him, and if they were bashful he would encourge them, to speak their minds freely in any words, that might best express their love to God, and the State of their Souls; and he was so skilful a <hi>Physician</hi> in Spiritual matters, that he could readily perceive eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man's case, and necessities, and would apply suitable remedies thereunto; if wavering, to settle them; if doubting, to resolve them; if sad, to comfort them; if fallen into a fault, to restore them, administering means to prevent the like Temptations; nor did he neglect any opportunities by good advice, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, to reclaim those that were corrupted with Errors, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: So that in all his discourses, as well publick, as private, he still endeavoured to bring Religion into reputation, and to make sin, and a wicked course of life odious, shameful, and destructive to the Souls and Bodies of men: And he would press this point with such a concerned earnestness; that one would have believed those to whom he then applied himself, must needs resolve not to love sin any longer: And on the other side, he would so mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the happiness, and excellencies of a Vertuous and Pious Life, that one would have thought that none could withstand such powerful perswasions.</p>
                  <p>And as this holy man was never better pleased than when he saw the grace of God manifested in any, so was he never grieved at any thing more, than at the great decay of sound <hi>Religion,</hi> and Christian <hi>Piety,</hi> which too much prevailed in those days, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the mighty encrease of both Spiritual, and Fleshly Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, as <hi>Heresies,</hi> and <hi>Schisms,</hi> and unchristian Animosities; with Debauchery, and Prophaneness, (so contrary to the nature of true <hi>Christianity,)</hi> which had so over-run, and infected this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, during those times of Licentiousness, and Confusion: For these things he would frequently express his grief, saying, These were the sad <hi>Presages</hi> of greater miseries, that will befal this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and make way for <hi>Popery,</hi> to which our own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, and wicked Lives, give the greatest advantage; and that these at length would prove a Scourge to the Nation, if not cause the greatest blow that had been ever given to the Reformed <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> These things he spake (not as pretending to <hi>Prophecy,</hi> but) from the then present evil Aspect of those Times.</p>
                  <p>And as this Religious man was always well imployed himself, so he was a constant reprover of Idleness in others; for he would have all men (of what Degree, or Quality soever) still busied in some honest imployment, that thereby <hi>Temptations</hi> might have the less power over them: And he would often express his <hi>Pity,</hi> that any who had good Natural Parts, and Abilities, should not imploy their <hi>Talents,</hi> to better purposes, than he saw too many did; saying, That such were no better than <hi>Drones,</hi> who did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60492:49"/>
but devour the fruits of other mens Labours, and would not be at any themselves; and thought it a great shame for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Quality</hi> to be brought up (for the most part) only in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning how to <hi>Eat,</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> and <hi>Dress</hi> themselves; and to spend their Time, and Estates in luxurious <hi>Treats,</hi> unnecessary <hi>Visits,</hi> or (which is worse) in down-right <hi>Debauchery;</hi> these he looked on as persons that did not only wrong to their own Souls, but were a dishonour to the <hi>Nation,</hi> and a scandal to the Truth of <hi>Religion;</hi> and would frequently affirm, that it was better to be an <hi>Idiot,</hi> than such a witty (but wicked) man; better to be an honest <hi>Clown,</hi> than such a fashionable, but vicious <hi>Gentleman.</hi> Yet was he not so morose, or severe, as to disallow what were harmless diversions, for he knew how useful they were in their respective Seasons, but he could not endure it should become a <hi>Trade,</hi> and Business, as if men could find nothing else to do, but to run from one vain <hi>Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to another, till they had quite wearied themselves with their eager pursuit, and so made themselves unfit for the <hi>Service</hi> of God, or their own <hi>Civil</hi> concerns: And as for particular <hi>Recreations,</hi> he liked those best that exercised the Body without too much force, or violence, as walking, or riding abroad; or such as might relax, and unbend the Mind, and keep it from <hi>Melancholy,</hi> or too deep a thoughtfulness on Business: But as for <hi>Gaming,</hi> (especially for <hi>Mony,)</hi> he by no means could allow of it, for several reasons; but chiefly, for that it too often administred to <hi>Passion,</hi> as also to <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Cursing, Quarrelling, Cheating,</hi> and not unseldom to <hi>Duelling;</hi> all which arose from coveting that which was anothers; so that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Winners nor Losers were satisfied, nor rarely knew when to give over in time. As for his own <hi>Recreations,</hi> walking was his greatest delight, and at spare times he loved pleasant Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and innocent <hi>Mirth,</hi> himself often telling <hi>Stories,</hi> or relating the wise, or witty sayings of other men, or such things that had occurred to his own observation; so that his company was always agreeable, and for the most part instructive; but still he would conform himself to the <hi>Genius,</hi> and improvements of those he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with; for as with <hi>Scholars</hi> he would discourse of matters of Learning, so could he condescend to those of meaner capacities. But when any asked his <hi>Opinion,</hi> or <hi>Advice,</hi> in any points of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he was highly Communicative, and free to impart what he knew, or thought would benefit others; and would first, with great modesty, shew them what others said upon that <hi>Subject;</hi> and would after, when farther pressed, deliver his own thoughts thereupon: Yet he was prudently cautious in delivering his <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> when he was sifted by designing captious men, whom he thought intended only to take advantage of what he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them: But he never declined giving his true thoughts,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60492:50"/>
when desired by those he thought Honest, Candid, and Pious, and that would not make use of his <hi>Opinion</hi> to evil purposes. But he could not endure that any should ridicule either <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> or drole upon any man's private <hi>Faults,</hi> or <hi>Calamities;</hi> and above all things he could not suffer <hi>filthy,</hi> or <hi>obscene Communication,</hi> or <hi>Swearing;</hi> He knew it displeased God, and therefore it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely offended him; and where he could not make the persons desist from it, he would presently leave the place, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: And when he could not with decency, or good manners go away, and though he was always very uneasie in such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, yet did he not always express his abhorrence of it in words, nor reprove their persons, when he considered it might do more hurt, than good, but would then hold his peace, waiting for an ppportunity to do it with gentleness, and by way of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> when the persons concerned might happily be convinced, he did it purely for their good, and not in reproach to them: And I remember once, when there had happened some discourse at <hi>Table,</hi> from Persons of Quality, that did not please him; he said nothing then, seeming not to hear them; but after Dinner, when I waited on him into his <hi>Chamber,</hi> he looked very Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which I taking notice of, and asking him if I might know the cause: <hi>It is a sad thing</hi> (said he) <hi>to be forced to put one's foot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another's Table, and not only to have all sorts of Company put upon him, but also to be obliged to hear their follies, and neither to be able to quit their company, nor to reprove their intemperate Speeches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he perceived any (whom he accounted truly <hi>Religious)</hi> Sad, and Melancholy, he would often ask them why they were so, and if any thing really troubled them; if not, he would proceed thus, If you have entirely devoted your selves to the Service of God, what reason have you to be <hi>Melancholy</hi> When, (if you will riously consider) none have more cause to be cheerful, than those who lead a Holy, and a Vertuous Life; by this your dejection, you may bring an <hi>Evil Report</hi> upon <hi>Religion;</hi> for people seeing you always sad, will be apt to think 'tis That occasions it; and that you serve a hard Master, whose Yoke is heavy, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands grievous; which vvill deter others, and scare them from the vvays of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> vvhich you ought by no means to do, for sincere Christians may, and ought to rejoyce, and to shevv themselves cheerful; vvhereas the vicious and vvicked have the greatest reason to be sad: And as he advised others, so he himself vvas alvvays of an even, cheerful temper, seldom trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, or discomposed, unless he found such occasions as those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned; and indeed his conversation vvith <hi>Heaven</hi> gave him all the reason imaginable to be so; for besides his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions Morning and Evening, he never omitted (vvhen
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60492:50"/>
he kept house) to have prayers there four times a day publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Morning at six, in the Evening at eight, besides the whole Service before Dinner and Supper in his <hi>Chappel,</hi> at which he was always present, as he also was, when it was constantly read at the Countess of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s, or other Families where he lived: From whence you may observe the reverend esteem he had for our <hi>Liturgy;</hi> so that when some had traduced him, as if he had spoke flightingly of it, he took it very ill, as appears by what I find of his own hand in his private <hi>Manual, January</hi> 16th. 1655. Not long before his death, which I suppose he wrote on purpose, that those who should peruse his Papers might take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.</p>

                  <p>And he did so much approve of set Forms of Prayer in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that he always kept himself to one constant short pathetical <hi>Prayer</hi> before his Sermons, with little alteration. And though this <hi>Apostolical</hi> Preacher, and Prelate, was as much able as any to instruct, and direct others in all matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> yet would he still give a good Example, and offer himself to be a learner, and though he had preached in the Morning, yet would he rarely miss his Attendance at the publick Service in the Afternoon, and was observed to be one of the most devout at Prayers, and the most attentive hearer of any in the Congregation; nor would he admit any drowsiness to seize him, nor suffer any thing to divert him from the present business. And as he used plain preaching himself, so was he much pleased with a pious, practical discourse from others, as if he had been to learn what he never knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He delighted to hear sin rebuked, and laid open in all its colours, and <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom</hi> exalted; this was always a pleasant Theme to him, and he would afterwards thank, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the <hi>Preacher,</hi> when he had thus performed his duty, to do so still.</p>
                  <p>Having given you some account of his private Conversation, we will now proceed to that of his more Publick. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given you an <hi>Idea</hi> of his way of <hi>Preaching,</hi> to which I shall only add, that in his delivery his very Voice, and Gesture were moving and perswasive, yet without any Tone, or Affectation; so that his preaching was with <hi>Authority, and not with inticeing words of humane wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and with Power.</hi> He had that fluency, and ready command of words, that for many years he never committed more to writing than the Heads of his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60492:51"/>
                     <hi>Sermons,</hi> trusting the rest (after he had well considered what to say,) wholly to his memory, which though it might render his <hi>Sermons</hi> not so fit to be published, as wanting that polishing, and exactness of Style, which those that write, and supervise their own Sermons are able to give them: Yet on the other side, his discourses had that <hi>Pathos,</hi> and natural vigor, (the very sinews of perswasion) which must needs be wanting in those that are read; nor yet does abound (being always attended with some concern) in those, who speak their written Sermons without Book: And indeed, considering how constantly he preached, had he tyed himself up to that drudgery, he would scarce have had time for any other business: But this made him not desirous of having any of his Sermons printed, since he was sufficiently sensible of the great disadvantage they must appear abroad withal, as well in respect of those Errors, and Omissions, which those that take Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in <hi>Characters</hi> must needs be liable to; as also because they wanted his own Eye, and Correction to be added to them, both which are requisite to make any discourse so exact, and coherent as it ought to be: But to add something farther of his way, and method in his popular Sermons; as he was an excellent <hi>Textuary,</hi> so it was his custom to run through all the parallel places, that concerned the subject on which he treated; and paraphrase, and illustrate them as they referred to each other, and their particular <hi>Contexts;</hi> he himself, as he past on, turning his <hi>Bible</hi> from place to place, and giving his Auditory time to do the like: Whereby as he render'd his preaching extreme easie to himself, so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came no less beneficial to his <hi>Auditors,</hi> acquainting them with the Holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and enabling them to recur to the proofs he cited, by which the memory was very much help'd, to recover the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of what was discoursed upon from them: He never cared to tire his <hi>Auditory</hi> with the length of his Sermon, knowing well, that as the satisfaction in hearing decreases, so does the attention also, and people, instead of minding vvhat is said, only listen vvhen there is like to be an end. And to let you see hovv strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he endeavoured to keep himself to this Rule, (though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the great regret of his hearers,) I shall give you this one instance; About a year before he died, vvhen he had left off prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching constantly, he vvas importuned (being then in <hi>London,)</hi> by the Countess of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and some other Persons of Quality, to give them a Sermon at St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Church, as vvell because it vvas the Parish vvhere he then lived, as that it vvas a Church vvhere his voice vvould be best heard of any thereabouts: The Lord Primate complyed vvith their desires, and preached a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon highly satisfactory to his Auditory; but after a pretty vvhile the Bishop happening to look upon the Hour-Glass vvhich stood
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60492:51"/>
from the light, and through the weakness, and deficiency of his sight mistaking it to be out, when indeed it was not, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, telling them, since the time was past, he would leave the rest he had to say on that Subject to another opportunity (if God should please to grant it him) of speaking again to them in that place: But the Congregation finding out my Lord's mistake, and that there was some of the hour yet to come; and not knowing whether they might ever have the like happiness of hearing him again, made signs to the <hi>Reader;</hi> to let him know that the <hi>Glass</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not run out, they earnestly desired he would make an end of all he intended to have spoken; which the <hi>Reader</hi> performing, the Bishop received it very kindly; and reassuming his discourse where he broke off, he concluded with an Exhortation full of Heavenly matter for almost half an hour; the whole <hi>Auditory</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much moved therewith, that none (unless perhaps some of the meaner sort in the <hi>Iles)</hi> went out of the <hi>Church,</hi> until he had done his Sermon. I relate this to let you know what great power this good man had in the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> and I have heard many say, they were never weary of hearing him, for besides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the matter he was upon; he had the faculty still to keep up the warmth, and attention of his hearers, and to dismiss them withal with an Appetite.</p>
                  <p>And that you may see how great a <hi>Master</hi> he was in this Art of gaining Souls, it will not be amiss to insert here some of those <hi>Directions</hi> he used to give those who were newly enter'd into <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> since they may not be unprofitable to such as mean serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to undertake this Sacred Calling.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Read, and Study the Scriptures carefully, wherein is the best Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and only infallible Truth; they can furnish you with the best materials, for your</hi> Sermons; <hi>the only rules of Faith, and Practice; the most powerful motives to perswade, and convince the</hi> Conscience; <hi>and the strongest ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to confute all</hi> Errors, Heresies, <hi>and</hi> Schisms: <hi>Therefore be sure, let all your</hi> Sermons <hi>be congruous to them; and to this End, it is expedient that you understand them as well in the</hi> Originals, <hi>as in the</hi> Translations.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Take not hastily up other mens</hi> Opinions <hi>without due Tryal, nor vent your own conceits, but compare them first with the Analogy of Faith, and rules of Holiness, recorded in the</hi> Scriptures, <hi>which are the proper Tests of all</hi> Opinions, <hi>and</hi> Doctrines.</p>

IV. <hi>Insist most on those points that tend to effect sound Belief, sincere love to God, repentance for Sin, and that may perswade to</hi> Holiness <hi>of</hi> Life: <hi>Press these things home to the Conscience of your Hearers, as of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity, leaving no gap for evasions, but bind them as close as may be to their duty; and as you ought to preach</hi> Sound <hi>and</hi> Orthodox Doctrine, <hi>so ought you to deliver God's Message as near as may be in God's Words, that is, in such as are plain, and intelligible, that the meanest of your</hi> Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors <hi>may understand: To which end 'tis necessary to back all practical</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, <hi>and</hi> Doctrines, <hi>with apt proofs from the holy</hi> Scriptures; <hi>avoiding all</hi> Exotic Phrases, Scholastick Terms, <hi>unnecessary Quotations of</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, <hi>and forced Rhetorical</hi> Figures, <hi>since it is not difficult to make easie things appear hard, but to render hard things easie is the hardest part of a good</hi> Orator, <hi>as well as</hi> Preacher.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>He would also exhort those who were already engaged in this</hi> Holy Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>and advised them, how they might well discharge their duty in the</hi> Church <hi>of God, answerable to their</hi> Calling, <hi>to this Effect: You are engaged in an excellent</hi> Employment <hi>in the</hi> Church, <hi>and intrusted with weighty matters, as</hi> Stewards <hi>of our great Master,</hi> Christ, <hi>the great</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop: <hi>Under him, and by his Commission, you are to endeavour to reconcile men to God; to convert sinners, and to build them up in the holy Faith of the</hi> Gospel, <hi>that they may he saved, and that</hi> Repentance, and Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins be preached in his name, <hi>This is of highest importance, and requires faithfulness, diligence, prudence, and watchfulness. The Souls of men are committed to our care, and guidance; and the Eyes of</hi> God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>and</hi> Men <hi>are upon us, and great is the account we must make to our</hi> Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>who is the Supreme</hi> Head <hi>of his</hi> Church, <hi>and will at length reward, or punish his Servants in this Ministry of his</hi> Gospel, <hi>as he shall find them faithful, or negligent; therefore it behoves us to exercise our best Talents, labouring in the Lord's</hi> Vineyard <hi>with all diligence, that we may bring forth fruit, and that the fruit may remain. This is the work we are separated for, and ordained unto; we must not think to be idle, or careless in this</hi> Office, <hi>but must bend our Minds and Studies, and imploy all our Gifts and Abilities in this Service: We must</hi> Preach <hi>the word of Faith, that men may believe aright; and the</hi> Doctrine, <hi>and</hi> Laws <hi>of</hi> Godliness, <hi>that men may act as becomes</hi> Christians <hi>indeed; for without</hi> Faith, <hi>no man can please God; and without</hi> Holiness, <hi>no man can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as this good Bishop took delight to advise others in the exercise of this great Duty, so likewise, he said, none of his <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> adminstred greater comfort to him in his Old Age, than that he had ever since he vvas called to the Ministry (vvhich vvas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early) endeavoured to discharge that great Trust committed unto him, of preaching the <hi>Gospel,</hi> vvhich he accounted so much his duty, that he made this the Motto of his <hi>Episcopal</hi> Seal, <hi>Vae mihi si non Evangelizavero!</hi> I mention not this, as if he thought all
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60492:53"/>
those of his ovvn <hi>Order</hi> vvere obliged to preach constantly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, since he was sensible that God hath not bestowed the same <hi>Talents</hi> on all men alike, but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Gave some Apostles, and some Pastors, and Teachers,</hi> though on some he hath bestowed all these gifts, as on this great <hi>Prelate,</hi> yet it is not often: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, God's Providence so ordained, that as he had qualified him in an extraordinary manner, for the preaching of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> so likewise towards his latter end he should be reduced to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as in great part to live by it.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot omit, that amongst many of those <hi>Advices,</hi> which he gave to those who came to him for Spiritual Counsel; one was concerning Afflictions, as a necessary mark of being a Child of God, which some might have gathered out of certain unwary passages in Books, and which he himself had met with in his <hi>Youth,</hi> and which wrought upon him so much, that he earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayed God to deal with him that way, and he had his request. And he told me, that from that time, he was not without various <hi>Afflictions</hi> through the whole course of his life; and therefore he advised, that no Christian should tempt God to shew such a <hi>Sign,</hi> for a mark of his paternal love, but to wait, and be prepared for them, and patient under them, and to consider the intention of them, so as to be the better for them, when they are inflicted: And by no means to judge of a man's Spiritual State, either by, or without <hi>Afflictions,</hi> for they are fallible Evidences in Spiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but that we should look after a real sincere Conversion, and internal Holiness, which indeed is the only true Character, and Evidence of a state of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I have already given you some account of his carriage whilst he exercised his Sacred <hi>Function</hi> in his own Country; to which I shall only add, That as his Discipline was not too severe, so was it not remiss, being chiefly exercised upon such as were remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Vicious, and Scandalous in their Lives, and Conversations, whether of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> or <hi>Laity;</hi> for as he loved, and esteemed the sober, diligent, and pious <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> and could not endure they should be wronged, or contemned; so as for those who were Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Idle, and cared not for their <hi>Flocks,</hi> he would call them the worst of men, being a scandal to the <hi>Church,</hi> and a blemish to their profession; and therefore he was always very careful what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons he Ordained to this high Calling, observing St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Timothy, Lay hands suddenly on no man:</hi> And I never heard he Ordained more than one person, who was not sufficiently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in respect of Learning, and this was in so extraordinary a case, that I think it will not be amiss to give you a short account of it, there was a certain <hi>English Mechanick,</hi> living in the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's <hi>Diocess,</hi> who constantly frequented the publick Service of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60492:53"/>
the Church; and attained to a competent knowledge in the Scriptures, and gave himself to read what Books of Practical Divinity he could get, and was reputed among his Neighbours and Protestants thereabouts, a very honest and Pious Man; this Person applyed himself to the Lord Primate, and told him, That he had an earnest desire to be admitted to the Ministry, but the Bishop refused him, advising him to go home, and follow his Calling, and pray to God to remove this Temptation; yet after some time, he returns again, renewing his request, Saying, He could not be at rest in his Mind, but that his desires toward that Calling encreased more and more; whereupon the Lord Primate discoursed him, and found upon Examination, that he gave a very good account of his Faith and knowledge, in all the main points of Religion. Then the Bishop questioned him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he could speak <hi>Irish,</hi> for if not, his Preaching would be of little use in a Country where the greatest part of the People were <hi>Irish,</hi> that understood no <hi>English.</hi> The Man replyed that indeed he could not speak <hi>Irish,</hi> but if his Lordship thought fit he would endeavour to learn it, which he bid him do, and as soon as he had attained the Language to come again, which he did about a Twelvemonth after, telling my Lord that he could now express himself tolerably well in <hi>Irish,</hi> and therefore desired Ordination: whereupon the Lord Primate finding upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that he spake Truth, Ordained him accordingly, being satisfied that such an ordinary Man, was able to do more good than if he had <hi>Latin</hi> without any <hi>Irish</hi> at all, nor was the Bishop deceived in his expectation, for this Man as soon as he had a Cure, imployed his Talent diligently and faithfully, and proved very successful in Converting many of the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists to our Church, and continued labouring in that Work, until the Rebellion and Massacre, wherein he hardly escaped with Life.</p>
                  <p>And as this good Bishop did still protect and encourage those of his own Coat, so did he likewise all poor Men, whom he found oppressed or wronged by those above them. And for an instance of this I will give you part of a Letter, which he Writ to a Person of Quality in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in behalf of a poor Man, which was his Tenant, whom he found much wronged and oppressed by him. <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Now having given as brief a Character as I could, of this excellent Prelate, not only as a private Man, but also a Minister and Bishop of Gods Church, and as a most Loyal Subject to his Lawful Sovereign Prince, expressed upon all occasions, I should proceed in the last place, to give some account of his Judgment and Opinions in points of Religion and Learning, for the first I shall say in general, That he always adhered to, and maintained the fundamental Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Truths, observing that Golden Rule, concerning Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.<hi>—Quod ubique, quod ab omnibus, quod semper Creditum est,</hi> &amp;c. and never approved of any Religion, under what pretence soever obtruded or introduced, contrary to the Scriptures and Primitive Truths, received and professed in the Church of Christ in all Ages; and upon this account could never comply with, nor approve of the new Doctrines and Worship obtruded and practised in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as now it is, but always protested against their Innovations and humane Inventions, as doth most evidently appear, in his Writings, bearing Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against their Corruptions, False and Erroneous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And as for the great Scholars and Leading Men of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, the Lord Primate usually said, That it is no Marvel; if they had a veil cast over their Eyes, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> said of the Jews, in the reading of the Scriptures; for besides the several judgments of God upon them, that have blinded their own Eyes, their Minds are so prepossessed and Corrupted with false Principles, Prejudices and Worldly interest,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60492:54"/>
that it is no wonder if they cannot perceive the most manifest and plainest Truths.</p>
                  <p>But as this good Mans judgment was sound and not byassed by prejudice or passion or worldly interest, so did he heartily approve of the Religion professed and established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as most Congruous to the Holy Scriptures and Primitive Christianity; and in which (if a Man keep the Faith and Lives according to its precepts persevering) he need not doubt of his Salvation. And in this Faith and Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he lived Holily and died happily. And this Holy Primate being fully perswaded in his own Mind, laboured instantly to reduce Popish Recusants and Sectaries from their Errors, and vain Conceits to inform them aright, and to perswade them for their Souls good to comply with, and embrace the Religion and Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and this he aimed to bring about by his Writing, Preaching and Conference upon all occasions and was successful in that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise.</p>
                  <p>But now for his Opinion in some nice points of Religion, that do not touch the foundation of Faith, he would not be rigorously Dogmatical in his own Opinions, as to impose on others Learned and Pious Men, of a different Apprehension in the more obscure points, with whom nevertheless (thô not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of his judgment) he had a friendly Conversation, and mutual Affection and Respect, seeing they agreed in the points necessary.—Would to God, That the Learned and Pious Men in these Days were of the like temper.</p>
                  <p>It will be needless here to mention any more particulars of his judgment in several points seeing there are so many instances of this kind in the Collection, to which I refer the Reader.</p>

Yet before I leave this matter, I think fit to mind you of some Treatises published by Doctor <hi>Bernard,</hi> after the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates Death, Intituled, <hi>The judgment of the late Lord Primate,</hi> on seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Subjects.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Of Spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4.</item>
                     <item>2. Of Laying on of Hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. and the ancient form of Words in Ordination.</item>
                     <item>3. Of a set form of Prayer in the Church.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Each being the judgment of the late Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> which being not set down in my Lord Primates own Words, nor written by him in the Method and Order they are there put into, cannot be reckoned, being much enlarged by the Dr., as himself confesseth; therefore cannot so well vouch them, as if I had been certain, that all he writes were purely the Lord Primate<hi>'s,</hi> since the Papers, out of which the Doctor says he Collected them, were never restored to my Custody, thô bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed under that Trust, that they should be so; and therefore I desire that those, into whose hands those Manuscripts are now fallen, since the Drs. decease, would restore them, either to my self, or the Lord Primates Relations.</p>
                  <p>And tho perhaps some of those Letters published by Dr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> might have been as well omitted, or at least some private reflections of them left out, concerning a Person easily provoked to bitterness and ill words, being provoked by the publishing those Letters, writ an invective Book on purpose to answer to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Heylin<hi>'s Respondet Petrus.</hi>
                     </note> what was contained therein, and not contented with this, has likewise bestowed great part of that Book, to tax my Lord Primates Opinions and Actions, as differing from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> only to lessen the Esteem and Veneration, which he deservedly had, with all those who loved the King and Church of <hi>England,</hi> as also to maintain those old Stories broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before concerning the repeal of the <hi>Irish</hi> Articles, and the Death of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> to which last particulars I
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60492:55"/>
need say no more than what I have already spoken in the Lord Primate's Vindication: and as to the former, relating to my Lord's Opinions and Actions, a near Relation of the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's has, I hope, vindicated him sufficiently, in an <hi>Appendix</hi> at the end of this Account; so that I shall concern my self no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therewith.</p>
                  <p>I have now no more to do, than to give you a short account of his <hi>Opinions,</hi> in some of the most difficult parts of Learning, with some Observations, which either my self, or others that convers'd with him can remember we have received from him by way of discourse, though not the Twentieth part of what might have been retrieved in this kind, had this task been undertaken many years agone, whilst these things were fresh in our memories, and whilst many more of his learned friends were alive, who must needs have received divers learned remarks from his excellent conversation.</p>
                  <p>As for the Lord Primate's <hi>Opinions</hi> in Critical Learning, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well known, as well by his Discourse, as Writings, that he still defended the certainty, and purity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> before the Translation of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> since he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether this we have, were the true Translation of the LXX. or not; as you may see in his Epistle to <hi>Valesius,</hi> and his Answer thereunto; which controversie, as it is a subject above my capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to give a Judgment on, having exercised (as it still does) both the Wits, and Pens of the greatest <hi>Scholars</hi> in this present <hi>Age:</hi> So I heartily wish, That it may never tend to the disadvantage, not only of our own, but indeed of the whole Christian Religion, with Prophane and Sceptical men; for whilst one Party decry the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> as obscure, and corrupted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the other side shew the failings, and mistakes of the <hi>Greek Translation,</hi> sufficient to prove that it was not performed by men Divinely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired, it gives the Weak, and more Prophane sort of <hi>Readers,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to doubt of the Divine Authority of these <hi>Sacred Records,</hi> though (notwithstanding all) the differences that have hitherto been shown between the <hi>Hebrew Original,</hi> and <hi>Greek Translation</hi> do not (God be thanked) prove of greater moment, than in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Time, Names, or Numbers of men, difference of some Words, and Phrases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilst they still agree in all the main points, both of the <hi>History,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which I think ought to satisfie any sincere, considering Person, that God's Providence has taken sufficient care, to convey these <hi>Sacred Records,</hi> and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Faith, clear, and uncorrupted to us, a reasonable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance being still given to the Mistakes and Errours of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers,</hi> or <hi>Translators,</hi> which were not Divinely Inspired, so as to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us from all mistakes in a Book which has been so often tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60492:56"/>
in so many hundreds of years, and that out of a <hi>Language</hi> which is thought by divers of the learned to have been written without any of those <hi>Points,</hi> which in most of these <hi>Eastern Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> stand for <hi>Vowels:</hi> But to other of the Learned of the contrary Opinion, and what our <hi>Primate</hi> thought of this, and some beside him, skill'd in this point, we may understand among the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions hereafter, unto which I refer the Reader, and to return from whence we have digressed.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Primate being once importuned by a Learned man, to give some directions in Writing, for the advancement of solid, and useful learning, as well Sacred, as Prophane, he said it might be thus performed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By learned Notes, and Illustrations on the <hi>Bible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By censuring, and inquiring into the Ancient <hi>Councils,</hi> and Works of the <hi>Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the orderly Writing and Digesting of <hi>Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. By gathering together whatsoever may concern the State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to this present Age.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By Collecting of all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Histories,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting them into a Body.</p>
                  <p>And to effect all this, he proposed, That the most ingenious and studious men of both <hi>Universities,</hi> being preferred to <hi>Prebends</hi> in Cathedral Churches should be enjoyned, and amply encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to prosecute this design, for the advancement of this most profitable Learning. And how much the Lord Primate desired the performance of these so useful works appears by what he had long since recommended to the <hi>University</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> touching the revising the Works of the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> of the Church: What his design was in this kind, the <hi>Reader</hi> may best judge by this passage in a Letter, written 1626. recommending this design to the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which I shall here insert.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>—The business of Revising the Ancient Fathers works in</hi> Latin <hi>(so long projected, and so many years followed by Dr.</hi> James) <hi>I do greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and judge it to be (as the times now are, and the Books now printed at</hi> Cologne, <hi>and else where) most necessary, tending to the great honour of this famous University; the benefit of them that shall be imployed therein, and the great good of the Church: And if the Heads of the University would be pleased, or might be intreated to incourage, and imploy some of their Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Divines herein (whereof I see so great store, and some I have found very painful in another kind) I shall think my self greatly honoured by this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity (as I confess I have been very much already) if by my means they may be the rather encouraged to the performance of this great work.</hi>
                  </p>

And indeed he had so great an esteem of the <hi>Ancient Authors,</hi> for the acquiring any solid learning, whether Sacred, or Prophane, that his advice to young Students, either in <hi>Divinity,</hi> or <hi>Antiquity,</hi> was, not to spend too much time in <hi>Epitomes,</hi> but to set themselves to read the <hi>Ancient Authors</hi> themselves, as to begin with the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and to read them according to the <hi>Ages</hi> in which they lived, (which was the Method he had taken himself) and together with them carefully to peruse the <hi>Church Historians</hi> that treated of that Age, in which those <hi>Fathers</hi> lived, by which means the Student would be better able to perceive the reason and meaning of divers Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in their Writings (which otherwise would be obscure) when he knew the <hi>Original</hi> and Growth of those <hi>Heresies,</hi> and <hi>Heterodox Opinions</hi> they wrote against; and may also better judge what <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> prevailed in the <hi>Church</hi> in every Age, and by what means introduced: So likewise for <hi>Prophane Authors,</hi> his advice was, to begin with the most <hi>Ancient,</hi> and so to read them in the order of time, of which they writ, which was the Method he used in the composing of his <hi>Annals:</hi> Nor did he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise Students in Divinity to spend more time than was necessary, in the subtilties of the <hi>School-men,</hi> only so far as might serve for the understanding, and answering the Controversies, between those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us; saying, That they were good to puzzle mens heads with unnecessary doubts, but bunglers in resolving them, and that their Writings had done more mischief to the Church, than brought advantage either to Learning, or Religion; That they might serve for Controversial Disputes in the <hi>Schools,</hi> but were very improper for the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and altogether useless for the Functions of a Civil Life: And whom one would think <hi>Prudentius</hi> had on purpose thus described, <hi>Solvunt ligantque quaestionum vincula, per Syllogismos plectiles, fidem minutis diffecant am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagibus,</hi> &amp;c. As for the <hi>Heathen</hi> moral <hi>Philosophers,</hi> he advised young Divines not to spend too much time in them, for they were much mistaken in many great points of Morality, and true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, the best rules of life, &amp;c. and the shortest, and plainest for all moral Duties; being delivered by God in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> In <hi>Theological Treatises,</hi> and Discourses, he was displeased with new wording of old Truths, and changing the Terms used by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> to express the things they meant; he would have the old form of sound words retained, for <hi>Qui nova facit verba, nova gignit Dogmata;</hi> and ever suspected that those who purposely used new coined words, had no very good meaning, or else affected too great singularity.</p>
                  <p>But I think I need say no more to prove the Lord Primate's great knowledge in all parts of useful Learning, since besides the <hi>Suffrages</hi> of the most knowing men of this <hi>Age,</hi> his many and

learned works (of which I have given you a short account in this Treatise) sufficiently declare it to the World, but let us look back a little, and survey at once those various parts of Learning he was skilled in: First, his <hi>Sermons,</hi> Treatises <hi>Theological,</hi> and Writings against the <hi>Papists,</hi> do sufficiently shew how great a Doctor he was in <hi>Theology,</hi> as well <hi>Practical,</hi> as <hi>Polemical;</hi> his <hi>Theological Bibliotheke</hi> (as imperfect as it is) together with the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> which he put forth, with learned dissertations concerning their Writings; as also his Treatise of the Ancient <hi>Apostolical Symbol</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> declare how well he was versed in all the Ancient Monuments of the Church; as his works of the <hi>Succession,</hi> and state of the Christian Churches, and of the Antiquities of the <hi>British</hi> Church do his knowledge in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> History, and Antiquity; his <hi>Syntagma</hi> of the Version of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and his Epistle to <hi>Lud. Capellus,</hi> concerning the various readings of the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> speak him a great <hi>Critick</hi> in the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues; and his <hi>Annals</hi> of the Old, and New Testament, do shew how great a Master he was in all the Ancient Authors both Sacred and Prophane; besides several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther smaller Treatises, as well in <hi>Latin,</hi> as <hi>English, viz.</hi> Of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi> Year, the <hi>Geographical</hi> Description of the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> &amp;c. each of which shew his great skill, either in <hi>Astronomy,</hi> ancient <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy;</hi> or the <hi>Civil Laws</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> besides divers other smaller Works of his, too many to be here particularly inserted, and therefore I shall refer the Reader to the <hi>Catalogue</hi> added at the end of this Account: Yet must I not omit particularly to take notice of two excellent <hi>Posthumous</hi> Treatises of his, which have not been yet mentioned, as being published since his death, the first is that of the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> which was written by the King's Command, during the late Wars, but forborn then to be published, because the corruption of those Times still growing worse and worse, would not bear this sound Doctrine; nor did he think it proper to do it in the short time of that <hi>Usurper,</hi> lest he, or others, might have interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to his advantage; but not long after his late Majesty's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Restauration it was Published, and Dedicated to him by the Lord Primate's Grandson, <hi>James Tyrrel,</hi> with an excellent Preface written by that learned, and good Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> in which he has given as true a Character of the Author, as of the work it self, in which he says, (with a great deal of truth) <hi>That there is nothing which can be brought either from the</hi> Holy Scriptures, Fathers, Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <hi>common Reason, and the</hi> Laws, <hi>and</hi> Statutes <hi>of this</hi> Realm, <hi>to prove it altogether unlawful for Subjects to take up Arms against their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince, but is there made use of with the greatest advantage.</hi> The other Treatise is written in <hi>Latin,</hi> entitled <hi>Chronologia Sacra,</hi> which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60492:57"/>
the Lord Primate never lived to finish; but was, as much of it as could be found (though somewhat imperfectly) published by the Learned and Reverend. Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> now Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln:</hi> The occasion, and design of this Treatise, was, to prove the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the accounts of time in his <hi>Annals,</hi> and that his <hi>Chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Calculations</hi> made use of in that work, agreed with the accounts laid down in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Prophane Authors,</hi> which could not be done in the <hi>Annals</hi> themselves, without interrupting the Series of the Work: In this he hath solved several difficulties relating to the <hi>History,</hi> and <hi>Chronology</hi> of the Bible; he began with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though the first Chapter is lost (being not to be found among his Papers,) yet in the next he gives an exact account of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the <hi>Jewish, Samaritan,</hi> and <hi>Greek Calculations,</hi> from the Creation to the Birth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he carried on, as far as the time of the <hi>Judges,</hi> but was then interrupted by death: Yet he had before happily perfected the account of the <hi>Reigns,</hi> and <hi>Synchronisms</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> from <hi>Saul</hi> to the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish</hi> Captivity, which being more perfect than the other part, was thought fit by the Printer, or Publisher to be set before it, though it be indeed contrary to the order of time: It was great pity that my Lord did not live to finish this work, which would have been of excellent use for the clearing of many difficulties, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the differences between the Sacred and Prophane <hi>Chronology,</hi> and <hi>History.</hi> I may here likewise take notice of those many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of his Collections, and several of them, all of his own hand, on particular subjects, both <hi>Theological, Philological,</hi> and <hi>Historical,</hi> most of them extracted out of several <hi>Manuscripts</hi> in the <hi>Libraries</hi> of the Universities, Cathedrals, and private mens Studies, there being scarce a choice Book, or Manuscript in any of them but was known to him, nor was he conversant in the <hi>Libraries</hi> of our own Nation alone, but also knew most of the choice pieces in the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, Escurial,</hi> and <hi>Imperial</hi> Library at <hi>Vienna,</hi> as likewise in that of the King of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Thuanus</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Erpenius</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> as still appears by the <hi>Catalogues</hi> he had procured of them, divers of which I have now in my Custody; and out of which <hi>Libraries</hi> he at his great cost procured divers Copies for his own use, which made the most considerable Ornament of his Study. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his own Collections above mentioned, which were the Store-Houses, and Repositories, from whence he furnished himself with materials for the writing of so many learned Treatises, and out of which might be gathered matter towards the performing much more in the same kind, though divers Volumes of them were borrowed by Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and never restored by him, as I have already said: Yet those that remain are thought very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable by the several Learned men, who have perused them,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60492:58"/>
and in particular, the late judicious <hi>Lord Chief Justice Hale</hi> having borrowed several of them, did out of them Transcribe those four Volumes, which he bequeaths in his Will to the Library at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns-Inn,</hi> among divers other Manuscripts of his, by the name of <hi>His Extracts out of the Lord Primate's Collections:</hi> And for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the <hi>Reader,</hi> I shall give you the Heads, and Subjects of some of the most considerable of them, at the end of this account: So that the Lord Primate was like the wise Housholder in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> who brought out of his Treasure things New and Old: And a Learned man of this Nation compared the <hi>Arch-Bishop of Armagh,</hi> not only to a careful <hi>Surveyor,</hi> who collects all sorts of materials for his building, before he begins his work, but also to a skilful <hi>Architect,</hi> who knew Artificially how to frame and put together the materials before Collected, till they became one strong, entire, and uniform Structure. Nor does any thing more express the great strength of the Lord Primate's memory, than those Collections, which though promiscuously gathered by way of <hi>Adversaria,</hi> according as those Subjects offered themselves, yet could he as readily call to mind, and find out any particular in them, which he had occasion to make use of, as if they had been digested in the more exact method of a Common-place-Book. So that he certainly deserved a much higher Character than that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> Sarcastically puts upon him, <hi>Of a walking Concordance, and living Library,</hi> as if he had been only an <hi>Index</hi> for such wise men as himself to make use of; but greater Scholars than he, had far higher and more Reverend thoughts of him, there being scarce a Learned Writer of this present Age, who does not mention his great Piety, Learning, and Judgment with honour, and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I had once collected a great many <hi>Elogies</hi> of this kind from the Writings of divers considerable Authors, but since I find that done already by others, and that it would swell this work into too great a bulk, and only serve to prove that which I think no body questions; I shall only refer you to the Learned Works of Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Twisden,</hi> Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Hall,</hi> Bishop <hi>Prideaux,</hi> and divers others of our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: And of Foreigners, to the Learned <hi>Vossius, Spanhemius, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardus, Morus, Lud. de Dieu, Bochartus,</hi> and many more; divers of whose Letters you will find in this ensuing Collection, so that you can scarce read farther, than the Preface, or Epistle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of several of their Works, without finding his name mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with peculiar honour; but I cannot here omit that <hi>Elogy</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the Suffrages of the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in a publick Convocation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1644. since the Authors are not commonly known.</p>

                  <p>And unto what hath been already said concerning his great <hi>Learning,</hi> we may add his great activity, as occasion served, to advance the Restauration of our old <hi>Northern Antiquities,</hi> which lay buried in the <hi>Gothick, Anglo-Saxonick,</hi> and other the like obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Languages.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Junius</hi> published a very old Paraphrastical Poem in <hi>Saxon,</hi> which upon strict enquiry was found to be written by one <hi>Caed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> a Monk, of whom <hi>Bede</hi> makes mention: The Manuscript Copy of which Poem, the said Publisher lets his Reader know more than once, he received from the hands of the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh.</hi> And when the same Author published the now mentioned <hi>Gothick</hi> Translation of the four <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and <note place="margin">

But whilst we now speak of his Learning, I had almost omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to give you some account of that, out of which he gained great part of it, his excellent Library, consisting of near 10000 <hi>Volumes,</hi> Prints, and Manuscripts, all which, he in the time of his prosperity, intended to bestow at his death on the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> in gratitude to the place where he received his Education: But when it pleased God to lay that great Affliction upon him, in the loss of all he had, except his Books, it is not to be wondered if he left those as a portion to his only Daughter, who had been the Mother of a numerous Off-spring, and hitherto had nothing from him, and which (besides some parcels of Gold he had by him, that had been before presented to him by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and other Persons of Quality) was all he had to leave her. This <hi>Library</hi> which cost the Lord Primate many Thousand pounds, was after his decease much sought for by the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and <hi>Cardinal Mazarine,</hi> and a good price offered for it by their Agents here: But the Lord Primate's Administrators being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by an Order from the <hi>Usurper,</hi> and his <hi>Council,</hi> to sell it to any without his consent, it was at last bought by the Souldiers, and Officers of the then Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who out of Emulation to the former Noble Action of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Army, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, by some men of Publick Spirits, to the like performance, and they had it for much less than what it was really worth, or what had been offered for it before, by the Agents above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: They had also with it all his Manuscripts, (which were not of his own hand-writing,) as also a choice (though not numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) Collection of Ancient <hi>Coins:</hi> But when this Library was brought over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Usurper,</hi> and his Son, who then Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in chief there, would not bestow it upon the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> least, perhaps, the gift should not appear so considerable there, as it would do by it self; and therefore they gave out, That they would reserve it for a new <hi>Colledge</hi> or <hi>Hall,</hi> which they said they intended to Build, and Endow: But it proved, that as those were not Times, so were they not Persons capable of any such noble, or pious work, so that this <hi>Library</hi> lay in the <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> unbestowed, and unimployed all the remaining time of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Usurpation; but after his death, and during that Anarchy, and confusion that followed it, the rooms where this Treasure was kept, being left open, many of the Books, and most of the best Manuscripts were stolen away, or else imbezeled by those who were intrusted with them; but after his late Majesty's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration, when they fell to his disposal, he generously bestowed them on the <hi>Colledge,</hi> for which they were intended by their owner, where they now remain; and (as they are) make up the greater part of that <hi>Library.</hi>

Thus having dispatch'd (as well as I am able) this account of the Life, and Writings of this rare, and admirable <hi>Prelate,</hi> though infinitely short of his incomparable worth, and perfections, being so eminently Pious, so prodigiously Learned, and every way so richly accomplished, I can only conclude, humbly beseeching the God of all Grace, the Father of Light, the Giver of every good and perfect Gift, That he would appoint, and continue in his <hi>Church</hi> a constant Succession of such Lights; and that particularly within his Majesty's Dominions, these <hi>Churches</hi> may still flourish under the like Pious, Watchful, Laborious, and Exemplary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Bishops, who may adorn the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; for the Confutation of the Adversaries of our Religion, and the Conviction of all those who clamour against the Doctrine, Government, and Godly Worship now Established in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <head>An APPENDIX to the Life of the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>USHER;</hi> containing a vindication of his Opinions and Actions in reference to the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and his Conformity thereunto, from the Aspersions of <hi>Peter Heylin</hi> D. D. in his Pamphlet called <hi>Respondet Petrus.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>FInding that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath taken the pains to write this Book on purpose to callumniate and asperse the Lord Primates Memory, and arraign his Opinions and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as not conformable to the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I cannot well omit to consider what that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath there laid to his charge, how justly I shall leave to the impartial Reader to judg; for I hope I shall make it appear that what the Lord Primate hath either publish'd, or written in private Letters on those Subjects, was on very good grounds, and such as may very well be defended, as agreeable to the Sence and Doctrine of our Church, contained in the 39 Articles. Or if after all I can say, the Reader shall happen to think otherwise, I desire him not to censure too hardly, but to pass it by, since such difference (if any be) was not in the fundamental Doctrines of our Religion, but only some Points of lesser moment; or in which the Church it self has not tied men either to this or that sence; and that the Lord Primate held these Opinions, not out of contradiction or singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but only because he thought them more agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reason: tho in most of them I doubt not but to shew, that the Doctor has stretched the Lord Primate's words farther than ever his own sence and meaning was. But to come to the Points in which the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath made bold to question his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the first is his Opinion of the Divine Morality of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or Seventh days rest, asserted by him in two several Letters, published (tho perhaps not so prudently with those private reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) by Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> in which Controversy whether the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities made use of by the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> out of the Fathers and other Writers, do not make out the Assertion by him laid down; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Doctor</hi> has fairly and ingenuously answered those Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he cites in those Letters, I shall not here take upon me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, but shall observe thus much, That as it is a Doctrine held by some of the Fathers, as also maintained by divers learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Bishops of our Church, and therefore could not be so Puritanical as the <hi>Doctor</hi> would have it; especially since the Lord
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60492:63"/>
                     <hi>Primate</hi> thought that he had the Church of <hi>England</hi> on his side, as she hath declared her sence of this matter in the first part of the Homily of the time and place of Prayer, viz. <hi>God hath given express charge to all Men, that upon the Sabbath day (which is now our Sunday) they shall cease from all weekly and work-day labour; to the intent, that like as God himself wrought six days, and rested the seventh, and blessed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated it to quietness and rest from labour: even so God's obedient People should use the Sunday holily, and rest from their common and daily business, and also give themselves wholly to the heavenly exercise of God's true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Service.</hi> Which passage being expresly in the point, of my Lord <hi>Primat</hi>'s side, the Sabbath day, mentioned in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, being there called our Sunday, and the same reason laid down for its observation, <hi>viz.</hi> because God had rested on the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ib. Sect.</hi> 7.</note> seventh day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi> has no way to oppose this so express Authority, but to make (if possible) this Homily to contradict it self; and therefore he produces another passage just preceding in this Homily, as making for his Opinion, which that you may judge whether it does so or no, I shall put down the passage as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath cited it, with his Conclusions from it, and shall then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examine whether it makes so much of his side as he would have it, viz. <hi>As concerning the time in which God hath appointed his People to assemble together solemnly, it doth appear by the fourth Commandment, &amp;c. And albeit this Commandment of God doth not bind Christian People so strictly to observe and keep the utter Ceremonies of the Sabbath day, as it was given unto the Jews, as touching the forbearing of work and labour, and as touching the precise keeping of the seventh day, after the manner of the Jews; (for we keep now the first day, which is our Sunday, and make that our Sabbath, that is, our day of rest, in honour of our Saviour Christ, who upon that day rose from death, conquering the same most triumphantly:) yet notwithstanding whatsoever is found in the Commandment appertaining to the Law of Nature, as a thing most godly, most just and needful for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of God's Glory, ought to be retained and kept of all good Christian People.</hi> So that it being thus resolved, that there is no more of the fourth Commandment to be retained by good Christian People, than what is found appertaining to the Law of Nature; and that the Law of Nature doth not tie us to one day <hi>in</hi> seven, or more, to one day <hi>of</hi> the seven, than to any other; let us next see by what Authority the day was changed, and how it came to be translated from the seventh to the first. Concerning which it follows thus in the said Homily, viz. <hi>This Example and Commandment of God, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christian People began to follow immediately after the Ascension of our Lord Christ, and began to chuse them a standing Day of the week to come together in; yet not the seventh Day, which the Jews kept, but the Lord's Day, the Day of the Lord's Resurrection, the Day after the seventh Day, which is</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60492:63"/>
                     <hi>the first Day of the week, &amp;c. sithence which time God's People hath always in all Ages, without any gainsaying, used to come together on the Sunday to celebrate and honour God's blessed Name, and carefully to keep that Day in holy rest and quietness.</hi> So far the Homily. And by this Homily it appears plainly, that the keeping of the Lord's day is not grounded on any Commandment of Christ, nor any Precept of the Apostles, but that it was chosen as a standing day of the week to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in, by the Godly Christian People immediately after Christ's Ascension, and hath so continued ever since. But the Doctor has been very careful in his Quotations, not only to take whatsoever in this Homily he thinks makes for his purpose, but has also been so wary as to leave out whatsoever he thinks is against him; and therefore the Reader is to take notice, that the place first cited by the Doctor immediately precedes that before quoted by the Lord Primate, being connected to it by this passage (which the Doctor omits), <hi>And therefore by this Commandment, we ought to have a time, as one day in the week, wherein we ought to rest, yea from our lawful and needful works.</hi> So likewise doth he omit that which immediately follows the words quoted by my Lord Primate, viz. <hi>So that God doth not only command the observation of this Holy Day, but also by his own example doth stir and provoke us to the diligent keeping of the same.</hi> And after the obedience of natural Children, not only to the Commands, but also to the Example of their Parents, is urged, it follows thus, as an Argument for its observation, <hi>So if we will be the Children of our heavenly Father, we must be careful to keep the Christian Sabbath Day, which is the Sunday, not only for that it is God's express Commandment, but also to declare our selves to be loving Children, in following the Example of our gracious Lord and Father.</hi> After which it follows again in the next Paragraph (which is also concealed by the Doctor, tho it connects the words aforegoing, and the passage he next makes use of, together), <hi>Thus it may plainly appear that God's Will and Commandment was to have a solemn time, and standing-day in the week, wherein the People should come together, and have in remembrance his wonderful Benefits, and to render him thanks for them, as appertaineth to loving and obedient People.</hi> From all which put together, I shall leave it to the ingenuous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge who hath most perverted the sence of this Homily, the Lord Primate, or the Doctor and whether or no these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions following do not clearly follow from the passages above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited; first, that by the fourth Commandment <hi>it is God's perpetual Will to have one solemn and standing Day in the week for People to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to worship and serve him</hi> Secondly, That this day, tho it be not the seventh day from the Creation, yet <hi>is still the Christian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or day of Rest,</hi> being still the seventh day, and still observed, (not only because of our Saviour Christ's Resurrection on this day)

                     <hi>but also that we keep the Christian Sabbath, which is the Sunday, as well for that it is God's express Commandment, as also to shew our selves dutiful Children, in following the Example of our gracious Lord and Father, who rested on the seventh day.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That on this Christian Sabbath, or Sunday, we ought to rest from our lawful and needful works, and common and daily business; and also give our selves wholly to Heavenly Exercises of God's true Religion and Service.</hi> And therefore this being the express words and sence of this Homily, that we may not make it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it self, the passages which the Doctor relies so much upon, must have this reasonable construction, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Maker there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, tho he supposed that we Christians were not obliged to the precise keeping of the seventh day after the manner of the Jews, <hi>Yet notwithstanding whatsoever is found in this Commandment appertaining to the Law of Nature, &amp;c. as most just and needful for the setting forth of God's Glory, ought to be retained and kept of all Christian People.</hi> Which words must be understood in a clean contrary sence to the Doctor's, <hi>viz.</hi> that the meaning of the Author was, (and which our Church confirms) that by the Law of Nature the seventh day or one day in seven is to be kept holy; or otherwise to what purpose serve these words before recited, viz. <hi>thus it may plainly appear that God's Will and Commandment was to have one solemn and standing Day in the week, wherein People should come together &amp;c.</hi> (that is, now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as before under the Law.) And what follows, which the Doctor thinks makes for him, viz. <hi>This Example and Commandment of God the Godly Christian People began to follow immediatly after the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension of our Lord Christ, and began to chuse them a standing day of the week to come together in; yet not the seventh day, which the Jews kept, but the Lord's Day, the Day of the Lord's Resurrection, the day after the seventh day, which is the first day of the week, &amp;c.</hi> does rather make against him; that is, by Gods Example as well as Command, they were obliged after Christs Ascension to chuse them one standing day of the week to meet together in: And if so, that must be one day in seven by an immutable moral institution; or else, the Church might, if they had so pleased, have celebrated the Lord's Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (not as the Homily says) on one standing day of the week, but only at Easter; and the Law of Nature, according to the Doctor, not tying us to observe one day in seven, if this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of keeping the Sabbath, or seventh day, oblige none but the Jews; then the primitive Church might, if they had pleased, have quite left off setting aside any particular day of the week for God's Service, and have thought it sufficient to have kept one day (suppose) in a month or two, for Men to meet together for the Service and Worship of God: which whether those of the Doctor's Party would be pleased with, I shall not dispute; but sure I am
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60492:64"/>
that the Church of <hi>England</hi> maintains no such Doctrine. But the Doctor, because he thinks the Homily not enough of his side, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to shew us upon what grounds the Lord's day stood in the Church of <hi>England</hi> at the time of the making this Homily, and therefore he has put down the <hi>Proem</hi> of an Act of Parliament of the fifth and sixth years of <hi>Edward the 6th</hi> concerning Holy-days, by which he would have the Lord's day to stand on no other ground but the Authority of the Church, <hi>not as enjoyned by Christ, or ordained by any of his Apostles.</hi> Which Statute whosoever shall be pleased to peruse, may easily see that this <hi>Proem</hi> he mentions, relates only to Holy days, and not to Sundays, as you may observe from this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, viz.<hi>—which holy Works as they may be called God's Service, so the times especially appointed for the same are called Holy-days, not for the matter or nature either of the time or day, &amp;c.</hi> which title of Holy-days was never applied to Sundays, either in a vulgar, or legal accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And tho the Doctor fancied this Act was in force at the time when this Homily was made, and therefore must by no means contradict so sacred an Authority as that of the <hi>Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons assembled in Parliament:</hi> because this Act, tho repealed by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> he would have to be revived again the first year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and so to stand in force at the time of making this Homily; whereas whoever consults our Statute-Book, will find that this Statute of King <hi>Edward the 6th</hi> was not revived, nor in force till the first of King <hi>James,</hi> when the Repeal of this Statute was again repealed: tho certainly the reviving of that, or any other Statute, does not make their <hi>Proems</hi> (which are often ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carelesly drawn) to be in every clause either good Law, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: But tho the Doctor in other things abhors the Temporal Powers having any thing to do in matters of Religion; yet if it make for his Opinion, then the Authority of a Parliament shall be as good as that of a Convocation. But I have dwelt too long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Head, which I could not well contract, if I spoke any thing at all to justifie the Lord Primat's Judgment in this so mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial a Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The next Point that the <hi>Doctor</hi> lays to the Lord <hi>Primat</hi>'s charge <note place="margin">Resp. Pet. Sect. 10.</note> as not according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is a passage in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Dr. Bernard,</hi> and by him published in the Book, intituled, <hi>The Judgment of the late Primat of</hi> Ireland, &amp;c. viz. <hi>That he ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Opinion to be, that</hi> Episcopus &amp; Presbyter gradu tantum dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferunt, non ordine, <hi>and consequently that in places where Bishops cannot be had, the Ordination by Presbyters standeth valid. And however</hi> (saith he) <hi>I must needs think that the Churches in</hi> France, <hi>who living under a Popish Power, and cannot do what they would, are more excusable in that defect than those of the</hi> Low-Countries, <hi>that live under a Free-State, yet</hi>

                     <hi>for the testifying my communion with these Churches (which I do love and honour as true members of the Church Universal) I do profess, that with like affection I should receive the blessed Sacrament at the hands of the Dutch Ministers, if I were in</hi> Holland, <hi>as I should do at the hands of the French Ministers, if I were at</hi> Charenton. Which Opinion as I cannot deny to have been my Lord <hi>Primat's,</hi> since I find the same written almost <hi>verbatim</hi> with his own hand, (dated <hi>Nov.</hi> 26. 1655, in a private Note-Book) not many months before his death, with the addition of this clause at the beginning, viz. <hi>Yet, on the other side, holding as I do, That a Bishop hath Superiority in degree above Presbyters, you may easily judg that the Ordination made by such Presbyters as have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered themselves from their Bishops, cannot possibly by me be excused from being schismatical.</hi> And concluding with another clause, <hi>viz. for the agreement or disagreement in radical and fundamental Doctrines; not the consonancy, or dissonancy in the particular points of Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is with me (and I hope with every man that mindeth Peace) the rule of adhering to, or receding from the Communion of any Church.</hi> And that the Lord Primate was always of this Opinion, I find by another Note of his own hand, written in another Book many years before this, in these words, <hi>viz. The intrinsecal power of Ordaining proceedeth not from Jurisdiction, but only from Order. But a Presbyter hath the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in</hi> specie <hi>with a Bishop;</hi> Ergo, <hi>A Presbyter hath equally an intrinsecal power to give Orders; and is equal to him in the power of Order; the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop having no higher degree in respect of intension, or extention of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Order; tho he hath an higher degree,</hi> i. e. <hi>a more eminent place in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Authority and Jurisdiction in Spiritual Regiment. Again, The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists teach that the confirmation of the Baptized is proper to a Bishop, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Episcopal Character as well as Ordination: and yet in some cases may be communicated to a Presbyter, and much more therefore in regard of the over-ruling Commands of invincible necessity, although the right of Baptising was given by Christ's own Commission to the Apostles, and their Successors: and yet in case of Necessity allowed to Lay-men: even so Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation might be devolved to Presbyters in case of Necessity.</hi> These passages perhaps may seem to some Men inconsistent with what the Lord Primate hath written in some of his printed Treatises, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of the Original of Episcopacy, wherein he proves from <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1. that the Stars there described in our blessed Saviour's right hand, to be the Angels of the seven Churches. 2. That these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were the several Bishops of those Churches, and not the whole Colledg of Presbyters, as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> would have it. 3. Nor has he proved Archbishops less ancient, each of these seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being at that time a Metropolis, which had several Bishops under it; and (4) that these Bishops and Archbishops were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Apostles, as constant permanent Officers in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60492:66"/>
Church, and so in some sort <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> that is, in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s sence, were ordained by the Apostles for the better conferring of Orders, and for preventing of Schisms, which would otherwise arise among Presbyters, if they had been all left equal, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to each other. And that this may very well consist with their being in some cases of Necessity, not absolutely necessary in some Churches, is proved by the Learned Mr. <hi>Mason,</hi> in his defence of the Ordination of Ministers beyond the Seas, where there are no Bishops, in which he proves at large against the Papists, that make this Objection from their own Schoolmen and Canonists; <q>and that tho a Bishop receives a Sacred Office, Eminency in Degree, and a larger Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction than a Presbyter, yet that all these do not confer an absolute distinct Order; and yet that Bishops are still <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that is, by the Ordinance of God, since they were ordained by the Apostles, and whereunto they were directed by God's Holy Spirit, and in that sence are the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God. But if by <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> you would understand a Law binding all Christian Churches universally, perpetually, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably, and with such absolute Necessity that no other form of Regiment may in any case be admitted, in this sence we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grant it to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
                     </q> And much of the same Opinion is the Learned Bishop <hi>Davenant</hi> in his Treatise.</p>
                  <p>So that you see here that as Learned Men, and as stout Asserters of Episcopacy as any the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath had, have been of the Lord Primat's Judgment in this matter, tho without any design to lessen the Order of Bishops, or to take away their use in the Church, since Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> in the said Treatise, tho he grants the French Churches (having a constant President of the Presbytery) to enjoy the substance of the Episcopal Office; Yet whereas their Discipline is still very defective, he wishes them in the bowels of Christ by all means to redress and reform it, and to conform themselves to the ancient Custom of the Church of Christ: So that I hope after all, this Question, Whether Episcopacy be <hi>Ordo,</hi> or <hi>Gradus,</hi> will prove only a difference in words rather than sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, between those of the Lord Primat's Judgment, and those of the contrary, since they are both agreed in the main Points in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trove sie between them and the Presbyterians, <hi>viz.</hi> That Bishops were ordained in the Church by the Apostles themselves, from the direction, or at least approbation of our Saviour himself, being the Stars which St. <hi>John</hi> saw in his Vision in our Lord Christ's own Hand, and that they are permanent, immutable Officers in the Church, which cannot subsist without it, but in Cases of pure Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. And lastly, that those Presbyters, which in Churches founded and setled with Bishops, do separate from them, are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60492:67"/>
guilty of Schism. These things being agreed upon on both sides, I think the rest of the Controversie is not worth contending about: But if any Learned Persons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are well vers'd in the Writings of the Fathers, and other ancient Monuments of the Church, have already proved, or can further make out, that Episcopacy has always been an absolute distinct Order, as well as Office in the Church, I suppose the Lord Primate, were he now alive, would be so far from opposing them, that he would heartily thank them for giving him greater light, provided it could be done without unchurching all those Protestant Churches abroad vvho want Bishops. And I hope however, if the Lord Primat may be thought by the Doctor, or others, not to go high enough in this matter, nor sufficiently to magnifie his own Office, yet that he may well be pardoned, since it proceeded from his excess of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and Charity towards our neighbouring-Churches, to whom no good Protestants ought to deny the right-hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p>The third Point which the Doctor will have the Lord Primat to hold contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 
                     <q>which (he says) maintains an Universal Redemption of all Mankind, by the Sufferings and Death of Christ, as is proved by the Prayer of Consecration of the sacred Elements in the Sacrament, which declares, <hi>that God hath given to his Son Jesus Christ, by his suffering death upon the Cross, and by the Oblation of himself, a full and sufficient Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Oblation, and Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> And also that in the publick Catechism, the party catechised is taught, <hi>to believe in God the Son, who hath redeemed him, and all Mankind.</hi> But that in this Point the Lord Primat is of a contrary Judgment to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For as he seems not to like their opinion, who contradict the riches of Christ's Satisfaction into too narrow a room, as if none had any interest therein but such as were elected before the foundation of the World; so he declareth his dislike of the other Extream (as he is pleased to call it) by which the benefit of this Satisfaction is extended to the Redemption of all Mankind. The one Extremity (saith he) extends the benefit of Christ's Satisfaction so far, <hi>ut reconciliationem cum Deo, &amp; Peccatorem Remissionem singulis impetraverit, as to obtain a Reconciliation with God, and a Remission of Sins for all Men at his merciful hands,</hi> p. 21. which <note place="margin">The Lord Primat's Judgment.</note> tho they are the words of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> at the Conference at the <hi>Hague, Anno</hi> 1611, and are by him reckoned for untrue; yet do they naturally result from the Doctrine of Universal Redemption, which is maintained in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> not that all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is so perfectly reconciled to Almighty God, as to be really and actually discharged from all their Sins, before they actually
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60492:67"/>
believe, (which the Lord Primate makes to be the meaning and effect of that Extremity, as he calls it, p. 2.) but that they are so far reconciled unto Him as to be capable of the remission of their Sins, in case they do not want that Faith in their common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour which is required thereunto.</q> And here the Doctor thinks he finds out two notable Contradictions in the Lord Primat's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Year 1617, since in one part thereof, <hi>he seems to dislike of their Opinion, who contract the riches of Christ's Satisfaction into too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a room; as if none had any kind of interest therein, but such as were elected before the foundation of the World,</hi> as before was said. And in the other he declares, <hi>that he is well assured that our Saviour hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the hands of his Father Reconciliation, and Forgiveness of Sins, not for the Reprobate, but Elect only.</hi> p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1. Now the Doctor has done his worst. Yet I hope to prove that tho there may be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between my Lord Primat's way of explaining this Doctrine, and that of the Doctor's, (which proceeds indeed from the different Notions they had of Election and Reprobation); Yet that there is no such formidable Contradiction in these two Propositions of my Lord Primat's by him laid down, as the Doctor fancies; or that the L. Primat hath maintained any thing in this Doctrine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for (1.) the Doctor owns that all Mankind is not so perfectly reconciled to Almighty God, as to be really and actually discharged from all their Sins, before they actually believe; but that they are so far reconciled unto him, as to be capable of the remission of their Sins, in case they do not want that Faith in their common Saviour which is required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Now what will the Doctor get by these words, <hi>[if they are so far reconciled to him, as to be capable of the remission of their Sins, in case they do not want that Faith which is required thereunto]</hi> since the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on still remains between the Lord Primat, and those of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion, Whether all Men can obtain, without the aid of Grace, this saving Faith which is required thereunto Our Saviour says the direct contrary, Joh. 6. 44, 65. <hi>No Man can come to me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father which hath sent me, draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, Ephes. 2. 8. <hi>For by Grace are ye saved, through Faith; and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God.</hi> So <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. And that likewise it is the greatness of God's Power that raises Man's heart unto this Faith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 19. So then Faith being the work of God in Man's heart, (which he bestows on whom he pleases) all the question now is, Whether Christ has obtained Reconciliation, and Remission of Sins from his Father for those whom God foresaw would, or could not obtain this saving Faith and if not, consequently not for the Reprobate, (as the Lord Primat hath laid down) they being only Reprobate, for want of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60492:68"/>
this Faith. Nor will this be contradictory to my Lord Prim at's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proposition, <hi>against such who contract the Riches of Christ's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction into too narrow a room, as if none had any kind of interest therein, but such as were elected before the foundation of the World.</hi> Since this is to be understood of the <hi>Supralapsarian</hi> Opinion, which makes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to be antecedant to the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not only at a <hi>Praeterition,</hi> but a <hi>Predamnation</hi> for actual Sins. Whereas the Lord Primat held that Mankind considered <hi>in massa corrupta</hi> after the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> was the only Object of God's Election or Reprobation; so that it is in this sence that he is to be understood when he says that <hi>our Saviour hath obtainedat the hands of his Father forgiveness of Sins, not for the Reprobate, but Elect only.</hi> Nor does he say that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from any deficiency in our Saviour's Death, and Satisfaction, which is sufficient to save the whole World, if they would lay hold of it, and apply it to themselves; but the reason why all Men were not thereby saved, was, because they do not accept Salvation when offered to them. Which is the Lord Primat's express words, in a Sermon upon <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. concerning our Redemption by Christ. So that those passages in our Liturgy and Catechism, before cited by the Doctor, of Christ's being a sufficient Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World; and in the Catechism, of his redeeming all Mankind; must certainly be understood in this restrictive sence, <hi>viz.</hi> to as many of the World of Mankind, as God foresaw would lay hold of this Satisfaction by Faith and good Works; or else all Men must have a like share therein, whether they contribute any thing to it by Faith or Repentance or not. And now I shall leave it to the indifferent Reader to judg whether the Lord Primat or the Doctor are most to be blamed for breaking their Subscription to the 39 Articles (as the Doctor would have him guilty of in this Point) because the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its second Article says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, <hi>that Christ suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a Sacrifice not only for Original Guilt, but also for the Actual Sins of Men. In which</hi> (says he) <hi>as well the Sacrifice, as the effect and fruit thereof, which is the Reconciliation of Mankind to God the Father, is delivered in general terms, without any restriction put upon them; neither the Sacrifice, nor the Reconciliation being restrained to this or that Man, some certain</hi> quidams <hi>of their own, whom they pass commonly by the name of God's Elect. The Sacrifice being made for the Sins of Men, of Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitly without limitation, is not to be confined to some few Men only.</hi> Yet after the Doctor has said all he can, it seems still to me (and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to any unprejudiced Reader) <hi>that these Christ suffered, &amp;c. to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile his Father to us, and to be a Sacrifice, &amp;c. for the actual Sins of Men</hi>—to be, not general, but limited Propositions: since by <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling his Father to us,</hi> can be understood no further than <hi>to us</hi> that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60492:68"/>
are not Reprobates (every Man supposing himself not to be of that number); and in this sence the Lord Primat himself makes use of the words <hi>we</hi> and <hi>us</hi> in his Body of Divinity, when he speaks of Justification and Reconciliation by Faith, tho he there sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses that all Men are not actually justified, nor reconciled to God by Christ's Sufferings. And as for the last clause, it is no more general than the former: for tho the word <hi>Men</hi> be used in that place indefinitly, yet it is not therefore a general Proposition, it being still to be understood of those Men who truly believe; for otherwise it had been very easie and natural for the Framers of this Article to have added this small word <hi>[all]</hi> and if they had, the question would have been much as it was before, Christ's Death being a Sacrifice that did not actually take away the Sins of the whole World, (for then none could be damned) <hi>tho vertually it hath power to do it, if it were rightly applied, the Sacrifice having such virtue in it self, that if all the World would take it and apply it, it were able to expiate the Sins of the whole World,</hi> as the Lord Primat in the above cited Sermon very plainly and truly expresses himself on this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Point which the Doctor accuses the Lord Primat not to hold according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is that of the true and real Presence of Christ's most precious Body and Blood in the Sacrament. Which Doctrine of a real Presence, he first proves from the words of the distribution, retained in the first Liturgy of King <hi>Edward the sixth,</hi> and formerly prescribed to be used in the ancient Missals, viz. <q>
                        <hi>The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee, preserve thy Body and Soul unto Life everlasting. The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi> It is proved, secondly, by that passage in the publick Catechism, in which the party catechised is taught to say, <hi>that the Body and Blood of Christ are verily and indeed taken and received of the Faithful in the Lord's Supper.</hi> Now if a question should be made, what the Church means by <hi>verily and indeed</hi> in the former passage it must be answered, that she means, that Christ is truly and really present in that blessed Sacrament, as before was said; the words being rendred thus in the Latin Translation, viz. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus &amp; Sanguis Domini quae verè &amp; realiter exhibentur, &amp;c.</hi> verily and indeed, as the English hath it, the same with <hi>verè</hi> and <hi>realiter,</hi> (that is to say, truly and really): as it is in the Latin. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise cites Bp. <hi>Bilson,</hi> Bp <hi>Morton,</hi> and Bp. <hi>Andrews,</hi> all of them to maintain a true and real Prefence of Christ in the Sacrament; and likewise Mr. <hi>Alex. Noel</hi> in his Latin Catechism makes the party catechized answer to this effect, That the Body and Blood of Christ given in the Lord's Supper, and eaten and drank by them, tho it be only in an heavenly and spiritual manner, yet are they

both given and taken truly and really, or in very deed, by God's faithful People. By which it seems it is agreed on both sides, (that is to say, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> that there is a true and real Presence of Christ in the holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, the disagreement being only in the <hi>modus Praesentiae.</hi> But on the contrary, the Ld Primat, in his Answer to the Jesuit's Challenge, hath written one whole Chapter against the real Presence of Christ in the Sacrament; In which tho he would seem to aim at the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (tho by that Church not only the real Presence of Christ in the Sacrament, but the corporal eating of his Body is maintained and taught) yet doth he strike obliquely and on the by on the Church of <hi>England.</hi> All that he doth allow concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the real Presence is no more than this, viz. <hi>That in the receiving of the blessed Sacrament, we are to distinguish between the outward and the inward action of the Communicant. In the outward, with our bodily mouth we receive really the visible Elements of Bread and Wine; in the inward, we do by Faith really receive the Body and Blood of our Lord; that is to say, we are truly and indeed made partakers of Christ crucified, to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual strengthning of our inward man.</hi> Which is no more than any Calvinist will stick to say.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now after all these hard words the Doctor has here bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my Lord Primat (part of which I omit); I think I can without much difficulty make it appear, that all this grievous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of the Doctor's is nothing but a meer <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a strife about words, and that the Lord Primat held and believed this Doctrine in the same sence with the Church of <hi>England;</hi> 1. Then the 29th Article of our Church disavows all Transubstantiation, or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine in the Supper of the Lord. The second asserts that the Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper, only after an heavenly and spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and that the mean whereby the Body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith. And now I will leave it to the unprejudiced Reader to judge whether the Lord Primat's way of explaining this Sacrament (according to the passage before cited by the Doctor) does differ in sence from these Articles, (however it may somewhat in words, as coming nearer the Articles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which the Bishop when he writ this Book had alone subscribed to, and was bound to maintain): for I think no true Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> will deny that in this Sacrament they still real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive the visible Elements of Bread and Wine. 2. That in the inward and spiritual action we really receive the Body and Blood of our Lord, as the Lord Primat has before laid down. But perhaps it will be said, That the Lord Primat goes further in this Article than the Church of <hi>England</hi> does, and takes upon him to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60492:69"/>
explain in what sence we receive the Body and Blood of our Lord, and that otherwise than the Church of <hi>England</hi> does; he explaining it thus, <hi>that is to say, We are truly and indeed made partakers of Christ crucified, to the spiritual strengthning of our inward man;</hi> whereas the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares that the Body of Christ is eaten only after a heavenly and spiritual manner; yet still maintains the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ to be eaten, whereas the Lord Primat only says, that we are truly and indeed made partakers of Christ crucified, but does not say (as the Article of our Church does) that we are therein partakers of the Body and Blood of Christ. But I desire the Objector to consider whether the Explanation of our Church, does not amount to the same thing in effect, that saying that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ is eaten in the Supper after a heavenly and spiritual manner; and the Lord Primat, that we are truly and indeed made partakers of Christ crucified, <hi>viz.</hi> after a spiritual, and not a carnal manner. But perhaps the Doctor's Friends may still object, that the Lord Primat does not express this Real Presence of Christ's Body and Blood in the Sacrament, as <hi>Bp. Bilson</hi> and <hi>Bp. Morton</hi> assert, the former saying <hi>that Christ's Flesh and Blood are truly present, and truly received by the Faithful in the Sacrament, and the latter expresly owning a real Presence therein</hi> And <hi>Bp. Andrews</hi> in his Apology to Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> thus declares himself, viz. <hi>Praesentiam credimus non minus quam vos veram, de modo praesentiae nil timerè definimus.</hi> Which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor renders thus: We acknowledg (saith he) a presence as true <hi>and</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>He adds the word</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>which is not in the Latin.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>real</hi> as you do, but we determine nothing rashly of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it. And the Church Catechism above cited, as also the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Catechism of Mr. <hi>Noel, confess the Body and Blood of our Lord are truly and indeed (or as the Latin Translation renders it,</hi> verè &amp; realiter) <hi>taken and received in the Lord's Supper.</hi> Which the Lord Primat does not affirm. I know not what such Men would have. The Lord Primat asserts that we do by Faith <hi>really</hi> receive the Body and Blood of Christ, and that in the same sence with Mr. <hi>Noel</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism, and the Article of the Church, viz. <hi>that Christ's Body is received after a spiritual and heavenly manner.</hi> Which was added to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any real presence as taken in a carnal or bodily sence. So that our Church does in this Article explain the manner of the Presence (notwithstanding what <hi>Bp. Andrews</hi> says to the contrary.) Nor know I what they can here further mean by a <hi>real Presence,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a carnal one; which indeed the Church of <hi>England</hi> at the first Reformation thought to be all one with the <hi>real,</hi> as appears by these words, in the first Articles of Religion agreed on in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation 1552, <hi>(Anno</hi> 5. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.) <hi>It becometh not any of the Faithful to believe or profess, that there is a Real or Corporal Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ in the holy Eucharist.</hi> And that our Church did
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60492:70"/>
likewise at the first passing the 39 Articles in Convocation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1562, likewise disallow any Real Presence, taken in a carnal sence, <hi>Christ's Body being always in Heaven at the right hand of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be in more places than one:</hi> appears by the original of those Articles, to be seen in the Library of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledg in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> where tho this passage against a Real or Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence (which they then thought to be all one) are dash'd over with red Ink; yet so, as it is still legible, therefore it may not be <note place="margin">vid. <hi>Dr</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net<hi>'s Hist. of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 405.</note> amiss to give you Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Reasons in his 2d part of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Reformation, p. 406, for the doing of it,<hi>—The secret of it was this; The Queen and her Council studied to unite all into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church; and it was alledged, that such an express Definition against a Real Presence, might drive from the Church many who were still of that perswasion; and therefore it was thought to be enough to condemn Transubstantiation, and to say that Christ was present after a spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and received by Faith. And to say more; as it was judged superfluous, so it might occasion division. Upon this, these words were by common consent left out; and in the next Convocation the Articles were subscribed without them. This shews that the Doctrine of the Church, then subscribed by the whole Convocation, was at that time contrary to the belief of a Real and Corporal Presence in the Sacrament; only it was not thought necessary, or expedient to publish it. Tho from this silence, which flowed not from their Opinion, but the Wisdom of that Time, in leaving a liberty for different Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, as to the manner of the Presence. Some have since inferred, that the chief Pastors of this Church did then disapprove of the Definition made in King</hi> Edward<hi>'s time, and that they were for a Real Presence.</hi> And that our Protestant Bishops that were martyr'd in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> days were against this expression of a Real Presence of Christ as a Natural Body, appears by those Questions which they disputed on solemnly at <hi>Oxford</hi> before their Martyrdom: The first Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Whether the Natural Body of Christ was Really in the Sacrament</hi> The second, <hi>Whether no other substance did remain but the Body and Blood of Christ</hi> Both which they held in the Negative. So that since this expression of a Real Presence of Christ's Body, was not maintained by our first Protestant Reformers, nor used by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Articles, I do not see of what use it can be now, (tho perhaps only meant in a spiritual sence by most that make use of it; For the real presence of a Body, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodily; I suppose those that speak thus, understand as little as I do) unless that some Men love to come as near the Papists as may be in their expressions, tho without any hopes now of ever making them approach the nearer to us, and in the mean time giving matter of offence and scandal to divers ignorant and weak Christians of our own Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60492:70"/>The fifth Point that the Doctor taxes the Lord Primat with as held by him contrary to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is,
<q>That she teaches that the Priest hath power to forgive Sins, as may be easily proved by three several Arguments, not very easie to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. The first is from those solemn words, used in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Priest, or Presbyter, that is to say, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost. Whose Sins ye forgive, they are forgiven; and whose Sins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they are retained.</hi> Which were a gross prophanation of the words of our Lord and Saviour, and a meer mockery of the Priest, if no such power were given unto him, as is there affirmed. The second Argument is taken from one of the Exhortations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Communion, where we find the people are exhorted by the Priest, <hi>that if they cannot quiet their Consciences, they should come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, or some other discreet Minister of God's Word, and open their grief, that they may receive such ghostly advice and comfort, as their Consciences may be relieved, and that by the Ministry of God's Word they may receive Comfort, and the benefit of Absolution, to the quieting of their Consciences, and avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness.</hi> The third and most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Proof, is the Form prescribed for the Visitation of the Sick; In which it is required, <hi>that after the sick Person hath made a Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Faith, and professed himself to be in Charity with all Men, he shall then make a special Confession, if he feel his Conscience troubled with any weighty matter.</hi> And then it follows, that after such Confession, the Minister shall absolve him in this manner, viz. <hi>Our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ who hath left power to his Church to absolve all Sinners that truly repent, and believe in him, of his great Mercy forgive thee thine Offences: And by his Authority committed to me, I absolve thee from all thy Sins, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.</hi> Of the first of these three places, deduced all of them from the best Monuments and Records of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Lord Primat takes notice in his Answer to the Jesuit's Challenge, p. 109. where he treateth purposely of the Priests power to forgive Sins, but gives us such a Gloss upon it, as utterly subverts as well the Doctrine of this Church in that particular, as her purpose in it. And of the second he takes notice, p. 81. where he speaks purposely of Confession, but gives us such a Gloss upon that also, as he did upon the other. But of the third, which is more posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and material than the other two, he is not pleased to take any notice at all, as if no such Doctrine were either taught by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or no such Power had been ever exercised by the Ministers of it: For in the canvassing of this Point, he declares sometimes that the Priest doth forgive Sins only <hi>declarative,</hi> by the way of declaration only; when on the consideration of the true Faith, and sincere Repentance of the Party penitent, he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60492:71"/>
unto him in the Name of God, that his Sins are pardoned, and sometimes that the Priest forgives Sins only <hi>optativè,</hi> by the way of Prayers and Intercession; when on the like consideration he makes his prayers unto God, that the Sins of the Penitent may be pardoned. Neither of which comes up unto the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which holdeth that the Priest forgiveth Sins <hi>authoritativè,</hi> by virtue of a Power committed to him by our Lord and Saviour. That the Supream power of forgiving Sins is in God alone, against whose Divine Majesty all Sins, of what sort soever, may be truly said to be committed, was never question'd by any who pretended to the Christian Faith. The Power which is given to the Priest is but a delegated power, such as is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by Judges under Soveraign Princes (where they are not tied unto the Verdict of Twelve Men, as with us in <hi>England)</hi> who by the Power committed to them in their several Circuits and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, do actually absolve the party which is brought before them, if on good proof they find him innocent of the Crimes he stands accused for, and so discharge him of his Irons. And such a power as this, I say, is both given to, and exercised by the Priest, or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For if they did forgive Sins only <hi>declarativè;</hi> that form of Absolution which follows the general Confession in the beginning of the Common-prayer-Book would have been sufficient, where the Absolution is put in the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; Or, if he did forgive Sins only <hi>optativè,</hi> in the way of prayers and intercession, there could not be a better way of Absolution, than that which is prescribed to be used by the Priest or Bishop, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the general Confession made by such as are to receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, viz. <hi>Almighty God, and heavenly Father, &amp;c. have mercy upon you, pardon you, and deliver you from all your Sins, &amp;c.</hi> Or else the first clause in the form of Absolution used at the Visitation of the Sick, would have served the turn; viz. <hi>Our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath left Power to his Church to absolve all Sinners, which truly repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, of his great Mercy forgive thee thine Offences;</hi> And there could be no reason at all imaginable why the next clause should be superadded to this prayer, viz. <hi>And by his Authority committed to me, I absolve thee from all thy Sins, &amp;c.</hi> if the Priest did not forgive Sins <hi>Authoritativè,</hi> by such a delegated and commissionated power as before we spake of</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all which tedious Charge of the Doctor's against the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> which I have been forced to transcribe, to let the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader see I shall not answer him by halves, I doubt not but to prove that first the Doctor hath dealt very disingenuously with the <hi>Lord Primat</hi>'s Book, by him there cited, out of which he hath culled some passages here and there, on purpose to cavil and find
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60492:71"/>
fault: For I shall shew you (1.) that the <hi>Lord Primat</hi> doth there assert, that whatsoever the Priest or Minister contributes in this great Work of Cleansing the Souls of Men, they do it as God's Ministers, and receiving a power from God so to do; and that tho perhaps he does not make use of the Doctor's distinction of <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritativè,</hi> yet he speaks the same sence. (2.) That admit the Priest does absolve <hi>authoritativè,</hi> Yet that this Absolution can only operate <hi>declarativè,</hi> or <hi>optativè,</hi> and not absolutely. And 3dly, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> in none of the three forms of Absolution above mentioned (no not in the last which he so much insists upon) does pretend to give any larger power to the Priest or Minister than this amounts to.</p>
                  <p>As for the first Head I have laid down, I shall prove it from the <hi>Lord Primat</hi>'s own words, in the same Treatise before cited by the Doctor; who agrees with the <hi>Lord Primat,</hi> that the supream power of forgiving Sins is in God alone. Next, that the power given to the Priest, is but a delegated power from God himself. Now that the <hi>Lord Primat</hi> owns the Priest, or Minister, to be endowed with such a power, I shall put down his own words in the said Book: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p> Having thus reserved unto God his Prerogative <note place="margin">Answer to the Jesuits Challenge.</note> Royal in Cleansing the Soul, we give unto his under Officers their due, when we account of them as of the Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the Mysteries of God. Not as Lords, that have power to dispose of Spiritual Graces as they please, but as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that are tied to follow their Master's prescriptions therein; and in following thereof, do but bring their external Ministry, (for which it self also they are beholden to God's Mercy and Goodness) God conferring the inward Blessing of his Spirit thereupon, when and where he will: <hi>Who then is Paul,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself) <hi>and who is Apollos, but Ministers by whom ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, even as the Lord gave to every Man.</hi> Therefore, saith <hi>Optatus,</hi> in all the Servants there is no Dominion, but a Ministery; <hi>Cui creditur, ipse dat quod creditur, non per quem creditur;</hi> It is he who is believed, that giveth the thing that is believed, not he by whom we do believe. Whereas our Saviour then saith unto his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Joh. 20. <hi>Receive the holy Ghost. Whose Sins ye forgive, shall be forgiven.</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> make this Observation thereupon, that this is not their work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but the work of the holy Ghost, who remitteth by them, and therein performeth the works of the true God.</p>
                     <p>To forgive Sins therefore being thus proper to God only, and <note place="margin">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60492:72"/>
to apply those means by which he useth to forgive Sins, and to give notice unto Repentant Sinners of that Forgiveness. For who can forgive Sins but God alone yet doth he forgive by them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, unto whom he hath given power to forgive, saith St. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> And tho it be the proper work of God to remit Sins, saith <hi>Ferus;</hi> yet are the Apostles (and their Successors) said to remit also, not simply, but because they apply those means whereby God doth remit Sins.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>After the <hi>Lord Primat</hi> had shewed in the pages before-going, that the power of binding and loosing consists in exercising the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline <note place="margin">P. 127.</note> of the Church, in debarring or admitting Penitents from or to the Communion, he proceeds thus; <q>That this Authority of loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remaineth still in the Church, we constantly maintain against the Heresie of the <hi>Montanists</hi> and <hi>Novations,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after having confuted the uncharitableness of those Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, <note place="margin">P. 128.</note> who denied that Penitents who had committed heinous Sins, ought to be received into the Communion of the Church, goes on thus; That speech of his <hi>(viz.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s) is specially noted, and pressed against the Hereticks by St. <hi>Ambrose, </hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave it, in the Person of Christ. For as in the Name, and by the Power of our Lord Jesus Christ, such a one was delivered to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; for God having given unto him Repentance, to recover himself out of the snare of the Devil; in the same Name, and in the same Power was he to be restored again; the Ministers of Reconciliation standing in Christ's stead, and Christ himself being in the midst of them that are thus gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his Name, will bind or loose in Heaven, whatsoever they accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Commission shall bind or loose on Earth.</hi>
                     </q> Then after he has shewn that the power of the Priest, or Ministers of the Gospel, is only ministerial and declarative, like that of the Priests under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>

Whereupon the Master of the Sentences (following herein St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and being afterwards therein followed himself by many others) observeth that in remitting, or retaining Sins, the Priests of the Gospel have that Right and Office, which the Legal Priests had of old under the Law, in curing of the Lepers. These therefore (saith he) forgive Sins, or retain them, whiles they shew, and declare that they are forgiven, or retained by God. For the

                        </note> or a Parrat likewise, if he be taught the words, may in this sence as well absolve as the Priest as if the speech were all the thing that here were to be considered, and not the power: whereas we are taught that the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. Indeed if the Priests by their Office brought nothing with them but the Ministry of the bare Letter, a <hi>Parrat</hi> peradventure might be taught to found that Letter as well as they; but we believe that God hath made them able Ministers of the New Testament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; and that the Gospel ministred by them, cometh unto us not in vvord only, but also in power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much assurance. For God hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a speical beauty to the feet of them that preach the Gospel of Peace, that howsoever others may bring glad-tidings of good things to the penitent Sinner, as truly as they do; yet neither can they do it with the same authority, neither is it to be expected that they should do it with such power, such assurance, and such full satisfaction to the afflicted Conscience. The speech of every Christian (we know) should be imployed to the use of edifying, that it may minister Grace unto the Hearers; and a private Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his place may deliver sound Doctrine, reprehend Vice, exhort to Righteousness very commendably: yet hath the Lord notwithstanding all this, for the necessary use of his Church, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed publick Officers to do the same things, and hath given to them a peculiar power for edification, wherein they may boast above others; and in the due execution whereof God is pleased to make them Instruments of ministring a more plentiful measure of Grace unto their Hearers, than may be ordinarily looked for from others.—These are God's Angels, and Ambassadors for Christ, <note place="margin">P. 137.</note> and therefore in delivering their Message are to be received as an Angel of God, yea as Christ Jesus. That look how the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> was comforted when the Angel said unto him, <hi>Thy Iniquity is taken away, and thy Sin purged;</hi> and the poor Woman in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, when Jesus said unto her, <hi>Thy Sins are forgiven:</hi> The like Consolation doth the distressed Sinner receive from the mouth of the Minister; when he hath compared the truth of God's Word faithfully delivered by him, with the work of God's Grace in his own heart. For as it is the Office of this Messenger, to pray us in Christ's stead, that we would be reconciled unto God: so when we have listned unto this motion, and submitted our selves to the Gospel of Peace, it is a part of his Office likewise to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60492:73"/>
us in Christ's stead, that we are reconciled to God: and in him Christ himself must be acknowledged to speak, who to us-ward by this means is not weak, but mighty in us.</p>

                  <p>Having now shewn what the Lord Primate hath said in that Treatise; That the Absolution of the Priest, or Minister, tho it be <hi>declarativè,</hi> yet is still <hi>authoritativè,</hi> by virtue of that power which Christ hath commited unto him.

                     <q>That tho the Lord Primat has spoken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the declarative and optative Forms of Absolution, yet he hath taken no notice of the Indicative, or that which is used in the Absolution of the Sick: of which sort take the Lord Primat's words; In the days of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> there arose a Learned Man <note place="margin">P. 123.</note> among the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves, who found fault with that Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Form of Absolution then used by the Priest, <hi>I absolve thee from all thy Sins,</hi> and would have it delivered by way of deprecation; alledging that this was not only the Opinion of <hi>Guliel. Altisiodo, Guliel. Paris.</hi> and <hi>Hugo Cardinal;</hi> but also that thirty years were scarce passed since all did use this Form only, <hi>Absolutionem &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionem tribuat tibi Omnipotens Deus,</hi> Almighty God give unto thee Absolution and Forgiveness. This only will I add, that as well in the ancient Rituals, and in the new Pontificial of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as in the present practice of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, I find the Absolution expressed in the third Person, as attributed wholly to God, and not in the first, as if it came from the Priest himself.</q> And after the Lord Primat hath there shewn, <q>That the most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">
                           <hi>That all the antient forms of Absolution in the Greek Church were till of late only declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the 3d, not first person. See Dr.</hi> Smith<hi>'s learned Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Gr. Church, p.</hi> 180, 181.</note> Forms of Absolution both in the Latin and Greek Church, were in the third and not in the first person, he proceeds thus: <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales,</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> in the form of Absolution used in their time, to observe that Prayer was premised in the <hi>Optative,</hi> and Absolution adjoined afterward in the <hi>Indicative Mood.</hi> Whence they gather that the Priest's Prayer obtaineth Grace, his Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion presupposeth it, and that by the former he ascendeth unto God, and procureth pardon for the fault; by the latter he descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Sinner, and reconcileth him to the Church. For although a man be loosed before God, (saith the Master of the Sentences) yet is he not held loosed in the face of the Church but by the Judgment of the Priest. And this loosing of Men by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Priest, is by the Fathers generally accounted nothing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60492:73"/>
else but a restoring them to the peace of the Church, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them to the Lord's Table again: which therefore they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually express by the terms of <hi>bringing them to the Communion; recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling them to, or with the Communion; restoring the Communion to them; admitting them to Fellowship; granting them Peace, &amp;c.</hi> Neither do I find that they did ever use any such formal Absolution as this, <hi>I absolve thee from all thy Sins:</hi> wherein our Popish Priests notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, do place the very Form of their late-devised Sacrament of Penance, nay hold it to be so absolute a Form, that (according to <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> his new Divinity) it would not be sufficient to say, <hi>Almighty God have mercy upon thee,</hi> or <hi>God grant unto thee Absolution and Forgiveness:</hi> because, forsooth, the Priest by these words doth not signifie that the Absolution is done, but entreateth that it may be done. Which how it will accord with the <hi>Roman Pontifical,</hi> where the Form of Absolution is laid down Prayer-wise, the Jesuits who follow <hi>Thomas,</hi> may do well to consider.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now how near the Doctor approaches to this Opinion of the Papists when he urges these words, <hi>I absolve thee from all thy Sins,</hi> as an Argument of the Priests power to forgive Sins <hi>authoritative,</hi> and as if this Form had something more in it, or could work further towards the remission of the Sins of the Penitent than any of the rest, I shall leave it to the Reader. Whereas whosoever will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Office of the Priest, will find that it is not like that of a Judg, or a Vice-Roy (as the Doctor would have it) under a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince; who has power not only to declare the person ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from his Crimes, but also may reprieve, or pardon him when guilty, or condemn him tho innocent, neither of which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Prince himself, by whose Commission he acts, would do: whereas the Priest, whatever power he has delegated from God, (vvhich I do not deny) yet it is still only declarative, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, according to the sincerity of the Repentance in the person absolved. For as his Absolution signifies nothing, if the Repentance of the Penitent, or dying person, be not real and sincere; so neither can he hinder God from pardoning him, if it be so indeed, tho he should be so wicked, or uncharitable, as to deny him the benefit of this Absolution, if he desire it: so that the Office of the Priest in this matter, rather resembleth that of an Herald, who has a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from his Prince to proclaim and declare Pardon to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Rebels who have already submitted themselves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Obedience to their Prince; which Pardon as it signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if they still continue in their Rebellion; so tho the Herald alone has the power of declaring this Pardon, yet it is only in the Name, and by the Authority of his Prince, who had passed this Pardon in his own Breast before ever the Herald published it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60492:74"/>
to the Offenders: so that it is in this sence only that the Priest can say thus,<hi>—By his Authority (viz.</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ) <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, I absolve thee from all thy Sins,</hi> since he does this not as Christ's Vicar, or Judg under him, but as his Herald or Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, or, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> words it, <hi>In the Person of</hi> Christ forgives our Offences; Yet still conditionally, that we are <hi>really penitent,</hi> and consequently is not <hi>effective,</hi> but only <hi>declarative</hi> of that Forgiveness. I shall now in the last place shew you, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> understands it in no other sence but this alone: and that if it did, it would make it all one with that of the <hi>Papists.</hi> First, That the Form of Absolution which follows the general Confession, is only <hi>declarative</hi> the Doctor himself grants; so likewise that before the Communion is only <hi>optative,</hi> in the way of prayer and intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and consequently no other than <hi>declarative</hi> or conditional; and therefore that the Absolution to particular Penitents both in order to receive the Communion, as also in the Visitation of the Sick, are no other likewise than <hi>declarative,</hi> appears from the great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this matter, not enjoining, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advising the Penitent in either case to make any special Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his Sins to the Priest, in which case alone (this Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is supposed to be necessary) unless he cannot quiet his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science without it, or if he feel his Conscience troubled vvith any weighty matter, after which Confession the Priest shall absolve him. But our Church does not declare that either the Penitent is obliged to make any such special Confession to the Priest either before the Sacrament, or at the point of Death, or that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son cannot obtain remission of their Sins without Absolution, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> asserts; so that it seems our Church's Absolution in all these cases is no other than <hi>declarative,</hi> and for the quieting of the Conscience of the Penitent, if he find himself so troubled in mind, that he thinks he cannot obtain pardon from God without it: Tho the Priest (as the Herald above-mentioned, whose Office it is to proclaim the King's Pardon) still absolves <hi>authoriative,</hi> and could not do it unless he were authorized by Jesus Christ for that purpose. And if the Doctor, or any other, will maintain any higher Absolution than this, it must be that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where a small <hi>Attrition,</hi> or sorrow for Sin, by virtue of the Keys, (that is, the Absolution of the Priest) is made Contrition, and the Penitent is immediately absolved from all his Sins; tho perhaps he commit the same again as soon as ever he has done the penance enjoyned. And that the pious and judicious Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> (who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly understood the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as well as Dr. <hi>H.)</hi> agrees fully with the Lord Primat in this matter, appears from his sixth Book of <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> 
                     <q>where after his declaring

(with the <hi>Lord Primat)</hi> 
                        <q>that for any thing he could ever observe, those Formalities the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do so much esteem of, were not of such estimation, nor thought to be of absolute necessity with the ancient Fathers, and that the Form with them was with Invocation, or praying for the Penitent, that God would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto him; for which he produces St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> and <hi>Leo, &amp;c.</hi> p. 96. he thus declares his Judgment, <hi>viz. As for the Ministerial Sentence of privat Absolution, it can be no more than a declaration what God hath done; it hath but the force of the Prophet</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than's <hi>Absolution, [God hath taken away thy Sins;] than which constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, especially of words judicial, there is nothing more vulgar. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Publicans are said in the Gospel to have justified God; the Jews in</hi> Malachy <hi>to have blessed the proud man, which sin, and prosper; not that the one did make God righteous, or the other the wicked happy; but to bless, to justifie, and to absolve, are as commonly used for words of Judgment, or Declaration, as of true and real efficacy; yea even by the Opinion of the Master of the Sentences, &amp;c. Priests are authorized to loose and bind, that is to say, declare who are bound, and who are loosed.</hi>

                  <p>The last Point in which the Doctor taxes the Lord Primat as <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Respon. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus Sect.</hi> 10. § 7.</note> differing from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is in the Article of <hi>Christ's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent into Hell;</hi> 
                     <q>The Church of <hi>England</hi> (says he) maintains a Local Descent; that is to say, That the Soul of Christ, at such time as his Body lay in the Grave, did locally descend into the nethermost parts, in which the Devil and his Angels are reserved in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chains of Darkness, unto the Judgment of the great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Day. This is proved at large by Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> in his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laborious Work, entitled, <hi>The Survey of Christ's Sufferings.</hi> And that this was the meaning of the first Reformers, when this Article amongst others was first agreed upon in the first Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Year 1552, appears by that passage of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which is cited by them touching Christ's preaching to the Spirits which were in prison. And tho that passage be left out of the present Article, according as it passed in the Convocation of the Year 1562, yet cannot it be used as an Argument to prove that the Church hath altered her Judgment in that Point; as some Men would have it; that passage being left out for these Reasons following: For, first, that passage was conceived to make the Article too inclinable to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which makes the chief end of Christ's descent into Hell, to be the fetching thence the Souls of the Fathers, who died before and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law. And secondly, because it was conceived by some Learned Men, that the Text was capable of some other constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction than to be used for an Argument of this Descent. The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church continues still the same as before it was, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60492:75"/>
is as plain and positive for a Local Descent as ever; she had not else left this Article in the same place in which she found it, or given it the same distinct Title as before it had; viz. <hi>De Descensu Christi ad Inferos,</hi> in the Latin Copies of King <hi>Edward the 6th,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Of the going down of Christ into Hell,</hi> as in the English Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign. Nor indeed was there any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why this Article should have any distinct place or title at all, unless the maintenance of a Local Descent were intended by it. For having spoken in the former Article of Christ's Suffering, Crucifying, Death and Burial, it had been a very great Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency (not to call it worse) to make a distinct Article of his descending into Hell, if to <hi>descend into Hell</hi> did signifie the same with this <hi>being buried,</hi> as some Men then fancied; or that there were not in it some further meaning, which might deserve a place distinct from his Death and Burial. The Article speaking thus, [viz. <hi>as Christ died for us, and was buried; so is it to be believed that he went down into Hell]</hi> is either to be understood of a Local Descent, or else we are tied to believe nothing by it, but what was explicitly or implicitly comprehended in the former Article. And lastly; That Mr. <hi>Alex. Noel,</hi> before mentioned, who being Prolocutor of the Convocation in the Year 1562, when this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was disputed, approved and ratified, cannot in reason be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be ignorant of the true sence and meaning of this Church in that particular. And he in his Catechism (above mentioned) declares, <hi>that Christ descended in his Body into the bowels of the Earth, and in his Soul, separated from that Body, he descended also into Hell; by means whereof the power and efficacy of his Death was not made known only to the Dead, but the Devils themselves; insomuch that both the Souls of the Unbelievers did sensibly perceive that Condemnation which was most just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due to them for their Incredulity; and Satan himself the Prince of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, did as plainly see that his tyranny, and all the Powers of Darkness were opprest, ruined, and destroyed.</hi> But on the contrary the <hi>L. Primat</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not any such Local Descent, as is maintained by the Church, and defended by the most learned Members of it, who have left us any thing in writing about this Article. And yet he neither fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the Opinion of <hi>Calvin</hi> himself, nor of the generality of those of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Party, who herein differ from their Master; but goes a new way of a later discovery, in which although he had few Leaders, he hath found many Followers. By Christ's descending into Hell, he would have nothing else to be understood but his continuing in the state of separation between the Body and the Soul, his remaining under the power of Death during the time he lay buried in the Grave: which is no more in effect, tho it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer somewhat in the terms, than to say, <hi>that he died, and was buried, and rose not till the third day,</hi> as the Creed instructs us.</q>

In vindication of the <hi>Lord Primat</hi>'s Judgment in the sence of this Article, I shall lay down some previous Considerations to excuse him, if perhaps he differed from the sence of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this Article, if it should appear that it ought to be understood in a strict and literal sence. For, first, you must understand that this Article of <hi>Christ's Descent into Hell,</hi> is not inserted amongst the Articles of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were the Confession of Faith of that Church when the <hi>Lord Primat</hi> writ this Answer to the <hi>Jesuit;</hi> the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (amongst which this of Christ's Descent into Hell is one) not being received by the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> till the Year 1634, ten years after the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Book; so that he could not be accused for differing from those Articles, which he was not then obliged to receive, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to. 2dly. Had this Article been then inserted, and expressed in the very same words, as it is in those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> could he be accused of being Heterodox for not understanding it, as the Doctor does, of a Local Descent of Christ's Soul into Hell, or the places of Torment, since the Church of <hi>England</hi> is so modest as only to assert, that it is to be believed that he went down into Hell, without specifying in what sence she understand it For, as the <hi>Lord Primat</hi> very learnedly proves in this Treatise, <q>the word <hi>Hell</hi> in old Saxon, signifies no more than <hi>hidden,</hi> or <hi>covered;</hi> so that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 287, 288.</note> in the original propriety of the word, our <hi>Hell</hi> doth exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, the place which is <hi>unseen,</hi> or <hi>removed from the sight of man.</hi> So that the word <hi>Hell,</hi> signifies the same with <hi>Hades</hi> in the Greek, and <hi>Inferi</hi> in the Latin. Concerning which St. <hi>Augustin</hi> gives us this Note; <hi>The name of Hell (in Latin</hi> Inferi) <hi>is variously put in Scriptures, and in many meanings, according as the sence of the things which are intreated of do require.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Casaubon</hi> (who understood the property of Greek and Latin words as well as any) this other; <hi>They who think that</hi> Hades <hi>is properly the seat of the Damned, be no less deceived, than they, who when they reade</hi> Inferos <hi>in Latin Writers, do interpret it of the same place.</hi> [Whereupon the <hi>Lord Primat</hi> proceeds to shew] That by Hell, in divers places of Scripture, is not to be understood the place of the Wicked, or Damned, but of the Dead in general; as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 48. <hi>What Man is he that liveth and shall not see Death shall he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Soul from the hand of Hell</hi> And Esa. 38. 18, 19. <hi>Hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not praise thee; Death cannot celebrate thee; they that go down into the Pit cannot hope for thy Truth. The Living, the Living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day.</hi> Where the opposition betwixt Hell, and the state of Life in this World, is to be observed.</q> Therefore since the word Hell does not necessarily imply a place of Torment, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Scriptures, or ancient Authors; and that Christ's descent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60492:76"/>
Hell is not to be proved from any express place of Scripture, as the Doctor himself grants, since upon the review of the Articles of our Church, past in <hi>Edward the sixth's</hi> time, this passage of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> of <hi>Christ's preaching to the Spirits in Prison,</hi> was left out in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Articles of our Church, as not well bearing that interpretation. And that the learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> have in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the New Testament explained this place in a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent sence. So that all the light we can receive as to this Article of our Creed, must be sought for in the ancient Fathers of the Church, <q>whose Opinions in this point are various and uncertain, (as the Lord Primat sufficiently sets forth in this Treatise) some of them understanding by this word Hell, [or <hi>Hades] Abraham</hi>'s Bosom, or place of Happiness, whither the Angels carried <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> or that Paradise in which our Saviour promised the good Thief he should be with him. So that this sort of Hell can have no great difference from Heaven it self. Others of them will have our Saviour descend into Hell, or some out-skirts of it, which were no places of Torment, only that he might make the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and Prophets a Visit, whom they supposed to be there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, tho he did not fetch them from thence. Others, as St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and others, suppose Christ to have descended into Hell, or the place of Torment, to bring forth such Souls of his as he found there. Others, that he went thither to preach, and to bring from thence all the Souls of the Heathens, that heard then, and believed his Preaching. Others again, that he emptied Hell of all its Prisoners, and left the Devils there alone; Which Opinion, tho very untrue, was maintained by St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and others: into which Error they were led by the superficial consideration of those words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> above-mentioned.</q> From which difference, and variety of Opinions we may learn, that as the Fathers were not Infallible; so this Opinion of Christ's Local Descent into Hell, as a place of Torment, was not generally agreed on amongst them, no more than the Reasons for which he should go thither. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sure our more Modern Authors, as Bp. <hi>Bilson</hi> and Mr. <hi>Noel,</hi> could be no more certain than the Fathers themselves, in what sence our Saviour descended into Hell, or what business he had to do there; Especially since this Article of our Church only says, we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he went down into Hell, without specifying in what sence he went thither; which she might easily have done, if she had not thought it better to leave Men to their liberty to put what reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sence they should think fit, upon so obscure and doubtful an Article; and which has so little influence upon our Faith or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, supposed to be taken in one or the other sence. Therefore I cannot see how the Lord Primat deserves to be blamed if in a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60492:76"/>
matter of so great uncertainty and variety of Opinions, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some of the most sober of the Fathers, who did not understand Christ's descent into Hell, or <hi>Hades,</hi> to be understood of any local descent into a place of Torment. And that the <hi>Lord Primat</hi> was not the first Discoverer or Broacher (as the Doctor would have him) of this Interpretation of <hi>Hades,</hi> or Hell, for the state of Souls as separate from their Bodies, I shall shew you from several Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations the Lord Primat makes use of, out of the Fathers, and other ancient Authors to this purpose. First, as for the Heathen, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Writers, <q>he shews out of <hi>Plato,</hi> and other Philosophers and Poets, that the word <hi>Hades</hi> signifies a general invisible future state of the Soul after it is separated from the Body, consisting of two places, one of Bliss, and the other of Torment, according to the nature and actions of the Soul whilst it was united with the Body, and which places they fancied to be as far beneath the Earth as the Heaven is from it: for they imagined that the Earth was not round but flat, and that the Sea and Skies did meet. So that most of the ancient Fathers having no notion of the roundness of the Earth, and of its being encompassed with Air; and likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most of them Platonic Philosophers, it is no wonder if they had the same notion of this <hi>Hades,</hi> as those ancient Philosophers and Poets had before. Yet some of them were better instructed, as St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who says modestly, <hi>If thou dost ask me</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the situation and place of</hi> Gehenna <hi>I will answer and say, that it is seated somewhere out of this World; and that it is not to be enquired in what place it is situated, but by what means rather it may be avoided.</hi> But St. <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> in his Dialogue between himself and <hi>Macrina</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 341.</note> touching the Soul and the Resurrection, makes her to answer the Question proposed by <hi>Gregory</hi> in this manner: <hi>Where is that name of</hi> Hades <hi>so much spoken of and which is so much treated of in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Conversation, so much in the Writings both of the Heathen and our own into which all men think that the Souls are translated from hence as into a certain Receptacle for you will not say that the Elements are this</hi> Hades. Whereunto <hi>Macrina</hi> thus replies: <hi>It appeareth that thou didst not give much heed to my speech, for when I spake of the translation of the Soul from that which is seen unto that which is invisible, I thought I had left nothing behind to be enquired of</hi> Hades; <hi>neither doth that name, wherein Souls are said to be, seem to me to signifie any other thing either in prophane Writers, or in the holy Scripture, save only a removing unto that which is invisible and unseen.</hi> So likewise <hi>Theophylact,</hi> and <hi>Hugo Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 342.</note> after him, <hi>What is</hi> Hades, <hi>or Hell Some say that it is a dark place under the Earth; others say that it is the translation of the Soul from that which is visible, unto that which is unseen and invisible. For while the Soul is in the Body, it is seen by the proper operations thereof; but being</hi>

                        <hi>translated out of the Body, it is invisible; and this did they say was</hi> Hades. Hitherto also may be referred the place cited before out of <hi>Origen</hi> in his fourth Book, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>and the Soul, according to the difference of their works, obtain divers places in Hell.</hi> Where, by <hi>Hades, Inferi,</hi> or Hell, he meaneth indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly the other World; in which how the Souls of the Godly were disposed, he thus declares in another place: <hi>The Soul leaveth the darkness of this World, and the blindness of this bodily Nature, and is translated into another World, which is either the bosom of Abraham, as it is shewed in Lazarus, or Paradise, as in the Thief that believed upon the Cross; Or yet God knows if that there be any other places, or other Mansions, by which the Soul that believeth in God, passing and coming unto that River which maketh glad the City of God, may receive within it the lot of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance promised unto the Fathers.</hi> For touching the determinate state of the faithful Souls departed this life, the ancient Doctors (as we have shewed) were not so throughly resolved.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lord Primat</hi> having thus shewn in what sence many of the ancient Fathers did understand this word <hi>Hades,</hi> which we translate Hell, proceeds to shew that divers of them expound Christ's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent into Hell (or <hi>Hades)</hi> according to the common Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which extends it self indifferently unto all that die: <q>For as Christ's Soul was in all points made like unto ours (Sin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) <note place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 345, 346.</note> while it was joined with his Body here in the Land of the Living: so when he had humbled himself unto the Death, it became him in all things to be made like unto his Brethren, even in the state of dissolution. And so indeed the Soul of Jesus had experience of both: for it was in the place of human Souls, and being out of the Flesh, did live and subsist. It was a reasonable Soul therefore, and of the same substance with the flesh of Men, proceeding from <hi>Mary.</hi> Saith <hi>Eustathius</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in his Exposition of that Text of the Psalm, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the place of humane Souls, (which in the Hebrew is <hi>the world of Spirits)</hi> and by the disposing of Christ's Soul there, after the manner of other Souls, concludes it to be of the same nature with other Mens Souls. So St. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> in his Exposition of the 138th <hi>Psalm, This is the Law of humane Necessity,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the Bodies being buried, the Souls should go to Hell. Which descent the Lord did not refuse for the accomplishment of a true man.</hi> And a little after he repeats it, that <hi>desupernis ad inferos mortis lege descendit,</hi> He descended from the supernal to the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts by the Law of Death. And upon <hi>Psal.</hi> 53. more fully; <hi>To fulfil the Nature of Man, he subjected himself to Death;</hi> that is, to a departure as it were of the Soul and Body; <hi>and pierced into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal</hi>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60492:77"/>
                        <hi>seats,</hi> which was a thing that seemed to be due unto Man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall not trouble you with more Quotations of this kind out of several of the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers which he makes use of in this Treatise, most of them agreeing in this, That Christ died; and was buried, and that his Soul went to that place or receptacle, where the Souls of good Men do remain after Death; which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is no more in effect but differing in terms, than to say, <hi>he died and was buried, and rose not till the third day:</hi> which the Doctor makes to be the absurdity of this Opinion, I leave to the Judgment of the impartial Reader; as I likewise do whether the Lord Primat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves so severe a Censure after his shewing so great Learning as he has done, concerning the various Interpretations of this word <hi>Hades,</hi> or Hell, both out of sacred and prophane Writers, <hi>that it only serves to amaze the Ignorant, and confound the Learned.</hi> Or that he meant nothing less in all these Collections than to assert the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this particular; Or, whether Christ's Local Descent into Hell can be found in the Book of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which he had subscribed to, or in the Book of Common-Prayer which he was bound to conform to And if it be not so expressed in any of these, I leave it to you to judge how far Dr. H. is to be believed in his Accusation against the Lord Primat in other matters. But I doubt I have dwelt too long upon this less important Article, which it seems was not thought so funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental a one, but (as the Lord Primat very well observes) <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 310.</note> in his Exposition of the Creed takes notice, that in the Creed or <hi>Symbol</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there is not added, <hi>He descended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell;</hi> and presently adds, <hi>yet the force or meaning of the word seems to be the same, in that he is said to have been buried.</hi> So that it seems old <hi>Ruffinus</hi> is one of those who is guilty of this Impertinency (as the Doctor calls it) of making Christ's descent into Hell to signifie the same with his lying in the Grave, or being buried, tho the same Author takes notice that the Church of <hi>Aquileia</hi> had this Article in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in her Creed, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had not, (which sure with Men of the Doctor's way, should be a Rule to other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.) And further, Card. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> noteth, (as the Lord Primat confesses) <q>that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Fide &amp; Symbolo,</hi> and in his four Books <hi>de Symbolo ad Catechumenos,</hi> maketh no mention of this Article, when he doth expound the whole Creed five se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times. Which is very strange, if the Creed received by the African Church had this Article in it. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> further takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, <hi>that it is not found in the Symbol of the Churches of the East;</hi> by which he means the Nicene and Constantinopolitan Creeds, the latter of which is nothing else but an Explanation, or more ample Enlargement of Creed Apostolical.</q> Tho this indeed be not at

                  <p>But the Doctor having shown his Malice against the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat's Memory and Opinions in those Points, which I hope I have sufficiently answered, cannot give off so, but in the next Section accuses him for inserting the nine Articles of <hi>Lambeth</hi> into those of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being inconsistent with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But before I answer this Accusation, I shall first premise, that as I do not defend or approve that Bishops, or others, tho never so learned Divines, should take upon them to make new Articles, or define and determine doubtful Questions and Controversies in Religion, without being authorized by the King and Convocation so to do: Yet thus much I may charitably say of those good Bishops, and other Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who framed and agreed upon these Articles, that what they did in this matter, was sincerely, and as they then believed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as either expresly contained in, or else to be drawn by consequence from that Article of the Church concerning Predestination. And certainly this makes stronger against the Doctor: for if with him the Judgment of Bp. <hi>Bilson,</hi> Bp. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Noel,</hi> in their Writings, be a sufficient Authority to declare the sence of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in those Questions of Christ's true and real Presence in the Sacrament, and his Local Descent into Hell; why should not the Judgment and Determination of the two Arch-Bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> with divers other Bishops and learned Divines, after a serious debate and mature deliberation, as well declare what was the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in those Questions of Predestination, Justifying Faith, Saving Grace, and Perseverance But it seems with the Doctor, no Bishops Opinions shall be Orthodox, if they agree not with his own. But to come to the Charge it self: The main Reason why the <hi>Doctor</hi> will needs have the <hi>Lord Primat</hi> to be the cause of the inserting these Articles of <hi>Lambeth</hi> into those of <hi>Ireland,</hi> agreed on in Convocation 1615, is, because the <hi>Lord Primat</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then no Bishop, but only Professor of Divinity in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity there, and a Member of Convocation, was ordered by the Convocation to draw up those Articles, and put them into Latin, as if Dr. <hi>Usher</hi> could have then such a great influence upon it, as to be able to govern the Church at his pleasure; or that the Scribe of any Synod or Council should make it pass what Acts or Articles he pleases; or that one private Divine should be able to manage the whole Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (as the <hi>Doctor</hi> would needs have him do in this Affair.) Whereas the <hi>Doctor</hi> having been an ancient Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Convocation, could not but know that all Articles after
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60492:78"/>
they are debated, are proposed by way of Question by the President and Prolocutor of either House, and are afterwards ordered to be drawn into form, and put in Latin by some Persons whom they appoint for that purpose; and tho perhaps they might not be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in all points of the same Opinion with those Articles they are so ordered to draw up; and that Dr. <hi>Usher</hi> did not hold all those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the same sence as they are there laid down, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what the Doctor himself tells us in this Pamphlet; for p. 116, he saith, <q>
                        <hi>That it was his (viz.</hi> the Lord Primat's) <hi>doing, that a different explication of the Article of Christ's descent into Hell, from that allowed of by this Church; and almost all the other Heterodoxies of the Sect of</hi> Calvin <hi>were inserted, and incorporated into the Articles of</hi> Ireland.</q>And p. 129, he finds fault with the 30th Article of that Church,  <q>
                        <hi>because it is said of Christ, that for our sakes he endured most grievous Torments, immediatly in his Soul, and most painful Sufferings in his Body. The enduring of which grievous Torments in his Soul, as</hi> Calvin <hi>not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some touch of Blasphemy, did first devise: so did he lay it down for the true sence and meaning of the Article of Christ's descending into Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In which expression, as the Articles of</hi> Ireland <hi>have taken up the words of</hi> Calvin, <hi>so it may be rationally conceived that they take them with the same meaning and construction also.</hi>
                     </q> But the Doctor owns that this was not the Lord Primat's sence of this Article; for p. 113, aforegoing, he says thus, <hi>Yet he (viz.</hi> the Lord Primat) <hi>neither follows the Opinion of</hi> Calvin <hi>himself, nor of the generality of those of the Calvinian Party, who herein differ from their Master; but goes a new way of a later discovery, in which altho he had few Leaders, he hath found many Followers.</hi> But as I shall not take upon me to enter into a dispute with the Doctor, or his Followers, in defence of these Irish Articles, and to prove they are not contradictory to those of <hi>England,</hi> it not being my business; yet I cannot forbear to observe, that it is highly improbable that all the Bishops and Clergy of <hi>Ireland</hi> should incorporate the nine Articles of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> containing all the <hi>Calvinian Rigours</hi> (as the Doctor calls them) <hi>in the points of Predestination, Grace, Free-will, &amp;c.</hi> if they had thought they were inconsistent with those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and had not been satisfied that it was the Doctrine then held and maintained in those Points by the major part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Clergy of our Church, as also believed by the King himself, who confirmed them, and certainly would never else have sent one Bishop, and three of the most Learned Divines within his Dominions, to the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> to maintain against the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi> or <hi>Arminians,</hi> the very same Opinions contained in these <hi>Irish</hi> Articles: But if all those must be counted by the Doctor for Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Calvinists that maintain these Articles, and consequently Heterodox to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I desire to know how he can
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60492:79"/>
excuse the major part of our Bishops in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, and a considerable part of them during the Reigns of the two last Kings of blessed Memory (some of whom are still living) from this Heterodoxy. And if all Men must be guilty of Calvinism, who hold these Opinions concerning Predestination, Grace, and Free-will; then the most part of the Lutherans (who differ very little from <hi>Calvin</hi> in these points) must be Calvinists too. Nor are these Points held only by Protestants, but many also of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hold the same, as witness the <hi>Jansenists,</hi> and also the Order of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> who come very near to <hi>Calvin</hi> in the Doctrines of Predestination, &amp;c. and are as much opposed by the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> as the <hi>Arminians</hi> are by the <hi>Anti-remonstrants</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> But perhaps the Doctor may make St. <hi>Augustin</hi> a Calvinist too, since he is much of the same Opinion with the Lord Primat in most of these Points against the Pelagians.</p>
                  <p>Having now I hope vindicated the Lord Primat from these unjust Accusations of his differing from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in matters of Doctrine, I now come to answer his Aspersions upon the Lord Primat in lesser matters; and that you may see how unjustly he seeks out a Quarrel against him, he makes it a crime in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those who were aspersed with the names of <hi>Puritans</hi> made their Addresses to him by Letters, or Visits, and <hi>because he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress'd and feasted by them where-ever he came,</hi> (as the Doctor will have it) as if the Lord Primat had no other Perfections but his assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Calvinian Tenents.</p>
                  <p>Then he goes on to tax the Lord Primat with Inconformity to the Rules and Orders of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in several particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: but with how great want of Charity, and with how many malicious Inferences and Reflections, without any just grounds, I leave to the impartial Reader who will give himself the trouble to peruse that Pamphlet, many of those passages being cull'd here and there out of Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Treatise, entitled, <hi>The late Lord Primat's Judgment, &amp;c.</hi> without ever considering what went before, or what followed after; and without taking notice that several things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined in the Canons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> had no force or obligation in that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where those Canons were not yet subscribed to, or received: and consequently such Ceremonies as were by them enjoined, being in themselves indifferent, as the Church declares, it had been singularity in him to have observed them there, and much worse to have imposed them upon others: for it is truly said of him by Dr. <hi>Bernard, That he did not affect some Arbitrary Innovations, (not within the compass of the Rule and Order of the Book of Common-prayer) and that he did not take upon him to introduce any Rite or Ceremony upon his own Opinion of Decency, till the Church had judged</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60492:79"/>
                     <hi>it so.</hi> p. 147. What the Lord Primat's behaviour was in <hi>England</hi> in relation to some of these Ceremonies of lesser moment, either to the peace or well-being of the Church, the Lord Primat needs no Apology, he having reason enough for what he did, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himself no further than the Doctor would have him. But to give one Instance for all of the Doctor's want of Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord Primat; <hi>Dr. Bernard</hi> having asserted his Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Discipline, Liturgy, and Articles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,—and that many of those who were called Puritans, received such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from him, as to concur with him in the above-said particulars.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi> immediatly makes this Remark: <hi>For this</hi> (says he) <hi>might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be done, and yet the Men remain as unconformable to the Rules of the Church (their Kneeling at the Communion only excepted) as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> Now what other Rules of the Church the <hi>Doctor</hi> means I know not, since I always thought that whoever had brought over a Lay-Nonconformist to conform to the Service and Orders of the Church, had done a very good work; and I know not when that is done, what is required more to make him a true Son of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But I shall say no more on this ungrateful Subject, since I doubt not but the Lord Primat's great Esteem and Reputation is too deep rooted in the hearts of all Good Men, to be at all lessened by the Doctor's hard Reflections; tho I thought I could do no less than vindicate the Memory of so pious a Prelate, since many ordinary Readers, who were not acquainted with this good Bishop, or his Writings, may think Dr. <hi>H.</hi> had cause thus to find fault with him. So avoiding all invidious Reflections upon the Reverend Doctor, long since deceased, I shall now conclude, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wishing that whatever he hath written, or published, had never done any more prejudice to that Church which he undertook to serve, than any of those Writings or Opinions of the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat's, which he so much finds fault with.</p>

                  <p>HAving the opportunity of this Messenger so fitly offered unto me, I make bold to desire your furtherance in some matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my Studies. The principal part of my study at this time is imployed in perusing the Writings of the Fathers, and observing out of them the Doctrine of the Ancient Church; wherein I find it very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that the Reader should be thoroughly informed touching his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, what Time they lived, and what Works are truly, what falsely attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to them; either of which being mistaken, must of force bring great confusion in this kind of study. To help Students wherein, <hi>Johannes Mola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> sometime Divinity Professor in the University of <hi>Lovain,</hi> wrote a Book, which he intituled <hi>Bibliotheca Theologica;</hi> giving charge at his death to his Heirs, That they should see the Work published; (as witnesseth <hi>Possevinus</hi> in <hi>Apparatu Sacro)</hi> but they being negligent in discharging that Trust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, the Book is at last fallen into the hands of <hi>Aubertus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roeus,</hi> a Canon of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as himself acknowledgeth in his Edition of <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s Chronicle. If you could procure from him the Copy thereof, (which I suppose will be no hard matter for you to effect) and with some conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent speed impart it unto me, I should take it for a very great argument of your love, and hold my self exceedingly obliged unto you thereby. Besides my main studies, I have always used, as a kind of Recreation, to spend some time in gathering together the scattered Antiquities of our Nation; whereof I doubt not but many Relicks are come into your hands, which I would very willingly hear of. But especially I would intreat you to let me have a Copy of <hi>Philip Flatsebury</hi>'s Chronicle, for hitherto I could never get a sight of it; as neither of <hi>Cornelius Hibernicus</hi> his History, cited by <hi>Hector Boethius: Sentleger</hi>'s Collections, alledged by Mr. <hi>Campian: Richard Creagh</hi> of the Saints of <hi>Ireland: Christopher Pembridg</hi> his Abstract of the <hi>Irish</hi> Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is also among the Manuscript Books of the Jesuites Colledge at <hi>Lovain,</hi> the Life of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> a Manuscript, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Manuscript whereof I have much desired, both because the Author seemeth to be of some Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and likewise alledgeth certain Sentences out of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. If any of our Country men, studious of such matters, will be pleased to communicate either that, or any other Antiquities of like nature, I do promise that I will take as much pains for him, and make full recompence of courtesie in the same kind. Your own Treatise of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Life I have; as also your <hi>Hebdomada Mariana.</hi> Your <hi>Margarita Mariana,</hi> and other writings

(if there be any) I have much sought for, but could not as yet get: Thus presuming upon that natural bond of love which is knit betwixt us, that I shall receive such satisfaction from you as I expect; with my Mother, your Sister's most kind remembrance, I remain</p>

                     <p n="1">1. De characterum Hebraicorum qui hodie in usu sunt, origine &amp; anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitate. Haec disquisitio necessaria videtur, ad defensionem integritatis Scripturae, propter novam opinionem illustrissimi viri Josephi Scaligeri: qui in animadvers. in Euseb. Chron. ad locum Eusebiani num. 1617. <hi>Literae,</hi> (inquit) <hi>quibus hodie Judaei sacros libros &amp; omnia acta sua conscribunt, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perae ac novitiae sunt, ex Syriacis depravatae, illae autem ex Samaritanis, &amp;c. Vide locum.</hi> Hâc de re variae sunt aliorum opiniones, ut Postelli libello de Phoenicum literis, Waseri lib. de antiquis numis Hebr. &amp;c. &amp; aliorum: quas hic ventilandas suscepi, etsi fateor in quibusdam quae caput rei non at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingunt aquam mihi haerere. Verum Scaligeri opinionem aperte falsam esse probari potest ex metis.</p>
                     <p>Nam 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> probatur, modernas literas non esse nuperas, &amp;c. &amp; Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanas in Biblico usu semper non fuisse antiquitùs, quia non Samaritanae sed Judaicae in usu fuerunt Christi humiliati tempore: ut constare mihi videtur ex Matth. 5. 18. Luc. 16. 17. &amp; locis id genus aliis, ubi Christus docet, Ne minimam quidem particulam legis perituram; nempe ut (omnes fatentur) sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem quoad sensum &amp; doctrinam, allusione facta ad minimam literulam He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braici contextus, nempe joth, quae facilè omnium literarum minima est in Hebr.

Nam Syriacae sive Maroniticae introductae fuerint à Christianis nascentis Ecclesiae, ne quid cum Nazaraeis &amp; Hebionitis (quorum haeresin execrabantur) haberent commune; ut docet doctiss. vir Guido Fabricius Boderianus in Epistola ad Dictionar.

                  <p>PArdon me, I pray you, that I have not written unto you of late, nor got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Book, you gave me, printed, (for now I cannot think it yours.) I received your Letter the other day, and did the same day twice seek Mr. <hi>Rimay,</hi> and your Books mentioned in the end of your Letter; of all which <hi>Abraham</hi> could get none save one Catalogue of the last Mart, which I have sent you within a Book of the Shires of <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60492:95"/>
at length I send to Mr. <hi>D. Chaloner,</hi> to whom I pray you commend me very kindly, with many thanks and excuses for my long deferring my promise. <hi>Abraham</hi> hath taken all the names of your Books, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to get them for you at the next Mart. I was likewise with Mr. <hi>Crawshaw</hi> (he hath not gotten, nor cannot find <hi>Confes. Ambrosianam)</hi> of whom I have now received your Book again, because he saith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to get it printed here without the Author's name, or without their <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> if any thing in it do sound suspiciously. He hath not read it over himself, and he is had in some Jealousie with some of our Bishops, by reason of some points that have fallen from his Pen, and his Tongue in the Pulpit. I will keep your Book till you please to send me word what I shall do with it. I think Sir <hi>J. Fullerton,</hi> or Sir <hi>J. Hamilton</hi> may with one word speaking have it pass without name; but I am now determined not to mention it to them until you give me some better Warrant. Concerning Eclypses, you see by your own experience that good purposes may in two years be honestly crossed, and therefore till you send me your Tractate you promised the last year, do not look for much from me, for if another business may excuse, it will serve me too: Yet am I not idle in that kind, for <hi>Kepler</hi> hath troubled all, and erected a new frame for the Motions of all the Seven upon a new foundation, making scarce any use of any former Hypotheses; yet dare I not much blame him, save that he is tedious and obscure; and at length coming to the point, he hath left out the principal Verb, I mean his Tables both of Middle-motion, and Prosthaphaereseων; reserving all, as it seemeth, to his <hi>Tab. Rudolpheas,</hi> setting down only a lame pattern in <hi>Mars:</hi> But I think I shall scarce with patience expect his next Books, unless he speed himself quickly. I pray you salute from me your Brother Mr. <hi>Lydyat,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kinge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bourchier,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lee. Macte Virtute:</hi> Do not cease to help the building of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the ruinating of <hi>Babel;</hi> yet look to your health, <hi>ut diu &amp; valide concutias hostium turres.</hi> The Lord ever bless you, and your labours, and all that most worthy Society.

                     <p>Concerning Sir <hi>R. Cotton</hi>'s Letter, I must crave pardon at this time, for I am but very lately come home, and full of business, going out of the Town again (I think) to morrow; and now if perhaps I find him I shall hardly get it copied. But I pray you to what question of sound Divinity doth this appertain Yet do not think me so censorious, but I can like you should sometimes descend to Toys for your Recreation. My opinion is, He that doth most good is the honestest man, whosoever have precedence; but if harm, the less the better. Pray for us: The Lord ever bless his Church, and us all in particular.

                  <p>I Received your Letter this <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> for which I thank you: It had been broken open by <hi>Chester</hi> Searchers before it came to him; but I thank God I have not lost any thing of moment for ought I find as yet. The East-Indian Fleet is gone about six weeks since; but I remain at <hi>London</hi> still, a suiter unto you that the School of <hi>Armagh</hi> be not disposed of otherwise than I have hitherto requested you, until I speak with you in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or rather here in <hi>London,</hi> where I shall be glad to see you. The night before I received your Letter, Mr. <hi>Crashaw</hi> acquainted me with a Letter from Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> wherein he seemed to doubt of divers things in Mr. <hi>James</hi> his <hi>English</hi> Book, whereof you write; signifying withal that he purposeth to be at <hi>London</hi> this Spring, where I hope to see you all three meet, to the better performing of that business. Mr. <hi>Provost</hi> told me that he had sent you a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister for <hi>Warberies</hi> (Mr. I have forgot his name, Mr. <hi>Provost</hi> being now out of Town) with my Lord Arch-Bishop his Letters commendatory to my Lord Chancellor; I think he is come to you ere this time. Printing of Books, especially Latin, goeth hard here: mine is not yet printed, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, I thank God, mine honourable friends, whom I have acquainted with the matter, shew me still a friendly countenance, with which I rest, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my self with that, <hi>pro captu lector is habent sua fata libelli.</hi> I have sent you the King's Book in Latin against <hi>Vorstius,</hi> yet scant dry from the Press; which Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> who hath the matter wholly in his own hands, swore to me, he would not print, unless he might have money to print it: a sufficient argument to make me content with my Manuscript lying still unprinted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he Equivocated: but see how the World is changed; time was when the best Book-printers, and sellers would have been glad to be beholding to the meanest Book-makers. Now Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> not long since the meanest of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Book-Printers and sellers, so talks and deals, as if he would make the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble King <hi>James,</hi> I may well say the best Book-maker of this his own, or any Kingdom under the Sun, be glad to be beholding to him: any marvel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if he think to make such a one as I am his Vassal: but I had rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my self to another occupation; therefore again I request you that my possibility be not frustrate for the School of <hi>Armagh.</hi> Thus hoping to see you in <hi>London</hi> ere long, with my very hearty thanks unto you, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to Mr. <hi>D.

                  <p>HOwsoever I intended not to have written unto you, before I had first heard from you, (which I long since expected) yet having the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of this Bearer offered, I could not pretermit that occasion of saluting you, and making known that you are not out of remembrance with your friends here, for in truth that was the special cause of my writing at this time: You will not believe how I long to be informed from you of the state of things there, both of our own private, and of our <hi>Respublica literaria</hi> in general. Now I pray you be not slack in satisfying my desire; and let me hear, among other things, how matters go with Mr. <hi>Casaubon,</hi> and how he is imployed. If hereafter you shall have occasion to enter into conference with him, learn whether he can bring any light to the clearing of the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses,</hi> and <hi>Waldenses,</hi> from those imputations wherewith they are charged by their Adversaries. <hi>Ludovicus Camerarius</hi> reporteth, That many of their Writings in the Ancient Occitanical Language <hi>(Langue d' Oc)</hi> were to be seen in <hi>Joseph Scaliger</hi>'s Library. <hi>Poplinier</hi> in the 28th. Book of his History, to prove that their Religion little differed from ours, alledgeth the Acts of a Disputation between the Bishop of <hi>Pammiers,</hi> and <hi>Arnoltot,</hi> Minister of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> written in a Language savouring much of the <hi>Catalan</hi> Tongue: Yea, sundry persons (saith he) have assured me that they have seen the <hi>Articles</hi> of their Faith engraved in certain old Tables, which are yet to be seen in <hi>Alby,</hi> in all things conformable to those of the Protestants. At my last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>London</hi> Mr. <hi>Fountayn,</hi> the Minister of the <hi>French</hi> Church, (dwelling in the <hi>Black-Fryars)</hi> told me, That in his time there was found a Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> which being exhibited to a Synod of the Reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> was by them approved as Orthodox. He promised me to write to the Ministers of <hi>Paris</hi> for the Copy of the Articles of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. I pray you put him in mind of it: And get from Mr. <hi>Casaubon,</hi> and him, what information you can in those particulars; for you know how greatly they make for my purpose. You remember that Dr. <hi>Chaloner</hi> wished you to deal for some Minister to come hither for St. <hi>Warburghs:</hi> I would willingly understand what you have done therein; if Mr. <hi>Ayre</hi> be about <hi>London,</hi> you may do well to acquaint him with it, and try whether he can find in his heart once again to visit poor <hi>Ireland.</hi> Dr. <hi>Chaloner</hi> hath written to Mr. <hi>Provost</hi> to this purpose: You may do us a very great pleasure, if you can help us to a faithful Minister to undertake that Charge; and Letters commendatory from the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> I would willingly hear what is done with Mr. Justice <hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s Book, the Preface whereof I sent over by you. If Mr. <hi>Briggs</hi> cannot get it printed, I pray you let it be safely sent unto me again, and that with as convenient speed as may be. If it will pass there, intreat Mr. <hi>Crashaw</hi> for my sake to take some pains in perusing the same, and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein what he thinketh fit, for that hath the Author wholly referred to his discretion. If you can come any where to the sight of <hi>Sanders, De Schismate Anglicano,</hi> write me out what he noteth concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the year 1542. Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> promised me the Copy of certain Letters, which concerned the Consecrating of the Bishops of <hi>Dublin,</hi> by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (they are at the end of his great Manuscript Book of the Pope's
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60492:96"/>
Epistles.) I pray you call to him for it, and likewise intreat Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> to send me the Copy of those Letters which he alledgeth to that purpose in his <hi>Hiberniâ,</hi> pag. 765. of the last Edition. I will trouble you no more at this time, but expect to hear from you after so long silence; in the mean time, committing you and your labours to God's good Blessing, and</p>

                  <p>I Received your Letter of the 22 of <hi>August,</hi> together with the Books speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therein, for which I give you great thanks. And as you have not been unmindful of my businesses; so have not I been altogether of yours. I have dealt since with my Uncle, the Primate, both for the annual stipend in the Proportion of Land lying about the School; and do find him constant in his Promise: Whereby I resolve you may well make account of your Fifty Pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> at the least. His Register hath been very forward in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the matter, and will take care that the utmost benefit be made of the Land to your behoof. I have caused him to write unto you of the state thereof, for your better information. Make I pray you, as convenient hast unto us as you can; and in the mean time, let us hear (once more at least) of your Affairs, and send unto me in your next Letter, in what forwardness Justice <hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s Book is—(as you have signified, delivered unto a Stationer in the Church-yard) and whether Mr. <hi>Crashaw</hi> hath taken any pains in running it over. And at your coming, forget not to bring for me a Bible in <hi>Octavo</hi> of the new Translation well bound, (for my ordinary use) together with Mr. <hi>James,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>'s Books you wrote me of. I would hear also willingly, whether you have proceeded further with Mr. <hi>Web,</hi> and what hope we may conceive of his coming. Because you met not with himself, and we had no certainty from you to pitch upon, Dr. <hi>Chalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> thought good at Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s departure, to try whether Mr. <hi>Storer</hi> (a worthy Preacher) might be drawn over to the place. We look for answer very speedily, of which we will not fail to certifie you with the first: for if we speed not this way; the care must lie upon Mr. <hi>Provost,</hi> or your self, to see us otherwise provided for; wherein you shall not only do us a great pleasure, but also procure a great blessing to this whole City. I pray you remember me in all kindness to Mr. <hi>Provost,</hi> and the rest of our friends there: but especially remember me to God in your Prayers; to whose good blessing I commend you and your Labours.</p>

                  <head>LETTER VIII. <hi>Another Letter from Mr.</hi> James Usher, <hi>late Arch-Bishop of</hi> Armagh, <hi>to Doctor</hi> Chaloner.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Know you greatly wonder at my long silence, and much blame my neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in that behalf. But the truth is, your Letters sent so long since by Mr. <hi>Cubbiche,</hi> came not unto mine hands before the 26th of <hi>March;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could I have full time to sollicite my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in those busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, before the 5th of <hi>April.</hi> What then (after two or three hours serious conference had with me) he resolved upon, you may understand by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written to my Lord Chancellor, and to the Visitors. Divers defects he observed in our Statutes, as in that of the Election of Fellows, though an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be taken therein for others to have a voice in that business, yet it is said <hi>Electio sit penes magistrum,</hi> which he said was absurd. He observed that there was no order taken that the Scholars should come into the Chappel, <hi>Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caliter vestiti;</hi> and took great exception against the Statute for the ordering of Common-placing, which he affirmed to be flat Puritanical. The Statutes had been sufficiently confirmed, if the Visitors there had subscribed unto them, without whose consent they could not afterwards have been altered by the Provost and Fellows; who (as the Arch-bishop, our Chancellor, saith) have by the Charter of Foundation power to make Statutes, but not to alter them after they be made. Your Project for the general was well liked by the Arch-bishop, but he excepted against it in divers particulars. We should not look so much (he said) for a great number, as to give some competency of maintenance unto those whom we did entertain. That Batchelors of Art should have no more allowance, than those that came newly into the House, he misliked: And for Masters of Art, if every year there be a new Commencement of twenty of them, (according to your project) then, said he, the twenty whom you would have to stay in the House (to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to answer the Church Livings, and Schools abroad) must of force be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed at every years end, to give place unto the new supply: Therefore would he have a competent number of Fellows, who might have a more set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led abode in the Colledge, and read Lectures by turns; counting it a great inconvenience that there should be but about six Fellows constantly resident in the House, and they so taken up with Lectures, that they can have no time for themselves to grow up in further learning: And you must look, saith he, to have some eminent men among you which may be deeply groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in all manner of knowledge; and not content your self with sending out a number of such as are but superficial. Likewise for the proportion of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, set down by you, he said it was in vain to look that there should be in times to come the same prices of them, which are at this present, or have been heretofore: And therefore if we would build upon any certainty, we should take care that all our payments should not be brought in money, but a certain reservation should be made for Provisions. When my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor hath imparted unto you, how far my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; what you see remaineth fit to be further sollicited, signifie unto me by the first that cometh from thence, that I may move my Lord of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> therein: And I pray you withal send me a note of the most general, and gross Defects, or Abuses in our Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the means whereby they may be redressed, if easily they may be redressed; for in such matters I have good hope that my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> may be wrought withal to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60492:97"/>
do us good. But I pray you be not too forward to have Statutes sent you from hence. <hi>Dictum sapienti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to your direction, I dealt with Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> to come over unto St. <hi>Warburghs,</hi> and now that Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> is placed there, I know not what to do or say. You write unto me of an allowance of 30 <hi>l.</hi> which he might have from the Colledge; let me know upon what consideration it shall be, for he would understand what his imployment shall be, before he resolve to leave his own Country. The Provost hath sent me a Bill for 20 <hi>l.</hi> to discharge my Credit with the Stationers, for the Books which Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> brought over: You may do well to have a care that the <hi>English</hi> Popish Books be kept in a place by themselves, and not placed among the rest in the Library, for they may prove dangerous. <hi>Purchase</hi> hath done nothing yet for the Religions of divers Churches; having hitherto written not a word more in that intended work of his, than you see printed. <hi>Speed</hi>'s Chronicle is at 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>s.</hi> price. Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi>'s <hi>Chrysostom</hi> (in eight Volumes) at 9 <hi>l.</hi> which prices are too great for me to deal withal, unless I might put them upon Sir <hi>James Carol</hi> his score, (as you would have me put <hi>Pradus</hi> upon <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which is now discharged by Mr. <hi>Temple.)</hi> About the end of <hi>May</hi> I purpose (God willing) to see you. I am now earnestly attending the Press, and as much of my Book as is at this present printed, I send unto you; together with two small Treatises lately published here, of some importance, (which also I would have you deliver unto my Lord Chancellor, if he hath not already seen them.) That against <hi>Paulus</hi> V. is supposed to be written by <hi>Marta:</hi> and one thing therein I think special worthy of observation, what the intendment may be of those great sums of money, which the Pope is said there daily to lay up. The Parsonage of <hi>Trim</hi> (for as much as I can learn here by the Common-Lawyers) is like to fall to the King's Presentation: And otherwise (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) Sir <hi>James Carol</hi> hath lost his turn, if he have not presented within the compass of his six months. Mr. <hi>Briggs</hi> would willingly hear from you, what Scholars you would entertain of his sending over. Mr. <hi>Sherwood</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Provost for one <hi>Increase Nowel,</hi> of the Age of 19 years, of good sufficiency in Learning, and Religious; he looketh to have your furtherance also in his admitting. Mr. <hi>Hildersham</hi> remembreth himself unto you. To morrow the Prince Palatine, and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> remove to <hi>Greenwich;</hi> on <hi>Tuesday</hi> from thence to <hi>Rochester;</hi> and the next day take shipping home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But I have no leisure to write unto you any news; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the relation of them unto others, and remembring my heartiest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to Mrs. <hi>Chaloner,</hi> and all the rest of my good friends; I leave you all unto the blessed Protection of our good God, and rest always,</p>

                  <p>YOU will not believe (good Sir) what great Pleasure I took in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using those writings which I received from you, especially where I found your learned <hi>Parisian</hi> so fully to agree with me, in collecting the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ancient <hi>Codex Canonum,</hi> out of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> For not long before, I had entred my self into the same Consideration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved after the same manner, but upon somewhat a more sure Ground. I had found in <hi>Baronius (ad an.</hi> 341. §. 34.) that both in the <hi>4th.</hi> and in the <hi>11th.</hi> Action of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> certain Canons of the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> were cited, but without any Name, out of some ancient Collections, in which the <hi>95th.</hi> and <hi>96th.</hi> Canon did contain the same that the <hi>16th.</hi> and <hi>17th.</hi> of the <hi>Antiochen</hi> Council. I mused a while what this might mean; and conceiving <hi>Baronius</hi> his Opinion to be somewhat improbable, that these Canons should be produced from some other Place than the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> it self. I bethought my self at last, of that which <hi>Dionysius Exiguus</hi> hath in his Preface before his Translation of the Greek Canons, <hi>ad Stephanum Salonitanum Episcopum. Regulas Nicenae Synodi, &amp; deinceps omnium Concilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, sive quae anteà, seu quae postmodùm facta sunt usque ad Synodum</hi> 150. <hi>Pontificum, qui apud Constantinopolim convenerunt, sub ordine numerorum, id est à primo Capitulo usque ad</hi> 165<hi rend="sup">um.</hi> 
                     <hi>sicut habentur in Graecâ auctoritate, digessimus. Tum sancti Chalcedonensis Concilii Decreta subdentes in his Graecorum Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num finem esse declaramus.</hi> Then set I a numbring of the Canons, and finding some variety in the divers Editions, I resolved to try <hi>Constantinus Harmenopulus</hi> his reckoning in his Preface before the Abridgment of the Greek Canons: where he numbreth 20 Canons of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> 25. <hi>Ancyranae,</hi> 15. <hi>Neocaesariensis,</hi> 19. <hi>Gangrensis,</hi> 25. <hi>Antiochenae,</hi> 60. <hi>Laodicen.

For thus much both <hi>Dionysius</hi> his Distinction of them from the rest seemeth to insinuate, and the Order of placing those General Councils after the Provincials (which otherwise no doubt if then they had been extant, when this first Collection was compiled, would immediately have been conjoyned with the Council of <hi>Nice)</hi> doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60492:98"/>
confirm: and the Citation of this Collection in the Council of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (afterwards incorporated into the same Book of Greek Canons, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by <hi>Dionysius)</hi> manifestly convinceth. Whether the <hi>Ephesine</hi> were as yet entred into the same body, I make some Question: because I find no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non thereof cited, neither by <hi>Fulgentius Ferrandus,</hi> or <hi>Cresconius;</hi> neither is it well known which were to be accounted the Canons of that Council: the Canons which are in the counterfeit <hi>Isidorus</hi> his Collection, being quite divers from those which are in <hi>Tilius</hi> his Greek Edition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</p>
                  <p>Of this ancient Collection of the Greek Canons, there was an ancient Latin Translation extant before the time of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> as he in his Preface wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth. But it being somewhat confused, <hi>Dionysius</hi> made a new Translation, which also he enlarged with Addition of new Canons: prefixing in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gininng of his Book the 50. Canons of the Apostles, translated by him out of Greek. <hi>In principio,</hi> (saith he) <hi>Canones, qui dicuntur Apostolorum, de Graeco transtulimus: quibus quia</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Of these <hi>Fulgentius Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus</hi> seemeth to be one in <hi>Dionysius</hi> his Days, for he never citeth those Canons.</note> 
                     <hi>plurimi consensum non proebuere facilem, hoc ipsum ignorare vestram noluimus sanctitatem.</hi> Then having ended the Greek Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> he adjoyned thereunto the Latin Canons of the <hi>Sardican</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Councils, which before were never brought into <hi>Codex Canonum,</hi> as you have well observed. For so much also doth himself testifie in his Preface; <hi>Ne quid praeterea notitiae vestrae videamur velle sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strahere, Statuta quoque Sardicensis Concilii atque Africani, quae Latine sunt edita, suis à nobis numeris cernuntur esse distincta.</hi> And here I take it about the year 530. do we <note n="*" place="margin">Unless in the <hi>5th.</hi> Canon of the fifth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Carthage,</hi> of which we may further inquire.</note> first find mentioned these Canons of <hi>Sardica</hi> of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and <hi>Ferrandus:</hi> being as yet also unknown unto the <hi>Greek</hi> Church howsoever afterward we find them added unto their <hi>Codex Canonum.</hi> For about this same time in the days of <hi>Justinian, Constantinus,</hi>

Apost. cap.</hi> 21. &amp; 28.) maketh his Collection of Ecclesiastical Constitutions, only out of the Canons of the Apostles, and the ten great Synods (as he calleth them) viz. <hi>Ancyrana, Neocaesariensi, Nicenâ, Gangrensi, Antiochenâ, Laodicensi, Constantinopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanâ, Ephesinâ, Chalcedonensi, Carthaginensi;</hi> without mention of that of <hi>Sardica,</hi> whose Canons seem to have been coyned for the Advancement of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Authority, after that the Forgery of the Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> had no Success, as no small presumptions may induce us to imagine. If we may believe <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Romano Pontif. cap.</hi> 25. (who herein I think followeth <hi>Lindanus.) Dionysius</hi> his Translation is <hi>extant in Monasterio S. Vedasti Atrebati; where the Canons of the Council of Nice and of Sardica are joyned together, as if they were but one Council.</hi> But they may believe him who list. The Words of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> which I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alledged, put the Matter out of all question, that in his Edition the Canons of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Sardica</hi> were placed for enough asunder. But where this Edition of <hi>Dionysius</hi> is to be had, is not so easie to be told. This only I conjecture, That whereas <hi>Crab</hi> setteth down two old Editions of the Canons, that which is different from <hi>Codex Moguntinus</hi> is likely for the most part to be that of <hi>Dionysius.</hi> So <hi>Baronius</hi> testifieth <hi>(ad an.</hi> 314. §. 81. 87.) that the first Edition of the <hi>Ancyrane</hi> Council in <hi>Crab,</hi> is of <hi>Dionysius</hi> his Translation: but <hi>ad an.</hi> 325. §. 156. (he sheweth,) That the first Edition of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons is not of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> nor the second neither, if we may give credit to his Relation. But this I leave to your own Judgment, who have better means to search out this Matter, than I can possibly have in this Country.</p>
                  <p>After this cometh <hi>Codex Romanus</hi> to be considered, which had nothing of <hi>Dionysius</hi> his Translation, but only the Canons of the Apostles, the rest being either of the old Translation which was before <hi>Dionysius,</hi> or of some other done after his time.

Preface of the counterfeit <hi>Isidorus</hi> to his Collection: And <hi>Hincmarus Rhemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis Archiepisc. in libro de variis capitulis Ecclesiasticis, cap.</hi> 27. <hi>De Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione è Graeco Concilior. &amp; Canonum:</hi> where among other things he writeth thus of <hi>Isidorus</hi> his Collection; <hi>Et beatus Isidorus in Collectario suo de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonibus quatuor editiones Nicaeni Concilii compaginavit.</hi> Although in the printed Collection of <hi>Isidorus,</hi> we have but one Edition left unto us.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Codex Romanus</hi> contained no more Councils than that of <hi>Dionysius;</hi> but had in the end adjoyned the Epistles of some Bishops of <hi>Rome:</hi> first of six, <hi>viz. Siricius, Innocentius, Zosimus, Celestinus, Leo,</hi> and <hi>Gelasius;</hi> as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by the Collection of <hi>Cresconius,</hi> (by some thought to be <hi>Corippus Grammaticus)</hi> who using this <hi>Codex</hi> about 700 years after Christ, alledgeth the Decrees of no other Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> than these. Then in the <hi>Roman</hi> Book were added the Constitutions of Bishops from <hi>Gelasius</hi> to <hi>Hormisda:</hi> And afterwards, to the time of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> as I gather by <hi>Gregory</hi> lib. 7. epist. 53. From <hi>Gelasius</hi> to <hi>Gregorius</hi> junior, the Decrees of <note n="*" place="margin">There are more.</note> five Popes you have in <hi>Codice Moguntino,</hi> (the true copy of <hi>Codex Romanus) Quod volumen postea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitum est Romae cohoerere cum aliis antiquis fideliter,</hi> saith <hi>Possevinus:</hi> And just so many are mentioned by <hi>Leo</hi> IV. in <hi>Gratian, Distinct.</hi> 20 <hi>C. de libellis,</hi> (but that <hi>Silvester</hi> is by Error added, of whose Decrees none were extant in the Body of the Canons) according to the last <hi>Roman</hi> Edition; for in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Editions of <hi>Gratian</hi> I find the name of <note n="*" place="margin">Also of the Councils <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.

But in other Copies which <hi>P.

I doubt not but it is wholly inserted into <hi>Crab</hi> his Edition; but I know not how to distinguish it from the other Collections there: I would intreat you therefore to send me a transcript of the Title of the Book (and if any thing be worthy the noting in the Preface of him that set out the Book) as also of the several Councils, and Epistles, with a direction in what page we may read the same in <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Nicolinus</hi> his Edition; that so I might learn which of the two old Editions in <hi>Crab,</hi> is that which is found in <hi>Codice Moguntino:</hi> As also whether the subscriptions be the same. And here espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially desire I to be satisfied in the <hi>Sardican</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Councils. The like would I now do unto you for <hi>Isidorus</hi> his Collection, directing you how you might read it entirely in <hi>Crab,</hi> if I had thought the Book were not to be found with you there. And if you could spare for a time your Book hither (which I would not willingly desire, considering the great distance betwixt our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) I would send it back with all speed, and send together with it <hi>Tilius</hi> his Edition of the <hi>Greek</hi> Canons, if I might understand you wanted it at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi> But if by your good direction I may find it fully in <hi>Crab,</hi> it shall suffice.</p>
                  <p>Now a word of that Collection, which falsly is attributed unto <hi>Isidorus,</hi> being compiled sometime betwixt the years 683. and 783. as in my <hi>Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca Theologicâ,</hi> God willing, I shall fully declare. The Author of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, taking pattern by the Epistles fathered upon <hi>Clement,</hi> coyned a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more of the same stamp, giving them the superscription of <hi>The Names of the ancient Popes:</hi> And not content by this means to advance only the Pope's Spiritual Jurisdiction, for the enlarging of his Temporalties, he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiteth, in the name of <hi>Constantine,</hi> that ridiculous <hi>Donation,</hi> which before this time was never heard of.

                  <p>Beside these Ancient Collections, there were kept in later times, greater Volumes of the Councils; containing both Eastern and Western Councils, Old and New, not much unlike the first Edition of <hi>Crab,</hi> set out at <hi>Colon.

We have long expected them from the <hi>Roman</hi> Press: Where the good Fathers have been mending them a longer time, than Nature requireth for bringing forth an Elephant. <hi>Anno</hi> 1591.

165: That this Collection of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the 5 Provincial, was before the Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> (besides your conjecture from the placing of the Provincials after that General of <hi>Nice,</hi> which you make out of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and is also in the Titles which are in the <hi>Greek</hi> Canons, and in <hi>Codex Moguntinus,)</hi> methinks that may probably be gathered out of the <hi>16th.</hi> Action of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> When after that <hi>Constantine</hi> the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Consistory had read the <hi>6th.</hi> Can. of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council out of the <hi>Canonical Code,</hi> which was in the Custody of <hi>Aetius</hi> the Arch-Deacon (which no doubt was the same which is mentioned both in the 4. &amp; 11. Actions) coming afterwards to alledge the Canons of the Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he beginneth to read thus, <hi>Synodicum primi Concilii sub Nectario Episcopo;</hi> and which <hi>Synodicum,</hi> no doubt was the Title of a distinct <hi>Codex</hi> from the other, though it may be, both in one Volume. It is great pity we have not these Acts of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> and more pity we have not those of the 1. <hi>Constantinop.</hi> neither in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> It should seem by <hi>Verderius Appendix,</hi> that they are to be had in the Libraries in <hi>Greece.</hi> But by this citation, and <hi>Maxinianus</hi> his Subscription in that Action, a little after, we may see the <hi>Constantinopol.</hi> Councils Canons were then incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the <hi>Canonical Code;</hi> though according to my former probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, <hi>non sub eadem numerorum serie.</hi> As for the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Canons howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are neglected, or at least not mentioned by <hi>Ferrandus, Dionysius,</hi> and <hi>Cresconius,</hi> (and that in probability especially the first 6, for that they were not touching general Orders in Church Discipline, but in particular for the suppressing of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresies, whence <hi>Baronius</hi> seemeth to acknowledge but 6,) yet I doubt not but they were received in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Codes,</hi> both of the East and West Churches. And first I doubt not but they are comprehended in that general ratification of the Canons, which is in the <hi>1st.</hi> Canon of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as may appear by <hi>Balsamon</hi> his Schol. upon that Canon. <hi>2dly,</hi> No doubt but they are contained in <hi>Justinian</hi>'s <hi>Canonical Code,</hi> which is confirmed, <hi>Novell.</hi> 131, where he will have the Canons of the 4 General Councils, and such as are by them approved, to be received as <hi>Imperial Laws.</hi> Now the 6 first Canons of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil are all orderly compiled together <hi>Tom.</hi> IV. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. of <hi>Peltarus</hi>'s Edition, with a Synodal Epistle to the Emperor <hi>Theodos.</hi> prefixed for the confirmation of them. The other two Canons are before in the Acts of that Council, and also are to be found <hi>in Libello Constitutionum Synodicarum,</hi> fathered by <hi>Crab</hi> upon <hi>Cyril</hi> chiefly, which he (as it seemeth) faithfully set forth, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 542. &amp;c. which is dismembred in the <hi>Venetian</hi> and the late <hi>Cologne</hi> Edition; one Member placed one where and another elsewhere, not much unlike their dealing with the ancient <hi>Canonical Code.</hi> This Book <hi>Crab</hi> much commendeth as having not seen the Acts of the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> since by <hi>Peltarus,</hi> and <hi>Sylburgius</hi> set forth, where most of those things are to be found. Whereas you seem to say, That it is not well known which were the Canons of that Council, for that the Counterfeit <hi>Isidore</hi> hath diverse from those in <hi>Tilius</hi>'s <hi>Greek</hi> Edition: I doubt not but those and those only which are in <hi>Tilius</hi>'s <hi>Greek</hi> Copies are the right Canons of the Councils, the other 12 Anathematisms being rather to be reputed <hi>Dogmata</hi> than <hi>Canones,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Justinian</hi>'s distinction in the aforesaid 131 <hi>Novell.</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>Patres Aphricani</hi> (as you know) writing <hi>ad Coelestinum: Ut aliqui tanquam à tuae Sanctitatis latere mittantur, nulla invenimus patrum Synodo constitutum.</hi> I know their distinction of the two <hi>Sardicans,</hi> but much may be said against it. Sure it is, that it was never holden for General which made the Canons. <hi>Codex Hadrianaeus,</hi> which is inserted into the late <hi>Cologne</hi> Edition, out of <hi>Henricus Canisius</hi> his <hi>Lib. Antiq. Lection.</hi> maketh mention only of 60 Bishops which subscribed to that Council. And <hi>Codex Moguntinus</hi> in the end, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereth but LX. which subscribed, but after the Catalogue of the names, it addeth, <hi>Et subscripserunt omnes Episcopi diversarum Provinciarum vel Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum,</hi> Numero CXXI. Moreover in the Preface in <hi>Codice Hadrianaeo,</hi> before the <hi>Sardican</hi> Canons, there are said to have been XX <hi>Regulae</hi> XL <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum:</hi> But in <hi>Codice Moguntino,</hi> in the <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Hec praesatio extat in Edit. per</hi> Crab. <hi>p.</hi> 328.</note> Preface there, it is said there XL <hi>Regulae</hi> XX <hi>Episcoporum.</hi> And here I am to tell you, That <hi>Codex Hadria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeus,</hi> and <hi>Moguntinus,</hi> though in substance they agree, yet in many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances they disagree, as for example, in many particulars in the said Prefaces; also in the distinction of Canons, and sometimes in Titles: So it should seem also for number of <hi>Decretal Epistles,</hi> if that which <hi>Eckius</hi> saw were the same with that <hi>H. Canisius</hi> had, for it should seem that <hi>Eckius</hi>'s Book had the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of 15 Popes, whereas <hi>Codex Moguntinus</hi> hath but 13, and not 11 only, as you seem to say out of <hi>Pithoeus.</hi> And now since I mention <hi>Pithoeus,</hi> if his copy of <hi>Ferrandus</hi>'s Breviary of the Canons were true, there were other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons amongst the <hi>Sardican</hi> Canons than those we have, as may appear in <hi>Ferrandus</hi> his Breviary, num. 92, 93, and 214; for the 1. and 13. Tit. there alledged, are not to be found in the Canons of <hi>Sardica</hi> now extant. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

thing also touching <hi>Pithoeus:</hi> He saith in the Preface of <hi>Ferrandus</hi>'s Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary, that that Version which is in <hi>Codice Moguntino</hi> is not that of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Exiguus;</hi> but I assure you <hi>Baronius, Ant. Augustinus,</hi> and the Recognisers of <hi>Gratian</hi> in their Annotations, and <hi>Binius</hi> in the late <hi>Cologne</hi> Edition, take that which is in <hi>Codice Moguntino</hi> to be that of <hi>Dionysius Exiguus.</hi>

                     <p>As for the <hi>Decretal Epistles,</hi> I am of opinion with you, That first they were brewed in <hi>Spain,</hi> and broached by <note n="*" place="margin">Another <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector. Canon. Caroli M. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porib. in</hi> 3 <hi>Tom. rerum Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannicarum Goldasti.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Riculfus,</hi> and afterward by <hi>Otgarius,</hi> (or <hi>Autcarius,</hi> as <hi>Bened. Levit. proefat. in</hi> 5. <hi>lib. capitular.</hi> termeth him.) And so much doth <hi>Hincmarus lib. contra Hincman. Laudunens</hi> insinuate; alledged <hi>inter testimonia proefixa capitularibus:</hi> and in <hi>Fr. Pithoeus</hi> his Glossary, <hi>lit. R.</hi> and by <hi>Baron. ad an.</hi> 865. <hi>n.</hi> 5. But in one thing I cannot accord to <hi>Fr. Pithaeus</hi> in the forenamed place, That <hi>Isidorus Mercator</hi> was the Collector of the <hi>Decretal Epistles</hi> from <hi>Clement</hi> to <hi>Gregorius Magnus.</hi> It seemeth tho that the <hi>Decretal Epistles</hi> began chiefly to be in request about the time that <hi>Isidore</hi> lived, according to your account; for in the XIV. Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> Can. 11. there is somewhat which may argue so much. But I do not think that <hi>Cresconius</hi> followed <hi>Isidore</hi> his Collection, considering it may be doubted whether ever he saw it; and therefore though <hi>Isidore</hi> gathered the <hi>Decretals</hi> to <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, as he intimateth in his Preface; yet <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conius</hi> (as it should seem) followed some former.</p>
                     <p>My Error in <hi>Concil. Cellensi</hi> was, in that I presupposed, that all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils mentioned by <hi>Ferrandus,</hi> (excepting those which are in <hi>Codice Tiliano)</hi> were in <hi>Africk:</hi> whereas <hi>Tela</hi> is in <hi>Spain,</hi> as <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s <hi>Itinerarium</hi> witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. I have not that Edition of <hi>Isidore</hi> printed by <hi>Merlinus</hi> 1530. but by those your directions I shall acknowledge it when I meet with it.</p>
                     <p>I have included here a note, by which you may know how to find the whole <hi>Codex Moguntinus</hi> in <hi>Crab</hi>'s Edition. I had verily thought you had had it.</p>
                     <p>As for the Acts of the Councils in <hi>Greek,</hi> which are promised to be set out at <hi>Rome,</hi> and have been a long time, I do fear me there will be jugling in that work. It is much to be lamented that <hi>Ant. Augustinus,</hi> who had gotten Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript Copies out of the chief Libraries of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> of the IV Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, and had them almost in a readiness for the Press, was preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Work by untimely death.</p>
                     <p>I have been at <hi>Bennet</hi> Colledge, but could not get into the Library, the Master, who had one of the Keys, being from home. I will remember some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for to look the places out of <hi>Burchardus:</hi> As for that other place of your <hi>Irish</hi> Synod, alledged <hi>Dist.</hi> 82. <hi>Can.</hi> 5.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60492:102"/>
should hardly have removed hither, (where I am now with the Bishop of <hi>Bath &amp; Wells)</hi> or any where else. But the Bishop sending for me, and offering me a Competency, in that kind I requested of him, then when I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided, I could not neglect God's Providence, and was advised hereunto by my best Friends: This unsettled Abode of mine was the Cause why I fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished not this Letter so long since begun, and sent it not before this. I have since got <hi>Jacob Merlin</hi>'s Edition of <hi>Isidore</hi>'s <hi>Collection,</hi> and before that at my being in the North, I borrowed out of <hi>Durham</hi> Library, the Manuscript of it, which is all one with <hi>Corpus Canonum</hi> in <hi>Bennet Colledge</hi> Library; and in <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> Library newly erected, there is another Copy of the same. I got also in the North a fair Transcript of the <hi>Greek Canons,</hi> which, as I understand, <hi>Erasmus</hi> caused to be copied out of an ancient Copy which was brought to <hi>Basil,</hi> at what time the Council of <hi>Basil</hi> was held. This Copy <hi>Erasmus</hi> sent to <hi>Cuthbert Tunstall</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> where it hath been since. Bishop <hi>Barnes</hi> who was Bishop there since, gave it to his Son, and his Son to me. It is the same with that which is translated by <hi>Gentian Harvett,</hi> and which <hi>Balsamon</hi> commenteth upon. The other day my Lord shewed me a Letter which came from one of his Chaplains at <hi>Windsor,</hi> who signified unto him that Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi> had an intendment to set out the <hi>Greek Councils:</hi> I fear me, he will hardly get Copies. I will inquire further into it, and will further it what lyeth in me: <hi>Antonius Augustinus</hi> had gathered all the Acts of the 4 first <hi>General Councils,</hi> out of all the Libraries of <hi>Italy,</hi> and had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have set them forth, as <hi>Andreas Schottus</hi> reporteth in a funeral Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him: Nay, he saith further, he had writ a Book thus entituled, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia Graeca &amp; Latina cum Historia, Scholiis, &amp; Variae Lectiones.</hi> But surely they will be suppressed for ever.</p>
                     <p>As for the Title of <hi>Volusianus ad Nicholaum</hi> in Colleg. <hi>Corp. Christi,</hi> you are to know that <hi>Bennet</hi> Colledge by his Foundation is called <hi>Collegium Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris Christi,</hi> not Christ's Colledge; and the Book in that Library I have not looked into. But the Printed Book, which <hi>ad Verbum</hi> is printed out of the Manuscript hath <hi>Nicholaus</hi> I. but falsly I verily think, for that was <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> II. which is Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his Opinion, and I think other probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than he hath might be brought. I have not my Books here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can say no more of that now.</p>
                     <p>I cannot meet with <hi>Turrian de Eucharistia,</hi> and therefore cannot relate unto you now, what he thinketh of the Author of the Epistle <hi>ad Caesarium Monachum:</hi> I remember <hi>P. Martyr de Eucharistiâ,</hi> saith that <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was the Author and that it was written in the time of his second Exile, against <hi>Appollinarius</hi> and others of his Sect, and he addeth, That in the Library of <hi>Florence</hi> there was a Manuscript Copy of it; and that Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> had another.</p>
                     <p>And now, good Mr. <hi>Usher,</hi> to shut up these disorderly and scambling Lines, I do acknowledge Mr. <hi>Alvey</hi>'s great Kindness and kind Offer, and could have wished his Offer had come first, but God had otherwise disposed; for I had disposed of my self before I heard of him; who otherwise would have been glad to have been one of your Confociates. But howsoever I hope by Entercourse of Letters, we shall benefit one another in some sort by Gods Grace. Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> is purposed to come to see your Colledge, and to take some Tryal; you'll find him a sound Christian, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and faithful Friend, and (I think) in some sort Eminent in one kind, I mean in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue. He is of a good Constitution and able to take Pains, and as he is able so is willing. In a word, such an one as I think you shall have much Comfort, and so you shall have of Mr. <hi>Pearson</hi> too, if he also come among you. Thus in hast I am glad to omit many things: I must send the Concordance of <hi>Codex Moguntinus</hi> with <hi>Crab</hi>'s Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of the Councils, from <hi>London,</hi> for I forgot it at <hi>Greenwich.</hi> The Lord keep you, prosper your Studies, bless your endeavours, and give his Grace to conduct us in those Ways which lead to Happiness.</p>

Petrus Apostolus, qui in palatio Dei est janitor constitutus, ubi sunt duae portae, viz. porta justitiae &amp; misericordiae. Nam per portam justitiae ingrediuntur illi qui salvantur exoperibus justitiae; per portam verò misericordiae ingrediuntur illi qui salvantur ex sola Dei mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordia &amp; gratia sine operibus. Et istam differentiam tangit Apostolus ad Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>dicens: Ei autem qui operatur, merces non imputatur secundum gratiam, sed secundum debitum: ei verò qui non operatur, credenti autem in eum qui ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificat impium, reputatur fides ejus ad justitiam, &amp;c.

                  <p>I pray, if your leisure serve, and opportunity too, let me know, if you have read of like Divinity to that of the two Gates, and of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s two Keys, in any other Paper. And besides I would gladly know, whether you have not seen these words in the Title page of <hi>Arius Montanus</hi> his Interlineal Bible, printed by <hi>Plantin, An.</hi> 1584. <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>For if my memory deceive me not, I have seen them there: And yet a friend of mine hath that Bible bearing the same date, wherein they are not; and I have not opportunity to see more Copies. I verily think the Papists have reprinted the first page, whereby it comes to pass that in some they are, and in some they are not. I would be glad to see the other part of the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Church, which you promise in that you have set out already. And if I can hear when good occasion brings you to <hi>London,</hi> I will make hard shift but I will meet you there. The bearer hereof, Mr. <hi>Foxcroft,</hi> is an honest Gentleman, and one of my Brother's neighbours; by him you may send to us at your pleasure. My Brother commends himself very kindly to you: And so with remembrance of mine own love unto you, I commend you, and your Labours to God's gracious blessing.</p>

                  <p>I Understood by a paper inclosed in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Winch,</hi> that you were desirous of some information hence in sundry particulars therein mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

                  <p>For that which is written touching <hi>Rabanus</hi> in the Preface of <hi>Guilielmus Malmesb. in abbreviatione Amularii,</hi> it is <hi>verbatim</hi> the same with that which you have in your Book alledged out of the MS. in <hi>Collegio Omnium Animarum Oxon.</hi>

I pray you inform me what the Specialties are which are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Mr. <hi>Mason</hi>'s Book. I would only know the heads. I would know of you, whether you have seen, or heard of the second Tome of Councils, <hi>Groe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co-lat.</hi> set out at <hi>Rome.</hi> I hear it is alledged by <hi>Fronto Ducoeus.</hi> Or whether you can remember out of the Reading of Catalogues of Manuscripts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Acts of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> be extant in any Library in <hi>Europe,</hi> Graecè. I have read of the Acts of the 1 <hi>Concilium Arelatense,</hi> set forth by <hi>P. Pithoeus,</hi> but could never come by them: I would know whether they be extant in the late <hi>Paris</hi> Edition of <hi>Hilary,</hi> or no, 1605. I had no leisure when I was with you, to inquire how Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> doth warrant the Vocation, and Ordination of the Ministers of the Reformed Churches in Foreign Parts. Thus with my best wishes, and kindest salutations, I commend your self, and all your labours to God's blessing, and the good of his Church, and so rest,</p>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Carew,</hi> shewed me your Letter written to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> (whose Death, I perceive, even we which did not know him, have much cause to lament) wherein you mention me, and a Letter which formerly you Writ to me, which never came to my hands. But to the point which here you repeat, I cannot tell how to meet with that part of <hi>Theon.</hi> his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon <hi>Ptolomoeus</hi> his <hi>magna constructio;</hi> I have it in <hi>Greek,</hi> but there I have no hope to find that thing either explained or recorded. There is in <hi>Christman</hi> upon <hi>Alfraganus</hi> which I suppose you have, in his Treatise <hi>de connexione anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, pag.</hi> 306. and in other places mention of <hi>oera Philippica</hi> which <hi>Kaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silla</hi> maketh the same with <hi>à morte Alexandri;</hi> but the <hi>Arabs</hi> ignorantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Nicanor,</hi> making <hi>oeram Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinam Seleucidarum</hi> 12 years and 325 days later than <hi>oera Philippica.</hi> But I am out of mine element, and I do not doubt but you have these things better known than I can: But I shall most gladly do any thing I can according to your direction. Concerning Eclipses which my Coufien <hi>Midgeley</hi> putteth me in mind of from you (for whom I heartily thank you, and for all your
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60492:107"/>
other kindnesses.) <hi>Mullerus</hi> in his <hi>Phris. Tabulis</hi> hath mightily discouraged me, for he hath weakned the <hi>Prutenicks,</hi> my Foundation, in three places of his Book at least, yet hath not either helped it, or shewed the fault in particular, that others might seek remedy. I have seriously set upon it; but these difficulties, and other straitness of time, and weight of other easier and more proper business, have, sore against my will, forced me to lay it aside as yet, till I can find better leisure and then I hope still to do somewhat. <hi>Napper,</hi> Lord of <hi>Markinston,</hi> hath set my Head and Hands a Work, with his new and admirable Logarithms. I hope to see him this Summer if it please God, for I never saw Book which pleased me better, or made me more wonder. I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to discourse with him concerning Eclipses, for what is there which we may not hope for at his hands. <hi>Paulus Middleb.</hi> is at pawn as I hear, and the other Book likewise; but I have, somuch as I can in Mr. <hi>Crawshaw</hi>'s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, had care to have them kept. I pray you, if you see Mr. <hi>Widdows,</hi> commend me heartily to him. We have here long expected him. Thus desiring the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ever to bless and prosper you, referring all news, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Mr. <hi>Egerton</hi>'s report, I take my leave from <hi>Gresham</hi> House this <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1615.</p>

                  <p>PResuming on your kindness shewed me at your being in these parts, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your ingenuous disposition otherwise, I am bold to request a further courtesie from you. I have in mine hands a Manuscript, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, among others, certain Treatises, which I cannot yet learn to have been printed; to wit, <hi>Guilielmi de Sancto Amore; de periculis novissimorum temporum;</hi> as also divers things of <hi>Robert Grosthed,</hi> sometime of <hi>Lincoln, viz. An Oration delivered in writing to the Pope at</hi> Lions; (whereof I find a peice recorded in <hi>Catalogus Testium;) excerpta quaedam ex ejusdem epistolis; tractatus de oculo morali; de modo confitendi; &amp; sermones quidam.</hi> Some of these, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, if they be not abroad already, might not be unworthy to see the light: nor should I be unwilling, if they should be so esteemed, to bend my poor and weak endeavours that way; but of that Oration to the Pope, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain lines, not many, are pared away in my Copy, though so as the sense of them may be guessed, and gathered from the context: And in the other Treatises there are many faults, that cannot easily or possibly, some of them, without help of other Copies, be amended. My desire is to understand from you, whether at your being here in <hi>England</hi> (for I wot well how careful you were to make inquiry after such Monuments) you lighted upon any of these, and where, or in whose hands they were. There are besides in this Manuscript a Commentary on <hi>Augustine De Civitate Dei;</hi> and a Postil on <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> with a Treatise <hi>De modo proedicandi;</hi> but these two imperfect, of nameless Authors: Besides <hi>Guilielm. Paris. de Prebendis, &amp; Malachiae Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith de veneno spirituali:</hi> which two last I understand to have been publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I should be glad to hear, as many others desire, that the second part of your painful and profitable Task, so generally applauded, and no less greedily expected, were preparing, or fully prepared for the Press, and much more to see it abroad. Works of that kind are in these times very seasonable; nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve any better of God's Church than those that deal soundly, and learnedly in them, among whom your self, as not a few acknowledge, may well claim
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60492:108"/>
a prime place: Your Labours both in that kind, and others, the Lord bless, and continue unto you life and strength, to be long an Instrument to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of his Churches good.</p>

                     <p>I Received your Letter dated the sixth of <hi>October.</hi> I am glad you received my Book, and I thank you for yours, which I received from Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> of <hi>Hanwell.</hi> The former part of your Letter, being, in regard of the matter, a Tragi-Comedy, drave me almost into an ecstasie; and afterwards brought to my mind that of the Psalmist, <hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous: but God delivereth him out of them all.</hi> And therefore it is good to hold fast by him continually, and to desire his direction and furtherance in all our Affairs and Businesses: So although the beginning and middle thereof be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so troublesome, we shall not need to doubt, but that the end will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and prosperous.</p>
                     <p>The Astronomical Calculation of years in <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Canons, if it be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, is doubtless an excellent Monument of Antiquity, which I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see: But yet it is not likely to make me to let go mine account of <hi>Darius</hi> his years, firmly proved out of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Ctesias,</hi> compared with <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus.</hi> I have endeavoured to satisfie you, touching the objections you make in your Letter: as also to satisfie your desire touching the distances of <hi>Taurus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Albategnius;</hi> and touching the quantity of the Solar and Lunar year, and disposition of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Calendar, in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>DE Epocharum distantiis,</hi> I find no such express mention in <hi>Albategnius,</hi> as that in the end of the 15 of <hi>Alfraganus,</hi> of <hi>Christman's</hi> Edition: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are his 32 nor his 421 set down in the same method. The 325 (the Title whereof, in the <hi>Indice Capitum</hi> before the Book, is, <hi>In scientiâ Tarec Arabum &amp; Romanorum ac Persarum atque Alkept alternatim)</hi> hath three parts.</p>
                     <p>In the first part are set down their 4 sorts of Months, thus. <hi>Mensium qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Arabum nomina sunt, Almuhartan, Saphar,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Romanorum autem men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium nomina secundùm Graecorum &amp; Egyptiorum principia sunt, Elul, Tisrin primus, Tisrin Secundus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nomina verò mensium Persarum, sunt Efroso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, Asdiasdmed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mensium autem Alkept nomina sunt Tut, Bena, Accur,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Whereunto is subjoyned a Clause directly concerning your purpose, and that truly set down, amidst the manifold errors about the Dates of Times, both in the same Chapter, and in the whole Book, as appeareth by comparing the same with other places in these Words. <hi>Principium autem à quo Romani inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt &amp; Alkept, est à morte Alexandri Macedonis secundum Graecos.

In the second part, he sheweth how to find the beginnings of all those 4 sorts of Years and Months. Where the <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Alhegira radix,</hi> is, <hi>5d.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> from <hi>Alhilcarnain,</hi>

                     <p>Here the last number 535, being by a manifest error of the first Figure, put for 435, from the beginning of <hi>Nabonazar</hi>'s Reign, to the <hi>Alkept</hi> year, (in which <hi>oera Dhilcarnaim,</hi> from the <hi>Syro-Graeco-Roman</hi> Month, <hi>Elul Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pioeus</hi> and <hi>September</hi> began,) doth as manifestly discover the error of 15 twice put for 11, and consequently of <note n="‖" place="margin">287. <hi>Crus. pag.</hi> 35.</note> 387 days for 283 <note n="*" place="margin">1205 <hi>anni die</hi> 297. <hi>in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no aequabili, (ineunte verò an.</hi> 1206.) <hi>qui hic intelligitur, ut ex collatione Eclipsis lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris liquet.</hi>

And so likewise in the 42. <hi>Cap. Quod si conjunctionem vel proeventionem per Taric Alkept scire volueris, annos ad Hilcarnaim cum anno in quo fueris, licet una dies tantum Elul praeterierat, assume; post hoc, ex annis</hi> 587 <hi>projice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduique quartam accipe, quodque fuerit, erit dies quartarum.—Et ei quod ex diebus quartarum provenerit,</hi> 3 <hi>dies, in quibus mensis Tut ab Alkept priusquam à Graecis habetur, superis junge, eique quod ex diebus post hoc exierit, ab Elul initio,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Remember that some three or four years since, having occasion in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Lecture in the Colledge, to speak of the beginning of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: I laboured to prove that <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> began his Reign to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the third year of the 77<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, By the number of years attributed to <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> by <hi>Ctesias, viz.</hi> 31. not 36.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:60492:111"/>
Secondly, By the time of the death of the same <hi>Darius,</hi> noted not only in him, but also in <hi>Georgius Syncellus</hi> his Collections, <hi>(pag.</hi> 43. <hi>Graec. Euseb. Scaligeri;</hi> which place, I then did cite long before you advertised me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:) to be not long after the overthrow received at <hi>Marathon, An.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                     <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piadis</hi> 72.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By the Testimony of <hi>Petrus Alexandrinus,</hi> (whom Mr. <hi>Casau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> in his Exercitations against <hi>Baronius,</hi> wrongfully maketh the same with <hi>Peter</hi> the Ancient Martyr of <hi>Alexandria,)</hi> or whosoever was the Author of those <hi>Fasti,</hi> which commonly are called <hi>Siculi:</hi> wherein the beginning of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> is expresly placed at the time above assigned.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By the Testimony of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> making <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> then to Reign, when <hi>Themistocles</hi> fled into <hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here I made a doubt of the time of <hi>Themistocles</hi> his flight: wherein I desired your further resolution. For though I willingly yield to that which I find recorded in <hi>Thucydides,</hi> that it fell after the Execution of <hi>Pausanias,</hi> and before <hi>Cimon</hi>'s double Victory: Yet whether that Victory was gotten in the year that <hi>Demotion</hi> was <hi>Archon</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and whether <hi>Themistocles</hi> his flight fell out the year before that, is not (I take it) so clear, but that we may call it into question. The former I would willingly believe, for the Authority of <hi>Diodorus Siculus;</hi> upon whose credit only, the referring of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Victory unto that year dependeth. <hi>Eusebius</hi> (who is the only man I know of, that after him setteth down the time of his Victory) placeth it at the fourth year of the 79<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Olympiad: by a manifest and notorious Error of two Olympiads,</hi> you say, but prove by no other Authority but the Confession of <hi>Scaliger;</hi> which with me (and I think with you too) is of very little moment. <hi>Diodorus</hi> is the only man we can find, that saith, this Victory was gotten in the year that <hi>Demotion</hi> was <hi>Archon</hi> at <hi>Athens, Publicola</hi> and <hi>Rufus</hi> Consuls at <hi>Rome.</hi> But doth not he also say <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. and that he being thus made Admiral took <hi>Eïone,</hi> and <hi>Scyrus</hi> The words methinks sound thus plainly, That this year he was made Admiral, and then conquered those places; which being untrue, derogates much from the credit of his report, that saith, <hi>Cimon</hi> got his famous Victory at <hi>Eurymedon</hi> the same year. You say, the former is reported by him, by way of recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: but the words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> seem to me very clear, that <hi>Diodorus</hi> meant plainly, That <hi>Cimon</hi> this year was made Admiral; and the words following as plainly import, that having thus undertaken the Admiralty, he took <hi>Eï<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi> and <hi>Scyrus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I never read that part of your written Chronicle, wherein this matter is handled: if there be any thing in it, that may farther clear the point, I pray you communicate it unto me, for I do desire, as much as you do, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Authority of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> in placing <hi>Cimon</hi>'s Victory at the Praetorship of <hi>Demotion,</hi> (or which is all one) at the third year of the 77<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this being admitted, for <hi>Diodorus</hi> his sake, how can you prove, either out of him, or any other Author, that <hi>Themistocles</hi> his flight into <hi>Persia</hi> fell out just the year before that for this is the main matter that concerneth the cause: You say, That you <hi>prove not that point out of</hi> Diodorus, <hi>but out of</hi> Thucydides. For <hi>Diodorus,</hi> I think you do well, seeing he expresseth not any way, that this flight fell upon that year, more than his Ostracism, or his death, but heapeth promiscuously all that appertained to his fall. <hi>Thucydides</hi> saith no more than what I have delivered, and do willingly acknowledge: that his flight happened after the Execution of <hi>Pausanias,</hi> and before <hi>Cimon</hi>'s Victory. Other proof you produce none for the setling thereof at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of the 77<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Olympiad,</hi> but what is contained in these words of your Letter [Your self alledgeth no Author that sets it later: and you may see that in <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s Chronicle it is set two years sooner, <hi>viz.</hi> in the fourth year of the 76<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Olympiad.</hi> At what time perhaps his trouble began, upon
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60492:111"/>
the Arraignment and Examination of <hi>Pausanias.]</hi> Whereunto I thus answer: It was far from my meaning to alledge any Author that setteth the flight of <hi>Themistocles</hi> later than the second year of the 77<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Olympiad.</hi> But I would know of you, what reason might be alledged, why it should not be placed forwarder. The Arraignment and Execution of <hi>Pausanias</hi> is referred by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus</hi> to the fourth year of the 75<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Olympiad:</hi> The flight of <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles</hi> by <hi>Eusebius</hi> to the fourth of the 76<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Olympiad.</hi> These two being the sole Authors, who express the time of these two accidents; why should we without cause reject the Testimony of either Especially for the streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of the Assertion of <hi>Eusebius;</hi> which we may thus farther reason. The <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War began in that Spring, which ended the first year of the 87<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as is known. Two years and a half after that, dyed <hi>Pericles,</hi> (witness <hi>Thucydides</hi> lib. 2. pag. 141.) He began to rule the Common-wealth after the death of <hi>Aristides;</hi> and continued the Government fourty years; (witness <hi>Plutarch in Pericle,</hi> pag. 155. &amp; 161.) <hi>Aristides</hi> deceased almost four years after <hi>Themistocles</hi> was expelled from <hi>Athens,</hi> as <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> (or <hi>Cornelius Nepos)</hi> testified in the life of <hi>Aristides.</hi> These things being laid together, do shew, That the expulsion of <hi>Themistocles</hi> from <hi>Athens</hi> fell no later than the beginning of the fourth year of the 76<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>Olympiad;</hi> (to which time you doubtfully refer the beginning of his troubles:) how much sooner soever, my opinion is, That at that time <hi>Themistocles</hi> fled unto <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> noteth, whose Testimony I have no reason to discredit, unless I have some better Testimony or Reason to oppose against it. The year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that (which is the third of the 76<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Olympiad) I suppose <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> to have begun his Reign: to whom, as yet <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi> fled, as <hi>Thucydides</hi> sufficiently proveth. Thus the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> year of his Reign should fall upon the second year of the 81 Olympiad: And the 487<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> year from that (which is the middle of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s last week) should fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the fourth year of the 202 Olympiad; from which I cannot be drawn as yet, to draw the passion of our Saviour Christ. If you have any further reason to perswade me to hold my first Opinion, which I learned from you, and did once publickly deliver in the Schools, upon the reasons laid down in the beginning of this Letter, I pray you let me understand thereof, for I am most willing to learn any thing, that may further me in the understanding of <hi>Daniel.</hi>

The true Intent and Extent, is <hi>Lubricus locus</hi> to be handled, and hath, and doth now much trouble the Church: this question hath been moved <hi>sub iisdem terminis quibus nunc,</hi> and hath received contrary resolutions; the reason is, That in the <hi>two extremities</hi> of Opinions held in this matter, there is somewhat true, and somewhat false; <hi>The one</hi> extremity <hi>extends</hi> the benefit of Christ's satisfaction <hi>too far,</hi> as if hereby God, for his part, were <hi>actually</hi> reconciled to all mankind, and did <hi>really</hi> discharge every man from all his sins, and that the reason why all men do not reap the fruit of this benefit, is the want of that faith, whereby they ought to have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that God in this sort did love them: whence it would follow, that God should <hi>forgive</hi> a man his sins, and <hi>justifie</hi> him before he believed, whereas the <hi>Elect</hi> themselves, before their effectual vocation are said to be <hi>without Christ, and without hope, and to be utter strangers from the Covenants of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> Ephes. 2. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The other</hi> extremity <hi>contracts</hi> the riches of Christ's satisfaction into <hi>too narrow</hi> a room; as if none had any kind of interest therein, but such as were <hi>elected</hi> before the foundation of the World; howsoever by the Gospel, <hi>every one</hi> be charged to receive the same: whereby it would follow, that a man should be bound in Conscience to believe that which is untrue, and charged to take that wherewith he hath nothing to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Both extremities</hi> then drawing with them unavoidable absurdities; the Word of God <hi>(by hearing whereof, faith is begotten,</hi> Eph. 1. 13.) must be sought unto by a middle course, to avoid these extremities.</p>
                  <p>For finding out this <hi>middle Course,</hi> we must, in the matter of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, carefully put a distinction betwixt the satisfaction of Christ absolutely considered, and the application thereof to every one in particular: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was once done for all; the other is still in doing: The former brings with it sufficiency abundant, to discharge the whole debt; the other adds to it efficacy. The satisfaction of Christ, only makes the sins of mankind <hi>fit for pardon,</hi> which without it, could not well be; the injury done to God's Majesty being so great, that it could not stand with his honour to put it up without amends made. The particular application makes the sins of those to whom that mercy is vouchsafed to be <hi>actually pardoned:</hi> for, as all sins are mortal, in regard of the stipend due thereunto by the Law, but all do not <hi>actually bring forth death,</hi> because the gracious Promises of the Gospel stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the execution; even so all the sins of mankind are become venial, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the price paid by Christ to his Father, (so far, that in shewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon all, if so it were his pleasure, his justice should be no loser,) but all do not obtain <hi>actual remission,</hi> because most offenders do not take out, nor plead their pardon as they ought to do. If Christ had not assumed our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therein made satisfaction for the injury offered to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, God would not have come unto a <hi>Treaty of Peace</hi> with us, more than with the <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> whose nature the Son did not assume: But this way being made, God holds out unto us the <hi>Golden Scepter</hi> of his Word, and thereby, not only signifieth his pleasure of <hi>admitting</hi> us unto his presence, and accepting of our submission, which is a wonderful Grace, but also sends an <hi>Embassage</hi> unto us, and <hi>entreats us that we would be reconciled unto him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60492:112"/>
Hence, we infer against the first extremity, that by the virtue of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Oblation, God is made placable unto our Nature, (which he never will be unto the Angelical nature offending) but not actually appeased with any, until he hath received his Son, and <hi>put on the Lord Jesus.</hi> As also against the latter extremity, that all men may be truly said to have interest in the merits of Christ, as in a <hi>Common,</hi> though all do not enjoy the benefit thereof; because they have no will to take it.</p>
                  <p>The Well-spring of life is set open unto all, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely,</hi> but many have <hi>nothing to draw with;</hi> and <hi>the Well is deep:</hi> Faith is the Vessel whereby we draw all vertue from Christ, and the Apostle tells us, That <hi>Faith is not of all,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 2. Now the means of getting this Faith is the <hi>hearing of the word of truth, the Gospel of our salvation,</hi> Eph. 1. 13. which ministreth this general ground for every one to build his Faith upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Syllogism.</hi> What Christ hath prepared for thee, and the Gospel offereth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that oughtest thou with all thankfulness to accept and apply to the comfort of thy own Soul.</p>
                  <p>But Christ by his death and obedience hath provided a sufficient remedy for the taking away of all thy sins, and the Gospel offereth the same unto thee. Therefore thou oughtest to accept, and apply the same to the comfort of thine own Soul.</p>
                  <p>Now this Gospel of Salvation many do not hear at all, being destitute of the Ministry of the Word; and many hearing do not believe, or lightly regard it; and many that do believe the truth thereof, are so wedded to their sins, that they have no desire to be divorced from them; and therefore they refuse to accept the gracious offer that is made unto them. And yet notwithstanding their refusal on their part, we may truly say, That good things were provided for them on Christ's part, and a rich <hi>prize was put into the hands of a Fool, howsoever he had no heart to use it,</hi> Prov. 17. 16.</p>
                  <p>Our blessed Saviour, by that which he hath performed on his part, hath procured a <hi>Jubilee</hi> for the Sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> and his Gospel is his Trumpet, whereby he doth proclaim <hi>Liberty to the Captives, and preacheth the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table year of the Lord,</hi> Luk. 4. 18, 19. If for all this some are so well pleased with their Captivity, that they desire no deliverance, that derogates nothing from the generality of the freedom annexed to that year. If one say to sin, his old Master, <hi>(Levit.</hi> 25. 39. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 66.) <hi>I love thee, and will not go out free,</hi> he shall be bored for a slave, and serve for ever, But that slavish disposition of his, maketh the extent of the priviledge of that year not a whit the straighter, because he was included within the general Grant, as well as others; howsoever, he was not disposed to take the benefit of it. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is like to a certain King that made a marriage of his Son, and sent his Servants to those that were bidden to the Wedding with this message; <hi>Behold, I have prepared my Dinner; my Oxen, and my Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; Come to the Marriage,</hi> (Mat. 24.) If we look to the event, they that were bidden made light of their entertainment, and went their ways; <hi>one to his Farm, and another to his Merchandise,</hi> (verse 5.) but that neglect of theirs doth not falsifie the word of the King (verse 4.) <hi>viz.</hi> That the Dinner was prepared, and these unworthy Guests were invited thereunto: For what, <hi>If some did not believe, shall their unbelief disannul the Faith, and truth of God</hi> (Rom. 3. 3, 4.) <hi>God forbid; yea, let God be true, and every man a lyar, as it is written, that thou mayest be justified in thy say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and overcome when thou judgest. Let not the house of Israel say, The way of the Lord is unequal.</hi> For when he cometh to judge them, the inequality will be found on their side, and not on his. <hi>O house of Israel, are not my ways equal, and your ways unequal saith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 18. 29, 30. <hi>The Lord is right in all his ways, and holy in all his works. All the ways of our God are</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:60492:113"/>
                     <hi>mercy and truth;</hi> when we were in our sins it was of his infinite mercy that any way, or remedy should be prepared for our recovery: And when the remedy is prepared, we are never the nearer, except he be pleased of his free mercy to apply the same to us, that so the whole praise of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the beginning to the end thereof, may intirely be attributed to the <hi>riches of his grace,</hi> and nothing left to sinful flesh wherein it may rejoyce.</p>
                  <p>The freeing of the Jews from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was a Type of that great deliverance, which the Son of God hath wrought for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cyrus,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who was <hi>Christus Domini,</hi> (and herein but a shadow of <hi>Christus Dominus,</hi> the Author of our Redemption) published his Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in this manner; <hi>Who is amongst you of all his people, the Lord his God be with him,</hi> and let him go up, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 23. and <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 2.) Now it is true, they alone did follow this Calling, whose spirit God had raised to go up, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 5. But could they that remained still in <hi>Babylon,</hi> justly plead, That the King's Grant was not large enough, or that they were excluded from going up by any clause contained therein The matter of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purchased by our Saviour Christ lieth open to all, all are invited to it, none that hath a mind to accept of it, is excluded from it. <hi>The beautiful feet of those that preach the Gospel of peace, do bring glad tidings of</hi> good things to every house where they tread: The first part of their Message being this, <hi>Peace to this house,</hi> (Rom. 10. 15. Luk. 10. 5.) But, unless God be pleased out of his abundant mercy <hi>to guide our feet into the way of peace,</hi> the Rebellion of our Nature is such, that we run head-long to the <hi>ways of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and misery,</hi> Rom. 3. 16. <hi>And the ways of peace do we not know.</hi> They have not all obeyed the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 16. All are not apt to entertain this Message of peace, and therefore, though God's Ambassadours make a true tender of it to all unto whom they are sent, yet <hi>their peace, only resteth on the Sons of peace,</hi> but if it meet with such as will not listen to the motion of it, <hi>their peace doth again return unto themselves,</hi> Luk. 10. 6. The Proclamation of the Gospel runneth thus: <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>Let him that is a thirst come,</hi> for him this Grace is specially provided, because none but he will take the pains to come; but least we should think this should abridge the largeness of the offer, a <hi>Quicunque vult,</hi> is immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and <hi>whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely:</hi> yet withal this must be yielded for a certain truth, That it is God who must work in us <hi>to will and to do of his good pleasure;</hi> and though the Call be never so loud and large, yet none can <hi>come except the Father draw him,</hi> Joh. 6. 44. For the <hi>Universality</hi> of the satisfaction derogates nothing from the necessity of the special Grace in the application: Neither doth the speciality of the one any ways abridge the generality of the other. Indeed Christ our Saviour saith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> but <hi>for them that thou hast given me:</hi> but the consequence hereby inferred may well be excepted against, <hi>viz.</hi> He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not for the World, Therefore, He payed not for the World; Because the latter is an act of his satisfaction, the former of his Intercession: which being divers parts of his Priesthood, are distinguishable one from another by sundry differences. This his satisfaction doth properly give contentment to God's justice, in such sort as formerly hath been declared: His Intercession doth sollicit God's mercy. The first contains the preparation of the remedy neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for man's salvation; the second brings with it an Application of the same, And consequently the one may well appertain to the common nature which the Son assumed, when the other is a special Priviledge vouchsafed to such particular persons only, as <hi>the father hath given him.</hi> And therefore we may safely conclude out of all these premises, That the <hi>Lamb of God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himself a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world,</hi> intended, by giving sufficient satisfaction to God's Justice, to make the nature of man, which he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60492:113"/>
assumed, a fit subject for mercy, and to prepare a Medicine for the sins of the whole World; which should be denied to none that intended to take the benefit of it: Howsoever he intended not by applying this All-sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy unto every person in particular, tomake it effectual unto the salvation of all, or to procure thereby actual Pardon for the sins of the whole World. So, in one respect he may be said to have <hi>died for all,</hi> and in another respect <hi>not to have died for all;</hi> yet so as in respect of his mercy he may be counted a <hi>kind of universal cause</hi> of the restoring of our Nature, as <hi>Adam</hi> was of the depraving of it; for as far as I can discern, he rightly hits the nail on the head that determineth the point in this manner.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXIII. <hi>An Answer to some exceptions taken against the former Letter, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend</hi> James Usher <hi>Arch-Bishop of</hi> Armagh.</head>
                  <p>I Cannot sufficiently wonder, why such exceptions should be taken at a <hi>Letter of Mine,</hi> which without my privity came to so many mens hands, as if thereby I had confirmed <hi>Papism, Arminianism,</hi> and I know not what error of Mr. <hi>Culverwell</hi>'s which (as you write) is, and hath been, opposed by <hi>many;</hi> yea, <hi>all good men.</hi> The <hi>Papist</hi> (saith one) doth thus distinguish; a Mediator of <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Intercession;</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (saith another) divides the satisfaction and application of Christ. To which, what other <hi>Answer</hi> should I make but this To hold, That Christ is the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of Redemption, but the Saints are also Mediators of Intercession, That Christ by his Merits hath made satisfaction to his Father in gross, and the <hi>Pope by his Indulgence,</hi> and his Priests by their Oblations in the Mass do make a particular application to particular persons; to joyn thus Partners with Christ in this manner in the Office of Mediation is Popery indeed: but he who attributing the entire work of the Mediation unto Christ alone, doth yet distinguish the Act of Redemption from the Act of Intercession, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction made by him unto God, from the Application thereof communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto men, is as far from Popery, as he that thinks otherwise, is from the <hi>grounds of the Catechism;</hi> for that Christ hath so died for all men (as they lay down in the conference of <hi>Hague) Ut reconciliationem cum Deo, &amp; peccatorum remissionem singulis impetraverit,</hi> I hold to be untrue, being well assured, That our Saviour hath obtained at the hands of his Father Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60492:114"/>
and Forgiveness of sins, not for the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> but <hi>Elect only;</hi> and not for them neither, before they be truly regenerated, and implanted into himself. For, <hi>Election</hi> being nothing else but the purpose of God, resting in his own mind, makes no kind of alteration in the party elected, but only the execution of that Decree and purpose, which in such as have the use of reason is done by an <hi>effectual Calling,</hi> in all by spiritual regeneration, which is the new birth, without which no man can <hi>see the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Impetration,</hi> whereof the <hi>Arminians</hi> speak, I hold to be a fruit, not of his Satisfaction, but Intercession; and seeing I have learned from Christ's own mouth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>I pray not for the</hi> reprobate <hi>World:</hi> I must needs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem it a great folly to imagine, that he hath impetrated Reconciliation and Remission of sins for that World. I agree therefore thus far with Mr. <hi>Ames</hi> in his dispute against <hi>Grevinchovius,</hi> That Application and Impetration, in this matter we have in hand, are <hi>of equal extent;</hi> and, That forgiveness of sins is not by our Saviour impetrated for any unto whom the merit of his death is not applyed in particular. If in seeking to make straight that which was crooked in the <hi>Arminians</hi> Opinion, he hath bended it too far the contrary way, and inclined too much upon the other extremity; it is a thing which in the heat of disputation hath befallen many worthy men before him; and if I be not deceived, gave the first occasion to this present controversie. But I see no reason why I should be tied to follow him in every step, wherein he treadeth: And so much for Mr. <hi>Ames.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The main error of the <hi>Arminians (vid. Corvin. in Defen. Armini. cap.</hi> 11.) and of the patrons of Universal Grace, is this, <hi>That God offereth</hi> unto every man those means that are necessary unto salvation, both sufficiently and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; and, that it resteth in the <hi>Free-Will</hi> of every one to receive, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the same; for the proof thereof they alledge, as their Predecessors, the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> did before them, that received Axiom of Christ's <hi>dying for all men,</hi> which being rightly understood, makes nothing for their purpose. Some of their Opposites (subject to oversights as well as others) more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward herein than circumspect, have answered this Objection, not by expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, (as was fit) but by flat denying that famous Axiom; affirming pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily, That <hi>Christ died only for the Elect,</hi> and for others <hi>nullo modo;</hi> whereby they gave the adverse party advantage to drive them unto this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream absurdity, <hi>viz.</hi> That seeing Christ in no wise died for any, but for the Elect, and all men were bound to believe that Christ died for themselves, and that upon pain of damnation for the contrary <hi>infidelity;</hi> therefore all men were bound to believe that they themselves were Elected, although in truth the matter were nothing so:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis</l>
                     <l>Tempus eget.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Neither is there hope, that the <hi>Arminians</hi> will be drawn to acknowledge the Error of their Position, as long as they are perswaded the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot be maintained without admitting that an untruth must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, even by the commandment of him that is <hi>God of Truth,</hi> and by the direction of that word, which is the <hi>Word of Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Endeavouring therefore to make one truth stand by another, and to ward off the blow given by the <hi>Arminians</hi> in such sort that it should neither bring hurt to the Truth, nor give advantage to Error; admit I failed of mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, I ought to be accounted rather an Oppugner, than any wise an Abettor of their fancies. That for the <hi>Arminians.</hi> Now for Mr. <hi>Culverwell,</hi> That which I have heard him charged withal, is the former extremity, which in my Letter I did condemn, <hi>viz. That Christ</hi> in such sort did die for all men, That by his death he made an actual reconcilement between God and man; and That the special reason why all men reap not the fruit of this reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60492:114"/>
is the want of that faith, whereby they ought to have believed, that God in this sort did love them. How justly he hath been charged with this error, himself can best tell; but if ever he held it, I do not doubt but he was driven thereunto by the absurdities, which he discerned in the other extremity; for what would not a man fly unto, rather than yield, that Christ no manner of way died for any <hi>Reprobate,</hi> and none but the <hi>Elect</hi> had any kind of Title to him, and yet so many thousand Reprobates should be bound in Conscience to believe that he died for them, and tied to accept him for their Redeemer and Saviour; yea, and should be condemned to everlasting Torments for <hi>want of such a faith,</hi> (if we may call that faith, which is not grounded upon the word of truth) whereby they should have believed that which in it self was most untrue, and laid hold of that in which they had no kind of interest If they who dealt with Mr. <hi>Culverwell,</hi> laboured to drive out one absurdity by bringing in another, or went about to stop one hole by making two, I should the less wonder at that you write, that though he hath been <hi>dealt withal by many brethren,</hi> and for many years, yet he could not be drawn from his errour. But <hi>those stumbling blocks</hi> being removed, and the plain word of truth laid open, by which faith is to be begotten, I dare boldly say, he doth not hold that extremity wherewith he is charged, but followeth that safe, and <hi>middle course,</hi> which I laid down; for after he had well weighed what I had written, he <hi>heartily thanked the Lord, and me,</hi> for so good a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of this Question, which for his part he wholly approved, not seeing how it could be gainsaid. And so much likewise for Mr. <hi>Culverwell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for Mr. <hi>Stock</hi>'s publick opposition in the Pulpit, I can hardly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe that he aimed at me therein; if he did, I must needs say he was deceived, when he reckoned me amongst those good men, who make the Universality of all the Elect, and all men to be one: Indeed I wrote but even now, that God did execute his Decree of Election in All by spiritual ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: But if any shall say, that by All, thereby I should understand the universality of All, and every one in the World, and not the universality of all the Elect alone, he should greatly wrong my meaning: for I am of no other mind than <hi>Prosper</hi> was, Lib. 1. De Vocat. Gent. <hi>Habet populus Dei plenitudinem suam, &amp; quamvis magna pars hominum salvantis Gratiam aut re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellat aut negligat, in elect is tamen &amp; proescitis, atque ab omni generalitate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretis, specialis quaedam censetur universitas, ut de toto mundo, totus mundus liberatus, &amp; de omnibus hominibus, omnes homines videantur assumpti.</hi> That Christ died for his <hi>Apostles,</hi> Luk. 22. 19. For his <hi>Sheep,</hi> Joh. 10. 15. For his <hi>Friends,</hi> Joh. 15. 13. For his <hi>Church,</hi> Ephes. 5. 25. may make peradventure against those, who make all men to have a share alike in the death of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: But I profess my self to hold fully with him, who said, <hi>Etsi Christus pro omnibus mortuus est, tamen specialiter pro nobis passus est, quia pro Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia passus est.</hi> Yea, and in my former writing I did directly conclude, That as in one respect Christ might have been said to die for all, so in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect truly said not to have died for all: and my belief is, That the principal end of the Lord's death, was, <hi>That he might gather together in one the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God scattered abroad,</hi> Joh. 11. 52. and, that for their sakes he did <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially sanctifie himself,</hi> that they <hi>also might be sanctified through the truth,</hi> John 17. 19. And therefore it may be well concluded, That Christ in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner died for these; but to infer from hence; that in no manner of respect he died for any others, is but a very weak collection, specially the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect by me expressed being so reasonable, that no sober mind advisedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering thereof, can justly make question of it, <hi>viz. That the Lamb of God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himself</hi> a sacrifice for the sins of the World, intended by giving satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to God's Justice to make the nature of man, which he assumed, a fit Subject for mercy, and to prepare a Sovereign medicine that should not only be a sufficient Cure for the sins of the whole World, but also should be laid

open to all, and denied to none, that indeed do take the benefit thereof: For he is much deceived that thinks a preaching of a bare sufficiency, is able to yield sufficient ground of comfort to a distressed Soul, without giving a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to it, and opening a further passage.</p>
                  <p>To bring news to a Bankrupt, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath Treasure enough to pay a thousand times more than he owes, may be true, but yields but cold comfort to him the miserable <hi>Debtor:</hi> Sufficiency indeed is requisite, but it is the word of promise that gives comfort.</p>
                  <p>If here exception be taken, That I make the whole Nature of man fit for Mercy, when it is as unfit a subject for Grace as may be;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Answer,</hi> That here <hi>two impediments</hi> do occurr, which give a stop unto the peace, which is to be made betwixt God and man. <hi>The one</hi> respects God, the <hi>party offended,</hi> whose justice hath been in such sort violated by his base Vassals, that it were unfit for his glorious Majesty to put up such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury without a good satisfaction. <hi>The other</hi> respects Man, the <hi>party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> whose blindness, stupidity, and hardness of heart is such, that he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sensible of his own wretchedness, nor God's goodness: that when God offers to be reconciled unto him, there must be much intreaty to perswade him to be reconciled to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. In regard of the latter, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with the Apostle, <hi>That the natural man receives not the things of the spirit, for they are foolishness to him; neither can he, because spiritually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. And this impediment is not taken away by Christ's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (which is a work of his Priestly Function) but by the enlightening of the mind, and softening the heart of the sinner, which are effects issuing from the execution of the Prophetical and Kingly Office of our Redeemer. When therefore, I say, That by Christ's satisfaction to his Father, he made the Nature of Man a fit subject for mercy, I mean thereby, that the former impediment arising on God's part is taken away, that if it were not for the other (for the having whereof we can blame none but our selves; and in the not removing whereof, we cannot say God hath done us any wrong) there were no <hi>let,</hi> but all Men might be saved: And if it pleased God to extend his mercy unto All, as he keeps his freedom therein, in <hi>having compassion on whom he will have mercy,</hi> and leaving others in blindness, natural hardness of their own heart, yet the worth of Christ's satisfaction is so great, that his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice herein should be no loser.</p>
                  <p>But if this Justice (you will say) be satisfied, how comes it to pass that God exacts payment again from any <hi>I Answer,</hi> We must take heed we stretch not our <hi>similitudes</hi> beyond their just extent, lest at last we drive the matter too far, and be forced to say (as some have done) That we cannot see how <hi>satisfaction and forgiveness can stand together,</hi> and so by denying Christ's <hi>Satisfaction</hi> be injurious to God's <hi>Justice,</hi> or by denying <hi>remission of sins</hi> become injurious to God's mercy. We are therefore to understand, that the end of the satisfaction of God's Justice is to make way for God's free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in shewing mercy, that so Mercy and Justice meeting, and embracing one another, God <hi>may be just,</hi> and the <hi>justifier of him that believes in Jesus,</hi> Rom. 3. 26. Now the general satisfaction of Christ, which was the first act of his Priestly Office, prepares the way for God's mercy, by making the sins of all mankind pardonable, the interposition of any bar from God's Justice notwithstanding, and so puts the Sons of Men only in a possibility of being justified, a thing denied to the nature of fallen Angels, which the Son was not pleased to assume: But the special Application of this Satisfaction vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed by Christ unto those persons only whom his Father hath <hi>given him out of the World,</hi> which is an appendant, or appertaineth to the second Act of his Priest-hood, <hi>viz. his Intercession,</hi> produceth this <hi>potentia in Actum,</hi> i. e. <hi>procureth an actual</hi> discharge from God's anger, and maketh Justification, which before was a part of our possibility, to be a part of our present <hi>Possession.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:60492:115"/>
If it be said, It is a great <hi>derogation to the dignity</hi> of Christ's death, to make the sins of mankind only pardonable, and brings in a <hi>bare possibility of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Answer, It is a most unchristian imagination to suppose the merit of Christ's death, being particularly applied to the Soul of a sinner, produceth no further effect than this. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, that we be not only <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable,</hi> but <hi>justified by his blood,</hi> Rom. 5. 9. yet not simply as offered on the Cross, but <hi>through faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. that is, through his blood <hi>applyed by faith. The blood of Jesus Christ his Son,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 1. 17.) <hi>cleanseth us from all sins,</hi> yet cleanse it doth not by being prepared, but by being applyed; prepared it was when he poured it out once upon the Cross; applyed it is when he washeth us from our sins therein, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. It is one thing therefore to speak of Christ's satisfaction, in the general absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered; and another thing, as it is applyed to every one in particular: The consideration of things, as they are in their Causes, is one thing; and as they have an actual Existence, is another thing. Things as they are in their Causes, are no otherwise considerable, but as they have a possibility to be. The application of the Agent to the Patient, with all circumstances ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily required, is it that gives to the thing an actual Being. That Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease is curable for which a Soveraign Medicine may be found, but cured it is not till the Medicine be applyed to the Patient; and if it so fall out, that the Medicine being not applied, the party miscarries, We say, He was lost, not because his sickness was incurable, but because there wanted a care to apply that to him that might have helped him.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sons have taken a <hi>mortal sickness</hi> from their Father, which if it be not remedied, will without fail, bring them to the <hi>second death:</hi> No Medicine under Heaven can heal this Disease, but only a <hi>potion confected</hi> of the blood of the Lamb of God, who came <hi>to take away the sins of the World;</hi> which, as <hi>Prosper</hi> truly notes, <hi>habet quidem in se ut omnibus profit; sed si non bibitur non medetur.</hi> The virtue thereof is such, that if all did take it, all without doubt should be recovered, but without taking it there is no reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: In the former respect it may be truly said, That no man's state is so desperate, but by this means it is recoverable, (and this is the first comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table news that the Gospel brings to the distressed Soul) but here it resteth not, nor feedeth a man with such a possibility, that he should say in <hi>his heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven to bring Christ from above</hi> but it brings the word of comfort <hi>nigh unto him,</hi> even to his mouth and heart, and presents him with the Medicine at hand, and desireth him to take it; which being done accordingly, the cure is actually performed.</p>

have been very glad in this time of my Absence from thence, to have heard from you, but your greater Imployments, and the Burthen of a higher Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that lyeth upon you, do speak sufficiently in your behalf. If you can steal any time from your Pastoral Function to give Perfection and Life, to many of your exquisite Labours, there liveth no man who would more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the News thereof than my self. I hear by common Fame, That there is somewhat published against you this Mart; but the Catalogue is now come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and proves Fame a Lyar. The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Spal.</hi> his great promised Work is in the Press here at <hi>London,</hi> and will come abroad before the End of the Term. It will be as large as <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Work. <hi>Laurentius Beyerlinke,</hi> who stiles himself <hi>Archipresbyter Antuerpiensis,</hi> hath begun the Fight against the Arch-Bishop. I know not whether you have seen his Book or no. There came but a few over. I only saw it, but could not buy it for Money. He is much threatned by the Jesuits in all Countries of Christendom. I doubt not but you have heard of the Ambassage of Sir <hi>John Bennet</hi> to <hi>Bruxels</hi> to question the Arch-Duke in the Behalf of the King our Master, concerning the late Book of <hi>Patianus,</hi> who neither apprehended the Author, nor suppressed the Book, until he was sollicited by the Kings Agent, and only interdicted the Book, and suffered the Author to fly his Dominions.

Sir <hi>John Digby</hi> makes Preparation for his Journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> to treat of a Marriage, which (to give you my Opinion) I think is unfeignedly intended on our Part, but whether by them or no, the Doctors doubt, as the Saying is. Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> is now at <hi>Southampton,</hi> and the Ships of his Fleet follow him daily from hence, and other parts. The action is most distastful to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beyond any that we have undertaken these many years, and hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed strong Opposition from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador, and some of our own, who have sucked in too much <hi>Spanish</hi> Air.

                  <p>I Esteem my self much beholden unto you, as for your former love, so for this your late kindness, in vouchsafeing me so large a Letter, with so full instructions concerning this business, that I was bold to break unto you, though the same, as by your information appeareth, were wholly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that though not fully purposed to do ought therein my self, willing rather to have afforded mine endeavours and furtherance to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I supposed that those two treatises, <hi>viz.</hi> that Oration of the Bishops, and that of <hi>Wilhelm</hi> of <hi>S. Amore.</hi> his might be not unworthy the publishing, had the one been perfect, and the other not yet published, (for as for that of <hi>Parisiensis de prebendis,</hi> I had heard to be already abroad: and <hi>Gesner</hi> in his <hi>Bibliotheca</hi> hath <hi>tractatus</hi> 2. <hi>Argentin. impress.</hi> 1507 <hi>de collatione &amp; pluralitate Eccles. beneficiorum,</hi> which may seem the same, one of them with this. As it is said to be <hi>gemma pretiosior</hi> in that Manuscript you speak of, so to be <hi>auro pret.</hi> in mine.) But I perceive now by your instructions, that the one is out already, and the other perfect and fit for the Press, in the hands of one better furnished and fitter for the performance of such a work than my self, whom I would therefore rather incite to send what he hath perfect, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, than by his perfect Copy, having pieced out mine imperfect one, to take his Labours out of his hand. I have heard since I Wrote to you by Mr. <hi>Bill,</hi> that Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi> is about to publish Bishop <hi>Grosthead</hi>'s Epistles, out of a Manuscript remaining in <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge Library. That treatise <hi>de oculo morali,</hi> I lighted lately on, in another Manuscript bound together with <hi>Grosthead in Decalog.</hi> having this Title before it, <hi>Incipit Liber de Oculo morali, quem composuit Magister Petrus de Sapiere Lemovicensis.</hi> And I find it cited by <hi>Petrus Reginaldeti,</hi> a Friar, in his <hi>Speculum finalis retributionis,</hi> under the name of <hi>Johannes de Pechano,</hi> as the Author of it. Neither seemeth it, though written honestly, yea wittily and learnedly, as the wit and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those times was, to be of the same frame and strain for gravity, that other the works of that Bishop are; which also maketh me suspect those Sermons, that in my Manuscript go under his name, should not be his, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lately at idle times run over some of them. If I meet with your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man <hi>Malachy</hi> at any time, I will not be unmindful of your request. And if any good Office may be performed by me for you here, either about the Impression of your Learned and Religious Labours, (so esteemed and much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, not of my self alone, but of many others of greater judgment than my self,) or in any other imployment, that my weak ability may extend it self unto, I shall be ready and glad upon any occasion to do my best therein. I lighted of late upon an obscure fellow, one <hi>Hieronymus Dungersheim de Och<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senfart,</hi> who in <hi>Anno</hi> 1514 published a confutation dedicated to <hi>George,</hi> then Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> of a confession of the <hi>Picards,</hi> which whether it be the same with that which <hi>Gretser</hi> saith <hi>Luther</hi> set out with his Preface, I wot not: The Title of it is, <hi>Totius quasi Scripturae Apologia,</hi> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60492:117"/>
of it, <hi>In summi Dei maximo nomine &amp; terribili, Amen. Nos homines in terrae or be quanquam ad ima subacti,</hi> &amp;c. And though it be not entirely, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by him in his answer, yet so much is picked out of it, and set down in their words, as may shew in divers main points their dissent from them, and consent with us. But it is not likely, that this Author, though obscure and not worthy the Light, hath escaped your curious eye. <hi>Gesner</hi> seemeth mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in him, when he saith, <hi>Hieronymus Dungersheim scripsit Apologiam sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crae Scripturae Boemorum,</hi> for he wrote not it, but against it. But I trouble you, it may be unseasonably, with needless trifles, amids your more serious Affairs, which forbearing therefore to do, further at this present, with hearty Salutations, and my best Prayers unto God, I commend you and your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Labours to his gracious Blessing, and rest</p>

                  <p>I Received both your Letters; and as touching your discourse in the latter, about the beginning of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Reign, and <hi>Daniel</hi>'s weeks, and the time of our Lord's Passion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> depending thereupon, I framed mine answer to your former discourse therebout, in your Letter bearing date, <hi>Octob.</hi> 6. 1615. upon the ground of your opinion, which I gathered out of the Words thereof: <hi>Darius hath there (in</hi> Ptolemy<hi>'s Canons)</hi> 36 <hi>years, and</hi> Xerxes 21 <hi>which maketh me somewhat to stagger at your beginning of</hi> Artaxerxes. Which words I could not otherwise understand, than that they had drawn <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Beginning back again, in your conceit, unto the vulgar Station, lower than I had advanced it, upon the grounds mentioned in the beginning of your last Letter, and that place of <hi>Fast. Sicul.</hi> which either I had not marked, or else had neglected and forgotten. And to the same purpose seems unto me to tend that you inferr in the same Letter, upon <hi>Cimon</hi>'s taking <hi>Eione</hi> and <hi>Scyrus,</hi> in the beginning of his Admiralty, first mentioned by <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion</hi>'s year. Whence it would follow, That the Siege of <hi>Naxos,</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi>'s Flight at the same time, was later, and the Victory at <hi>Eurymedon</hi> yet later than that. My Manuscript Chronicle being the third part of my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>de Emendat. Tempor.</hi> after my first project, wherein I have wholly transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those places of <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> concerning <hi>Themistocles</hi>'s Flight, I did communicate unto you; if I have not much forgotten my self, and if I be not much deceived, you shall find that part of my Translation, agreable both to <hi>Diodorus</hi> his Words, and to the Truth. Wherefore it made me <hi>marvel,</hi> that in the latter part of the same Letter, you now go about contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, to set <hi>Themistocles</hi>'s Flight, according to <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s Chronicle, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the beginning of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> according to <hi>Thucydides,</hi> two or three years higher, at what time I supposed his troubles began, about the Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and Examination of <hi>Pausanias,</hi> and so much the more, that for your purpose you alledge <hi>Aurelius Probus</hi> or <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> affirming <hi>Themistocles</hi> to have been expelled <hi>Athens,</hi> four years before <hi>Aristides</hi>'s Death, and the beginning of <hi>Perieles</hi>'s Government; which falling out just upon the very same year of my supposal, strongly confirmeth the same; and so much the more strongly, for that his Words seem to have direct reference to those of <hi>Thucydides. Erat enim Themistocles patriâ puisus per ostracismum, Argis vitam agens, &amp; per caeteram Peloponnesum commeans.</hi> Whereas therefore <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> his account casts <hi>Themistocles</hi>'s expulsion or exostracism from <hi>Athens,</hi> right upon that same year, after which time, saith <hi>Thucydides,</hi> he lived at <hi>Argis,</hi> and was going up and down about <hi>Peloponnesus:</hi> needs must his Pursuit and Flight be supposed a good space after that, upon the Execution of <hi>Pausanias,</hi> whose first plotting of Treason and endictment thereupon, whereabout was long and much ado before his Execution, seem to have be fallen the <hi>4th.</hi> year of the 75 <hi>Olympiad:</hi> Where <hi>Diodorus</hi> relateth his whole History together, according to his manner. But that, that made me most of all to marvel, was, that by your thus urging <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s beginning together with <hi>Themistocles</hi>'s Flight, two or three years higher than my Pitch, you not only utterly discredit your <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Canons, for giving 36 years to <hi>Darius</hi> and 21 to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> together with <hi>Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> but also all other Authors of Antiquity that I know, whereof none ascribes less than 31 to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and 20 to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> which hereby, whether upon oversight or otherwise, you enforce your self to do; namely subtracting two or three years more from <hi>Xerxes,</hi> leaving him scarce 15. whose Authorities and Testimonies, together with the other reasons, that I have in place alledged, will, I trust, in the end prevail with you, to move and draw you, to assent to the truth which I have delivered, concerning the beginning and ending of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s weeks, and the time of the Passion and Resurrection of our Lord and Saviour Christ, with all the dependences thereupon. For certainly how weak soever I the restorer and publisher thereof am, yet it is strong and will prevail; and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mine obscure estate, in due time, the Clouds and Mists of errors being dispersed and vanished, it will shine forth as bright as the clear Sun at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyde.</p>
                  <p>As touching the Books you wrote for, I told this Messenger that I meant to send them, and therefore I appointed him to call for them, together with my Letter this Day. But since I have altered my purpose, not envying you the sight of them, but expecting your coming into <hi>England</hi> ere long as of custom, once within three or four years: at which time I shall be glad to shew you them, and to confer them together with your <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Canons. In the mean time if you have any more urgent occasion, of desiring to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved of any thing in them, do but acquaint me with your purpose, what you would prove out of them, and I will truly give my best diligence to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>HAD the Opportunity of convenient Messengers concurr'd with my Desires, my Letters should have come faster to your Hands than they have done; and what hath been wanting of that Respect which absent Friends yield one another, I do assure you hath been supplied by an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate Desire in me to enjoy your Company, together with the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of those many happy Hours, which I have spent with you. I had once hop'd to have seen you this Winter, but my necessary Occasions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the Difficulties of a Winter Journey, are like to detain me here until the Spring; where, if my Service may be useful or advantageous to you, it shall be as absolutely at your Command, as any Friend of yours that lives. I doubt not, but you have heard much of the troublesome Estate of the Low-Country Churches, by their Diversity of Opinions, and what Tumults had like to have ensued; or rather are like to ensue, for the Tempest is not yet over-blown; and had not the opposite Faction to the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,</hi> by them termed vulgarly <hi>Gomarians,</hi> shewed a great deal of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Patience, much Effusion of Christian Blood had followed. I suppose you have seen Sir <hi>Dud. Carlton</hi>'s Speech in the last General Assembly at the <hi>Hague,</hi> which is answered by <hi>H. Grotius</hi> in Print: He is a Professor in <hi>Leyden,</hi> very inward with <hi>Mouns. Barneveldt,</hi> and by name (I think) well known to you: And 14 of the 18 Cities, which send their Deputies to the General Assembly, have publickly protested against any National, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synods, which shall be called. About a Fortnight since, the Heads and others of the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> were summon'd to appear before his Majesty at <hi>New-market,</hi> where, at their coming, they were required to deliver their Opinions concerning <hi>Mouns. Barneveldt</hi>'s Confession, lately sent over to the King, to which, as I am informed, many of them did subscribe; and principally Dr. <hi>Richardson,</hi> the Kings Professor, for which he either hath already, or is in some Danger of losing his Place. I know not whether you have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60492:120"/>
seen the Book called <hi>Analecta Sacra,</hi> published the last Mart, if you can discover the Author I pray you let me know him. I have written to a Friend of mine at <hi>Paris,</hi> to enquire at the Printers, where the Book was printed of the Author. With much difficulty I obtained one of them, which you should have received, had I not been constrained to bestow it otherwise. Here in <hi>England</hi> there is little written or published in any kind of Learning. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parish-Church there are now Sums of Money collected for <hi>Chelsey</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but I see no Addition to the Work. Our kind Friend, Mr. <hi>Briggs,</hi> hath lately published a Supplement to the most excellent Tables of Logarithms, which I presume he hath sent you. <hi>Suarez</hi>'s Book against the King, is now grown common by the late <hi>German</hi> Impression; which if you please you may have. The Popish Writers having sharpned their Weapons, being now to strike, with sharp Invectives, our Arch-Bishop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> after their wonted manners, and now openly charge him with Apostacy, and revolt from their Religion. He hath not obtained any Ecclesiastical Promotion, nor, for ought I hear, desireth any; but rather to end his Days in a retired and solitary Exile. Since the return of <hi>Digby</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> there is little known of the Progress of our Affairs there; neither of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> since the Return of Captain <hi>Bayly</hi> from him, if I may give his unworthy running away so honest a name. Sir, both I and my Messenger stand upon Thorns, as they say, being both presently to begin our Journeys; he for <hi>Ireland,</hi> I for the West of <hi>England,</hi> where I mean to spend this Festival time; which I hope shall excuse my Rudeness in Writing, both for Matter and Manner. When I come to a place of more leisure, you shall hear from me. In the mean time, let me live in your good Opinion, as one who truly loves you, and will ever declare himself</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXXIII. <hi>A Letter from Dr.</hi> James Usher, <hi>afterward Arch-Bishop of</hi> Armagh, <hi>to Mr.</hi> William Camden.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My dear and worthy Friend,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have been earnestly intreated by Dr. <hi>Rives</hi> to send this inclosed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Letter unto you. He hath had his Education in New-Colledge in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he took his Degree of Doctor in the Civil Law. He is now one of the Masters of the <hi>Chancery</hi> with us, and Judge of the Faculties and Prerogative Court. Two things, he told me, he was very desirous to be certified of from you; the one, In what sort you would have him answer that Calumniation of our Irish Libeller, where he intimateth, that you dissemble your Religion, and write otherwise than you think, <hi>delusus Spe hujus secult, et mundani honor is lenocinio illectus.</hi> The other, What you think of our great St. <hi>Patrick</hi> and of his Miracles.</p>
                  <p>Touching the former, I assured him of my own knowledge, that you were wrong'd most shamefully: what you did you did out of Judgment, and not led by any such base Respect as you were charged withal; and that I knew for certain, that with your heart you embraced the Religion which by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is maintained in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For the latter, I gave him good leave to discredit as much as he list, that Pack of ridiculous Miracles which latter Writers had fastned upon St. <hi>Patrick;</hi> but wished him in no wise to touch the Credit of that worthy man himself, nor to question his Succession to <hi>Palladius,</hi> nor to cast him unto lower Times, contrary to the consent of all Writers that ever make Mention of him. And to this end, I shewed unto him what I had gathered together to this purpose, in a Treatise
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60492:121"/>
which I lately wrote at the Request of Dr. <hi>Hampton,</hi> Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> of the first Planters of the Christian Faith in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and specially, of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> and his Successors in the See of <hi>Armagh:</hi> but one word from you will satisfie him more than a hundred from me; and therefore let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, that you would here <hi>erranti comiter monstrare viam.</hi> You easily may see what little Credit the Testimony (or the Silence rather) of so late an Author as <hi>Platina</hi> is, may carry to bear down the constant agrement of all our own Writers. The Objection would be far more specious, if it were drawn from the Silence of venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> who making express Mention both in his History and his Chronicle of <hi>Palladius,</hi> speaketh nothing at all of <hi>Patricius.</hi> Yet have I seen in Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Library an ancient Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment written before the time of <hi>Bede,</hi> wherein St. <hi>Patrick</hi> is not only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but also made to be as ancient in time as hitherto we have still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him to have been. It was found among Mr. <hi>Josseline</hi>'s Papers: and is now bound up in blew Leather, with other Antiquities. If you can come by the Book, and will be pleased to transcribe that place of it where the Tradition of the Liturgy from Man to Man is described (for there this Mention of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> is to be found) either that or nothing will give full Satisfaction to our Doctor.</p>
                  <p>The Company of <hi>Stationers</hi> in <hi>London</hi> are now erecting a Factory for Books and a Press among us here: Mr. <hi>Felix Kingston,</hi> and some others are sent over for that Purpose. They begin with the printing of the Statutes of the Realm; afterwards they purpose to fall in Hand with my Collections <hi>De Christianarum Ecclesiarum Successione &amp; Statu.</hi> I do intreat you of all Love, to look over the first Edition; and what you find I have mistaken, or what you think may be further added out of the Antiquities which you have met withal, signifie unto me. I wrote unto you to this purpose about four years since, by a Kinsman of mine, Mr. <hi>John Brereton:</hi> at which time also I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to understand from you, Whether it were possible to get the Copy of the Epistles to the Monks of <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> attributed to St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you told me you had sometimes seen. But since that time I have heard nothing from you. If you will be pleased at this time to write unto me, or to Dr. <hi>Rives,</hi> (who earnestly expecteth your Answer) you may leave your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at my Lord <hi>Knevet</hi>'s House in <hi>Westminster,</hi> there to be delivered unto Sir <hi>Henry Docwra,</hi> our Treasurer at Wars; who will take Order that they shall be safely conveyed unto me. And thus craving Pardon for my Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in troubling you thus far, I take my Leave for this time, resting always.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXXIV. <hi>A Letter from Mr.</hi> William Camden <hi>to Dr.</hi> James Usher, <hi>afterward Arch-Bishop of</hi> Armagh.</head>

                     <salute>My most esteemed good Mr. Dr.</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOur loving Letter of the Eighth of <hi>June</hi> I received the Fourth of <hi>July,</hi> being retired into the Country for the recovery of my tender health, where <hi>portum anhelans beatadinis,</hi> I purposed to sequester my self from Worldly business and cogitations. Yet being somewhat recovered, I could not but answer your love, and Mr. Doctor <hi>Rieves</hi> Letter for your sake, with the few lines herein enclosed, which I submit to your censure.</p>
                  <p>I thank God my life hath been such among men, as I am neither ashamed to live, nor fear to die, being secure in Christ my Saviour, in whose true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion I was born and bred in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued firm therein.</p>
                  <p>And to make you my Confessor <hi>sub sigillo Confessionis,</hi> I took my Oath thereunto at my Matriculation in the University of <hi>Oxon.</hi> (when Popery was predominant) and for defending the Religion established, I lost a fellowship in <hi>All-Souls,</hi> as Sir <hi>Daniel Dun</hi> could testifie, and often would relate how I was there opposed by the Popish Faction. At my coming to <hi>Westminster</hi> I took the like Oath, where <hi>(absit jactantia)</hi> God so blessed my labours, that the now Bishops of <hi>London, Durham,</hi> and St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> to say nothing of persons employed now in eminent place abroad, and many of especial note at home of all degrees; do acknowledge themselves to have been my Scholars. Yea, I brought there to Church divers Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as <hi>Walshes, Nugents, O Raily, Shees,</hi> the eldest Son of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Cassiles, Petre Lombard</hi> a Merchants Son of <hi>Waterford,</hi> a youth of admirable docility, and others bred Popishly, and so affected.</p>
                  <p>I know not who may justly say that I was ambitious, who contented my self in <hi>Westminster</hi> School when I writ my <hi>Britannia,</hi> and eleven years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Who refused a Mastership of Requests offered, and then had the place of a King of Arms, without any suit cast upon me. I did never set sail after present preferments, or desired to soar higher by others. I never made suit to any man, no not to his Majesty, but for a matter of course incident to my place, neither (God be praised) I needed, having gathered a contented suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency by my long labours in the School. Why the <hi>Annalectist</hi> should so censure me I know not, but that men of all humours repair unto me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of my place; and rest content to be belied by him, who is not ashamed to belie the Lords Deputies of <hi>Ireland</hi> and others of honourable rank. <hi>Sed haec tibi uni &amp; soli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That I might give you better satisfaction, I sent my Servant with directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to my Study at <hi>Westminster,</hi> who found this which I have herein inclosed. Which if they may stead you I shall be right glad. As my health will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit I will look over your learned Treatise <hi>De Christianarum Ecclesiarum Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessione.</hi> But such hath been your happy industry therein, that I have little hope to add any thing, and less to observe any mistaking. Thus with my salutations to your good self, and my respectful love remembred to Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Savage,</hi> I rest</p>

                  <p>I Have read carefully what <hi>Arminius</hi> hath written <hi>De justitia &amp; efficacia providentiae Dei in malo.</hi> Yet in that I read him for especially, he leaves me as doubtful as he found me.

Indeed if God, foreseeing both what arguments and occasions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing unto sin, would by ordinary course of Nature, or free-will, come in the way of him that for the present meant no such evil; and likewise, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less his Providence hindered, he would be thereby overcome; I say, if God, foreseeing all this, should with-hold his preventing interposition, it were no more than bare permission, the justice whereof cannot be called in question. And if this seem too little, it might haply be farther granted, <hi>istius objectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis administrationem penes Dei providentiam esse,</hi> (to use his own words) though I cannot think what bounds are thereunto due: but that he should <hi>irritamenta ista objicere, cum creatura actum peccato junctum ex se patrare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit,</hi> It seems to me very hard to grant, and he as hardly to maintain the justice of it, <hi>pag.</hi> 102. &amp; 114. But of the extent, and justice of his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration in this point, I would your leisure served to send me your opinion; you shall both pleasure me, and do God service in it.

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Do heartily thank you for your double pains in writing, which is your kindness beyond any single desert of my part; and I must twice thank you for the young Batchelor, who hath approved himself, since his coming hither, to be indeed very commendable. Your manifold Imployments spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in your Letters, will not suffer me to be too large in these of mine, lest I might <hi>morari tua tempora.</hi>

                  <p>Truly I cannot but admire your exceeding pains, and bless God for his Graces in you. The Synod in the low Countries is held at <hi>Dort,</hi> the most of their Suffragators are already Assembled, the manner of their proceedings is methodically ordered; the Remonstrants (excepting some few) do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt themselves. I think to hold universal grace <hi>quoad revelationem nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi> as importing that no Soul can be said particularly to be excluded, may sufficiently qualifie the violence of oppositions. I shall long to see you with me, that I may enjoy the comfort of your presence; I pray you, if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, satisfie my desire: In the interim, and always, I pray our Lord Jesus to preserve us to the glory of his Saving Grace, and rest</p>

                     <salute>Good Mr. Dr. Usher,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>MY kindest salutations premised. These are to signifie unto you, That I received at <hi>Dort</hi> the Letter you sent me, though a long time after the date. As touching the Additions and Corrections <note n="*" place="margin">Upon <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>'s Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> which <hi>J. Scaliger</hi> left with <hi>Gomarus;</hi> I understand by him, that they shall shortly be published. He hath delivered them to a Printer at <hi>Leyden,</hi> who is to print them. The Additions are many, as he telleth me, almost as many as are already set forth. <hi>Chamierus</hi> was not at the Synod, and I cannot learn whether any such ancient Writings of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> were left with him. As for that which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be transcribed out of <hi>Paulus Alexandrinus,</hi> concerning the method of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Year, I being at <hi>Leyden</hi> after the Synod, was desirous to have spoken with <hi>Meursius;</hi> but enquiring for him of Mr. <hi>Joannes Latius,</hi> one of our Synod, he told me he would go to <hi>Meursius,</hi> and transcribe it, and send it me into <hi>England;</hi> for he thought it not seasonable to go to him that day, being the day of <hi>Bernevelt</hi>'s Execution, whose Sons <hi>Meursius</hi> had been
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60492:123"/>
Tutor unto. When I receive the Transcript from <hi>Latius,</hi> I will send it you.</p>
                  <p>It may be you will be desirous to know the remarkable passages of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, which will be shortly published, both the Acts, and the Canons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded upon touching the five Articles: We had somewhat to do when we came to frame Canons, with the <hi>Provincials,</hi> and some of the <hi>Exteri,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some points, especially touching the second Article. Some of us were held by some half Remonstrants, for extending the Oblation made to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to all; and for holding sundry effects thereof offered <hi>seriò,</hi> and some really communicated to the reprobate. I had somewhat to do with a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal man touching this point; somewhat passed in writing between us pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately. We were careful that nothing should be defined which might gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say the Confession of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> which was effected, for that they were desirous to have all things in the Canons defined <hi>unanimi consensu.</hi> We foreign Divines, after the Subscription of the Canons, and a general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Confession, and Catechism (which is the <hi>Palatine</hi>'s) as containing no <hi>Dogmata</hi> repugnant to the Word of God, and a Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Vorstius</hi>'s Doctrine, chiefly that in his Book <hi>De Deo,</hi> were dismissed. In our approbation of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Confession, our consent was only asked for Doctrinals, not for matters touching Discipline. We had a solemn parting in the Synod, and all was concluded with a solemn Feast. This was upon Thursday <hi>April</hi> 29. The Saturday we went to the <hi>Hague</hi> to take our leaves of the States General, where we resolved, while our Ship was made ready, to see <hi>Leyden, Amsterdam</hi> and <hi>Harlem,</hi> which we did the week following. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Monday we purposing to go for <hi>Leyden,</hi> early in the morning were informed, that <hi>Bernevelt,</hi> was to lose his head that morning, which was executed. Upon the tenth of <hi>May</hi> we loosed from the <hi>Bril,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Gravesend</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>May:</hi> And visited his Majesty at <hi>Greenwich</hi> as we came by, who graciously did receive us. And thus, I thank God, we are safely returned to our homes. And here with my hearty salutations, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the gracious Protection of the highest Majesty.</p>

                  <p>This latter doth contain but ordinary Stuff: in <hi>Theon</hi> the Principal thing that I observe is the time of the Concurrence of the beginning of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> and the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> year, <hi>(hoc est anni vagi et fixi)</hi> noted by him in these Words. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I am very glad to hear of your Pains taken in the unfolding of the Revelation: and hope that e'er long, it will come abroad among us. To help you therein touching the <hi>Fratricelli, Beguini,</hi> &amp;c. my Opinion is this, That as under the name of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> were comprehended not only the <hi>Manichees</hi> which swarmed in those parts of <hi>France,</hi> but also the <hi>Waldenses</hi> which dwelt among them: so likewise under the Name of the <hi>Fratricelli</hi> and <hi>Beguini</hi> (unto whom as monstrous Opinions and Practices are ascribed as unto the other) those also were contained who made Profession of the Truth. For to omit the Testimony of a certain Writing, <hi>in quo S.

                  <p>There cometh also unto my mind, another place (which is not common) touching the <hi>Beghardi</hi> and <hi>Fratricelli,</hi> out of the Book <hi>de squaloribus Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae Curiae,</hi> written by <hi>Matthew de Cracovia,</hi> who was Bishop of <hi>Worms, ab anno</hi> 1405 <hi>ad</hi> 1410.

                  <p>YOU hear (I doubt not) ere this, of the lamentable news out of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia;</hi> how it pleased God, on the 29th. of <hi>October</hi> last, to give victory to the Emperor's Army against the King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> His whole Army was routed, 3000 flain on the ground, others taken Prisoners, who have yielded <note place="margin">1800 <hi>Of the other side.</hi>
                     </note> (to save their lives) to serve against him. Himself, and the chief Commanders, fled with 2000 Horse, came to <hi>Prague,</hi> took away the poor Queen (being with Child) and some of his Councellors, with such things as in that hast could be carried away; and so left that Town (it not being to be held) and withdrew himself into <hi>Silesia,</hi> where he hath another Army (as also in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia)</hi> though not without an Enemy there invading also. How those of the Religion in <hi>Bohemia</hi> are like to be dealt with, you may imagine; and what other evil effects will follow, God knoweth, if he in mercy stay not the fury of the Enemy, who in all likelihood intendeth to prosecute the Victory to the uttermost. <hi>Spinola</hi> also prevaileth still in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> one Town or two more, with two or three little Castles, he hath gained; and now we hear, that a Cessation of Arms is on either side agreed upon, for the space of five months. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath made himself Master of the Passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> by getting <hi>Voltelina;</hi> where he hath put down five Protestant Churches, and Erected Idolatry in their places. He hath so corrupted many among the <hi>Switzers,</hi> as they cannot resolve on any good course, how to help the mischief, or how to prevent the further increasing of it. The <hi>French</hi> (that should protect them) are <hi>Hispaniolized:</hi> The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> have their hands full at home: And the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that would, dare not alone enter into the business. And now newly (while I am writing this addition) we are certified here, that the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> hath quit <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> and <hi>Silesia,</hi> seeing all things there desperate; and hath withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi> God grant we may lay this seriously to heart; otherwise I fear, the judgment that hath begun there, will end heavily upon us; and <hi>(if all things deceive me not) it is even now marching toward us with a swift pace.</hi> And so much touching the Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired me to impart unto you, whether they were good or evil.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XLI. <hi>A Letter from the Right Reverend</hi> James Usher, <hi>Bishop-elect of</hi> Meath, <hi>to the most Reverend Dr.</hi> Hampton, <hi>Arch-Bishop of</hi> Armagh.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My very good Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Received yesterday your Grace's Letter, whereby I understand, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly the Bishop of <hi>Clogher</hi> entred into contestation with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for the exercise of his Jurisdiction; and laboured to turn your particular favour toward me, to his own advantage, whereat I was not a little grieved. It was far from my meaning ever to oppose either your Archiepiscopal right, or the duties of your Register for the time present, much less for the time to come. The difference betwixt the Registers is by their mutual consent referred to the determination of my L. Chancellor, before whom let them plead their own Cause; I mean not to intermeddle with it. The exercising of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction hitherto, cannot be justified by taking out a Commission now from your Lordship: But seeing what hath been done herein, cannot now be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, I will thus far shew my respect unto your Metropolitical Authority, that whensoever the matter shall be called in question, I will profess, that what I have done in the exercising of the Jurisdiction, I have done it by your special Licence, without which I would not have meddled with it. And for the time to come, I have given order to my Commissary, that he shall proceed no farther, but presently surcease from dealing any way in the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: that no occasion may be left, whereby it might be thought that I stood upon any right of mine own, to the derogation of any point of your Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>episcopal Authority.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for my self. As for my Lord of <hi>Clogher,</hi> howsoever I be none of his Council, yet the respect and duty which I owe unto you, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Father, forceth me to wish, That your Grace would seriously delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of this business, before you bring it unto a publick Tryal. For then I fear the matter will be determined, not by Theological Argumentations of the power of the Keys, but by the power of the King's Prerogative in Causes Ecclesiastical, and the Laws of the Land. If my Lord of <hi>Clogher</hi>'s Council told him, that he might challenge the exercising of his Jurisdiction as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to that which he had already received from the King: It is certain that in his Letters Patents the Bishoprick is granted unto him, <hi>Una cum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Juribus, Jurisdictionibus, Prerogativis, Preeminentiis, Allocationibus, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditatibus &amp; Privilegiis tam spiritualibus quàm temporalibus,</hi> with a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi> directed <hi>Universis &amp; singulis Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, Decanis, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaconis, Officialibus, Commissariis, Rectoribus, Vicariis, Presbyteris, &amp; aliis personis Ecclesiasticis quibuscunque; quatenus ipsum Episcopum &amp; ejus Officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios tam spirituales quàm temporales Episcopatum proedictum habere, percipere, gubernare, gaudere &amp; disponere permittant.</hi> And howsoever, if the matter were to be disputed in the Schools, he peradventure might obtain the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who did defend, That <hi>Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical doth issue from the Keys, not from the Sword:</hi> Yet I doubt me, when the case cometh to be argued in the King's Court, he will have the advantage that hath the Sword on his side, and standeth to maintain the King's Prerogative. Again, by the Statute of 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> whereby <hi>Congedelires</hi> are taken away, he that hath the King's <hi>Letters Patents</hi> for a Bishoprick is put in the same state, as if he were Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically both Elected and Confirmed. Now, howsoever by the Law, a Bishop barely elected can do little or nothing: yet the Canonists do clearly resolve,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60492:126"/>
that he who is both Elected and Confirmed, may exercise all things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to Jurisdiction; although he may not meddle with matters of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <note place="margin">

All which I humbly submit unto your Graces grave consideration; protesting, notwithstanding, for mine own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that I will not only for the time to come cease to exercise the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction (of the proceeding further wherein, I see no great necessity before my Consecration) but also willingly herein submit my self unto any course that your Lordship shall be further pleased to prescribe unto me.</p>
                  <p>There is at this time in <hi>Dublin</hi> neither <hi>Civilian</hi> nor <hi>Register</hi> with whom I might advise touching the matter of the Dilapidation. My Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor offered to grant (if I pleased) a Commission out of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> for the inquiry hereof: But I considered with my self that this business was more proper for the Archiepiscopal Court; whereof I remembred that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous President of <hi>William Wickham</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester;</hi> who sued the Executors of his Predecessor in the Court of <hi>William Witlesey</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and recovered against him 127 <hi>afros,</hi> 1556 <hi>boves,</hi> 3876 <hi>mutones,</hi> 4717 <hi>oves matrices,</hi> 3521 <hi>agnos,</hi> &amp; 1662 <hi>libras cum</hi> 10 <hi>solidis, pro repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Aedificiorum ad ruinas vergentium:</hi> as in the Register of the said <hi>Witle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> is yet to be seen. I will cause Mr. <hi>Ford</hi> to draw up my Libel in the best manner he can; and then expect the issuing of the Commission with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient expedition: For it behoveth me that the inquiry of the Dilapidations be returned, before I go in hand with the reparation: and that I must do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shortly, though upon mine own charges, unless I will see the house fall quite down the next Winter.</p>
                  <p>I humbly thank your Grace for your remembrance of me in the matter <hi>Armagh.</hi> For howsoever I conceive very little hope that I shall ever enjoy that <hi>Deanry;</hi> yet am I nothing the less beholding unto you for your care of me: for which, and for all the rest of your honourable favours, I must always remain.</p>

                  <p>I Thank your Lordship for your care and respect of me, as likewise your counsel, that I should be well advised, ere I brought the matter of Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into publick Tryal. I truly have not cause to complain, but if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> or any other, think themselves wronged, that I give not way to the exercise of his Jurisdiction until he be Consecrated, and thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Justice, I shall be ready to shew reason, and yield account of my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well in the King's Courts, as in Theological Schools. For to pass the general words of his grant <hi>cum omnibus Jurisdictionibus,</hi> which grant him <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> but not <hi>in re:</hi> The Statute of 2 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. expresly forbiddeth all that shall be preferred, to take upon them, receive, use, exercise any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before he hath taken the corporal <hi>Oath of the King's Supremacy</hi> before such person as hath Authority to admit him to his Bishoprick. As for the <hi>Statute</hi> of Conferring and Consecrating Bishops within this Realm, I find not the words you have written, <hi>viz.</hi> That he which hath the King's <hi>Letters Patents</hi> for a Bishoprick, is put in the same state as if he were Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically elected and confirmed. But that his Majesties Collation shall be to the same effect, as if the <hi>Conge delire</hi> had been given, the election duly made, and the same election confirmed (for the Dean and Chapters election in <hi>England</hi> is not good, until the King have confirmed by his Royal assent) then it followeth in the <hi>Statute,</hi> upon that collation the person may be consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Afterward in the same Statute it is further enacted, That <hi>every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereafter conferred, invested, and consecrated,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall be obeyed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and do, and execute in every thing, and things touching the same, as any Bishop of this Realm, without offending of the Prerogatives Royal.</hi> Now by an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>à contrario sensu</hi> it appeareth that it is not I which stand against his Majesties Prerogative, but they which exercise Jurisdiction without the form prescribed in these Statutes: Confider again how impertinent the opinion of Canonists is in this case, where the King's collation is aequivalent to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Election, and Confirmation: The Confirmation which the Canonists speak of is from the <hi>Pope,</hi> not from the <hi>Prince. Gregoriana constitutione in Lugdunensi Consilio cautum est, Electum infra tres menses post consensum suum electioni proestitum, si nullum justum impedimentum obstat confirmationem à supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riore Proelato, petere debere, alioqui trimestri spatio elapso electionem esse peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus irritandam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the See of <hi>Armagh</hi> falleth void, the Dean and Chapter have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by the Canons to exercise Jurisdiction, which the Bishop elect hath not until he be consecrated, as you may read in <hi>Mason</hi>'s Book, and elsewhere, and so it is practised in <hi>England.</hi> Behold the cause which maketh the Dean capable, namely the Authority, Canons, and Custom of the Church: So is not the Bishop elect warranted, and standeth still in the quality of a simple Presbyter, until he be further advanced by the Church.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Jo. Forth</hi> shall bring his Libel I will do the part which belongeth to me. In the mean time I commend you to God, and rest</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>MY duty to your Lordship remembred. This Messenger so fitly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himself unto me, albeit it were the Sabbath Even, and I cast behind hand in my studies by absence from home, yet I could not but in a line or two salute your Lordship, and thereby signifie my continued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served remembrance of you, and hearty desire of your welfare. By this time I presume your Lordship in setled in your weighty charge of Over-sight, wherein I beseech the Lord in mercy to bless your Labours, and Endeavours, to the glory of his own Name, and the good of his Church, never more in our times oppugned and opposed by mighty and malitious Adversaries both at home and abroad: never in foreign Parts generally more distracted and distressed than at the present. Out of <hi>France</hi> daily news of Murthers and Massacres, Cities and Towns taken, and all sorts put to the Sword. Nor are those few that stand out yet, likely to hold long against the power of so great a Prince, having no succours from without.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Palatinate</hi> likewise all is reported to go to ruine. Nor do the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> sit, for ought I see, any surer, the rather for that the Coals that have here been heretofore kindled against them, about Transportation of Coin, and the Fine imposed for it, the Quarrels of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> the Command of the <hi>Narrow Seas,</hi> the Interrupting of the Trade into <hi>Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. are daily more and more blown upon, and fire beginneth to break out, which I pray God do not burn up both them and us too. I doubt not, worthy Sir, but you see as well, yea much better, I suppose, than my self, and many others, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able further to pierce into the state of the times, and the consequents of these things, what need the forlorn flock of Christ hath of hearts and hands to help to repair her ruines, and to fence that part of the Fold that as yet is not so openly broken in upon, against the Incursions of such ravenous Wolves, as having prevailed so freely against the other parts, will not in likelihood leave it also unassaulted: as also what need she hath, if ever, of Prayers and Tears (her ancient principal Armor) unto him, who hath the hearts and hands of all men in his hand, and whose help (our only hope, as things now stand,) is oft-times then most present, when all humane helps and hopes do fail. But these lamentable occurrents carry me further than I had purposed when I put Pen to Paper. I shall be right glad to hear of your Lordship's health and welfare, which the Lord vouchsafe to continue; gladder to see the remainder of your former learned, and laborious Work abroad. The Lord bless and protect you: And thus ready to do your Lordship any service I may in these parts, I rest</p>

                     <salute>My very good Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IF your Lordship hath forgotten my name, I shall account my self very unhappy therein, yet justly rewarded for my long silence; the cause whereof hath especially been my continual absence (almost for these last eight years) from my native Country: where now returning, and disposed to rest I would not omit the performance of this duty unto your Lordship, hoping that the renewing of my ancient respects will be entertained by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as I have seen an old Friend or Servant, who arriving suddenly, and unexpected, hath been better welcomed than if he had kept a set and frequent course of visiting and attendance.</p>
                  <p>With this representing of my service, I presume your Lordship will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that I recommend my especial kind friend Dr. <hi>Price</hi> (one of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Commissioners for that Kingdom,) and for his Learning, Wisdom, and other Merits (which your Lordship will find in him) truly deserving your Lordships good affection.</p>
                  <p>The most current news I can signifie to your Lordship from this place, are, That the Lord <hi>Vicomte Doncastré</hi> returneth (within three days) into <hi>France,</hi> (as 'tis thought) invited thereunto by that King, both at his coming from thence, and since by his Ambassadour resident here; which occasioneth some forward natures to presage of Peace very speedily in those Parts, between the King and his Protestant Subjects. Whereof, notwithstanding, (except want of moneys) the importunity of his old Councellors, at length, having been long slighted, the disunion of his Grandees, and desperate resolution of the afflicted Protestants to withstand these Enemies, shall beget an alteration, for my own part, I see little reason: for it is not likely, That either the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who hateth the Protestants, and loveth to fish in troubled Waters; or the Jesuit party (earnest votaries of the House of <hi>Austria)</hi> being still powerful in <hi>France,</hi> will ever suffer that King to be at rest, until their Patrons Affairs shall be settled in <hi>Grisons, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. From <hi>Italy</hi> I hear that in <hi>Rome</hi> there is lately erected a new Congregation <hi>De fide propaganda,</hi> consisting of 12 Cardinals, (whereof Cardinal <hi>Savelli</hi> is chief:) A principal Referendary thereof being <hi>Gaspar Schioppius:</hi> There are to be admitted into this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of all Nations, and their <hi>Opus</hi> is to provide maintenance from their Friends, &amp;c. for Proselites of all Nations, who shall retire into the Bosom of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church: But I fear I begin to be tedious to your Lordship, and therefore craving Pardon, as well for my present boldness as former omissions, with my ancient and most unfeigned Respects I take leave of your Lordship, desiring to know if in these parts I may be useful to your Lordship, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ever</p>

                  <p>THough I be always tied to reiterate my thankfulness to your Lordship, for your favours here in <hi>England,</hi> yet is it not fit to trouble you too often with Letters only of complement. And other occasion I have hitherto not had any, save what in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term last I wrote unto you touching the Monument of <hi>Bury</hi> Abby, which the Cutter going then in hand with came to me about, as directed so by your Lorship. I was bold to stay him for the time, and signified by those Letters that I thought much excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be taken to the credit of the Monument, for that both the ends of the upper Label pictured in the Glass, over the head of Antichrist, are stretched out so far, as they rest not in the Glass, but run on either way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stone Pillars, which, as your Lordship knows, could not possibly be so in the Window it self. How it cometh to pass I do not know, whether by the rashness of the Painter, (not heeding so light a matter as he might take it) or that perphaps those which in the picture seem to be the Pillars of the Window, were but painted Pillars in the Glass it self, and so the whole Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow but one Pannel. I cannot determine this doubt, but out of all doubt such a picture there was, and taken out exactly by a Painter then, as a right honest old Gentleman which saw it standing in the Abby Window, and the Painter that took it out, did often tell me about 40 years since; affirming the picture now at the Cutters to be the true pattern thereof. But at that time my understanding shewed me not to make this doubt; if I had, he perhaps could have resolved it. For my own part, though I think it fitter in this respect not to be published, as doth also Sir <hi>H. Bourgchier,</hi> yet I leave it to your direction, which the Cutter hitherto expecteth. So remembring my service most humbly to your Lordship, and desiring your blessing, I rest</p>

Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> hath purchased a House in <hi>Westminster,</hi> near the <hi>Parliament House,</hi> which he is now repairing, and there means to settle his Library by Feoffment to continue for the use of Posterity. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> is much decayed, <hi>Et senio planè confectus,</hi> in so much that I doubt his friends shall not enjoy him long. Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> is busie about the impression of his Glossary, and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> of his <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> which will be finished within three or four days; together with his Notes, and the Laws of the Conqueror; the comparing whereof with the Copy of <hi>Crowland,</hi> was the cause of this long stay; for they could not get the Book hither, though they had many promises, but were faign to send one to <hi>Crowland</hi> to compare things. We have not yet the Catalogue of <hi>Frankfort;</hi> nor any news but what you often hear. The reports of the Princes entertainment in <hi>Spain</hi> fills the Mouths and Ears of all men; and not so only, but also set the Printers a work. I should be very glad to know your Lordships resolution of coming into <hi>England,</hi> that I might accordingly send you either Books, or other news which we have here. If your Lordship would be pleased to send me your Copy of <hi>Dionysius Exiguus,</hi> I would willingly take some pains in the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him; for I doubt your own labours take you up so much, that you cannot attend him. I desire to be most kindly remembred to Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Christ-Church.</hi> I hear much murmurings among the Papists here, especially those of our County, against some new persecutions, (you know their Phrase) lately raised in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and particularly against some courses of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships in the Diocess of <hi>Meath;</hi> as namely in the case of Clandestine Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beyond all others of your rank. I should be larger, did I not doubt of my Letter's finding your Lordship there; but wheresoever God will dispose of us, let it be; I will ever approve myself</p>

                  <p>THe remembrance of our former love, doth embolden me to present these lines to your <hi>Lordship,</hi> which otherwise I would not presume to do. I wish your <hi>Lordship,</hi> in your great Place and Dignity, all happiness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60492:130"/>
still perswading my self, That your Place and Dignity doth not so alter you, but that you still do continue to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, no less than that Bishop of <hi>Durham, R. Angervile,</hi> was. I hope therefore it will not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ungrateful to write of things touching that argument. I am right sorry to hear of that heavy news which was reported unto me upon <hi>Monday</hi> last, of the taking of <hi>Heydelberg</hi> by <hi>Tilly,</hi> the Commander of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> It is a great grief that the place where the purity of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> hath so long been maintained, should now come into the hands of the Enemy. I take it (I have heard) that, out of fear it should be Besieged, care was taken that the Manuscripts were conveyed into the Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I wish it were so, if it be not. It should grieve me, if that famous Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too should come into their hands, who are so faithless in setting them out.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Lordship</hi> was partly acquainted with a business which I had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to answer one Chapter of <hi>Perron</hi>'s latest work, set out after his decease. Since that time <hi>Petrus Bertius,</hi> the Remonstrant, is turned <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and hath undertaken the Translation of that whole Book into <hi>Latin,</hi> and hath in Specimen set forth the Translation of that Chapter which I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to answer, as a principal motive of his Conversion to them, which he hath added to the Oration of the motives to his Conversion; I suppose you have seen the Book. Now having been lately chosen, upon my Lord of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> his promotion, to be Reader of the <hi>Margaret Lecture</hi> in our University, Lam advised by my good friends, and namely the Lords Bishops of <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Sarum,</hi> to read those Controversies mentioned in that Chapter. And upon more mature advice have resolved to set down positively the Fathers Doctrine, not barely by <hi>Thesis,</hi> but with their several proofs, and the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them from the Adversaries cavils. I will be bold to communicate with you, the special difficulties which I shall observe, if it be not trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some unto your Lordship. In the first Controversie touching the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, they except against the testimony produced by <hi>P. Martyr</hi> of <hi>Chrysostom ad Caesarium Monachum.</hi> I have heard your Lordship say, it is alledged by <hi>Leontius,</hi> but by what <hi>Leontius,</hi> and where, I remember not. I cannot find it in such Tractates of <hi>Leontius,</hi> as I find in <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum;</hi> I desire your Lordship in a word to certifie me. It seemeth <hi>P. Martyr</hi> read it in <hi>Latin,</hi> for otherwise it is probable he would have alledged the <hi>Greek</hi> Text, if originally he had it out of the <hi>Greek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I suppose your Lordship hath seen the third Tome of <hi>Spalatensis,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his VII. and IX. Book. I fear me he may do some harm with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise which he hath, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 11. touching the matter of <hi>Predestination,</hi> wherein he goeth about to shew, That both Opinions may be Tolerated, both that of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s, which makes <hi>Predestination</hi> to be <hi>gratuita;</hi> and that other, which maketh <hi>Predestination</hi> to be, <hi>Ex proevisis fide &amp; operibus.</hi> But chiefly he goeth about to invalidate St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Opinion. It will confirm the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi> in their Error; for he hath said more than any of them, but all in vain, for doubtless St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Opinion is the truth: and no doubt but it is special Grace which doth distinguish <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>Judas,</hi> and not <hi>solum liberum arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium.</hi> It is great pity the man was so carried away with Ambition and Avarice; otherwise I think he is not inferior to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies. I write this Letter upon my way, being at <hi>Sarum,</hi> where my Lord Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> doth salute you. I cannot now dilate further, but with my best service and wishes, commend your Lordship to the Highest Majesty, and so rest</p>

                     <salute>My very good Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Had purposed with my self long ere now to have seen your Honour in <hi>England;</hi> which was one reason, among others, why I did forbear to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you hitherto with any Letters. But seeing I think now it will fall out, that I shall remain here this Winter, I thought it my duty, both to tender my thankfulness unto your Lordship for all the honourable favours which I have received at your hands, and withal to acquaint you with a certain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular which partly doth concern my self, and in some sort also the state of the Church in this poor Nation. The day that my Lord of <hi>Falkland</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Sword, I preached at <hi>Christ-Church:</hi> and fitting my self to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion, took for my Text those words in the 13th. to the <hi>Romans; He beareth not the Sword in vain.</hi> There I shewed, 1. What was meant by this Sword. 2. The Subject wherein that power rested. 3. The matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was exercised. 4. Thereupon what it was to bear the Sword in vain. Whereupon falling upon the Duty of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> in seeing those Laws executed that were made for the furtherance of God's Service, I first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That no more was to be expected herein from the subordinate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate than he had received in Commission from the <hi>Supreme;</hi> in whose power it lay to limit the other at his pleasure. Secondly, I wished, That if his <hi>Majesty</hi> (who is, under God, our Supreme Governour) were pleased to extend his clemency toward his Subjects that were <hi>Recusants,</hi> some order notwithstanding might be taken with them, that they should not give us publick affronts, and take possession of our Churches before our Faces. And that it might appear, that it was not without cause that I made this motion, I instanced in two particulars that had lately fallen out in mine own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: The one certified unto me by Mr. <hi>John Ankers,</hi> Preacher of <hi>Athloane,</hi> (a man well known unto your Lordship) who wrote unto me, <hi>That going to read Prayers at</hi> Kilkenny <hi>in</hi> West-Meath, <hi>he found an old Priest (and about</hi> 40 <hi>with him) in the Church; who was so bold as to require him</hi> (the said <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) to depart, until he had done his business.</hi> The other concerning the <hi>Friars,</hi> who not content to possess the House of <hi>Multifernan</hi> alone (whence your Lordship had dislodged them) went about to make Collections for the re-edifying of another Abby near <hi>Molengarre,</hi> for the entertaining of another swarm of Locusts. These things I touched only in general, not mentioning any circumstances of Persons or Places. Thirdly, I did intreat, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever connivance were used unto others, the Laws might be strictly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against such as revolted from us, that we might at least-wise keep our own, and not suffer them without all fear to fall away from us. Lastly, I made a publick Protestation, That it was far from my mind to excite the <hi>Magistrate</hi> unto any violent courses against them, as one that naturally did abhor all cruel dealings, and wished that effusion of blood might be held ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Badge of the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> than of the <hi>Church of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These points, howsoever they were delivered by me with such limitations, as in moderate mens judgments might seem rather to intimate an allowance of a Toleration in respect of the general, than to exasperate the State unto any extraordinary severity: yet did the <hi>Popish Priests</hi> perswade their followers, that I had said, <hi>The Sword had rusted too long in the Sheath,</hi> whereas in my
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60492:131"/>
whole Sermon I never made mention either of <hi>Rust</hi> or <hi>Sheath:</hi> yea some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so did not stick to give out, That I did thereby closely tax your self for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too remiss in prosecuting of the <hi>Papists</hi> in the time of your Government. I have not such diffidence in your Lordships good opinion of me, neither will I wrong my self so much, as to spend time in refelling so lewd a calumniati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Only I thought good to mention these things unto your Lordship, that if any occasion should be offered hereafter to speak of them, you might be informed in the truth of matters: Wherein, if I have been too troublesome unto you, I humbly crave pardon, and rest</p>

                  <p>IN the exceptions taken by Recusants against your Sermon, I cannot be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected as <hi>Gallio</hi> was at the beating of <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> to care nothing for them. I am sensible of that which my Brethren suffer: And if my advice had been required, I should have counselled your Lordship to give lenitives of your own accord, for all which was conceived over harsh, or sharp; the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, whether an offence were given or taken, may add to the flame already kindled, and provoke further displeasure, it is not like to pacifie anger. But let your case be as good as <hi>Peter</hi>'s was, when the Brethren charged him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously for preaching to the uncircumcised, the great Apostle was content to give them a fair publick satisfaction, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. and it wrought good effects; for the Text saith, <hi>His auditis quieverunt &amp; glorificaverunt Deum:</hi> it brought peace to the Congregation, and glory to God.</p>
                  <p>My Noble <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> hath propounded a way of pacification, that your Lordship should here satisfie such of the <hi>Lords</hi> as would be present; wherein my poor endeavours shall not be wanting: howbeit (to say ingenuously as I think) that is not like to have success; for the Lord of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and your other friends trying their strengths in that kind at <hi>Trim,</hi> prevailed not; but can tell your Lordship what is expected. And if my wishes may take place, seeing so many men of Quality have something against you, tary not till they complain, but prevent it by a voluntary retractation, and milder inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the points offensive, and especially of drawing the Sword, of which spirit we are not, nor ought to be; for our Weapons are not Carnal, but Spiritual. Withal it will not be amiss in mine opinion for you Lordship to withdraw your self from those Parts, and to spend more time in your own Diocess; that such as will not hear your Doctrine, may be drawn to love and reverence your Lordship for your hospitality, and conversation. Bear
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60492:131"/>
with the Plaines of an Old mans Pen, and leave nothing undone to recover the Intercourse of Amitie between you and the People of your Charge. Were it but one that is alienated you would put on the Bowels of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Shepherd, you would seek him and support his Infirmities with your own Shoulders, how much more is it to be done, when so many are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be lost But they are generous and noble and many of them near unto you in Blood or Alliance, which will plead effectually, and conclude the matter fully whensoever you shew your self ready to give them Satisfaction. In the mean time, I will not fail to pray God for his Blessings unto the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and so do rest</p>

                  <p>I Cannot hope to send you any Portion of our <hi>London</hi> News, which common Fame will not bring sooner to you; I notwithstanding fail in my Duty, if I adventure not. The same day of your departure hence, the Houses of <hi>Parliament</hi> presented their <hi>Petition</hi> concerning <hi>Recusants</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> to which they received a large and very satisfactory Answer; and a Proclamation to that purpose is expected within a few days. On <hi>Saturday,</hi> the day following, the <hi>Spanish Ambassador</hi> (I mean the <hi>Marquess)</hi> desiring Audience, acquainted the <hi>King</hi> with a Practice of Treason; namely, That the <hi>Prince</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had conspired, That if they could not draw the <hi>King</hi> to their Desires this <hi>Parliament,</hi> by the Authority thereof they would confine him to some place of Pleasure, and transfer the Government to the <hi>Princes</hi> About this there is now much consultation, in what manner to proceed; <hi>(Salvo legatino jure)</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> (as you know his manner is) hath been very busie in ransacking his Papers for Presidents: Of this more hereafter. This day my <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi> makes his Answer; about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the next Week we shall know his Doom. Our good Friend D. <hi>Lyndsel</hi> was cut on <hi>Munday;</hi> and is yet (God be praised) well after it; there was a Stone taken out of his Bladder about the bigness of a Shilling, and rough on the one side. I am now collating of <hi>Bede</hi>'s <hi>Ecclestastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> with Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s <hi>Copy;</hi> wherein I find many Variations; I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with <hi>Commelyn</hi>'s Edition in Folio, which is that I have. All that I expect from your Lordship, is, to understand of the Receipt of my Letters, which if I know, I shall write the more confidently. I should also willingly

                  <p>IT hath pleased his Majesty now to direct this Letter to the <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> to admit you a <hi>Privy Counsellor</hi> of that Kingdom. I am ashamed it hath staid so long in my hands before it could be dispatch'd: But if it had come at the first to me, during the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi>'s being here, it had not staid three days; but gone on in the plain High-way, which is ever <hi>via sana.</hi> After the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> was pleased to put it into my Hands, at my first Access I moved his Majesty and shewed his Lordships Hand: But the King willed it should stay; and it became not me to press it further at that time: I know the Cause of the Stay was not any dislike of your Person, or Purpose not to grant it. But if the <hi>Duke</hi> had come home in any time, you should have been beholding to him for it. I pray your Lordship not to think it strange, that about the same time, his Majesty dispatch'd the Letter for Sir <hi>Edward Trevour</hi> to be a Counsellor: The Grant was gotten by my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> before his going, and by his Commandment I drew it. I do strive to give your Lordship a particular Accompt of this Business, and do pray your Lordship to endeavour to satisfie the <hi>Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,</hi> of whose Commands herein I was not negligent.

                  <p>THough I have little to say more than the remembrance of my love and best respects, I could not forbear to lay hold on the opportunity of this Bearer, our common friend, thereby to present them, as many ways most due from me to your Lordship. You have been so long expected here, that your Friends Letters have by that means, come more rarely to your hands. We have little News either of the great business, or any other, though Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers come Weekly out of <hi>Spain:</hi> And I conceive that Matters are yet very Doubtful. The new <hi>Chapel</hi> for the <hi>Infanta</hi> goes on in Building, and our <hi>London-Papists</hi> report, That the <hi>Angels</hi> descend every Night, and Build part of it. Here hath been lately a Conference between one <hi>Fisher</hi> a <hi>Jesuit,</hi> and one <hi>Sweete</hi> on the one side; and Dr. <hi>Whyte</hi> and Dr. <hi>Feately</hi> on the other: The Question was of the Antiquity and Succession of the Church: It is said that we shall have it Printed. All our Friends are in good Health, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sr. <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> Sr. <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and the rest, and Remember themselves most Affectionately to you. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> will send you a Copy of his <hi>Eadmerus</hi> with the first opportunity; which should have been done before this time, had not his expectation of you here, stayed his hand. <hi>Philip Cluverius</hi> is lately Dead at <hi>Leyden</hi> of a Consumption: Before his Death he was so happy as to finish his <hi>Italia,</hi> which they say is done with great diligence, and the Impression so forward that we shall have it this Autumnal Marte. My Lord <hi>Chichester</hi> is to go within a Fortnight to <hi>Colen,</hi> to the Treaty and Meeting there, appointed for the Restitution of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> But some think that the Armies now a-foot in <hi>Germany</hi> will much hinder it. <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> troubles the Emperor again in <hi>Austria.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Brunswick</hi> in <hi>Bohemia, Lusatia,</hi> and <hi>Silesia;</hi> and <hi>Manfeyld</hi> in other places. I believe I shall see your Lordship in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before I see you here. If your <hi>Answer to the Challenge</hi> be Printed, I hope I shall be beholding to you for a Copy. And thus wishing your Lordship as much happiness as to my self, I will ever remain</p>

                  <p>IT is now above a fortnight since I received your Graces direction for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting the Order, for settlement of the payment of Tithes in the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheated Counties: whereof some question was made at the <hi>Council Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> My Lord <hi>Docwra,</hi> and my self, the next day after we received your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, addressed our selves unto the <hi>Lord Deputy;</hi> and possessed him fully with the substance of the business: Within two hours after your Graces Letter was openly read at the Table: together with which I exhibited the Orders set down in your Triennial <hi>Visitation, Anno</hi> 1620. Whereupon my Lord Deputy very honourably moved, that the former Act of State might be renewed, and enlarged with the addition of such particulars as were in your Orders ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and there omitted. It was replyed, That the matter was of great importance, and much concerned the Country, and therefore it was not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60492:134"/>
suddenly to be resolved upon, until the advice of the Judges, and some other of the Bishops were had therein. In the mean time, for the preparing of matters, Mr. <hi>Vice-Treasurer,</hi> my <hi>Lord Chief Justice,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Jones,</hi> Sir <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> and my self, were appointed to meet in private, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of those particulars in your Graces Order, which were not formerly contained in the <hi>Act of State.</hi> The things questioned at that meeting, were,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Titles of Warrens, and Fish, of which they made doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ought to be paid or no.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of Tradesmen, Merchants, and Sellers of small Wares, under which Title, they said, all sellers of Ale, all manual Occupation, and day Labourers might be comprehended: yea, and the Servants of all the Trades also, as well as the Masters.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To the Title of Milk and Calves; they would have the words of Cheese and Butter added, to take a way all questions about them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That no Seed of Hemp and Flax should be paid, but such as are in the Bundle with the stalks of the Hemp and Flax, (as it was no otherwise, I told them, in the Order intended.)</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Of Mortuaries was the last and greatest Controversie; which being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heretofore (as was alledged) for praying for dead mens Souls, it was by some said, That it was against Law and Conscience to demand them now, when such praying is held to be unlawful. But generally the exception ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against the Order was, That the poor only did suffer therein; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was wished, that a certainty might be laid down for all Mortuaries.</p>
                  <p>This is the substance of all that passed at that meeting: since which, I have attended divers times, to see unto what issue these things might be brought at the Table. And to be sure that nothing should be done therein in my absence, I took with me your Graces Orders, and the Commissioners Animadversions upon them, and still detain them in mine own custody. At last, considering that it was your Graces pleasure, that my <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> should be made acquainted with this business, before it came to the <hi>Table,</hi> seeing, by reason of his absence, that could not then be done, I thought it not amiss yesterday to move my <hi>Lord Deputy,</hi> that things might be deferred until my <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi>'s coming hither: for now that my Lord <hi>Docwra</hi> is in <hi>England,</hi> I think we shall not find any like affected unto us in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as my <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> and <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> have always shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be. My continual expectation of the ending of this matter, hath occasioned the delay of my writing unto your Grace therein: now, as you shall be pleased to give me further direction, I will either proceed in the same, or forbear until we may have the benefit of my <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi>'s presence.</p>
                  <p>While I was writing of this, I received your Graces Letter brought by this Bearer: together with his complaint made against <hi>Heglye,</hi> and others, in the prosecution of that suit. I will, according to your direction, give order to my Official that these violent courses may be stayed, until the truth of things upon further examination may appear. I find more trouble with Mr. <hi>Heg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> in causes of this nature, than with all the Ministers in <hi>Meath</hi> beside: and in truth (my Lord) unless some course be taken for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining such unquiet spirits as these, our whole Clergy will <hi>pessime audire</hi> for their sakes. Yesterday I was fain my self to prefer a Petition to my <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> in the behalf of my Clergy, that no Indictments might be permitted to proceed against them at the Assizes for matters of this kind, but they might be referred to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Court,</hi> unto which the cognisance of the right of Tithes doth properly appertain. And I do discern at this time a kind of a general combination to be made for the disgrace and keeping down of our Ministers. What that particular is which your Grace doth mention in the beginning of your Letter, I do not yet understand, <hi>John Forth</hi> having
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60492:135"/>
not as yet sent any Letter unto me. But whatsoever it is, I will not fail (God willing) to be present at the Assizes in <hi>Trim;</hi> and both in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and in all other things, wherein your Grace shall be pleased to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy me, to follow your directions, as one who desireth always to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted</p>

                  <p>UPon <hi>Sunday</hi> last, as I was going to Bed, a Pacquet was brought unto me from my <hi>Lord Deputy,</hi> with the Advertisements of all that passed at <hi>White-Hall</hi> the 20th of <hi>July.</hi> But by good hap I received advice from my Lord <hi>Grandison</hi> five days before of the King's noble profession in a Speech used to his Judges, That as he had, so he would still maintain the <hi>Religion Established in the Church of England, and would never give way to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Only he wished the Judges to proceed in the execution of Laws with temperance, and fitting moderation.</p>

The Gospel is not supported with wilfulness, but by patience and obedience. And if your Lordship light upon petulant, and seditious Libels, too frequent now-a-days, as report goeth, I beseech you to repress them, and advise our Brethren to the like care.

                  <p>I Have now too long time forborn to write unto your Lordship, the cause whereof hath been, for that we have here lived in suspense our selves, of what would ensue of our Noble <hi>Prince</hi> his Journey into <hi>Spain;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durst I write you any thing for certain, because I was ever in fear of a contrary report before my Letter could come unto you; and as for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties they were not worth the writing. But now at the last, thanks be to our good God, we have our <hi>Prince</hi> again; he came to <hi>London</hi> on Monday Morning last, being the <hi>6th</hi> of this present, at Eight of the Clock in the Morning; it was my hap to be at <hi>Lambeth</hi> at that time with my Lord of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and whilst I was there, the <hi>Prince</hi> came to <hi>Lambeth</hi> Stairs, where his Grace received him and kissed his Hand; and from thence in his Graces Barge went to <hi>York-House,</hi> where he brake his Fast, and presently went away to <hi>Royston,</hi> where the King then was and is. News of his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Night at <hi>Guilford</hi> came to his Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> that Morning at Three of the Clock, and presently all <hi>London</hi> rang with Bells, and flamed with Bonfires, and resounded all over with such Shouts, as is not well possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to express. The day, without bidding, was kept festival by every Man; whereof, because I took such pleasure in seeing it, I conceive your Lordship will also take some pleasure in hearing the Relation.

As for my self, hanging otherwise in equal Ballance between the two Opinions, your <hi>divining Spirit</hi> is always obversant before mine eyes; and sways me to believe as I hope, that it will please God to dispose of our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's Affections for the greater benefit of his Church, and our State.</p>
                  <p>It hath happly ere this came to your Lordship's Ears, that I was not long since commanded to attend my Lord <hi>Chichester</hi> into <hi>Germany:</hi> after a while, that Negotiation was hung up upon the Nail, in expectance of the <hi>Princes</hi> return: and now we look to hear of a new Summons, but nothing is done as yet therein.

Moreover, what is befallen to the <hi>Prince</hi> himself and to the Duke, the same is befallen to all the rest of his Company, they all return more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd Protestants than ever; being thorowly perswaded <hi>ex evidentia facti,</hi> that <hi>Popery is Idolatry,</hi> if ever any were.</p>

                  <p>I Hope you will impute my long silence to your long expected and much wished repair hither, which you seemed in your last kind Letter to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend before this time: I trust that your Stay proceeds not from want of Health, but some other occasion, which I shall most gladly understand. We are here full of business, but all in Treaty, and so little concluded, that I know not what to deliver for Truth to my Friends. Here hath been a great Conventicle of Embassadors, which is now dissolved: <hi>Dieguo de Mendoza,</hi> who accompanied the Prince, is gone yesterday: <hi>Dieguo de Meshia,</hi> who came from <hi>Bruxells</hi> with a fair train of Nobles, Gentlemen, and Military Men, goes away on Tuesday next. Our late prodigious Events, as that of the fall of the House in <hi>Black-friers,</hi> being related in three several Pamphelts, the late dangerous Fire in <hi>London,</hi> with some others of that kind, cannot now be new to your Lordship. The latest which I must send you, is very sad and dolorous, being of the death of our late worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> whose Funeral we solemnized at <hi>Westminster</hi> on Wednesday last in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon with all due Solemnity: At which was present a great Assembly of all Conditions and Degrees; the Sermon was preached by <hi>Dr. Sutton,</hi> who made a true, grave, and modest Commemoration of his Life: As he was not factious in Religion, so neither was he wavering or inconstant, of which he gave good Testimony at his end; professing in the Exordium of his last Will and Testament, that he died, as he had lived, in the Faith, Communion, and Fellowship of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> His Library (I hope) will fall to my share, by an Agreement between his Executors and Me, which I much desire, partly to keep it entire, out of my Love to the Defunct. The original Copy of the second part of his <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> is in my hands,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60492:137"/>
which is intended to be shortly printed. Within a day or two Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> and my self intend to go into his Study, which is yet shut up, and there to take a view of his Papers, especially of such things as are left of his own writing. I desire to be remembred by your Lordship in your holy Prayers to God, to whose gracious Protection I commend you, and ever remain,</p>

                  <head>LETTER LXIII. <hi>A Letter from Dr.</hi> James <hi>to the Right Reverend</hi> James Usher, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Meath.</head>
                  <p>MY Duty in most humble manner remembred unto your Lordship. I am informed that your Lordship passed this way, not far from us to <hi>London,</hi> where you have remained for some few weeks: I should have been glad to have known of it sooner, or rather to have waited upon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship here in <hi>Oxford.</hi> I have traced the Steps a far off about <hi>the Succession and Visibility of the Church,</hi> wherein your Lordship hath gone a far Journey: I do but glean where you have reaped a plentiful Harvest. Nevertheless if my poor and weak Labours may any ways stead your Lordship, I would be glad to contribute my Pains. You ascend (as I perceive) as far as our St. <hi>Aug.</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and not unworthily: for if our Records be true, not only the <hi>Irish,</hi> (as you shew) but also our <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> continued averse and heretical (as they are called) to the whole World, almost till the time of S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> Many <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French</hi> were orthodox in the substantial Points of Religion long before <hi>Waldus</hi> (I mean <hi>P. Waldus,</hi> for there was another <hi>Waldus</hi> Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox some hundreds of years before <hi>P. Waldus</hi> in <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s time.) I have collected as much as I can find in all likely Authors to this purpose, as in the Catalogue of Writers and Witnesses of the truth of the last Age of <hi>Goulartius, Wolfius, Rhoanus, Balaeus de scriptoribus,</hi> out of the History of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> both by <hi>Lydius</hi> and <hi>Camerarius</hi> out of <hi>Lombard,</hi> Dr. <hi>Powel</hi> and others, printed; out of sundry Manuscripts, as <hi>Gascoigne, Canter, Mapes, P. de Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, Becket, Sarisburiensis,</hi> which have been diligently read over by a learned Kinsman of mine, who is at this present, by my direction, writing <hi>Becket</hi>'s Life: wherein it shall be plainly shewed, both out of his own Writings and those of his time, that he was not (as he is esteemed) an <hi>Arch-Saint,</hi> but an <hi>Arch-Rebel;</hi> and that the <hi>Papists</hi> have been not a little deceiv'd in him. This Kinsman of mine, as well as my self, shall be right glad to do any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to your Lordship in this kind. He is of strength, and well both able and learn'd to effectuate somewhat in this kind; critically seen both in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> knowing well the Languages both <hi>French, Spanish,</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> immense and beyond all other Men, especially in reading of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts of an extraordinary style in penning, such a one as I dare ballance with any Priest or Jesuit in the World of his Age, and such a one as I could wish your Lordship had about you: but <hi>paupertas inimica bona est moribus,</hi> and both fatherless and motherless, and almost (but for my self) I may say (the more is the pity) friendless. For my self, I am not so far gone in Years as in Sicknesses; yet my Body is not so weak, but my Mind is as strong,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60492:138"/>
and my Zeal great to see somewhat acted against the <hi>Papists</hi> in matters of <hi>Forgery</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> which are matters of Fact, whereto my Studies have always aim'd, and shall during Life (if God will.) I find infinite Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the <hi>Fathers</hi> Works, especially of the <hi>Roman</hi> Print: in the <hi>Canon Law</hi> and <hi>Decretals</hi> I can convince them of shameless Forgeries by the Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But that which hath amazed or amused the World, and made it turn, or continue <hi>Popish,</hi> hath been the want of Censurers of the <hi>Fathers</hi> Works, which made our <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> and some of our best learn'd, to lance the Fathers, and not to spare them, whereas they are but Pseudo-Fathers indeed. But the notedst cozenage which is rife, and most beguiling in these days, is a secret <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> and therefore the more dangerous; that is, the reprinting of Books, not making mention of any <hi>Castigation</hi> or <hi>Purgation</hi> of them, and yet both leaving and adding, and otherwise infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depraving them (as is to be seen in hundreds of Books of the middle-Age and later Writers) I instance in <hi>Sixtus Senensis,</hi> and <hi>Alphonsus de Castro,</hi> and <hi>Antoninus Summes.</hi> There are about five hundred bastard Treatises, and about a thousand places in the true Authors which are corrupted, that I have diligently noted, and will shortly vindicate them out of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, (for hitherto they be but the Conjectures of the Learned.) For this purpose I have gotten together the Flower of our young Divines, who volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily will joyn with me in the search: some fruits of their labours (if your Lordship desires) I will send up. And might I be but so happy as to have other twelve thus bestowed; four in transcribing Orthodox Writers (whereof we have plenty) that for the substantial Points have maintain'd our Religion, (40 or 50 <hi>l.</hi> would serve): four to compare old Prints with the new: four other to compare the Greek Translations by the <hi>Papists</hi> (as <hi>Vedelius</hi> hath done with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> wherein he hath been somewhat help'd by my Pains) I would not doubt but to drive the <hi>Papists</hi> out of all their starting-holes: But alas, my Lord, I have not Encouragement from our Bishops! Preferment I seek none at their hands, only 40 or 60 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for others, and their Lordships Letters to incourage others is that I seek, which being gained, the Cause is gained, notwithstanding their brags in their late Books. And thus, craving pardon, I rest in humble Service,</p>

                  <p>I Am glad my Lord hath a mind this way; I am told that he may perhaps have those fair Houses furnished for the speaking. <hi>Godstow</hi> of Sir <hi>Tho. Walters,</hi> which is not far from <hi>Oxford,</hi> by Land or by Water at pleasure; <hi>Water-Eaton</hi> of Sir <hi>Richard Lovelace,</hi> four miles distant, <hi>Waterstock</hi> of Sir <hi>Geo. Crooks</hi> six miles. I move not because I hear not from his Lordship, but if I may, both Dr. <hi>Bambridge</hi> and my self will do our best for the best in our Intentions, both for my Lord's Health, and the facilitating of his Lordship's Studies. Sir <hi>John Walter</hi> and Sir <hi>Geo. Crook</hi> may be spoken withal in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Concerning our beginning, and that with the Councels, taking <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus de Pontificibus,</hi> and the <hi>Epistles, Decretals</hi> together, I wish it here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, if we had my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Letters and Copies. <hi>Normannus</hi> certainly is no Anabaptist. <hi>Alph. de Castro</hi> is in the <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> as well as <hi>Cajetan,</hi> contrary to both our Expectations. Not only the peices, but the whole Tracts are at my Lord's command. That of <hi>Anselm, Plessis</hi> had not from me: Of that my Cousin is transcribing, I know that <hi>Asinus Burnelli</hi> of <hi>Nigellus Wiraker</hi> is long ago printed, now out of print; but he hath compared his Manuscript with two more and enlarged it, the print is not to be come by. <hi>Stampensis</hi> and <hi>Serlo,</hi> I think are no where extant. In my note D. I am not as yet assured to be that in <hi>Lambeth;</hi> the sight will shew that it is a MS. so ancient, that it was <hi>Theodorus</hi>'s, written almost in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Time: The Copy of the Concordance I send you, you need not keep a Copy of it, for I have the Original by me. <hi>Anentine</hi> of <hi>Ingolst.</hi> I have not seen, he is much corrupted, as all our Historians, two quire taken out of him, two out of <hi>Cuspinian,</hi> more than a quire out of <hi>Krantzius:</hi> If my Cousin come, I will perhaps send, I dare not venture them otherwise: Remember my Duty to my Lord, <hi>&amp; sic te Deo.</hi>

                  <p>I Receiv'd your last weeks Letter: The Collection out of <hi>Stella</hi> I have, but no <hi>Stella</hi> it self, and that I will not trust an ordinary Carrier with, the <hi>Lyon</hi>'s Addition and the <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> will satisfy your longing therein: some of the first places are amended according to the Prescript of that unholy <hi>Inquisition,</hi> but farther they proceed not: all the rest (and in one place a whole leaf or two) are to be expunged, but untouched in that of <hi>Lyons.</hi> We have fully finished the Collation of the <hi>Opus imperfectum,</hi> hereafter more of that matter, mean time I have taken pains for trial sake, to compare both our <hi>Basil</hi> and it with the Manuscript, for one Homily; I find wonderful need of a second review. I have sent you a Proof of some few Differences from both the printed Copies, whereby you may perceive, how this Book and sundry others have been tossed and tumbled by ignorant Men, what, and how great mistakes, and need of a diligent review, for this is but lapping. I do send you up also in thankfulness for Dr. <hi>Goad</hi>'s Project, a Fancy of mine, which I pray you to impart to the good Bishop; if he give any liking to it, let it go forward, if otherwise, let it be remanded, it is both fesible and possible in my judgment. If <hi>Cambridge</hi> will set up, or set forward the like, I dare undertake more good to be done for the profit of Learning and true Religion, than by building ten Colleges. I have of late given my self to the reading only of Manuscripts, and in them I find so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and so pregnant Testimonies either fully for our Religion, or against the <hi>Papists,</hi> that it is to be wondred at; Religion of <hi>Papists</hi> then, and now, do not agree. How many private Men out of their Devotion would singly be able to found such a College; much more jointly considered, but I leave all to God's Providence, it shall suffice, and be a great comfort to me if this cannot be effected, that by my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Letters, (which I have long'd for) we may have a <hi>quasi</hi> College, and the whole benefit of that which is expected in Dr. <hi>Goad</hi>'s refin'd Project. I my self, by my intreaty, have set twenty or thirty a-work; how may the Lord Archbishop command our Heads of Houses, and they their Company, or at least, one out of a College or Hall. I have or shall receive this week three quire of Paper of my Workmen, for which as they finish the quire, I lay out the Mony, 20 <hi>s.</hi> for each quire: of <hi>Gu. de S. Amore</hi> I have received one quire; and so of <hi>Wickleph</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is harder to read, and the other in English of <hi>Wicklephs,</hi> I look for this day. <hi>Platina</hi> is almost done, <hi>Alphonsus à Castro</hi> respited a while, and <hi>Cajetan</hi> likewise, till I hear from the Learned Bishop.</p>
                  <p>Touching <hi>Wicelius,</hi> I thank you for your Advertisment, I now perceive my Conjecture fails me not, that <hi>Cassander</hi> was much holpen by him, and his Judgment confirm'd by reading his; but if I read his <hi>Epistles,</hi> I will tell you my mind; howsoever in the interim, <hi>Wicelius</hi> is of more authority than <hi>Cassander,</hi> and his Books concealed purposely, or made away <hi>quantum in illis</hi> by the <hi>Inquisitors.</hi> I have ever been of Dr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s mind, touching the publishing those Books which they make away so fast, <hi>ut jugulent homines fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fisher de natura Dei,</hi> is in one of their <hi>Indices</hi> impudently denied to be his; tho some one in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> say nay. Upon the fifth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> is but a scantling to those great Volumes which I have ready: if any Man please to come hither, he may see the whole,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:60492:140"/>
My Lord of <hi>Meath</hi>'s return and earnestness for the Plot, both before and since, as also Dr. <hi>Goad</hi>'s forwardness to print ought hereabout (I pray God the News be not too good to be true) glads me much; as the Sickness of my Lord of <hi>Ely</hi> doth some no less.</p>
                  <p>It were not from the purpose, if Dr. <hi>Sutcliff</hi> do see this whole Project of our College and Purpose; and if he did turn away his mind wholly from <hi>Chelsey,</hi> I durst presume of more fasibility and possibility here of doing good.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for the Catalogue, it is a great and painful Work, but hath well requited my Pains, in that I find some Books that I have long sought after, and could not find, as <hi>Stella</hi> of the <hi>Popes,</hi> and such like. If any thing be printed, I would print only those that are not mentioned in our present Catalogue. But where is the Encouragement for the printing or doing any thing</p>
                  <p>If our <hi>Genevians</hi> had sent us over that of <hi>Gregory</hi> at this Mart, how sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable had it been to have put an egde to our great Business: I am sorry it came not, but see no remedy. What of the <hi>Enchiridion!</hi> nothing; my Judgment you have, and it is free to alter, that do nothing at pleasure, but sure I am some things are past question: lay aside and expunge all doubtful Treatises, till our College take them in hand, which shall rivet them in after another fashion, if God give Life.</p>
                  <p>I have now at length recovered the <hi>Spanish</hi> Book of Mr. <hi>Boswell:</hi> the Book is a Commentary upon our <hi>English</hi> Laws and Proclamations against Priests and Jesuits, spightful and foolish enough, but especially about the <hi>Powder-Treason,</hi> laying it to <hi>Puritans,</hi> as <hi>Cobham, Gray,</hi> and <hi>Rawley;</hi> or to the whole State, or a Policy to intrap Them and their Estates. I would my Lord of <hi>Meath</hi> did understand the Tongue, that from him the King might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Mystery of Iniquity contained in the Book: No Place, or Time when, or where it was printed. Was he asham'd of that he did and it seemeth it, or the like like hath been divulged in many Languages. But I end, and pray God, That the Clergy give us not a fair denial, that is, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to our Businesses at this Session. Let my Lord prevent as wisely and timely as he can. God have you and all yours in his safe keeping, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my Service in dutiful manner to my Lord, and Commendations to my Cousin, with whom (if I had had the Spirit of Prophecy) Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> should not have coaped withal, but God send the Truth to take place; if the President be faulty, to be punished; if innocent, to be delivered: And so once again I bid you heartily farewel.</p>

                     <salute>My very good Lord;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YEsterday, being the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> I received this inclosed Letter: In reading whereof, it presently came into my mind, that this was the Man at whose Sermon his Majesty was so much offended, when I was last at <hi>Court.</hi> Whereupon I sent for the party, and upon Conference had with him, found indeed that I was not deceived in mine Opinion. I put him in mind, that his Conceits were contrary to the Judgment of the Church of Christ from the beginning of the Gospel unto this day: and that of old they were condemned for heretical in the <hi>Nazarites.</hi> But finding that for the present he was not to be wrought upon by any reasoning, and that <hi>long a dies</hi> was the only means to cure him of this Sickness; I remembred what course I had heretofore held with another in this Country, who was so far ingaged in this Opinion of the calling of the Jews (tho not of the revoking of Judaism) that he was strongly perswaded, he himself should be the Man that should effect this great Work, and to this purpose wrote an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Epistle (which I have still in my hands) directed to the dispersed <hi>Jews.</hi> To reason the matter with him I found it bootless; I advised him therefore, that until the <hi>Jews</hi> did gather themselves together, and make choice of him for their Captain, he should labour to benefit his Country-men at home with that Skill he had attained unto in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue. I wished him therefore to give us an exact Translation of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verity, which he accordingly undertook and performed. (The Translation I have still by me): but before he had finished that Task, his Conceit of <hi>the calling of the Jews,</hi> and his <hi>Captainship</hi> over them, vanished clean away, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of after. In like manner I dealt with Mr. <hi>Whitehall;</hi> that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he himself acknowledged that the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Rites were not to be practised unto the general calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he might do well, I said, to let that matter rest till then; and in the mean time keep his Opinion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and not bring needless Trouble upon himself and others by divulging it out of season. And whereas he had intended to write an historical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the retaining of <hi>Judaism</hi> under <hi>Christianity:</hi> I counselled him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to spend his pains in setting down the History of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or <hi>Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints,</hi> or some of the other Points in controversy betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Us. So far I prevailed with him herein, that he intreated me to become a Suitor unto your Lordship in his behalf, that the loss of his Living, and those other Troubles which he hath already sustained, might be accepted for a sufficient Punishment of his former Offence; and that he might have the Favour to be restored only unto his Fellowship in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he would bind himself to forbare intermedling any way with his former Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either in publick or in private, and spend his time in any other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that should be imposed upon him.</p>
                  <p>How far it will be fitting to give way unto this motion, I wholly leave unto your own grave Consideration. Thus much only I have presumed to propound unto your Lordship, in discharge of my Promise made unto Mr. <hi>Whitehall,</hi> with whom I could have no long Communication, by reason
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60492:141"/>
I way presently to begin my Journey for the visitation of the Diocess of <hi>Meath.</hi> Until my return from thence, I have stayed the printing of the rest of mine <hi>Answer unto the Jesuits Challenge;</hi> the former part whereof I humbly make bold to present unto your Lordship's view, as unto whom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, I most desire my simple Labours in this kind may be approved.

                  <p>MY Duty remembred unto your Lordship. I am much beholden to your Lordship for your last Book, which I received before the <hi>Act</hi> by my good Friend Mr. <hi>Calendrine;</hi> I have punctually perused it, and do render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Lordship both common and private thanks for the same, and expect your Lordship's of <hi>the Britains ancient Religion:</hi> wherein as I see no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so I would be glad to assist with my Pains if any thing were worthy: yet of my Cousin Mr. <hi>Rich. Jame</hi>'s (who remembreth himself most dutifully to your Lordship) I send a Taste, or Essay; of what may be done by him. I will say no more of him or it, but this; That I know no Man living more fit to be imployed by your Lordship in this kind than himself; his Pains incredible, and his Zeal as great, and his Judgment in Manuscripts such, as I doubt not but your Lordship may use to the great benefit of the Church, and ease of your Lordship; may there be but some course taken that he may have <hi>victum &amp; vestitum</hi> independant from any one. This if he may have from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or by your Lordships means, I know his Deserts and Willingness to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve well of the Church.</p>
                  <p>For my own Business, I know not what to say, whether to go onward, or to stay. <hi>Guil. de s. Amore</hi> is transcribed, and wants but the three Books from your Lordship, whereof Mr. <hi>Calendrine</hi> hath given me good hopes. <hi>Wickleph de Veritate</hi> is the better part done; I have hitherto laid out the Money, but my Purse will hold out no longer to defray the Charges: If it would be so, that I may receive the Money to recompence their pains, I would not doubt before the next Session, but to have most of <hi>Wickleph</hi>'s Works transcribed; but I fail in the burden, and refer all to God's Providence and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Direction, being not idle in these Businesses. And so in haste, with my own and my Cousin's Duty to you, I end, and rest,</p>

                  <head>LETTER LXIX. <hi>A Letter from</hi> Thomas Davies <hi>to the Right Reverend</hi> James Usher <hi>Bishop of</hi> Meath.</head>

                  <p>MAY it please your <hi>Lordship</hi> to take notice, that your Letter of the 24th of <hi>January</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> came to my hands the 14th of <hi>July,</hi> unto which I have given due perusal; and perceiving your Lordship's pleasure thereby, omitted no opportunity, neither any time, but the very day that I received it, began to lay out for those Books you writ for. The five Books of <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Character, I have found by a meer accident, with the rest of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> joyned with them; but the mischief is, there wants two or three leaves of the beginning of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and as many in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> which notwithstanding I purpose to send by this Ship, lest I meet not with another; yet <hi>I</hi> have sent to <hi>Damascus,</hi> and if not there to be had, to Mount <hi>Gerazim,</hi> so that in time I hope to procure another, which shall contain the five Books of <hi>Moses</hi> perfectly. I sent a Messenger on purpose to Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> and <hi>Tripoly,</hi> for the <hi>Old Testament</hi> in the Syriack Tongue, but he returned without it, and brought word that there I might have one after two months, but could not have it time enough to send by this Ship. The reason why they sent it not, was, that they wanted Parchment to copy one of the Books, and so not being perfect, did not send it; which by the next Ship, if your Lordship please, God willing, I will send you. But I pray understand, that by the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tongue they mean here the <hi>Caldean;</hi> And every Man tells me it is all one, the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Caldeans</hi> being one and the same People, but questionless the same Language; Therefore if your Lordship mean, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to have the <hi>Old Testament</hi> in <hi>Caldean,</hi> I beseech you to write me by the first over Land, that I may provide it by the next Ship. Also I beseech you to take knowledge that I dare not promise you to send it according to the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> for neither my self, nor any other Man here, can determine it; only I must be forc'd to take his word that sells it me, who is a Minister of the Sect of the <hi>Marranites,</hi> and by birth a <hi>Caldean,</hi> but no Scholar, neither is there any to be found in these parts; but if your Lordship will have me send it at adventures, though it cost dear (as it will cost 10 <hi>l.)</hi> I will do my best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to send it by the first Conveyance, but shall do nothing herein, until such time I have further order from your Lordship; to effect business of this nature in these parts requires time, Travel being very tedious in these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. I have inquired of divers, both <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> of the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jordan,</hi> but can learn no certainty. Some say it never rises but after great Rain; but I met with a learned <hi>Jew,</hi> (at least so reputed) who told me that <hi>Jordan</hi> begins to flow the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> and continues flowing 29 days, and is some 18 or 20 days increasing: but I dare not believe him, his Relation not agreeing with the Text; for Harvest is near ended with them by that time; and unless you will understand by Harvest, the time of gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grapes, it cannot agree. I have also sent to <hi>Damascus</hi> concerning this, and trust ere long to satisfy your Lordship in this Particular, and in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar</hi> of the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> A <hi>French Frier,</hi> who lived at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> told me that it never overflowed except occasiond by Rain: whereupon I shewed him the words in <hi>Joshua</hi> 3. 15. that <hi>Jordan overfloweth his Banks at the time of Harvest:</hi> which words are written with a Parenthesis, and therefore said he, are no part of the Text, which I know is his ignorance; I could
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60492:142"/>
have shewed him, the thing plainly proved by that which he holds Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 24. 26. If <hi>I</hi> have done your Lordship any Service herein, <hi>I</hi> shall greatly rejoyce, and shall ever be ready and willing to do the best Service <hi>I</hi> can to further the Manifestation of God's Truth; yea <hi>I</hi> should think my self happy that <hi>I</hi> were able to bring a little Goats Hair, or a few Badgers Skins, to the building of God's Tabernacle. <hi>I</hi> acknowledg your Lordship's Favour towards me, who have not, neither could deserve at your hands the least Kindness conceivable; yet the Graciousness of your sweet Disposition, emboldens me to entreat the continuance of the same, and also the benefit of your faithful Prayers; so shall I pass the better amongst these Infidel Enemies to God and his Christ. And so I pray God to encrease and multiply his Favours and Graces both upon your Soul and Body, making you happy in what ever you possess here, and hereafter to grant you Glory with Christ; into whose hands I recommend your Lordship, and humbly take leave, ever resting,</p>

                  <p>I Was not unmindful, according to my Promise, to send to Dr. <hi>Crakenthorp</hi> for <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> immediatly after I was with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: But he attending the Visitations at <hi>Colchester</hi> and <hi>Maldon,</hi> came not home till yesterday. At which time, sending my Man for the Books, the Doctor returned Answer, That your Lordship shall command any Books he hath whensoever you please. That he had not <hi>Diodorus Siculus;</hi> but he sent me <hi>Polybius,</hi> and <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> which he says Dr. <hi>Barkham</hi> told him you desired to borrow. These two Books your Lordship shall now receive; and if it fall out that you be already provided of <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> then it may please you to let that come back again, because the Doctor tells me that after a while he shall have occasion to see some things for his use in <hi>Sigebert</hi> and other Writers, which are bound in this Volume with <hi>Marianus;</hi> but by all means he desires your turn should be served however. I shall be most ready to afford your Lordship any Service that lieth in my power, during your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad in these parts, holding my self in common with the Church of God, much bound to you for your great and weighty Labours, both formerly and presently undertaken in the Cause of our Religion.

                  <p>MY bounden Duty remembred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> News here is not any worthy your knowledg; the great Rebel <hi>Abassa</hi> still troubles the State, and hinders the going forward of the Army against the <hi>Persian.</hi> Some few days time News came that the <hi>Vizier</hi> had given Battel to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and that the Rebel had cut off 12000 <hi>Janisaries;</hi> yet they report the <hi>Vizier</hi> to have the best of the day, which most Men judg to be but report: certainly it is that <hi>Abassa</hi> will give them great trouble, pretending only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon the <hi>Janisaries</hi> for the Blood of his Master <hi>Sultan Osman.</hi> The greatest Villanies that ever were practised or intended, never wanted their Pretences. Yet it is thought by many that this Man hath done nothing without leave from the Port, otherways it is strange they had not cut him off long since; for what can be his Forces against the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Powers The <hi>Janisaries</hi> refuse to go to War before the Rebel be cut off, or Peace made with him: whereby you may observe what Power the King hath over his Souldiers; the truth is, they command and rule all, oppressing and eating up the Poor. When I consider the Estate of the Christians in these Parts, yea the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> themselves that are not Souldiers, then must I say, happy, yea thrice happy are the Subjects of the King of <hi>England,</hi> who live in peace, and enjoy the Fruits of their own Labours, and yet have another and a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Blessing, the free passage of the Gospel. I pray God we may see and be thankful for so great Favours, expressing it by Obedience to God, and Honour to our King.</p>
                  <p>Thus fearing that I have troubled your Lordship with a slender Discourse, humbly take my leave, beseeching the Lord of Lords, to multiply his Graces upon you, recommending you, with all yours, to God's Grace and Mercy, rest,</p>

                  <p>I Received your <hi>Lordship</hi>'s Letter, for which I return many thanks. My Journy into <hi>Ireland</hi> is of such necessity, that I cannot defer it long; though I have many motives, besides those mentioned by your <hi>Lordship,</hi> to urge my stay. As for the Books which you mention, I find <hi>Jordanus in vitas Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum</hi> in the Catalogue of the Publick Library at <hi>Oxford;</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> told me he never heard of the Author; if any Library about <hi>London</hi> have it, or that other Work of his, I will endeavour to discover them. As for the new Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sealiger de Emendat. Temporum;</hi> as many as I speak withal are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it is so far from coming out, that it is not yet come in to the Press. Here are already come two Dry-fats of <hi>Mart</hi> Books, and they expect but one more; you may perceive by the Catalogue what they are. Here will be very shortly some good Libraries to be had; as Dr. <hi>Dee</hi>'s, which hath been long litigious, and by that means unsold. One <hi>Oliver,</hi> a Physician of St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundsbury,</hi> of whose writing I have seen some Mathematical Tracts printed; and Dr. <hi>Crakanthorp</hi> are lately dead. If there be any extraordinary Books which your Lordship affects, if you will be pleased to send a note of them, they shall be bought. Such News as we have, you receive so frequently, as coming from me they would be stale, which you know destroys their very Essence. We have had Bonfires, Ringing, Shouting, and also Ballads, and base <hi>Epithalamiums</hi> for the conclusion of the <hi>French Marriage,</hi> and yet I am but <hi>modicae fidei.</hi> Our Country-man <hi>Florence,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carthye</hi> was committed to the <hi>Tower</hi> some five days since.

                  <p>I Received your Lordship's Letter, which was must wellcome to me, and much more the News of your Recovery, which was deliver'd to me by Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and by me to some others of your Friends, who were no less glad than my self. I am afraid that you converse too much with your Books; I need not tell you the danger of a Relapse. This News which I sent your Lordship deserved not Thanks, because vulgar and trivial: that of the Death of <hi>Erpenius</hi> is but too true, and is much lamented by learned Men in all places, for the cause by your Lordship truly expressed; he died of the <hi>Plague.</hi> Mr. <hi>Briggs</hi> was gone from <hi>London</hi> some three days before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of your Lordship's Letter. But I will write to him, that which I should have delivered by word of Mouth, if he had tarried here.</p>
                  <p>In the collating of Books your Lordship hath made a good choice, that being a fit study in time of Sickness, as not so much imploying the Mind as other Studies. As for <hi>Bede I</hi> doubt the Collation of him will be scarce worth your labour: For as far as <hi>I</hi> went, they seemed rather to be <hi>variantes lectiones,</hi> than material Differences, a very few excepted. To make use of my Collations, your Lordship shall not want the <hi>Heydelburg</hi> Edition, which <hi>I</hi> will take care to have sent unto you.</p>
                  <p>I have been this Morning with Mr. <hi>Patrick Young,</hi> who cannot give me satisfaction concerning those Books till he have been in the <hi>Princes</hi> Library. For the nameless <hi>Annal,</hi> I conceive that your <hi>Amanuensis</hi> mistook your meaning; for where you say that it begins at the year of our Lord 744, and ends in the year 1100, I cannot see how <hi>Asserius Menevensis</hi> could be the Author of most of it: Mr. <hi>Young</hi> will make search for it, and return an Answer as soon as conveniently he may. As for <hi>Asserius de rebus gestis Alfredi,</hi> he tells me that they have only a Transcript of it; but Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> hath an ancient Copy; the same he tells me of <hi>Florentius Wigorniensis,</hi> and <hi>Simeon Dunelmensis.</hi> Of <hi>Eusebius Chronicle</hi> they have three or four Copies; and if you please shall have all of them, or which you please. Sir <hi>Rob. Cotton</hi> doth daily augment his store; he hath gotten lately a Book of St. <hi>Edm. Bury.</hi>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:60492:144"/>
By the next return I hope to send the Books which you desire, and perhaps to play the Carrier my self. There is a rumor of the Adjournment of the Parliament till <hi>April,</hi> but no Proclamation yet come forth. There is a new Secretary, Sir <hi>Albertus Morton,</hi> to be sworn in the place of Sir <hi>Geo. Calvert.</hi> I have not heard any thing out of <hi>Ireland</hi> since my last to your Lordship. Mr. <hi>Young</hi> tells me that he received lately a Letter from <hi>Paris</hi> from one <hi>Lucas Holstenius,</hi> a young Man whom I mention'd sometime to your Lordship, being acquainted with him here in <hi>London</hi> the last year: he writes to him that a Jesuit there doth publish a new Edition of <hi>Eusebius</hi> in Greek and Latin; for the furtherance of which Work, Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Young</hi> sends thither their Notes and Observations upon him. <hi>Petavius</hi> is busy about his work <hi>de Emendat. Temp.</hi> which will shortly come abroad. <hi>Holstenius</hi> is print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Scylax, Artemidorus Ephesius;</hi> with divers other old <hi>Geographers,</hi> some of which were heretofore publish'd by <hi>D. Haeschelius;</hi> and some till now never publish'd. I doubt not but <hi>D. Ryves</hi> hath sent your <hi>Lordship</hi> his Answer to the <hi>Analecta.</hi> I have read him over, and approve the Work, but not in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular; as where he makes <hi>Sedulius</hi> among others, (pag. 46. <hi>lib.</hi> 2.) to be one of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s forerunners in the plantation of Christian Religion in <hi>Ireland.</hi> I do not see how that can be; The best Authors making him contemporary, if not later than St. <hi>Patrick.</hi> Some other passages I could cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, both of ancient and modern times; but I will spare that labour till our meeting. In the mean time with the remembrance of my Love and Service to your Lordship and Mrs. <hi>Usher,</hi> and my heartiest Wishes and Prayers for your Health, I will remain</p>

                  <p>AFter my Duty in humble manner premised; I hope, and am right glad to hear of your Lordship's Recovery. I have received from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship two Books, whereby I have not been a little benefited; yet of <hi>Boston</hi> I hear there is a greater Catalogue extant. I forbore to write all this while, for fear of trouble. I have laboured ever since in the common business, as your Lordship shall perceive by an humble Supplication printed, which your Lordship shall receive by Mr. <hi>Calandrine,</hi> which could I have had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that it might have passed your learned Censure, would have been much more perfect, but, <hi>ut quimus aut quando, non ut volumus.</hi> I have done it as advisedly as I could, and doubt not to give every Man good satisfaction in good time. If our Friends of <hi>Cambridge</hi> will joyn with us, the Work may be well atchieved within half the time, they taking half the Points menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and they both sending to us their Observations to be revised by us; we ours to them to be revised by them, that it may be the work jointly of both Universities. My Zeal and Knowledg cannot match Dr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s, yet I will endeavour to do my best. I de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60492:145"/>
transcribing <hi>Guil. de S. Amore,</hi> not that which your Lorship sent, but another greater and fuller Work, that is done, and a great deal besides: More had been, if we had not been compell'd, for want of Mony to have surceased; and my poor Means would not serve to supply Wants, and I am indebted for that which is done. Your Lordship by Letter (if I mistake not) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took for my Lord of <hi>Ely</hi>'s 20 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> had all promised been paid, I had had 20 or 30 quire in readiness; that which I have shall be fitted against the Parliament, in the exactest manner that it can be done for the Press. I have in the Press at the present these things, <hi>A Confutation of Papists out of Papists,</hi> in the most material Articles of our Religion; whose Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies are taken either out of the <hi>Indices Expurgatorii,</hi> or out of the ancient Books, especially the Manuscripts. <hi>An Index librorum prohibitorum 1ae, 2ae, vel 3ae Classis, vel expurgatorum quovismodo;</hi> chiefly for the use of our publick Library, that we may know what Books, and what Editions to buy; their prohibition being a good direction to guide us therein; I have cast them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an exact Alphabet. My Cousin <hi>Rich. James</hi> desireth to have his Duty remembred to your Lordship, he hath reviewed and inlarged his Book of <hi>Bochel's Decanonization,</hi> a Book so nearly concerning Kingly Dignity, and so fully opening the History of those Times, that I know not where a Man shall read the like: I would he might have the happiness that your Lordship might see it, being now fair transcribed, that it might pass your Lordship's Censure before it pass any further. And I am perswaded (over-weaning perhaps in love to my Cousin) that if his Majesty saw it, it would please him, having so many good pieces of Antiquity in it: it is his, and shall be my chiefest Study. I have here found upon search thereof, <hi>Petrus Minorita's Homil.</hi> upon <hi>Matthew,</hi> and two Books of St. <hi>Augustins</hi> coming here into <hi>England,</hi> which are of good note: but I make no doubt your Lordship hath seen them already; I leave therefore to trouble your Lordship any further, being right glad to hear of your Lordship's Preferment (as I am informed) for the good of the Church; and so I rest,</p>

                  <p>I Am incouraged by your Lordship's Letters to go on chearfully in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended course and discovery, <hi>solus aut quomodo</hi> what is one Man able to resist, when so many oppose so falsly and so impudently I have written to his Grace by his Chaplains for helps necessary for the forwarding so great a Work, as <hi>the Visibility and perpetual Succession of the Church.</hi> There shall come nothing forth till I have viewed by my self, or others, under a publick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries hands, all the Testimonies that do result out of the Manuscripts and printed Books of <hi>Papists:</hi> But what can I poor weak Man do, unless my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> command Help, and command Books and all things
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60492:145"/>
necessary to so great and requisite a Work which being well done, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to close up the Mouths of our deceived <hi>Papists.</hi> This Question (if I conceive aright) is set afoot politickly by our Adversaries the <hi>Papists,</hi> by especial Advice from <hi>Rome:</hi> for it is plausible amongst the People and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar sort, and impossible to be answered by every one; but be it as it may, I have willingly offered to answer one <hi>Smith,</hi> a <hi>Lincolnshire-Man,</hi> who insults upon us in the close of his Book in these words; <hi>And if now they endeavour to answer them,</hi> [his Reasons] <hi>it will yet more appear that they can no way answer them, and that this kind of dealing with Protestants</hi> [in matters of Fact] <hi>out of their own Confessions is the fittest to stop all Mouths.</hi> Upon occasion of these words, I will make bold to write somewhat concerning this matter, both to divert our <hi>Papists</hi> to other matters of Fact, wherein they have hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the Question about the Controversie of their <hi>Bibles</hi> (I mean of <hi>Sixtus</hi> and <hi>Clemens)</hi> impossible to be answered. I have heard their best Reasons about the number of the bastard Treatises, which, as false Writers, have put them into Possession of their false Religion, which amount unto five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, reckoning none but such as are both condemned by some, and urged by others as learned <hi>Papists;</hi> touching the corrupting of all Authors, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in all Ages, both in their several <hi>Indices Expurgatorii,</hi> and without, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of their <hi>Decretals</hi> and <hi>Gratian,</hi> wherein the Soul and Life of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> consists. For the <hi>Decretals,</hi> I have lighted upon a Manuscript, that, I trust, to a clear eye, will make the matter indubious, and by the sight of this Manuscript (which contains them not at large) there are such Absurdities contain'd in them, as I shame either in modesty (as of Mice Turds in the <hi>Eucharist)</hi> or in Grammar <hi>(Epscopi si in fide erraverit)</hi> are to be quitted; but for all other matters whatsoever they are, <hi>portandi,</hi> a good Resolution set down in a good Phrase. For the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> I mean <hi>Gratian,</hi> I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it from top to tae, not without special Contentment to all Lovers of the Truth. For by the Edition of the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> so carefully set out by <hi>Greg.</hi> 13. <hi>Faber</hi> and <hi>Contius,</hi> and I know not who must be imployed to that great business, more care had of the printing of that than of the <hi>Bible;</hi> it must be testified that the Edition doth agree exactly with the <hi>Roman</hi> Copy, or else it of no worth; they had the use of many <hi>Vatican</hi> Copies. Now either this is untrue, or their Copies are of no Credit: For none of our Copies, of as great Antiquity as theirs, either have <hi>Constantine's Donation,</hi> or the proof of it out of <hi>Gelasius Dist.</hi> If <hi>Gesta SS. Martyrum S. Sylvestri,</hi> this is proving of a thing that is <hi>ignotum</hi> by <hi>ignolius;</hi> for both are wanting in all our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, that are of as great Antiquity as theirs, as long since <hi>Antoninus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Lawyers have observed. Generally in the Edition of the <hi>Canon Law</hi> they have deceived us thus. 1. Those which are <hi>Palea,</hi> noted by them, are indeed <hi>Palea,</hi> that is <hi>Chaff,</hi> in our old Copies. But besides, 2. There are a number of good Consequences that are <hi>Paleae,</hi> which they have passed over in silence, whereof our Manuscripts give good witness. There are also a third sort which they have made <hi>Paleae,</hi> to discredit them which are no <hi>Paleae,</hi> as in the <hi>8th Distinction</hi> touching Obedience to Princes Commandments for Religion, this is in all our Manuscripts but censured and sentenced by them Lord! What a world of Corruptions is contained in that Volume, I mean not only of <hi>Gratians,</hi> that is bad enough, but of their Additions to, and Perversions of <hi>Gratian's.</hi> I mean to spend this next week wholly upon this Argument of <hi>Popish Fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ds,</hi> and to send up my abortive Labours to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your Lordship's grave Judgment. I deal in matters of Fact, and have little help God knoweth: <hi>I</hi> will empty my self to your Lordship. For <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> God knows, if I had compared it, one of the first Books, and both that and <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> yea and <hi>Bedes</hi> History must be compared, or vain will be our Labour in writing of the <hi>Visibility of the Church,</hi> when we shall rely upon such sandy Proofs. It is too true that <hi>Possevin</hi>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:60492:146"/>
observeth, that there are whole Pages thrust into <hi>Marianus</hi>'s Works; he saith by <hi>Hereticks:</hi> he lieth like a Varlet; the <hi>cui bono</hi> will shew us that. The Manuscript in our publick Library (I have compared the <hi>Capita</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out) doth hugely differ from the Printed, and so doth another Copy of alike Goodness and Antiquity in C. C. C. To compare him exactly, is to write him out anew: <hi>Hoc opus, hic labor est.</hi> I doubt your Lordship's Leisure will not serve; after this Fortnight mine shall; and it will need the help both of Dr. <hi>Banbridge</hi> and Mr. <hi>Briggs.</hi> To have the Copy out of the Library it is impossible; for if the King should write for it, it is Perjury for any Man to propose a Dispensation for the lending it forth: but the Copy at C. C. C. upon a sufficient caution for the redelivery, shall and may be sent up to your Lordship; and I suppose Mr. <hi>Patrick Young</hi> hath one or two Copies in the Princes Library at St. <hi>James</hi>'s. Not only the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> but the <hi>Thalmud</hi> in six Volumes at <hi>Rome</hi> hath felt the smart of the <hi>Popish Indices,</hi> would God we were but half as diligent to restore, as they abolish and put out the Truth. I have restored 300 Citations, and rescued them from Corruption in thirty quire of Paper: Mr. <hi>Briggs</hi> will satisfie you in this Point, and sundry other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of mine, if they miscarry not for want of maintenance; it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a Prince's Purse. If I was in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Estates</hi> would defray all Charges; cannot our <hi>Estates</hi> supply what is wanting If every Church-man that hath an 100 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> and upward, will lay down but a Shilling for every hundred towards these publick Works, I will undertake the reprinting of the Fathers, and setting forth of five or six Volumes of Orthodox Writers, comparing of Books printed with printed, or written; collating of Popish Translations in Greek, and generally whosoever shall concern Books, or the Purity of them, I will take upon me to be a <hi>Magister</hi> S. <hi>Palatii</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> if I shall be thereunto lawfully required.

But the truth is I had a purpose to have seen your Lordship at my return from <hi>London</hi> at the end of the Term, but I was hindred in that intention: And since my return home, I heard your Lordship was fallen into a burning Fever, whereupon I purposed to have made a Journey to visit your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and to that purpose went to Mr. <hi>Crane</hi> to have his Company: But being born in hand by one of <hi>Jesus Colledg,</hi> that he should shortly hear from <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> how your Lordship did, the Party went out of Town, and so I heard nothing till Mr. <hi>Crane</hi> came home. I did hear at <hi>London</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease of the late <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and of your Lordship's Designment
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:60492:146"/>
by his Majesty to succeed in that place, which I pray God may turn to his Glory, the Good of the Nation, and your own Comfort and Contentment. I have borrowed of Mr. <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> the Book wherein is the History of the Church of <hi>Lindifern,</hi> after of <hi>Durham;</hi> it is in four Books; the Book is none of those which <hi>Bale</hi> mentioneth; I borrowed it of him for two Months. It is one of them which <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> gave to the University-Library: I spake with Mr. <hi>Lisle,</hi> as touching the setting of some of the <hi>Saxon Chronicles:</hi> He saith he hath seen some, but few of them have any thing which are not in other <hi>Chronicles</hi> now extant. If you have any which you think were worth his pains, I would incite him thereunto. I suppose your Lordship hath seen the <hi>Process</hi> against the Corps, Picture, and Books of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Spalato.</hi> Unwise Man that could not easily have presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged these things. By halting between two, he hath much obscured his worth with all Parties. I have perused some of Dr. <hi>Crakenthorp</hi>'s Book, which is well done. I purpose to see your Lordship at Easter, if God will, and you continue with Sir <hi>Gerard Harvy.</hi> This Messenger bringeth the Book, and things from Mr. <hi>Crane,</hi> with two Letters from him. Thus with my Prayers to God for the Recovery of your Health, and to bless you in all your Affairs, with my best Wishes I commend your Lordship to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Protection of the highest Majesty.</p>

                  <p>IN discharge of my Promise, and that great Obligation of Thankfulness due from me, I thought good to present these Lines to your Lordship: Your Friends here were glad to conceive so good hope of your perfect Recovery, which I doubt not will be daily greater. I have herewithal sent your Lordship <hi>Eusebius's Chronicle,</hi> and <hi>Asserins de vita Alfredi</hi> from Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Young,</hi> together with the remembrance of his Love and Service. It was neither his fault nor mine that you had them not sooner. He desires that your Lordship will be pleased to return the <hi>Transcript</hi> of <hi>Epistles</hi> which you borrowed of me, if you have not present occasion to use them; for among them are some Epistles of <hi>Grossetede,</hi> which my <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> desires to have: having contracted with the Printer for the Impression of his Works, with which he goes in hand presently, as I told your Lordship. Sir <hi>Rob. Cotton</hi> hath not yet gotten <hi>Malmesbury de Antiquit. Glaston.</hi> but expects it daily. I have been with my Lord of <hi>Winehester,</hi> and presented your Lordship's Love and best Respects to him: I also told him of your <hi>Samaritan Pentateuch,</hi> of which he was very glad, and desires to see it with your Lordship's best Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:60492:147"/>
He keeps his Chamber for a Cold, being otherwise very well. Since my being with your Lordship, I understand that Mr. <hi>Mountagues Appeal to Caesar</hi> (for so he stiles it) is in the Press. I am promised <hi>Sirmundus</hi> upon <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris,</hi> and <hi>Anastasius Bibliothecarius</hi> History, which are not common: the former with <hi>Savarons</hi> Notes I have; but Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish your Lordship in the mean time with both. <hi>Vettius Valens</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> is Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s now, but was sometimes Dr. <hi>Dees:</hi> But the rest of his Books will be had very shortly, as many as are worth the having; and so much <hi>de re literaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now your Lordship will expect something of the publick Occurrents of the World, which may be to you some Recreation.

                  <p>Here is now great talk of the <hi>French Match,</hi> and of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s present Journey thither, but I confess I believe little: For I hear others speak of the <hi>Popes Nephew,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> coming with great Pomp into <hi>France,</hi> and, as some say, rather to hinder th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n further the Match. Here is great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for a Fleet to go to Sea: They speak of a Press of 10000 Land Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and 7000 Mariners to furnish that Fleet; and that it shall be victual'd for eight Months. Here is News come out of <hi>Spain</hi> of a great loss lately sustained by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>South Sea,</hi> and that by the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet that went for <hi>Lima.</hi> And thus wishing your Lordship perfect Health, and as much Happiness as to my self, I will ever remaim,</p>

With all particulars the <hi>Agents</hi> whom we have sent over will fully acquaint you, to whom I rest assured your Lordship will afford your Countenance, and best Assistance. And my good Lord, now remember that you sit at the Stern, not only to guide us in a right Course, but to be continually in action, and standing in the Watch-Tower to see that the Church receive no hurt. I know my Lord's Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> will give his best furtherance to the Cause, to whom I do not doubt, but after you have fully possessed your self thereof, you will address your self. And so with the remembrance of my Love and Duty unto you, praying for the perfect recovery of your Health, I rest,</p>

How they read those Books I have enquired (having no better means) of him, who I perceive knows no more (if so much) than their Alphabet, and to hear him read the first two Verses of <hi>Genesis</hi> I could not, because another of those Books is not here to be had. The Name of God <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them, as saith he, <hi>Yehueh.</hi> and the fist, eight, and sixth of these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Alphabet are pronounced <hi>hef, chef, ef,</hi> the <hi>ch</hi> of the eight Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters must be pronounced deep in the throat, <hi>Chef.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I sent to <hi>Damascus</hi> to see if I could procure the Grammer, Chronicles and Calendar which your Lordship desires, but could not obtain any of them, there being but one poor Man of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> race left in <hi>Damascus,</hi> who is not able to satisfy me in any thing you desire; only he said there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Books in their Language pawned to a great Spahee of that City, but what they contained the poor Fellow knew not. The Spahee would not part with them under 200 Dollers, which is 60 <hi>l.

touching the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and I hope to prevail in some things, unless the Troubles in and about <hi>Jerusalem</hi> do hinder the free passage of Caravans this ensuing Spring.</p>
                  <p>A former Letter, which it seems your Lordship writ and sentaway by <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> I never received; but as for the Old Testament in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Tongue, my diligence hath not wanted to procure; and to this end, sent divers times to <hi>Tripoly</hi> and <hi>Mount Libanus,</hi> but could not prevail. I have seen here the two first Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> but examining them according to your Direction, I found them to be out of the Greek; whereupon I resolved to send to <hi>Emmit</hi> and <hi>Carommitt</hi> a City in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> where divers of the Sect of the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do remain; and after a long time there was sent me (which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived eight days past) the five Books of <hi>Moses</hi> only, in an old Manuscript, and according to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> with a promise ere long to send the rest of the Old Testament: the Party that sent me this, is the Patriarch of the <hi>Jacobites</hi> in those Parts who writ also that I should have <hi>Eusebius</hi> his Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, with some of the Works of <hi>Ephraem;</hi> which if he do, shall be sent by the first good Conveyance. Those parcels of the New Testament, <hi>viz.</hi> the History of the Adulterous Woman; the second Epistle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third of <hi>John,</hi> the Epistle of <hi>Jude,</hi> with the Book of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> I have procured, and sent them together with the five Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> and a small Tract of <hi>Eprhaem</hi> by the Ship <hi>Patience</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> With the said Books I have sent another in the same Tongue, which I humbly present your Grace; if it shall yeild any matter worthy your reading, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained my desire; however it may prove, I presume it will be accepted as a Token of his Love, who will ever be ready, in what he can, to observe and effect what your Lordship shall command him.</p>
                  <p>I have sought the Old Testament in that Tongue, which is out of the Greek, and distinguished by certain Marks and Stars: but I cannot hear of any such. From <hi>Emmit</hi> I hope to have some good News to write your Lordship, and to send you a Catalogue of such Books as be here to be had. When this Book which I now send shall be received, I beseech your Grace to give your Secretary order to advise me thereof: in the mean time, if any of the Books you desire shall be brought or sent unto me, I will not let them go for a small matter more or less; such Books are very rare, and esteemed as Jewels by the Owners, tho they know not how to use them, neither will they part with them but at dear rates, especially to Strangers, who they presume would not seek after them, except they were of good worth: and indeed they give a kind of superstitious Reverence to all Antiquity. Thus have I related my proceedings, and what intend to do, in what your Lordship writes for, and I should be very glad to accomplish your desire, but I presume my willing and ready mind shall be accepted.</p>
                  <p>Here is News from <hi>Bagdat,</hi> that the <hi>Vizier</hi> with the Army have been thereabouts now three Months past, but have done little worthy so great a force; and now for 70 or 80 days have besieged <hi>Bagdat,</hi> but can do no good upon it. The <hi>Persians</hi> have made divers Sallies out of the City, and after a small Skirmish returned, giving the <hi>Turks</hi> the worst; the King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> if report be true, draws all his Forces that way, but rather to fear the <hi>Turk</hi> than encounter him, unless by some Stratagem, wherein he hath the advantage of the <hi>Turks:</hi> the sequel and issue of this War we expect, and greatly desire in this place, the rather because our Trade depends much thereupon. There hath of late happened some Troubles about <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by the Insolence of an <hi>Arab</hi> called <hi>Emeere Farrach;</hi> there is a force of Men gone against him; he being of no great power, will be soon quiet. The Estate of his Empire decays, and will be utterly ruined by the Tyranny and Oppression of the <hi>Spahees</hi> and <hi>Janisaries,</hi> who are Lords and Governors of the Country; what Man is he that dare oppose a Souldier The <hi>Mahometans</hi> are Slaves to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:60492:148"/>
the Souldiers, the Christian and Jew under both; it would grieve a Man's Heart to see the poor Estate and Condition of the Christians in these Parts; nor so much for their outward Estate, tho that be marvelous grievous, but they are to be pitied for their Estate of Christianity; for I know that in a manner all true knowledg is departed both from Minister and People, the Lord in Mercy visit them. Pardon my Tediousness and Presumption, and excuse my weakness, who shall daily pray unto the Lord of Lords to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper all your ways, and bless all your Endeavours, and grant you a long Life here, with Happiness, and everlasting Glory in the Life to come, and will ever rest,</p>

                  <p>I Received your Lordship's Letter of the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> for which I return many humble Thanks. I have written to Mr. <hi>Pat. Young,</hi> both concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Transcript of Epistles, and the nameless Annal; but I could yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Answer from him, and I have not yet had time to go to him my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self. I have spoken with Sir <hi>Rob. Cotton</hi> concerning <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and the two Books of Saints Lives in <hi>Sarisbury</hi> Library, all which he hath undertaken your Lordship shall have with all convenient speed. As for the other two Books, he tells me that you have one of them, if not both already, but if you want either of them you shall have it sent to you. <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis</hi> of the Lives of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Patrick</hi> was in my hands, which I send your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship herewithal. I have transcrib'd him for the Press, only I will desire that when the Printer is ready for that part, I may have it to compare with my Transcript; for I purpose to go in hand with the Impression of his Works, tho I make some adventure of my own Purss. If my Memory fail me not, that Arabick Book is in my Lord <hi>Marshall</hi>'s Library, but I have not had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to go in since the receipt of your Lordship's Letter, by the next I will give your Lordship an account of it. I received some Letters out of <hi>Ireland</hi> of the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> but containing little memorable; only which is very lamentable, of five hundred Souldiers lately transported from the River of <hi>Chester,</hi> three hundred at least are lost by Shipwrack upon the Coast of <hi>Wales.</hi> Sir <hi>Ed. Chichester</hi> is created Baron of <hi>Belfast,</hi> and Viscount of <hi>Carikfergus.</hi> Here is much preparation for the Solemnities of the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Parliament, and Coronation. The new Writs are gone out, returnable the 17th of <hi>May.</hi> The Funeral-day is appointed the 10th of <hi>May,</hi> which doubtless will be very great and sumptuous. It is said that the King of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> his eldest Son comes over to be chief Mourner. There is no day certain for the Coronation, because it depends upon the Marriage, that both may be done together. <hi>Italy</hi> which hath been quiet sixty Years, some few, Brables of the D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> excepted, is now grown the Stage of War: The <hi>French,</hi>

                  <p>IT is a good while since I writ your to Grace, for want of a good occasion, not presuming to trouble you with unnecessary Lines, so trust my long silence will be excused. The five Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> with those parcels of the New Testament (which your Lordship writ for) in the <hi>Caldean</hi> Tongue, sent you ten Months ago, I trust in safety are come to your hands, whereof I should be glad to hear.</p>
                  <p>I have used my best Industry to procure those other Books that you would have bought, but hitherto have not been so happy as to light upon any of them, such Books being very rare and valued as Jewels, tho the Possessors are able to make little use of them. Amongst all the <hi>Caldeans</hi> that lay in <hi>Mount Libanus, Tripoly, Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> there is but only one old Copy of the Old Testament in their Language extant, and that in the custody of the Patriarch of the Sect of the <hi>Maronites,</hi> who hath his residence in <hi>Mount Libanus,</hi> which he may not part with upon any terms; only there is liberty given to take Copies thereof, which of a long time hath been promised me, and indeed I made full account to have been possessed of one ere this time, having agreed for it; but I was deluded, which troubled me not a little, so in fine, resolved to send a Man on purpose to <hi>Libanus</hi> to take a Copy thereof, who is gone, and I hope in four or five Months will finish it; and by the assistance of the Almighty, I trust to be able to send it by our next Ships.</p>
                  <p>By our Ships lately departed I have sent your Lordship some of the Works of <hi>Ephrem,</hi> which if they prove useful, I have my desire, however I trust will be acceptable.</p>
                  <p>The last Letter I received from your Lordship bears date the 21st of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> and came to my hands the 18th of <hi>July,</hi> where I perceive you would have the New Testament in the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Language and Character, wherein my best Endeavours have not wanted, for which purpose I have sent to <hi>Damascus,</hi> where a few of the <hi>Abissines</hi> do inhabit, yet have had no answer thence; and in case do not prevail here, I purpose to send to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where divers of them do attend upon the Sepulcher of our Lord, whence I hope to be furnished, and in due time to send it with the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tongue, by the next Ships. Thus much I beseech your Lordship to be assured of, that I will omit no time, nor neglect any means for effecting what you have or shall command me.</p>

Touching such Occurrences which are worthy your Lordship's knowledg, this unsettled tottering Estate affords little. The <hi>Turks</hi> Forces were before <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and during the Siege, the <hi>Persians</hi> sallied out of the City divers times and had many Skirmishes with the <hi>Turks,</hi> but ever came off with Honour, and slew the <hi>Turks</hi> in great numbers, who after eight Months were forced to raise their Seige and be gone; who whilst they sought to starve their Enemies, were themselves almost famish'd, the <hi>Persians</hi> having stopped all Passages whereby Provision should have been brought to the Camp. The <hi>Vizier</hi> having raised the Siege, and marching toward <hi>Mossell,</hi> a City formerly called <hi>Ninive,</hi> was pursued by their subtil Adversaries, demanding their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, who the <hi>Turks,</hi> contrary to the Laws of Arms, did detain: in this their Fight the <hi>Persians</hi> had the slaughter of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and after three days the Ambassador was delivered them, who with great Honour and Joy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Bagdat;</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> with great loss, and greater dishonour marched weakly towards <hi>Mossell,</hi> who before they could arrive thither, what with want of Victuals, and a Sickness that raigned amongst them, as also an extream hot Wind that sometimes happens in those Parts, there died in one day twelve thousand Persons; in fine, they lost in these Wars the greater part of the Army, which consisted of 150 thousand Men; and now the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier</hi> with a great part of the Army are here in <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where they purpose to winter, and in the Spring to make a second on-set and try their Fortunes (as they term it) with their Enemies. But a good success such unruly and rebellious Souldiers can scarce expect; their long Ease and unjust gotten Wealth hath caused them to forget Obedience either to their King, or his Lieutenant: But whether of these two Mahumetans prevail I think makes not much; my Prayers shall be, that God his Enemies may be scattered, and his Truth take place.</p>

in the exercise of those Offices; when it was no part of my meaning to give him any such unlimited and absolute Power; but such only as other Bishops ordinarily do give unto those which they place under them. And whereas in <hi>Ireland</hi> the power of granting Dispensations is not by Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to any competent distance of place, to any certain number of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or to any Qualification of Persons: I more particularly declared my Mind therein unto my Lord Treasurer in the Doctor's own presence: that I held it no ways fit that my Substitute should have Authority to grant <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties as he listed,</hi> but only to such Persons, <hi>and in such manner as I my self should appoint:</hi> yet so as the whole profit of such Grants should wholly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served unto him, and the care of ordering them left only unto me. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a motion was made by my Lord Treasurer, that as we had referred the main business <hi>unto your Lordship,</hi> so we should also refer the condition <note place="margin">Your Lordship may by private Instructions, and his discretion, free your self of this fear.</note> and limitation of that Deputation, which was to be granted unto him by me; unto which Motion both of us then yeilded. After this he brought unto me the Copy of an Instrument drawn by himself; wherein there was no manner of mention at all made of any limitation of his Power, either in the granting of Dispensations, or in any thing else: So that by virtue hereof he might also likely do what he pleased, without controul or restraint from me. I leave unto your Lordship's Wisdom to consider, whether it would be convenient, that the Doctor should take upon him to visit the whole Clergy of the Kingdom, to convent Arch-bishops and Bishops before him, and to grant all manner of Dispensations whether I will or no; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I should not wrong both my self and the whole Clergy of <hi>Ireland</hi> (who have groaned long under this heavy burden, as your Lordship discerns by the Copy of their Petitions here inclosed) if I did commit any such trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent and unlimited Power unto him. My humble suit therefore unto your Lordship is, that you would be pleased to get the Order drawn by Dr. <hi>Rives,</hi> into your hands again, and to commit the laying down both of it and of the Authority which he is to receive from me, unto some other which shall not respect his own Ends, but simply express what shall be your Lordship's pleasure therein; whereunto I will most willingly submit my self, and ever rest,</p>

                  <p>MY most humble Duty remembred to your Lordship, being not a little affected with your Recovery. My Lord, you may peradventure blame me of Neglect or Forgetfulness, or both, concerning some business I was entrusted with, when last I was with your Lordship. I had wrote a Letter fully to excuse my self. The Fellows of <hi>Emanuel</hi> were confident they had not that <hi>Thalmud</hi> your Lordship desired: Mr. Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> undertook the delivery of that <hi>Bennet-Colledg</hi> Book, when I intended to have by a Letter excused my self, but a long fit of Sickness prevented me. I could draw little or nothing from Mr. <hi>Downs,</hi> whose Memory fails him; by much a-do I desired him to shew me that place which Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> so much talked of concerning <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

I was lately with one Mr. <hi>Boyse,</hi> whose Notes are on <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Downes</hi>'s; he is now comparing of <hi>Nicene Syn.</hi> in Greek with an old Manuscript which was by great chance offered to him: he is very learned in the Greek Authors, and most willing to communicate, tho your Lordship needs not those Excellencies; he is but four Miles dwelling out of <hi>Cambridg.</hi> I intend to go over of purpose to him concerning the same Queries which your Lordship propounded, because he was Mr. <hi>Downes</hi> his Scholar; I shall intreat him to furnish me with all the Notes (if he may conveniently) that he gathered from Mr. <hi>Downes.</hi> My Lord (if I be not over-bold to desire such a Favour) I wish I had that Table wherein your Lordship hath compared the Hebrew, Greek and Latin Alphabet, which sheweth plainly the right Pronunciation of the <gap reason="foreign">

When I have done with Mr. <hi>Boyse,</hi> and have obtained any thing worth your view, I will by that Messenger desire your Servant to copy out that Table for me, which would give great content to my Scholars, which study the Languages.

                     <salute>Most Reverend, and my very good Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Received a Note from Dr. <hi>Lindsell,</hi> written by your Lordship; wherein you desire to have a Book out of <hi>Trinity-Colledg</hi> Library, which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title, <hi>Psalterium Gallicum, Romanum, Hebraicum MS. in magno Folio.</hi> There is no such Book there, as the Master telleth me; but he shewed me the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in Hebrew MS. interlinear with a Latin Translation; and two other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Translations in Latin, but there is no French, and it is but in a little <hi>Folio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Catena in Psalmos</hi> 50 <hi>priores, Daniele Barbaro interprete,</hi> I cannot learn where it is.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you desire some old Impression of the Greek <hi>Psalms,</hi> in <hi>Trinity-Colledg</hi> Library, there is <hi>Augustini Justiniani, Episcopi Nebiensis Psalterium Octaplum;</hi> in which there is the Greek Translation, also the Arabick and Chalde Paraphrase; but I suppose you have that Book already. Also they have a Manuscript <hi>Psalter</hi> in Greek, a very good Hand, which it seemeth was <hi>Liber Theodori Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis.</hi> If you would have any of those, I will procure them from Dr. <hi>Maw.</hi> I had purposed to have seen you e're now; and now this Week I had purposed to have brought my whole Family to <hi>Mundon,</hi> but this day I received a Letter, that one of my Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at my Parsonage, had a Sister who is suspected the last <hi>Saturday</hi> to die of the Plague at <hi>Standon.</hi> I thank God we are yet well at <hi>Cambridg.</hi> If you please to write unto me your mind, touching the Books aforesaid, I will do what you would have me. Thus desiring the Lord to mitigate this grievous Judgment which hath seized upon our Mother-City, and from thence is diffused to many other Towns in the Land, and to stay it in his good time; and in the mean time to sanctify this Correction unto the whole Land, that it may have that powerful working for which God sends it, to make us sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of our Sins, and of his Wrath for our Sins, and of the Miseries of our Brethren under the Cross; and so to move us to true Repentance, and new Obedience; which He effect in us for his Mercy's sake. Thus with my best Service to your self, and Mrs. <hi>Usher,</hi> and my kind Love to Sir <hi>Gerard</hi> and his Lady, I commend you to the safe protection of the highest Majesty.</p>

                     <salute>After the remembrance of my humble Duty:</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>MAY it please your Grace to pardon my long silence and neglect of writing, according to my Duty, occasioned partly by Sickness, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Discontent and Discouragement from our great Ones: But being now freed from both, (God be thanked) I address my self wholly to the care of the Publick, long since by me intended. Wherein now, more than ever, I must be bold to crave your Lordships furtherance, that as it had its first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings from your Grace, so it may its final end, and a fulfilling by your Lordships good means. It is true, my Lord of <hi>Litchfield</hi> is intrusted with the whole direction and managing of this Business: but had your Grace been near, there would have been none more able nor willing than your Grace. I do therefore most humbly intreat your Lordship, that sometime before your Grace's departure into <hi>Ireland,</hi> you would be pleased, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with my Lord of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> to settle the whole Business, what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors we shall begin with, in what order, and after what manner. As for the Canon-Law, which I have looked unto, not without the vocation and approbation of Mr. <hi>Vice-chancellor;</hi> I must confess my forwardness therein, upon a supposal of sundry Additions unto <hi>Gratian;</hi> and my Fellow-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are as earnest as my self upon that little which we have hitherto found. Doubtless <hi>Gratian</hi> was one of the first Compilers of the Popish Religion, in his hotch-potch of the Canon-Law: but yet he is not so bad as he is made, the Corruptions are of a later hue, and came in long since his time. I have given a taste as of all that I have hitherto done, in certain rude Papers, overhastily perhaps sent up to pass your Lordships Censure and Judgment; and from thence to the Press, that I may have a taste to present unto my Lord the Bishops, and others, that have already promised their helps. If this, of almost an hundred places corrupted in point of Religion, (not taking all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an exact survey, but a few to give proof of the faisibility of the Work to the common profit of the Church) shall be thought fit to be printed, and an hundred places of flat contradiction, Men, if ever, will be stirred up to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance this Work; for the doing whereof, with some jeopardy of my Health, and loss of all worldly Preferment, I am most willing to be imployed to the uttermost of my simple Endeavours, having nothing to promise but Fidelity and Industry. Good, my Lord, what can be done by your Grace, let it be done to the uttermost; the Work is in a manner yours; to God be the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and if the <hi>Church of England</hi> receive not as much profit by this one Work being well done, as by any thing since <hi>Erasmus</hi>'s Time, I will never look hereafter to be credited of your Grace, or any Man clse. But to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing and perfecting of this Work, two things are requisite;</p>
                  <p>First, That the Fathers Works, in <hi>Latin,</hi> be reprinted, (the <hi>Vindiciae</hi> will not serve) wherein I desire to have three or four able Doctors, or Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of Divinity, to be my Assistants in framing the Annotations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That there be provision, either in Parliament, or out, that the Copies may be sent from any Cathedral Church or Colledg, upon a sufficient Caution, <hi>non obstante statuto:</hi> both these being granted, as at your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships instance they may be, I doubt not of a most happy success of the whole Business. Which, that I may not be too troublesome to your Grace, I
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60492:153"/>
commend unto the protection of the Almighty, praying for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships health and happiness, and resting, as I am, in all Bands of Duty and Service.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XCII. A <hi>Letter from the most Reverend</hi> James Usher <hi>Arch-bishop of</hi> Armagh. <hi>To the Right Honourable and my special good Lords, the Lord-Keeper of the Great Seal, and the Lord High-Treasurer of</hi> England.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My most honoured Lords;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOUR Lordships Letters, bearing date the <hi>9th</hi> of this Present, were delivered unto me by a Servant of Dr. <hi>Rives</hi> the <hi>18th</hi> of the same. In reading whereof, <hi>I</hi> found my self much grieved, that the Doctor, by his sinister Suggestions, should so far prevail with your Wisdoms, as to make you conceive that <hi>I</hi> refused to perform the Agreement which your Lordships made betwixt us. True it is indeed, that <hi>I</hi> complained unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, that the drawing up that Agreement was committed to the Party him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who was careful enough to lay down all things therein to his own best advantage; without reservation of any Power unto me, to limit him any way in the exercise of that Authority which he was to hold under me. But as soon as <hi>I</hi> had received satisfaction from your Honour (my Lord Keeper) under your hand writing, that <hi>I might limit him by private Instructions, though not by Patent;</hi> and that the <hi>clause of good-behaviour was ever included in these Offices,</hi> howsoever they were granted <hi>during Life: I</hi> presently did agree to sign his Patent. And this is that second Agreement he talketh so much of; which <hi>I</hi> never took to be any other, than that which was at first intended.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this, he affirmeth in his Petition, that having shewed unto me my Lord Keeper's Opinion, signified in writing, concerning the Exceptions taken by me against his Draught of the Patent; I agreed to seal him the said Patent, provided that two Clauses only might be added; but most guilefully suppresseth that which was not to be inserted in the Patent, but to pass in private betwixt us two; namely, that <hi>I might limit him by private Instructions,</hi> according to my Lord Keeper's direction, which at that very time he delivered unto me in writing. My Lords, if you think that I have any Faith or Honesty in me, believe me herein, that I propounded this unto him as the main foundation of our Agreement; and that he gave his assent unto it before ever I would promise to seal his Patent: He only adding this, That he did not doubt, when he could shew cause unto me why I should vary from my Instructions in any Particular, I would be ruled by better Reason. Herewith for the present did I rest satisfied: but the day following I considered better with my self, what a slender Tie I had upon him, if I only should rest contented with his bare Word only; which at his pleasure he might deny, where-ever he saw cause. And therefore to prevent all matter of future Discord, I intreated him, by Letter, that as I had shewed my self ready to gratify him, by binding my self publickly under my Hand and Seal unto him, so he would privately tie himself in like manner, for giving more full satisfaction unto me in two Particulars.</p>
                  <p>For the former of these, which doth concern the Registership; I signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto him, at the time of our Agreement, that I had made promise of it already to one Mr. <hi>Hilton:</hi> Which being a Matter of less importance, the Doctor doth now so little stand upon it, that in a Letter lately written unto me, he hath utterly disclaimed all Power of conferring the said Office upon the next avoidance. But for the latter, which concerneth the limiting of him by private Instructions, (according to my Lord-Keeper's express dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60492:155"/>
he hath now at full discovered that whereof I conceiv'd at first but a jealousie; namely, that he did but <hi>dare verba,</hi> and intended nothing less than performance, when to get my consent unto the signing of the Patent of his own drawing, he submitted himself to be ordered by the Instructions which I should give him. For as if <hi>res</hi> were <hi>adhuc integra,</hi> and no such A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement at all had passed betwixt us; he now maketh your Lordships to write, that <hi>you do not think it reasonable</hi> that this should be imposed upon him. I am bold to say, that he maketh your Lordships to write thus; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, I am verily perswaded, that if the Matter be examined, it will be found, that this Letter was of his own drawing. Wherein, what infinite wrong he hath done unto your Honour, (my Lord-Keeper) I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you to consider. First, He bringeth your Lordship's Writing unto me, signifying that I might <hi>limit him by private Instructions,</hi> though not by <hi>Patent:</hi> and hereunto he shewed himself then content to yield. And now he hath stolen another Letter from your Honour, wherein he would have you sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify again, that you <hi>do not think it reasonable</hi> that he should be tied to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Instructions that I shall give him. Behold! <hi>Jordanes conversus est retrorsum:</hi> and now, not <hi>Littora littoribus contraria,</hi> but <hi>litterae litteris.</hi> Your Lordships had need to watch this Man's Fingers, when-ever you trust him with drawing up of any Orders or Letters that do concern his own Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: for otherwise you may chance to find him as nimble in putting Tricks upon your selves, for his own advantage, as now he is in putting them upon me.</p>
                  <p>Which that your Lordships may yet be more sensible of, I intreat you to weigh well the Reason which he maketh you here to render, of the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of the Condition that I require of him. For did ever any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Man hold it to be a thing unreasonable, that a Substitute should be ordered by him that hath appointed him to be his Substitute This may be true, will he say, <hi>in thesi,</hi> but not <hi>in hypothesi,</hi> in other Substitutions, but not in this; because, <hi>upon your Lordships motion he hath submitted himself to take that under me, which he hath a fair pretence to challenge in his own Right:</hi> So that, were it not for the respect which he did bear unto your Lordships mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his stout heart belike would not stoop to such terms of submission; but hazard the whole rather, by putting his own Right in trial. Yea, but what if this prove to be another piece of the Doctor's <hi>Legerdemain;</hi> and that it do appear evidently, under his own hand, that this desire of submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion did primarily and originally proceed out of his own breast, <hi>ex motu mero &amp; proprio,</hi> long before your Lordships had any thing to do in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness If you will be pleased to take so much pains as to peruse the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed copy of a Letter which he wrote unto me, not long before the decease of his late Majesty, (of blessed memory) you shall find a Motion tendred therein unto me, for the intreating of Sir <hi>Henry Holcraft</hi> to move his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, that he (the said Doctor) might be <hi>spoken to for the surrendering of his Patent;</hi> together with the renewing of a former Suit, of <hi>making him my Servant in that place;</hi> sealed up with a promise, of <hi>rendring his due obedience and thankfulness unto me for my favour.</hi> So far was he then from those high terms whereon he now standeth.</p>
                  <p>But the case is now so far altered, that this obedient Servant of mine, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth not an Equality only with me, (by exempting himself wholly from my controul) but also, for ought I see, a Superiority over me. For if it shall please him to visit my Diocess, or my Province, as he did in the time of my Predecessor; what is there in that Patent, as he hath drawn it, whereby I may hinder him from so doing <hi>Your Honour may, by private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and his Discretion, free your self of this fear;</hi> faith my Lord-Keeper in his Marginal Annotations upon my former Letter. But, good my Lord, give me leave to think, that the hope of such a Prize as he got by
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60492:155"/>
his other Visitation of all the Arch-bishops and Bishops in our Kingdom, will very easily blind this <hi>Man's Discretion;</hi> and for my <hi>private Instructions,</hi> what weight will they be of, if it be now thought a matter not reasonable, that my Substitute should be tied by them</p>
                  <p>As for the Report which your Lordships are to make unto his Majesty, upon the reference of this Business unto you: I humbly crave, that for so much as doth concern me, it may be made to this effect.</p>
                  <p>First, That I never did, nor do, refuse to submit my self to that Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which you have put under your hands to be signified to his Majesty, but am ready to perform it in every particular.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That for the limiting of my Substitute, and the terms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he must hold his Place under me, (of which there is nothing laid down in that Agreement which you have signed, that which concerneth Fees and Profits only excepted) I do desire that his Patent only be drawn according to the Pattern of Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi>'s; and that the same Power may be reserved to me and my Successors, that my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Grace doth retain unto himself, in the exercise of the Office of Prerogative and Faculties. Which if it may here stand well with Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; I see not but it may stand as well likewise in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without any such great disparagement to Mr. Doctor's Dignity.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, If the Doctor herein shall not hold himself to be fairly and exceeding favourably dealt withal; my desire is, that both of us may be left to the Law, to try our Rights together. For thereby it shall be made as clear as the Light, that the Doctor's Patent was absolutely void, or voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, <hi>ab initio;</hi> that whatsoever validity it had at the beginning, yet it was afterwards forfeited by his notorious Misdemeanour; and, in fine, that it was actually surrendred into the Hands of His Majesty, and by him cassated and annulled, howsoever the Ceremony of cancelling it hath been neglected. Which kind of Trial, by course of Law, I do now the rather desire, (yet strill submitting my self to the former Agreement, if it shall so seem fit unto your Lordships); 1. Because the Doctor wished mine Agent to certify me, in plain terms, that he would not be under me; and hereby, for his part, hath disclaimed the benefit of your Lordships Order. 2. Because, by his incensing of my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> against me, (of whose Grace I never yet deserved evil) by his abusing of me in his Reports unto your Lordships, and by his disgraceful traducing of me in all Companies; he hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self utterly unworthy of the Favour which I intended to shew unto him. 3. Because, as long as my Life shall be conceived to remain in that pretended Patent; the validity of the Acts that have passed in the <hi>Prerogative Court,</hi> during the time of my Predecessor, (some whereof have been of very great moment) may be held in suspence; it being still questionable, whether they were done <hi>coram non-Judice,</hi> or no. All which I leave unto your honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consideration: and humbly craving pardon, if I have any way over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot my self in defending mine Innocency and Reputation against the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Proceedings of my ungrateful Accuser; I rest,</p>

                  <p>MY beloved Neighbour-Minister Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> acquainted me with your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to hear from me, how I conceived of the way of God's eternal Predestination, and the Execution of it: I should not have hearkned to him herein (tho I love him well) were it not for the deep Affection and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60492:156"/>
Reverence I bear to your Person and Gifts, which hath constrained me (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his importunacy) to yield to the sending of this Discourse to you, which I was occasioned to write a year ago for the satisfaction of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Minister in Points of this nature. The Questions and Answers in the beginning of the Book, I delivered and opened by way of Catechism long ago; which a Neighbour-Minister having afterwards gotten from some of my Hearers, he wrote those Doubts, which follow in the Book, the better to inform either himself or me: Whereupon as I could get any time in the midst of other continual Employments (too heavy for me) I wrote to him the Discourse following, the more fully to acquaint him with the grounds of my Judgment, as knowing well his sufficiency to object fully, if he found himself unsatisfied in any Passage thereof. The Style (I confess) is unmeet for you to read, as being plain and popular, and therefore too large, and withal empty of variety of reading, which store of other Occurrences in my Calling here, inforceth me too often to intermit.</p>
                  <p>Thus much let me humbly intreat at your Lordship's hands, by the honour which you owe to Christ, and by the Love you bare to his poorest Servants, stick not (I beseech you) to advertise me freely of any such tenent herein, as you shall think less safe. I trust you shall find me conscious of mine own Slenderness, and glad to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ive such Light, as God shall be pleased to impart to me by you.</p>
                  <p>Yet this one thing more let me also add. Tho I yield some degree of Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in Christ's Death unto all; yet I conceive it far short, both of Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Application of that gracious Atonement, which is thereby wrought to the Elect of God; whence also it is that I dare not preach the Gospel indifferently unto all, before the Law; nor the worth of Christ, before the need of Christ. Childrens Bread is not meet for Whelps; and full Souls will despise Hony-Combes. I see <hi>John Baptist</hi> was sent to humble, before Christ to heal: and Christ himself preached Repentance, before Faith in the Promises, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. Neither do I remember in the Gospel any Promise of Grace, pardoning Sin, nor any Commandment to believe Sin pardoned, but to the broken, the bruised, the poor, the weary, the thirsty, or the like. Faith in the Promises, before the Heart be changed from Stoniness to Broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I fear is no better than the Temporary Faith, which is found in the stony Soil; <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                  <p>But I cease your Lordship's further Trouble. Now the Lord Jesus, who hath delighted in you to fill your Heart with the Riches of his manifold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Graces, be pleased to enlarge you to the Employment of them to his best advantage, guide all your Ways in his Faithfulness, and Wisdom, and sustain you with his Mercy and Power unto the end. So I humbly take leave, and rest;</p>

                  <p>I Received your Lordship's Letter; and that which I signified to your Lordship in my last Letter, was almost really effected. The night before the choice of our new Chancellor, I was very ill, so as without hazard of my Health, I could not be at the choice, and so was absent: The Duke carried it not above three or four Voices from the Earl of <hi>Berkshire;</hi> and had not neither carried it, but that the King's Pleasure was signified for the Duke, both by Message and Letter. <hi>Quod vis summam rerum in summo versari discrimine, &amp; timeo, &amp; doleo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I acquainted Mr. <hi>White</hi> with your Pleasure, and wished him to impart it to the rest of the Collators, as touching the Collation of the Text in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Photius</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius.</hi> I send you inclosed the Hebrew Verse you writ for. They are in <hi>Denteronomy</hi> in the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Pentateuch. I have
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:60492:157"/>
not as yet spoken with Mr. <hi>Boyse.</hi> I received the Books you mention, and sent two of them to Mr. <hi>Austine.</hi> Mr. <hi>Green</hi> will send you the two Books, <hi>Lucian Graeco. Lat.</hi> and <hi>N. Testam. Syrlacum-Latin,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Burnets.</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> sendeth up unto you the <hi>Variae Lectiónes</hi> upon the Psalms. The divers Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Prosper</hi> shall be sent you. Dr. <hi>Goad</hi> sent me two sheets of my Latin Sermon printed. But I hear not whether our Suffrage be reprinted. I would know whether <hi>Nicetus</hi> his <hi>Orthodoxus Thesaurus</hi> be extant in Greek. I suppose it is in Latin, at least in the New <hi>Bibliotheca.</hi> He is said to interpret <hi>Greg. Nyssen</hi> his Opinion of the Conversion which is made in the Eucharist menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned c. 37 Catechet. I cannot tell what to pronounce touching that discourse. His discourse is somewhat plausible till he come to the conversion made in the Eucharist by Christ's words, and then he doth faulter.</p>
                  <p>I pray you let me know where the Manuscript Copies of the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> are to be had. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whalley</hi> are both in good health. I am right sorry that your Lordship should so soon go from us. I am now in busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in Disputations in our Schools. I shall forget many things which I should have enquired of. And so with my best Service remembred to your Lordship and Mrs. <hi>Usher,</hi> I commend you. to the gracious Protection of the highest Majesty, and so rest,</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have received from you the divers readings of the continuation of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>'s Chronicle, and your <hi>Concio ad Clerum,</hi> for which I heartily thank you. Your <hi>Gratia Discriminans</hi> (I doubt not) will settle many Mens minds in those dubious Times, to which I wish that the other things which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, had been added, especially those places which you observed out of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> against <hi>falling from Grace.</hi> But of this Argument I earnestly beseech you to take special care, as soon as your Commencement Businesses are past over, and when you have put your Notes together, I pray you make me so happy as to have a Copy of them.</p>

                  <p>The suddain Dissolution of the Parliament hath amazed us, all Mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking on those things which are coming on the Land. The Lord prepare us for the Day of our Visitation, and then let his blessed Will be done. There is a Proclamation to be presently set out for the stopping of those Contentions in Points of Religion.</p>
                  <p>I have dealt with your Chancellor very effectually for the erecting of your Library, to which he is of himself exceeding forward: I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him to send unto <hi>Leyden</hi> for all the printed Hebrew Books of <hi>Erpenius</hi> his Library; which together with his Manuscripts which he hath already, he purposeth to bestow upon your University. I have also perswaded him to send thither for the Matrices of the <hi>Syriack, Arabick, Aethiopick,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> Letters, and to bestow them like wise upon you.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>White</hi> hath sent up unto me the <hi>Variae Lectiones</hi> of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a very kind Letter. I pray you tell him, from me, that I will keep them by me as a perpetual testimony of his love and respect to me; whereof he shall find that I will not be unmindful, whensoever either himself, or any of his, shall have occasion to use me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nicetus</hi> his <hi>Orthodaxus Thesaurus</hi> I have not seen in Greek, the Latin I have in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but whether it be inserted into <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> I cannot tell, the Book being not now by me.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi>'s Catechetical Oration hath been evil handled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpolated by Hereticks, I think is somewhere observed by <hi>Nicephorus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, (see his <hi>Ecel. Elist. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.); yet that Discourse of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist</hi> (if my Memory fail me not) is inserted by <hi>Cuthimius</hi> in his <hi>Panoplia:</hi> And I have seen it my self in two ancient Greek Manuscripts of <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> with Mr. <hi>Patrick Toung,</hi> (the one whereof was Mr. <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In Sir <hi>Rob. Cotton</hi>'s Library there be four several <hi>Saxon Annals;</hi> and one written both in the Saxon and in the Latin Tongue. In <hi>Benet-Colledg</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary likewise, <hi>Vol.</hi> 269. there is another ancient Saxon Annal.</p>

I should have gone from hence at the time I wrote unto you of; but since that time I received a Letter from the Lord Chamberlain, signifying the King's Pleasure, that I should preach at Court the <hi>25th</hi> of this Month, which hath caused me to put off my Journey until the end of the Term.

                  <p>I Received your Lordships last Letter, of the 23<hi>d</hi> of this month, and do perceive thereby, that <hi>Erpenius</hi>'s printed Books, and his Matrices of the Oriental Tongue, are already sold. I am glad your Lordship hath got the old Manuscript of the Syriack Translation of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and for your hopes of the rest. You say, you have received the parcels of the New Testament in that Language, which hitherto we have wanted. But it seemeth those Parcels are writttn out of some Copies: But I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anciently they were in the old Manuscript. I am much afraid the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits have laid hold of <hi>Elmenhorst</hi>'s Copy. As for the places of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> I will at my better leisure, by God's Grace, examine it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Boyse</hi> hath written out the Fragment of P. <hi>Alexandrinus;</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth me to let him have the Book till the next week, for he would gladly peruse the Notes of <hi>Casaubon</hi> upon <hi>Nicander.</hi> And, God-willing, the next week, I will send it to Mr. <hi>Francis Burnett.</hi> I am right sorry to see matters of that importance carried <hi>ex consilio perpaucorum.</hi> I had a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from my Lord of <hi>Sarum,</hi> by which I understand as much.</p>
                  <p>There was the last week a Cod-fish brought from <hi>Colchester</hi> to our Market to be sold; in the cutting up which, there was found in the Maw of the Fish, a thing which was hard; which proved to be a Book of a large 16<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, which had been bound in Parchment, the Leaves were glewed together with a Gelly. And being taken out, did smell much at the first; but after wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> did look into it. It was printed; and he found a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Contents. The Book was intituled, <hi>A preparation to the Cross,</hi> (it may be a special admonition to us at <hi>Cambridg).</hi> Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> upon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday,</hi> read to me the Heads of the Chapters, which I very well liked of. Now it is found to have been made by <hi>Rich. Tracy,</hi> of whom <hi>Bale</hi> maketh mention, <hi>Cent.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 719. He is said to flourish then 1550. But, I think, the Book was made in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Time, when the six Articles were a-foot. The Book will be printed here shortly. I know not how long your Lordship will stay in <hi>England;</hi> I wish you might stay longer. We are to come to present our new Chancellor, with his Patent, upon the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>July;</hi> all our Heads will be there, I would be glad to meet your Lordship then.</p>
                  <p>And thus wishing your Lordship all good success in your Affairs, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Journey, and speedy Passage when you go, with our best Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, my Wife and I wish you and yours all health and happiness, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to the safest protection of the highest Majesty.</p>

                  <p>These six Errors avoided as Rocks of Shipwrack to the Reader, and his Traditions distinguished from the Commandments, the Reader may make with me this sixfold good use of <hi>Maymon.</hi>

These that forgot the Truth, by reason of the Vanities of the Time, wandring all their Years in Vanity and Toys, which neither profit nor deliver. Look into your Souls, and make good your Ways and your Actions; and let each of you forsake his evil Ways, and his Thought that is not good.</q> Thus far <hi>Maymon.</hi> The blowing of the Trumpet then, is a lively Type of Repentance, and newness of Life, to begin on <hi>New-Years</hi> Day; and of awaking and rising from the sleep of Sin, whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks. <hi>Kimchy,</hi> on <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 1, 4. <hi>Blow the Trumpet in the New Moon, in the time appointed in our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feast-day,</hi> comments thus; <q>This Psalm was sung every New-years day in the Temple, and the blowing of the Trumpet is mentioned in it; the meaning whereof is, That our Fathers rested from their Service, and ceased from their Labours in that day: For this Psalm spoke of the going of our Fathers out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was on the Eve of the 14 day of <hi>Nisan,</hi> or <hi>March.</hi>

And <hi>Rabbi Abben Ezra</hi> saith, Remember <hi>Abraham</hi> that came away from the Idolaters. Neither is he called <hi>[Ahub]</hi> a Friend, passively, but <hi>[Oheb]</hi> a Friend, active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not beloved, but a loving Friend, or Lover; for it is an Action which passeth or goeth out of the Lover or Agent cleaving unto the Beloved, which is the Patient. <hi>Maymon</hi> in his Tractate of Repentance, <hi>cap.</hi> 10. §. 2. 3. makes plain this matter unto us.

All this, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 10. expounds thus: <hi>Likewise, I say unto you, that there is Joy in the presence of the Angels of God over one Sinner that repenteth:</hi> and lastly, <hi>Vers.</hi> 1,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. he shews the occasion of the Parable, <hi>viz.</hi> The murmuring of the Scribes and Pharisees against Christ; <hi>This Man receiveth Sinners, and eateth with them;</hi> which thing they despised: And therefore <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, 18. 10. <hi>Take heed ye despise not one of these little ones,</hi> the repenting Sinner, <hi>viz.</hi> and then tells the Parable that their Conversion is to be joyed at and not to be despised. <hi>Maymon</hi> in his Tractate of Repentance, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. §. 4. openeth all this excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Let not a Man that is a true Repentant think that he is far from the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Righteous, because of the Iniquities and Sins that he hath committed. The matter is not so, but he is beloved, and one that the Creator takes Joy in as if he had never sinned; and not that only, but his Reward is great, for he hath tasted the taste of Sin, but now he hath left it and subdued his ill Affection. The wise have said, the place in which true repentant Sinners stand, the most perfect righteous Men are not able to stand therein, that is to say, That their Dignity is greater than the Dignity of these righteous Ones who have never sinned, because that they have subdued their Affections or Concupiscenses more than these. And in the same Chap. §. 8. he saith that it was accounted an absolute Sin for any one to say unto a true penitent Sinner, <hi>Remember thy first Works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Kimchy</hi> on the 57th of <hi>Esay, vers.</hi> 19. on these words <hi>[Peace, Peace to him that is a far off, and to him that is near]</hi> comments thus: By him that it far off, is meant the Sinner that repents, and by him that is near, the Righteous. And from this place they have taught and said, The Sinners that repent are greater than the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:60492:162"/>
Righteous, as is said to him that is far off, and to him that is nigh; first to him that is far off, then to him that is nigh. By <hi>far off</hi> is meant, that was far off, but now is become nigh; and <hi>by nigh,</hi> is meant he that was nigh already. <hi>Kimchy,</hi> that is, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds <hi>Esay's</hi> words, both to Jew and Gentile, Ephes. 2. 17. <hi>He preached Peace to you which were far off, and to them that were nigh;</hi> and <hi>vers.</hi> 13. the Gentiles <hi>viz.</hi> which were sometimes far off, are now nigh; as Christ saith, <hi>Publicans and Sinners shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before the Scribes and Pharisees.</hi> And <hi>Maymon</hi> opens his meaning more fully: Repent. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. §. 6. Sin is of a separating nature; your Sins have made a partition between you and me; but Repentance is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning and uniting nature, making the Sinner to day nigh unto God, who yesterday was far off.</p>

It is worth observing how that Christ confutes the Errors of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> (who thought there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection) out of the ancient sayings of their own Talmudical Doctors. And <hi>Maymon</hi> gives the reason of this Apothegm; <hi>There is no eating nor drinking in the World to come:</hi> Ergo <hi>they neither marry, nor are given in Marriage.</hi> Thus it is observable how Christ disputing against the Jews about the Resurrection, doth prove the Resurrection out of the sayings of their own Talmudicks, and in proving it, he doth approve those sayings; and in approving them, doth reprove the <hi>Sadduces</hi> for denying it.</p>

The same Phrase is as frequent with <hi>Maymon:</hi> he saith, <hi>It is said, It is written,</hi> or, <hi>The Scripture saith,</hi> whensoever he bringeth any place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for to prove his Assertion. Now the reason why he never cites the Section, Chapter, or Book, is for that the Jews have always been so ready and pregnant in the Scriptures, as that they need not cite the Book, Chapter, or Verse: For this their expertness in the Scriptures they were called <hi>Sopherim,</hi> Seribes or Numberers of the Law. They have told us that there be 54 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rashioths or Sections in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, of which they do here joyn together the two shortest, and so in every year they read over <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, ending on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles; every Sabbath-day reading in the Synagogue a whole Section. They set down the number of the Verses of every Book, as namely <hi>Genesis</hi> hath in it 1534 Verses. The midst of the Book is at these words, <hi>[And by thy Sword thou shalt live.]</hi> The Sections
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:60492:163"/>
thereof be 12. The <hi>Sydrim,</hi> or lesser Sections, be 43. The number of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Genesis</hi> be 4395. And <hi>Hakmi</hi> tells us on the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> how many Alphabets there be in the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> 1800. And so I could run through all the other Books. But I must not be tedious.</p>
                  <p>Now methinks I hear some ignorant Scholar object, such an one as <hi>Jude</hi> speaks of, who condemns and speaks ill of those things which he knows not, and corrupts those things he also knows; To what end and purpose serves this great and needless labour of the Rabbies, in numbring up of the Books, Verses, Sections, Words, and Letters I answer. They serve us for exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great use, especially in these our days, in which God did foresee Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings would go about to prove that the Scriptures were corrupted, and that then we must of necessity have another Judg, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope. If I should grant this Argument, made by the Pope's Champion, <hi>Pistorius,</hi> That the Scriptures were corrupted, and that therefore we must have another Judge: Yet doth it not follow that the Pope must be he; but contrary-wise, that of all other the Pope must be excluded from being Judg, for that he is a Party. But we constantly deny the Corruption of the Scriptures, which they affirm, and endeavour to prove by the 848 <hi>variae Lectiones,</hi> and by the <hi>Keries</hi> and the <hi>Cethists.</hi> And we answer, that variety of reading argues not any Corruption, but Ingenuity and plentiful Fruit of the Spirit of God, done only in obscure places for Illumination: for we can prove out of the <hi>Nazarites</hi> and <hi>Sopherisms,</hi> every word and letter to have been through God's singular Providence, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred up, and so kept by them thereby from Corruption: Upon which Point <hi>Pistorius</hi> the Pope's Champion durst not dispute with a Learned Man of our Land. For howsoever the Jews were <hi>male Legis observatores,</hi> yet were they <hi>boni servatores &amp; custodes,</hi> true keepers of the Oracles of God committed unto them: And how did they keep them but by numbring up every Word, Letter, and Verse, that so it being left unto Posterity on Record, we might prove the Purity of the Scriptures by their Nazaretical Books against the foisting Papists, who do nothing but foist in and corrupt all things, not only the Greek Fathers, but even the <hi>Targums</hi> and Comments of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> in all those places and expressions that make against <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Buxtorffs</hi> Bible lately set forth. As for Example, <hi>Esay</hi> 34. 9. And <hi>[her] i. e. Edom</hi>'s Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>shall be turned into Pitch. Jonathan</hi> the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast, that wrote long before Christ, comments thus: And the Rivers of <hi>Rome</hi> shall be turned into Pitch. Rabbi <hi>David Kimchy</hi> cites this Chaldaical Exposition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it, saying, That all the Section is spoken against <hi>Edom,</hi> that is, <hi>Rome.</hi> And <hi>Elias Levita</hi> in his <hi>Methurgaman</hi> in the word <hi>[Roma]</hi> cites the Chaldee Paraphrast so against <hi>Rome,</hi> and so doth <hi>Munster.</hi> All these follow the true and best <hi>Bumberges</hi> Bibles. But in <hi>Buxtorffs</hi> Bibles lately set forth (which follows the third Edition of <hi>Bumberg</hi>'s Bibles that be purged) there the word <hi>Rome</hi> is left forth in the <hi>Targum,</hi> and in <hi>Kimchy</hi>'s Comment; and four times in <hi>Rabby Shelemaes</hi> and <hi>Kimchies</hi> Comments instead of the word <hi>[Edom]</hi> by which they mean <hi>Rome,</hi> they have put the word <hi>[Javan]</hi> that is <hi>Greece,</hi> and once the word <hi>(Cuthith)</hi> that is, <hi>Samaria.</hi> And in the 35th Chapter four times the word <hi>[Cuthith] Samaria.</hi> So <hi>Rome</hi> is both <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and in other places <hi>Persia,</hi> and a <hi>mess of Wax.</hi> And on the 16th Verse of the 34th of <hi>Esay, Kimchy</hi> comments thus: Whosoever will see into the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Rome,</hi> let him search over the Book of <hi>Jehova,</hi> and wade in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Bumbergs</hi> Bibles. But in <hi>Buxtorffs</hi> Bible you have no more but these words <hi>[whosoever will see into]</hi> leaving out the words of <hi>Kimchy,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Rome;</hi> and doth not tell one that he must see, for that they would have the Reader blind, and not to see <hi>Rome's</hi> Fall, which for all this their Legerdemain with Scholars, must yet in the end be sacked with Sword, and burnt with Fire, for her Idolatry and Filthiness. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.

It is not therefore a Corruption of the place, as some do unjustly accuse them, but a witty mutation and signification, done by them of purpose to teach us Gentiles to know the Messiah, who then when they translated this, was unknown to us. Mark how Christ still confutes the Rabbies of the Jews by the saying still of their own Talmudicks; and here by an Argument taken <hi>à minore ad majus</hi> thus; If a Man by the saying of your Doctors, must give an account of every idle word, much more for a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but the first is true out of your Doctors, <hi>ergo</hi> the second.

                  <p>I Have sent your Lordship <hi>Drusiius</hi> his <hi>Alphabetum Hebraicum vetus;</hi> and <hi>Veterum Sapientum</hi>

                     </gap>, out of which I conjecture the reason why the Jews at this day do pronounce the Hebrew words with the defect of the Gutturals, is, for that the <hi>Septuagint</hi> Jews have used so to write them in Greek, as, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Three Jews I have talked with personally, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and asked them the reason why they omitted these Gutturals, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in words, by reason of which their pronunciation was difficult to be understood by us which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them: I told them, that <hi>Moses</hi> wrote them to this end, that they should be read and pronounced: And they confessed it should be so, only custom and use had otherwise prevailed. Now this custom arose (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) from this ancient manner of writing and speaking without the Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. Now what was the original cause of this custom, I cannot yet find, unless it be that which <hi>Elias Levita</hi> alleageth, in his <hi>Titsby voce,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, because, saith he, the pronounciation of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is difficult to the Gentiles; as <hi>Abben Ezra</hi> saith, That whosoever hath not learned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. It may be therefore, that Antiquity, and the <hi>Seventy,</hi> respected the Gentiles in the difficulty of these Gutturals, as in other things, and to make the pronunciation of this Tongue more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>I have sent your Lordship also Mr. <hi>Claudius Duret</hi>'s History of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of the Universe; which Book, long e're now, I had translated for the good of the Gentry, in that it fitteth a Gentleman with Discourse of every Nation and Language; but that I understood the several Characters in this Book would not be had for 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and to set it forth without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, would be a Catarract in the Reader's Eye.

Secondly, The Antiquity of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Characters, for the commendation of your Lordships <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritain</hi> Bible.

                  <p>70 <hi>Weeks,</hi> &amp;c. That eminent Doctor <hi>Sagnadiah</hi> saith, that these weeks are years; witness that which he saith afterwards, <hi>cap.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>till three weeks of days</hi> (that is, years) <hi>were fulfilled;</hi> but he mentioneth not with the weeks 70 days. <hi>For Behold they are like</hi> 7 <hi>Sabbaths of Years:</hi> and right is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; for that half of the Week that he mentioneth, is 1290 days, as I will declare by perfect Demonstration, only the Exposition of these 70 weeks are exceeding hard. Moreover, for that we know not whether these words <hi>[to restrain Rebellion, and to finish erroneous Sins]</hi> be <hi>in laudem,</hi> or <hi>vitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium:</hi> For lo, it's semblable, that from the word <hi>[to cover Iniquity, and to</hi>

                     <hi>anoint the most holy]</hi> that all this is <hi>in laudem,</hi> in Commendation; but these words <hi>[to seal Vision and Prophecy]</hi> cannot be in Commendation.

                     </note> they should be in Commendation.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>Punishment shall happen unto thee.</hi> And so thy Iniquity is perfected and finished, thy Punishment is ended; and it is in the ill sense. But the Replyer may answer, that these words <hi>[erroneous Sin,</hi> and <hi>Trespass]</hi> as also that word <hi>[I beseech thee take away now,</hi> &amp;c.] are contrary to those words <hi>[and her Iniquity is taken away.]</hi> But lo the whole shall be expounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning of the place; but these words, <hi>to bring in eternal Righteousness,</hi> do shew that they are in Commendation.</p>
                  <p>And the sense of <hi>[to seal Vision]</hi> is, the understanding of the Prophets, which have prophesied of the Subject of the second Temple. And now I will tell the meaning of, that eminent <hi>Gaon,</hi> he saith, That the exposition of <hi>[the word went forth]</hi> is, That God had decreed that <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with the second Temple, should he waste 490 Years, which are the 70 Weeks.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60492:167"/>
Only thou hast erred in thine Account, when the 70 Years were compleat and ended, and they are but only seven Weeks, which make 49 Years; and thou needest not be curious to mention the Years, for they were 51.</p>
                  <p>And the meaning <hi>[to Messias the Prince]</hi> is, <hi>Cyrus</hi> the King. And he hath brought a Reason from the words of the Prophet; <hi>Thus saith the Lord to</hi> Cyrus <hi>his Messias, or anointed One, whose right hand I have strengthned.</hi> And the 62 Weeks are the Days, <hi>i. e.</hi> Years, of the second House. But lae there is a difficulty, for the Angel saith, <hi>In the beginning of thy Supplications,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Abben Ezra</hi> confutes Rabby <hi>Sagnadiah,</hi> as before.</note> 
                     <hi>the Word went forth.</hi> Again, how can the Years of the Captivity be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Years of the second Temple Or, how should we expound, to <hi>restrain Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>to finish Error</hi> Again, what shall become of the Week that remains Of which he saith, <hi>[he will confirm the Covenant for many in one Week]</hi> after the 62 Weeks; and it were meet to mention, that yet three Weeks do remain.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, his proof that <hi>Cyrus</hi> is the Messias, is not right; for that <hi>[to his Messias]</hi> is as much as to his <hi>Prophet;</hi> for so it is written for that, <hi>that the Lord hath anointed me.</hi> But before I speak my Opinion, I will expound these words, <hi>(He will confirm the Covenant for many).</hi> It is a thing manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, that <hi>Titus</hi> made a Covenant with <hi>Israel</hi> for seven years; and that three years and an half, the <hi>daily Sacrifice ceased,</hi> before the destruction <note place="margin">I, but not by <hi>Titus,</hi> but by <hi>Antiochus.</hi>

                  <p>Dan. 9. 27. And he saith, [with the <note n="*" place="margin">Wing of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Souldiers.</note>

                     <hi>Pecuniam qui habet, non refert, &amp; qui refert, non habet. At gratiam qui refert, habet, &amp; qui habet refert.</hi> Accept therefore this my <hi>Literarum Manus,</hi> by which now I prove that plainly unto you, which long ago I affirmed in conference, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Israel</hi> passed not over the Red Sea <hi>transversum,</hi> as you with others have supposed.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Israel</hi> coming out of the Sea, arrived and landed at the self-same side <note place="margin">Major.</note> of the Wilderness, from which he departed when he entred the Sea: Then did he not go over the Red Sea <hi>transversum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Israel</hi> coming out of the Sea, arrived and landed at the self-same side <note place="margin">Minor.</note> of the Wilderness, from which he departed when he entred the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, <hi>Israel</hi> did not go over the Sea <hi>transversum.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Concl.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> Proposition cannot be denied. For if he went into and out of the Sea, keeping still the same side, he did not pass over-thwart the Sea, which is the breadth thereof, from one side to another.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proved out of the Text, in express words. They came from <hi>Succoth</hi> to <hi>Etham,</hi> in the edg of the Wilderness, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 20. <hi>Num.</hi> 33. 6. And returned from <hi>Etham</hi> to <hi>Pihahiroth,</hi> encamping by the Sea, <hi>Num.</hi> 33. 7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 1. &amp; 9. and passing <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>From which collation of places it appears, that <hi>Abben Ezra</hi> his Opinion is true, <q>We know (saith he) that there is no Red Sea between <hi>Egypt</hi> and the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> neither was there any need that they should go into the Red Sea, for that it was their way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> only God commanded them so to do, to the end that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> might go in after them and be drowned. Now from the Wilderness of <hi>Etham, Israel</hi> entred the Sea, and into the Wilderness of <hi>Etham</hi> they went out again.</q>

                     </gap>) and so I have read over the whole Tractate (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>), but there is not any word touching the duration of the Babylonian Kingdom, or any other Kingdom. It only handleth on what days the <gap reason="foreign">

nor <hi>Bartinorah</hi>'s Comment, for that would require many days, and I found no one word in the Text tending any thing at all towards any such Matter; and therefore, my Lord, I would be glad to know what Author referred you to that Tractate of <hi>Megillah,</hi> or whether your Grace hath mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: I humbly thank your Grace for your Lordship's last kindness unto me, when I was at <hi>Much-Haddam,</hi> for defraying my Charges at mine Inn. And now, my Lord, <hi>vetus conferendo beneficium invitas novum.</hi> It hath pleased my Lord <hi>Carew,</hi> who lieth at <hi>Nonesuch,</hi> some mile and an half from <hi>Sutton,</hi> before whose Honour I have often preached, to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to write his Letter to the Right Honourable my Lord Keeper, Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Coventry,</hi> that he would be pleased, at his Request, to bestow a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on me, when any shall fall in his Gift. And he was pleased moreover to send the Letter by Sir <hi>Thomas Stafford</hi> to my Lord Keeper, to sollicit the Matter also by word of mouth. And so I was there at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and presented my self to my Lord Keeper; who gave me his hand, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, that within three months, or sooner, he assured himself he should provide for me. And now, my Lord, my request is, that your Grace would be pleased to write your Letter also unto my Lord Keeper, in my behalf, to this effect, having relation to my Lord <hi>Carew</hi>'s Precedent; That whereas your Lordship is informed, that my Lord <hi>Carew</hi> hath sollicited my Lord Keeper to bestow a Benefice on one <hi>Ralph Skynner,</hi> Minister and Preacher of the Word at <hi>Sutton,</hi> (under Mr. <hi>Glover)</hi> a Man of honest Life and Conversation, and conformable to the Orders of our Church, and so forth, as it shall please your Lordship to write of me, that you would be pleased to second my Lord <hi>Carew</hi>'s Request effectually, for that I am but <hi>mediocris fortunae Vir,</hi> and have not means and maintenance to buy me Books, and other Necessaries. This your Grace's Letter, in my behalf to my Lord Keeper, if your Lordship would be pleased to send it before <hi>Christide,</hi> inclosed in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s, and to give me leave to seal it, after I have read it, it's likely my Lord Keeper would remember me the sooner.</p>
                  <p>I have given my Lord <hi>Carew</hi> satisfaction in many Questions, at sundry times of conference; and especially in these three, 1. That the Pope and Conclave be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 2. That the Points and Vowels were given by God from <hi>Sinai,</hi> and not the invention of the <hi>Masorits.</hi> 3. That the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Tongue is the most ancient Tongue, and that <hi>Moses</hi> wrote in it, and not in the Caldee and Egyptian; and all this proved expresly out of the Text of the Scripture: For which my Lord hath given me a greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation in the ancient Tongues, to my Lord Keeper, than I either have deserved, or can answer unto. And thus, with my humble Service to your Grace, I end,</p>

                  <p>BEsides my many obligations of Service to your Grace, I am in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar engaged in an expedite and resolute method of calculating Eclipses, which I hope to accomplish to your Grace's Content, and would now have presented the same, but that many other pursuits in my Astronomical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story have taken up my time. Presently after my return from your Grace, I made haste to <hi>London,</hi> but could find nothing of <hi>Dee's</hi> Books, but bare Titles, whereof some did very much please me, and encourage me to make a diligent enquiry after them. I reforted to Sir <hi>Rob. Cotton</hi> (with very kind welcome) but his Books being not yet ordered in a Catalogue, I deferred my search there till another opportunity, and now am bold to enter your Grace's <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> with humble request that I may have the names of such Mathematical Books as were <hi>Dee's.</hi> It may be I shall find those Books, whose Titles did promise so much. If I had the Books at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I would make an abstract of all things making to Astronomical History and Chronography, the two chief Objects of my Enquiry, and safely return the Books and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract to your Grace.</p>
                  <p>Being at <hi>London,</hi> I procured an Arabick Book of Astronomy, the Tables whereof I do perfectly understand, but the Canons annexed are more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and yet do so much the more incite me to find out that particular mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is not possible without knowledg in the Arabick; wherefore I have made entrance into the Rudiments thereof, and hope <hi>(labore &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiâ)</hi> at length to be able to translate any Arabick Book of Mathematicks. It is a difficult thing which I undertake, but the great hopes I have in that happy <hi>Arabia</hi> to find most precious Stones, for the adorning and enriching my <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:60492:173"/>
and Chronology, and amongst the rest a good Arabick Copy of the Alko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, the only Book whereby that Language is attained. If your Grace have one already, I humbly request the use thereof for some time; for ours are bound Prisoners in the Library, wherein are many Arabick Books, but <hi>aut ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re nescio-quo, de re nescio qua.</hi> I hope to bring them in <hi>lucem meliorem,</hi> and with them many others, if I may have the gracious Rays of your favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able assistance. I am not yet come to the closure of my Apology, I beseech your Grace's patience a while.</p>
                  <p>Besides my Enquiries, I am very busy in the Fabrick of a large Instrument for Observations, that I may, <hi>mea fide,</hi> both teach and write; and here again I humbly entreat you to take in your Consideration my Petition at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that you would as occasion shall be offered commend to the Munificence of some noble Benefactors this excellent and rare part of Astronomy (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I may not forget, in my return from your Grace, I called on Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> to see his <hi>Leland,</hi> and there in the Catalogue of Books in <hi>Worcester</hi> Church I found, <hi>Commentarii 'Dunchagt praesulis Hybernensis in Mart.

I spake to the Dean of <hi>Worcester</hi> (who was with me at <hi>Oxford)</hi> about it, but he made no esteem thereof. Yet if it please your Grace, I will cause it to be perused.

                  <p>AFter I had writ the former Lines, came to my hands your Lordship's Letter of the <hi>31th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> from <hi>Oxford;</hi> whereto I have given due perusal, and thereby take notice, that your Grace hath received mine of the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> with the Books sent you by the Ship <hi>Patience</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> being very glad thereof, but more joy ful that your Lordship finds such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in them, being sorry that I am not able to perform to the full what you desire.</p>
                  <p>The Patriarch's Name that sold me the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> is, <hi>Jesu Jáb;</hi> which in the Chaldee Tongue, is as much as to say, <hi>Jesus give me</hi> And
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:60492:174"/>
whereas I writ he was a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> I pray take notice that he is a <hi>Nestorian,</hi> and hath his residence in <hi>Emite</hi> and <hi>Zert,</hi> and continually comes to this Town to visit them that are of that Heresy. His promise to me he hath not kept, neither could I ever hear from him since he sent me that Book, now in your Lordships possession; yet I caused divers Letters to be writ to him, and at this present have given order to write to him again: But as I often writ to your Grace, those Books are rare, especially in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Tongue and Character; the greatest part of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Books, are written in the <hi>Arab</hi> Character, which I think you would not have, nor esteem. As for the remainder of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> in the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> I have sent a Man to Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> to take a Copy thereof, intending to send you the whole <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in one Volume; notwithstanding I know you have the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Psalms;</hi> those you have, are old Copies, and this will be a new Transcript, presuming your Lordship will not think much of the Charge, which if I had excepted, would have been very little less than now it will be. And as for the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Books, in the hands of the Damasceen Spahee, I will use my best diligence to find him out again, and redeem them at as easy a rate as I can. And so continue my care in accomplishing your Lordship's Will in every thing, desiring the benefit of your particular Prayers. And so fearing to be further troublesom to your Grace, humbly take my leave, and remain,</p>

                     <salute>My good Lord,</salute>

                  <p>IAcknowledg my self much bounden unto you, for your Letter sent me from <hi>Liverpool,</hi> in your return to <hi>Ireland.</hi> Yet I confess I had not from this place, where now I am, returned you thanks, but that I was desirous to acquaint you with an Accident lately fallen out; some Circumstances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I had better occasion to know, than many my betters. It concerneth my Lady <hi>Faukland.</hi> She, within this fortnight, hath declared her self to be a Papist. One of the Priests who perverted her, goeth under the Name of <hi>Fitz Gerard,</hi> though his true Name is <hi>George Pettinger,</hi> a <hi>York-shire</hi> Man, an idle p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Savile,</hi> to whom he was well known; and by some Gentlemen of his own Kindred. Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:60492:174"/>
are sensible of the disgrace which they sustain by reason of her fall. Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> told her, That dying an English Papist, she died in the state of Damnation. Mr. <hi>Coosens</hi> told her, That she had sinned damnably in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from that Church wherein she was born and baptized, before she had consulted with the Governors thereof. Besides, Mr. <hi>Coosens</hi> gave her a few Notes, which she sent unto her Priest to answer: whose Answer came to my hands; and in my poor Opinion, was a very silly one. Yet Mr. <hi>Coosens</hi> would not reply, but took his farewel of the Lady, without purpose of ever visiting her again. She protested, that if ever she turned again, she will turn Puritan, not Moderate Protestant, as she phraseth it; for Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Protestants, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Coosens,</hi> &amp;c. are farther from Catholicks than Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans. And thus much concerning her, who, for any thing I know, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fallen from Grace, nor to Grace.</p>
                  <p>Here is 15000 <hi>l.</hi> offered (as it's said) for the Bishoprick of <hi>Winchester,</hi> by the Dean of <hi>Winchester:</hi> And some say it is worth it, for he may make of the Leases, at his first entrance, 10000 <hi>l.</hi> The other Bishopricks are rated proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and destinated to Men of corrupt Minds. Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> is Dean of the Chappel; and Dr. <hi>White</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carlisle. Chamierus</hi> is lately come forth against <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> they are sold as fast as they come over: But Mr. <hi>Fether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> looks daily for 40 more, of which I hope to have one. The Papists brag, that God hath not shewed himself a <hi>Hugonite</hi> for these three years last past. They have great hopes, but I trust their hopes shall perish. Yet wise Men are afraid of what may follow; and are more inquisitive than heretofore to know, Whether Dotage may not be wrought by Sorcery. I shall be glad to see your second part of the <hi>Succession of Christian Churches;</hi> or any thing else of yours against the common Adversary. Your Lordship had need now to do something, for few go with a right foot, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are many.</p>
                  <p>I thought, all this while, I had been writing to Mr. <hi>Usher,</hi> which made me write so carelesly; but ere-now my Memory serves to tell me, that it is my Lord Primat of <hi>Armagh,</hi> to whom I ought to have written more respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively: yet I cannot find in my heart to burn what I have written, but to pass it a way as it is, not doubting of a pardon from your Lordship, if for no other respect, yet for this, that I live in the North, where we know not well what Manners mean. And so with remembrance of my humble Duty and Service, I rest,</p>

                  <p>MY diligence hath not been wanting, either in treating with my Lords the Bishops when they were present, or in writing unto them when they were absent, touching the Augmentation, and the present paiment of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:60492:175"/>
the Loan-monies, demanded of the Clergy in the Province of <hi>Armagh.</hi> The Augmentation with one Voice, they did deny; alledging, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in your Letters directed unto them, did not propound any indefinite Sum to be levied according to their Discretions; but a precise one, of 395 <hi>l.</hi> and 4 <hi>s.</hi> for one months pay of the new Supplies in <hi>Ulster.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for the present paiment of that Sum, order hath been already taken, that (according to your Lordships special Directions) 70 <hi>l.</hi> should be delivered unto Sir <hi>William Calfield.</hi> One hundred twenty one Pounds, and a Noble, I have since received; which is ready to be delivered unto any one who shall be authorized to receive the same under your Lordship's Hand. The Bishop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> who hath already paid half of that Sum which was assigned unto Sir <hi>William Calfield,</hi> is there at <hi>Dublin,</hi> ready to give an account of that which remaineth due upon his Clergy. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Derry</hi> hath left with me his Ticket, wherein he undertakes to pay 50 <hi>l.</hi> unto any one of the Captains to whom your Lordship shall appoint. Upon the Diocess of <hi>Meath,</hi> there was 85 <hi>l.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> taxed in this Levy; which is the double twentieth part of the Clergy there; the twentieth part of the Bishoprick it self being abated, because the Bishop is yet in First-Fruits. For this I have used my utmost endeavour, both with the Bishop and with his Clergy; but could not prevail, to get from them more than 50 <hi>l.</hi> And therefore of them I must rid my self, and wholly leave them unto your Lordship.</p>
                  <p>As for the Remain of the Total Sum, betwixt this and the beginning of the Term, I will use my best endeavour to get in what may be had, and give a particular Certificate of the Names of those who will not pay; to the end your Lordship may deal with them, as in your Wisdom you shall think fit. And so expecting your Lordship's further Commands in this, or any other Service, I humbly take leave for the present, and ever-more rest,</p>

Yet so is it fallen out for the present, that I am enforced to discharge one piece of debt with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into another. For thus doth the case stand with us. Sir <hi>William Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> who hath governed our Colledg at <hi>Dublin</hi> these seventeen Years, finding Age and Weakness now to encrease upon him, hath resolved to ease himself of that Burthen, and resign the same to some other. Now of all others whom we could think of, your worthy Preacher Mr. <hi>Sibbs</hi> is the Man upon whom all our Voyces have here settled; as one that hath been well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an Academical Life, and singularly well qualified for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of such a place of Government. I am not ignorant, what damage you are to sustain by the loss of such an able Man, with whose Ministry you have been so long acquainted: but I consider withal, that you are at the Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, where the defect may quickly be supplied; and that it somewhat also tendeth to the honour of your Society, that out of all the King's Dominions your House should be singled out, for the place unto which the Seminary of the whole Church in this Kingdom should have recourse for help and succor in this case. And therefore my most earnest suit unto you is, that you would give leave unto Mr. <hi>Sibbes</hi> to repair hither, at leastwise for a time, that he may see how the place will like him.

                  <p>I Wrote unto your Grace heretofore concerning the Substitution of Mr. <hi>Sibbes</hi> into the place of Sir <hi>William Temple.</hi> But having since considered with my self, how some occasions may fall out that may hinder him from coming hither; and how many most unfit Persons are now putting in for that place: I have further emboldened my self to signify thus much more of my Mind unto you, That in case Mr. <hi>Sibbes</hi> do not come unto us, I cannot think of a more worthy Man, and more fit for the Government of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, than Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> who hath heretofore remained with Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> and is now beneficed about <hi>Berry.</hi> If either he, or Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> or any other worthy Man whom you shall think fit, can be induced to accept of the place; and your Grace will be pleased to advise the Fellows of the Colledg to elect him thereunto: That poor house shall ever have cause to bless your Memory for the Settlement of it at such a time as this, where so many labour to make a Prey of it.</p>
                  <p>In ordering the Affairs that do belong unto the Primacy, the greatest trouble that I yet meet withal, is the Persidiousness of the Register, whom my Predecessor hath fastened upon me. He hath combined with one <hi>Chase</hi> (a base Fellow that is now acting this business at Court) to overthrow the Ministry which King <hi>James</hi> (by your Grace's special Incitation) hath so happily planted in the Diocess of <hi>Armagh,</hi> by making the Rectories that did belong to the Vicars Chorals of <hi>Armagh</hi> to be Lay-fee; unto which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents have been hitherto (by his Majesties own Direction) still presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the Livings also taxed with payment of First-fruits, as all other presentative Livings are. <hi>Dawson</hi> is a Man so notoriously branded for his lewd Carriage, that I dare not trust him with the keeping of the Records, or suffer him any ways to intermeddle with the businesses of the Church. To see therefore whether I can fairly rid my hands of him; I have made a grant of his places unto others, and so left them to the trial of their Titles by course of Law: Which hath so incensed <hi>Dawson,</hi> that he laboureth now by his Emissary <hi>Chase</hi> to disgrace me in Court with all the Calumnies that his wicked Heart can devise. Wherein I doubt not but your Grace, (as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion shall require) will be ready to stand for me in my just defence.</p>
                  <p>As for the general state of things here, they are so desperate, that I am afraid to write any thing thereof. Some of the adverse part have asked me the question, Where I have heard or read before, that Religion and Mens Souls should be set to sale after this manner unto whom I could reply nothing, but that I had read in <hi>Mantuan,</hi> that there was another place in the World, where <hi>Coelum est venale, Deus<expan>

                  <p>I procured a meeting of all the Prelates at my House; who with one voice protested against these Courses, and subscribed this Protestation of theirs with their hands. But forasmuch as we knew that the Project was wonderful distastful unto the Papists themselves; we contained our selves in publick, and suffered the Breach to come from their side. I know their Agents are not asleep at Court; but our hope is, that your Grace is as vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant there to make opposition unto their Practices; and to advise of some

                  <head>LETTER CXVII. <hi>A Letter from Dr.</hi> Ward <hi>to the most Reverend</hi> James Usher <hi>Arch-bishop of</hi> Armagh.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Most Reverend, and my very good Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>MY best Service premised, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I received your Lordship's last Letters to me dated from <hi>Leverpool;</hi> and have heard by others since of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's safe arrival in <hi>Ireland.</hi> As touching Sir <hi>Gerard Harvy,</hi> I have been with him at <hi>Hadham</hi> since, and have had Letters once or twice about his business from him. I consulted with Mr. <hi>Whalley,</hi> and wrote to Sir <hi>Gerard</hi> what Fine will be expected besides his coming in Rent-corn, which he is willing to pay. The Fine will be about 200 <hi>l.</hi> for renewing his Lease, and adding of ten Years to the time he hath; about Easter he will be with us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
                  <p>I am sorry your Lordship missed of that Epistle of <hi>Chrysostom ad Caesarium Monachum,</hi> at <hi>Oxford.</hi> I was in good hope your Lordship would have hit upon it. It is to be feared it is purloin'd away.</p>
                  <p>I received Mr. <hi>Boys</hi> his <hi>variae lectiones in Liturgiam Basilii,</hi> which your Lordship left to be sent him. I spake with Mr. <hi>Patrick Young,</hi> who telleth me, that <hi>Sirmondus</hi> hath all <hi>Fronto</hi>'s Papers, and that he is in hand with <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and that after he is set out, I shall have my Transcript upon the <hi>Psalms.</hi> He saith your Lordship hath the Greek Transcript of <hi>Euthymius.</hi> I have seen <hi>Athanasius Graecol.</hi> newly set forth at <hi>Paris;</hi> it hath some Homilies added by one <hi>Holstein,</hi> but it wanteth the <hi>varia lectiones</hi> which are in <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>'s Edition. <hi>Eusebius</hi> in three Volumes <hi>Graecol.</hi> is daily expected, but not yet come.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>White,</hi> now Bishop of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> hath sold all his Books to <hi>Hills</hi> the Broker. His Pretence is the charge of Carriage so far by Land, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by Water. Some think he paid for his Place. I did hear of his Censure of your Lordship, which I would not have believed, but that I heard it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly reported about the time of your Lordship's departure hence.</p>
                  <p>Sundry Bishopricks are still remaining unbestowed. The Precedent is not good.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Court and Commonwealth-affairs here, I suppose you have better Information than my Pen can afford. I would I could be a Messenger by my Letter of better news than any I hear here.</p>
                  <p>The 25th of <hi>January</hi> deceased your good Friend and mine Mr. <hi>Henry Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> I was with him twice when he was sick: the first time I found him sick, but very patient, and comfortable. He earnestly prayed that God would give him Patience and Perseverance. The later time I came he was
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:60492:177"/>
in a slumber, and did speak nothing: I prayed for him, and then departed. Shortly after he departed this Life: He desired to be buried privatly, and in the Church-yard, and in a Sheet only without a Coffin, for so, said he, was our Saviour. But it was thought fitting he should be put in a Coffin, and so he was: I was at his interring the next day at night. Thus God is daily collecting his Saints to himself. The Lord prepare us all for the <hi>Dies accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionis,</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> stileth it. Since the decease of Dr. <hi>Walsall,</hi> Dr. <hi>Goslin</hi> our Vice-Chancellor, and Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> Master of <hi>Katherine-Hall,</hi> are both dead. In their places succeed, in <hi>Bennet-Colledg,</hi> Dr. <hi>Butts;</hi> in <hi>Caius-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bachcroft,</hi> one of the Fellows; in <hi>Katherine-Hall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sibbs</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the place of <hi>Chrysostom, Homilia de Encaeniis,</hi> which you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your last Letters, I cannot write now as I would, I having not my Book by me. My last Lecture was touching it. I see a great difference in the Reading, between the reading in the Manuscript of <hi>New-Colledg</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> which Sir <hi>H. Savill</hi> printed, and the reading in <hi>M. Baraciro,</hi> which is in the Notes of Sir <hi>H. Savill.</hi> The Latin Translation is answerable to that of <hi>New-Colledg.</hi> That speech, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, gave occasion (I think) to <hi>Damascene</hi> to say the like. Though I do somewhat suspect some corruption by later Grecians in that Point; especially <hi>Origen</hi> writing to the contrary, as you know, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. In the similitude following from <hi>Wax,</hi> the words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is translated in the Latin Translation, <hi>nihil remanet substantiae;</hi> contrary as I conceive to the Greek, for it should be, <hi>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil substantiae perdit.</hi> For <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>est, aliquid substantiae perdo.</hi> It is not easy to conceive the sense of that Similitude, both for the <hi>Protasis,</hi> and <hi>Apodosis.</hi> But of this when I come home at better leasure.</p>
                  <p>I do purpose (God willing) in my Determinations, when I shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute upon any, to go in the Point of Free-will, for that (as I conceive) it is the chief ground of the rest of the Errors maintained by the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants, or at least, of most of them.</p>
                  <p>I have been here above a fortnight, for to get a License of Mortmain for the holding of 240 Acres of Capite Land, which a Gentleman would give to our Colledg; but I find great difficulty in effecting it, so as I fear me I must return, <hi>re infectâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you would be pleased to send Mr. <hi>Lively</hi>'s Chronology, I think Mr. <hi>Whalley</hi> would see to the publishing of it.</p>
                  <p>And thus with tender of my best Service, and my best Wishes and Prayers, for the happy success of your good Designs, and prospering of all your Endeavours; and for the publick Peace and Safety of both the Nations, Yours and Ours, in these tottering and troublesome Times, I commend your Lordship, and all yours, to the gracious protection of the highest Majesty.</p>

                  <head>LETTER CXVIII. <hi>A Letter from the Right Honorable the Lord Deputy</hi> Falkland, <hi>to the most Reverend</hi> James Usher <hi>Arch-bishop of</hi> Armagh.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOur judicious apprehension of the Perils which threaten the Peace of this Kingdom, which your dutiful consideration of the King's Wants, through his other manifold Occasions of Expence, together with your Zeal to his Service, is clearly manifested, by conforming your Tenants to the good Example of others, to join with the rest of the Inhabitants, in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the relief of the new Supplies, and other Souldiers sent hither for the publick Defence, notwithstanding your Privileges of Exemption, by Patent, from such Taxes; which I will take a fitting occasion to make known to his Majesty, for your Honour.</p>
                  <p>And where your Lordship doth complain, that other Country Charges are imposed upon your Tenants, whereof you conceive they ought to be free, by virtue of your Patent: I can give no direct answer thereunto, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I be informed from your Lordship of what Nature they be; but do faithfully assure your Lordship, that neither my Lord <hi>Chichester,</hi> nor my Lord <hi>Grandison,</hi> did ever shew more respect to your Predecessors, than I will be ready to perform towards your Lordship, as well in this your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as in all other things which lie in my Power, (not being prejudicial to the King's Service, which I know is as much as your Lordship will ever desire); and do pray your Lordship to send me a Copy of their Warrants for my information, what hath been done in that behalf before my Time.</p>
                  <p>I have kept Sir <hi>Charles Cootes</hi> Company from that County as long as I could, and will remove them thence as soon as I can conveniently: But your Lordship may please to understand, that by the earnest intercession of some well-willers to that County, it hath been less burthened with Souldiers, than any other within that Province; saving only <hi>Fermannagh,</hi> which is much smaller in scope than it.</p>
                  <p>And for the Distinction you desire to be made between your Town-Lands, which you alleadg are generally less by one half, than those that are held by others; that Error cannot be reformed without a general admea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surement, and valluation of the different Fertilities; for we all know that a hundred Acres in a good Soil, may be worth a thousand Acres of Lands that are mountainous and barren, and therefore it will surely prove a Work of great difficulty, and will require a long time to reduce it to any perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so as it is best to observe the custom in usage, until such a reformation shall be seriously debated and agreed upon.</p>
                  <p>For the Bridg to be built at <hi>Charlemount,</hi> it was propounded to the Board by the Lord <hi>Caulfield;</hi> he informing, that the old one was so decayed, that it could hardly last out another Year. The usesul Consequence of that Bridg, in time of War, guarded by a strong Fort, (which Defence others want) being well known to the Table, did make it a short Debate, every Man concurring in Opinion, with an unanimous consent, that it was most necessary for the King's Service, that a substantial Bridg should be erected there with expedition. Then the Question grew, At whose Charge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the King's or Countries Which, upon mature debate was ordered, that the Country should bear, as well for that it is a place of equal conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:60492:178"/>
with any other that is or can be made elsewhere, for passage of the Inhabitants over that deep River in times of Peace, as because they shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy great security by their Neighbourhoods to that strong Fort of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi> (in times of Combustion) built and maintained without their Charge. These Considerations did move us to give direction to certain of the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace, of each of these Counties of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and <hi>Armagh,</hi> to view the place, and treat with Workmen; which they accordingly did. Upon whose Certificate, we gave Warrant to applot the same, according to their Agreement with Workmen; which I wish may be levied without opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or interruption; and do make it my request unto your Lordship, to give way and furtherance thereunto, for this Work, tending so much to the Service of the King and Country, which I shall take in very good part from your Lordship; and you cannot want your Reward in Heaven for it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Work of that kind which is accounted pious. And so I commit your Lorship to God's protection, and rest,</p>

You shall do well to pray to God that he will bless his Church; but be not too sollicitous in that Matter which will fall of it self, God Almighty being able and ready to support his own Cause. But of all things, take heed that you project no new ways; for if they fail, you shall bear a grievous Burthen: If they prosper, there shall be no Thanks to you. Be patient, and tarry the Lord's leasure. And so commending me unto you, and to the rest of your Brethren, I leave you to the Almighty, and remain,</p>

                  <p>MAY it please your Lordship to take a view of my Proceedings, for the procuring of such Books you gave me order for; such as I could get, and have in readiness to be sent by our next Ships, (which may depart this Port about four months hence) are certain Books, and loose Papers in the Samaritan Tongue, of what use or value I cannot learn. The Old Testament in the Chaldean, which after seventeen months time, is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a fair Character, wanting only the Book of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Esdras.</hi> I have also a small Tract of <hi>Ephraems</hi> in the Syriack. I have used the best means I could to procure the New Testament in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byssins</hi> Language and Character, but to this day have not been able. Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days past I sent again to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to try if it, or any other of the Books your Lordship would have in the Samaritan Tongue may be had. For obtaining whereof, I have made use of the favour of a Gentleman of <hi>Veniee,</hi> that is Consul for that Nation in this Place, who I presume will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to satisfy my great desire in this Particular; and if he fail me, I have no farther hopes of prevailing. I am sorry that I can do no better service in a business that may be so beneficial (as your Grace hath intimated) to the Church of God, and so acceptable to your self. Such Papers as I have, or can procure, shall (God willing) with a Note of their Cost and Charges, be sent by our Ships aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>News this place affords not worth your knowledg. By our last Letters from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> they write of great preparation for the Wars, and that they will this Spring go against the Rebel <hi>Abbassa,</hi> that holds the City of <hi>Assaraune.</hi> In their last Years Siege of that place, they lost many Men, and much Honour. The Common Adversary (the <hi>Persian)</hi> in the mean while hath time to provide himself to welcome the Turks, when they shall think good to visit him. They write also from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that a Greek Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, or Bishop, (that spent three Years in <hi>England)</hi> was resolved to print (being furnished out of <hi>Christondom</hi> with all things necessary, having leave of the <hi>Caymo-cham)</hi> some of the Greek Fathers, whose Writings it should seem the Papists have abused. Which when the Jesuits that live in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> understood, they went to the Bashaw, and told him. That the Greek, under pretence of Printing, would coin and stamp false Mony: Whereupon, without examination of the Business, order was given to apprehend and instantly to hang the old Man; his House and Goods to be seised upon for the King's use: The latter was effected, but God so provided, that the Man was at that instant of time in our Ambassador's House: where the Officers came to take him, and execute that tyrannical Sentence. But the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor examining the Business, undertook his Protection, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I Have received the Chronicle of <hi>Ireland,</hi> penn'd by my Uncle, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Mr. <hi>Molineux;</hi> together with the History of <hi>Ireland,</hi> compiled by <hi>Edmund Campian.</hi> I have cursorily ran them both over, and do find some defects in both, not only in Orthography, by reason of the unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Transcriber, but also in the Sense, by reason of dissonancy in the coherence, and the very Context it self. But as it is, I do purpose (God willing) to send it this week to <hi>London</hi> unto some Friends of mine, to give the Printers there a view of the Volume; as also to deal with them touching the Profit that may be raised to the advancement of the Widow, my Aunt. I will not fail to prefix in the Epigraphe and Title to Mr. <hi>Campian</hi>'s History, that direction which your Lordship very kindly affordeth in your loving Letter. And I am sensible enough, that <hi>Campian</hi>'s Name, honoured with your Grace's Publication to the Work, will be a Countenance unto it, and much further the sale. And for Mr. <hi>Daniel Molineux,</hi> not only my self, but the whole Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> together with this of great <hi>Britain,</hi> shall owe a large beholdenness unto him. If it please God that the Work take success for the Press, I will take care that his Name, for his care and pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking therein, shall live and have a being in the memory of Posterity, so long as the Books shall live. When the Copies shall be returned from <hi>London,</hi> and the Printer agreed withal, I and my Friends here will review them again, and again, and to our Capacities make them fit for the Press; for I find, by perusing, that such a Work must be framed by such Men as be skilful, both in the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Welsh</hi> Tongues, and reasonably versed in their Stories. Between this and <hi>Michaelmass</hi> I hope to bring all Passages to perfection, and agreement with the Printer, and then I will not fail to certify your Grace of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: Till when, and ever, I commit you and yours to the Grace of the Almighty.

                  <p>YOur Letter of the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> came not unto my hands before the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>November.</hi> And to give you full satisfaction in that which you desired out of my Samaritan Text; I caused the whole fifth Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> to be taken out of it, as you see, and so much of the <hi>11th</hi> as concerneth the Chronology you have to deal with. The Letters in the second and third Leaf, are more perfectly expressed than those in the first; and therefore you were best take them for the Pattern of those which you intend to follow in your Print, there being but 22 of them in number, without any difference of Initials and Finals, and without any distinction of Points and Accents. Matrices may be easily cast for them all, without any great Charge; which if you can perswade your Printer to undertake, I will freely communicate to him the Collection of all the Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Text of the Jews, and the Samaritans, throughout the whole Pentateuch; a Work which would very greedily be sought for by the Learned Abroad; howsoever such things are not much regarded by ours at Home. The Original it self, after the Collation is perfected, I have dedicated to the Library of our Noble Friend Sir <hi>Robert Cotton.</hi>

                  <p>In the Samaritan Chronology, published by <hi>Scaliger, Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de Emend. temp. pag.</hi> 618. there are reckoned 130 Years from <hi>Adam</hi>

Which <hi>Scaliger,</hi> in his Notes upon the place, <hi>(pag.</hi> 243. <hi>a)</hi> would have reformed according to his Samaritan Chronography. But that <hi>Eusebius</hi> was in the right, and his Chronography wrong, appeareth now plainly by the <hi>Samaritan</hi>'s own Text of the Bible: Only one fault there is in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> (or in the corrupt Copy of <hi>Georgius Syncellus</hi> rather, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> used) <hi>in annis</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>patrum ante Diluvium:</hi> Namely, in the 60 Years attributed to <hi>Exoch.</hi> Which to have been miswritten for 65 appeareth, not only by the consent of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, both Chronicle and Text, but also by the total sum of the Years from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Flood; which as well in <hi>Ensebius</hi> (pag. 9. <hi>Graeci Chronici,</hi> lin. 10. &amp; pag. 19. lin. 36.) as in <hi>Georgius Syncellus,</hi> is noted to be <hi>anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> 1307; which <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his Notes (pag. 248 <hi>b.</hi> and 249 <hi>b)</hi> doth wrongfully mend 1327. and, (pag. 243 <hi>a)</hi> with a greater Error, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with the time of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Birth, blaming <hi>George</hi> the Monk for extending them (as the truth was) to the Year of the Flood. From the Creation to the Flood, according to the Hebrew Verity, are 1656 Years; according to the Samaritan Text 1307; according to <hi>Eusebius</hi> his reckoning out of the Septuagint, 2242; and according to <hi>Africanus,</hi> 2262. <hi>George</hi> followeth <hi>Eusebius</hi> his Account, which he noteth to be 20 Years less than that of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus;</hi> 186 greater than the Hebrew, and 935 greater than the Samaritan; for that he meant so, and not as it is written (pag. 243 <hi>a.

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:60492:180"/>
betwixt the Hebrew Account (which every one knoweth to be 1656) and the Samaritan to be <hi>annorum</hi> 349. Now for the Years that these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lived, <hi>post</hi>

                     </gap>. <hi>Adhuc tamen restat te vindice dignus nodus.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in his Hebrew Questions upon <hi>Genesis,</hi> affirmeth, that he found the Year of <hi>Mathusalah</hi> and <hi>Lamech</hi> to be alike; <hi>in Hebraeis Samaritanorum Libris.</hi> And indeed the Hebrew hath, as he setteth it down, that <hi>Mathusalah</hi> lived 187 Years before he begat <hi>Noah.</hi> But in the Samaritan Text it is far otherwise; that <hi>Mathusalah</hi> lived 67 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he begat <hi>Lamech,</hi> 653 after, 720 in all; and <hi>Lamech</hi> 53 Years before the birth of <hi>Noah.</hi> And these numbers are in the self-same sort related by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who lived before St. <hi>Hierom;</hi> lest any Man should imagine that since his Time the Samaritan Text which we have, might be altered. Now it is to be noted, that by both these Accounts it falleth out, that the Death of <hi>Mathusalah</hi> doth concur with the Year of the Flood: And it is the principal intent of St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in this place, to solve the Difficulty moved out of the Greek Edition, that <hi>Mathusalah</hi> lived 14 Years after the Flood; by appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Books of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> wherein <hi>Mathusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> is made to die, <hi>Eo Anno</hi> (as he speaketh) <hi>quo caepit esse diluvium.</hi> This general peradventure might run in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s memory, when he wrote this, which well might make him think that the particular Numbers of both Texts, did not differ; especially if (as it is likely) he had not the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Text then lying by him to consult withal. But howsoever his slip of memory derogateth nothing from the Credit of that which we are sure was in the Samaritan Text before he committed this to writing.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the Years of the Fathers which lived after the Flood. Wherein for the Time <hi>ante</hi>

                     </gap> (whereupon the course of the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology doth depend) there is an exact agreement betwixt the Samaritan Text and Chronicle. From whom also <hi>Eusebius</hi> doth not dissent; if the Error be amended which hath crept into <hi>pag.</hi> 10. <hi>lin.</hi> 12. (Graeci Chronici) where 130 Years are assigned to <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> instead of 135. For that this was the Error, not of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> but of the Transcriber, appeareth evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both by the Line next going before, where <hi>Sem,</hi> after the begetting of <hi>Arphacsad,</hi> is said to have lived 500 Years, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>post diluvium,</hi> there is a full agreement, both in the total Sum, and in all the Particulars, betwixt the Samaritan Account, and that of the LXX, as it is related by <hi>Eusebius, (Gainan</hi> in both being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) which sum of 942 being added to the former of 1307, maketh up the full number of 2249, from the first of <hi>Adam,</hi> to the <hi>70th</hi> Year of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> the very same Sum which is laid down by <hi>Eusebius, (pag.</hi> 19. <hi>lin.</hi> 37. <hi>Graeci Chronici)</hi> and answereth precisely to the Collection of the Particulars that are found in my Samaritan Bible. In <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Samaritan Chronicle, <hi>(pag.</hi> 618. <hi>Emend.)</hi> the particulars being summed up, amount to 2267, (2365 it is in <hi>Scaliger,</hi> pag. 625.); which number so laid down in the Chronicle, (and partly misreckoned; partly miswritten in the Commentary) is by the same <hi>Scaliger,</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Eusebius (pag.</hi> 249. <hi>b.)</hi> amended 2269 <hi>nimirum</hi>

                     <hi>neque dubium est ita esse,</hi> saith he; of which yet I do very much doubt: or rather do not doubt at all, because I know the Error was not in the Transcriber, but in the Chronologer himself, who accounteth from the Birth of <hi>Noah,</hi> to the Birth of <hi>Arphacsad,</hi> (as did also
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:60492:180"/>
                     <hi>Africanus</hi> and others before him) 600 only; and not (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> and others more rightly) 602; from whence, unto the <hi>70th</hi> of <hi>Terah,</hi> by the joint consent, as well of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> as of the Samaritan Text and Chronicle, there are 940 Years. For <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s 937, (pag. 249. <hi>b. Eusebian.)</hi> is but an Error of that noble Wit, who intending higher Matters, did not heed so much his ordinary Arithmetick. In the numbering of the Years of these Fathers, <hi>post</hi>

                     </gap>, there is not the like consent betwixt the LXX, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, as was before. Our Greek Copies differing very much herein, not only from the Samaritan, but also betwixt themselves. <hi>Eusebius,</hi> pag. 10. <hi>Graeci Chronici,</hi> differeth from my Samaritan Text only in the Years of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gau.</hi> Yet there, <hi>lin.</hi> 15. <hi>in Phalec.</hi> instead of <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>Georgius</hi> the Monk, in his miswritten Copy, finding 207, laboured thus to fit the whole unto the <hi>77th</hi> of <hi>Nachor.</hi> Which I am so much the more easily induced to believe, because in the Chronology of the LXX, related by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> (pag. 9. lin. 37.) <hi>Non dissimile quid ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvertisse mihi videor;</hi> for there the same <hi>Ragau</hi> is said to have begotten <hi>Seruch</hi> at 135 years. <hi>Scaliger</hi> giveth there a mark, that it should be 132, as <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Revelation.</hi> In this Treasure, among other things worth the observation, are found; 1. A Genealogical Table from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses.</hi> 2. A Table of the Judges to <hi>Samuel.</hi> 3. A Table of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Sedechias.</hi> 4. A Chronological Table of the Kings that successively reigned in <hi>Babylon, Persia,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> from thence unto <hi>Vespasian.</hi> Where to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> after the time of <hi>Sedechias,</hi> are assigned 24 years; To <hi>Evilmerodach,</hi> 1. To <hi>Belshatzar,</hi> 2. To <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> 3. To <hi>Cyrus,</hi> 30. To <hi>Cambyses</hi> 8; and all this to make 70 years to the second of <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> from the desolation of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Zachar.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p>In these Tables, some Heathenish Antiquities also are inserted; as of the building of <hi>Tarsus,</hi> &amp;c. But these are nothing in comparison of the <hi>Treasure</hi> which you have found of the Kings and Archons of <hi>Athens:</hi> than which (as you have rightly judged) nothing can please me more. You have made my Teeth water at the mention thereof; and therefore, I pray you, satisfy my longing with what convenient speed you may. I can give you no occasion of Inscriptions, because I am fixed here in a Country where the old Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists never had any footing. All that I have in this kind, I did but borrow from the Monuments of my Lord of <hi>Arundel,</hi> my Lord <hi>William Howard</hi> of <hi>Naworth,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Cotton;</hi> which to send back unto you who are there at the Well-head, were <hi>inanis opera.</hi> Those Hebrew Fragments of <hi>Aldersgate,</hi> had your own explication in Latin adjoined unto them (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) which made me seek no further; especially, because those Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made by later Jews, and so were of the same stamp with that of R. <hi>Moses filii</hi> R. <hi>Isaac</hi> found in <hi>Ludgate</hi> (whereof <hi>Stow</hi> maketh mention in his <hi>Survey).</hi> I think you may do well to put together all the Inscriptions, printed and imprinted, which are not to be found in the great Volume of <hi>Goltzius;</hi> and amongst the rest, the Latin one, <hi>v. Scipionis Barbati F.</hi> (with <hi>Sirmondus</hi> his Explanation) and the Greek of <hi>Herod</hi> expounded by <hi>Casaubon,</hi> for <hi>Salmasius</hi> his Exposition is a little too long: And whatsoever Punick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can be had in any Coin, (as one or two Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> hath of them) would be added also, because these are scarce known to any.</p>
                  <p>There was a Chronology some years since, published by one of <hi>Ausborough,</hi> and dedicated to the Pope, the Emperor, and King <hi>James,</hi> which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I pray you, if you can, help me to a sight of it; and let me understand whether your second Edition of <hi>Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> be yet come abroad, for as yet I have heard nothing of it. By this time, I suppose, I have tired you with a tedious Letter, and therefore now I dismiss you, and rest always,</p>

                  <p>I Do acknowledg no Promise made unto you on my part, but upon a Condition to be performed on your part, of desisting to prosecute any further your Sacrilegious Intention, either by your self, or by any of yours; the jealousy whereof you have been so far from taking away out of my mind, by your two last Letters, that you have increased it much more. To bear me in hand, that you will not follow the Business your self, but leave it only to the prosecution of your Friends; and that, if they obtain your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, yet you will submit all afterward to mine own disposition; I esteem no better than a meer delusion of me. And therefore if you intend to say no more than this, when you come up, you may save your Journey, for I will accept no other Satisfaction, but an absolute disclaiming of the prosecution of this Business, either by your self, or by others. And this I look you should certify unto me, before Sir <hi>Archibald Atcheson</hi>'s arrival, for afterward I care not a rush for it. And when you both have tried the uttermost of your Wits, to subvert the good Foundation laid by King <hi>James,</hi> of happy Memory, you shall but struggle in vain, with shame enough. And so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching Almighty God to give you the Spirit of a right Mind, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Thoughts of your Heart, I rest,</p>

                     <salute>Right Reverend Father, my honourable good Lord;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOur Letters of the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> came not to my hands till the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>November.</hi> Upon the receipt whereof, I wrote to the Vice-Provost, to forbear to proceed to the election of Fellows, if it were not past before. Not but that the Course was such, as stood by the Statutes in being e're I came to the place; but because, by your Grace's earnestness therein, I conceived, your Wisdom saw more to lie in it than I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Since that, I am sorry to understand the success of that Election was not such as gave satisfaction to your Grace, and hath bred a new Broil in the Colledg. For the restriction of the Statute for Batchelors, that they should be at least of seven Terms standing; if there be any blame, it must lie upon me; who would have had it according to that in <hi>Emanuel Colledg,</hi> that they should be of the third Year; but that by some of the Company this temper
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:60492:182"/>
was found. Wherein the Lord is witness, I respected meerly the good of the Colledg, and had not so much as in my thoughts, the Case of any that was to pretend the next Election, but resolved, as every Statute came to be considered, to reduce it to such perfection, as there should be as little need as was possible to touch them afterward. I have seen, by experience, that the timely preferring of young Men, makes them insolent and idle; and the holding them a little longer in expectation of Preferment, doth them more good in one year, than two years before, or perhaps after. Wherefore I cannot herein repent me of that which was done. If Mr. Vice-Provost, and the Seniors, have in any other Point failed of their Duty, I desire your Grace, not only to excuse me in participation in it, but them also thus far, that as I hope, it proceedeth of Error, and not Malice. And of one thing I do assure my self, and have been bold to undertake so much to the Fellows, that your Grace, though it be in a sort necessary for you, and all Men of place, to give satisfaction in words to importune Suitors, will not take it ill that we discharge our Consciences, coming to do acts upon Oath, such as this is; otherwise, miserable were the condition of such places, and happy are they that are farthest from them. I understood further, by your Grace's said Letters, That you dislike not that the time of the Fellows should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to twelve years, though you would not have it mentioned upon this suddain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which made me send for the University-Statutes of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> to my Friend Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> (having leisure this Winter to that purpose) to think of some Project, according to my last Letters to your Grace. And shortly it seems to me, that with one labour, the University might be brought into a more perfect Form, and yet without touching our Charter. At my being in <hi>Dublin,</hi> there came to me one Dr. <hi>de Lanne</hi> a Physician, bred in <hi>Immanuel Colledg:</hi> Who in speech with me, discovered their purpose to procure a Patent, like to that which the Colledg of Physicians hath in <hi>London.</hi> I noted the thing, and partly by that occasion, and partly also the desire of the Fellows, to extent their time of stay in the Colledg; I have drawn a Plot of my Thoughts in that behalf, which I send your Grace herewith. I have imparted the same generally to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> who desireth that your Grace would seriously consider of it, and, to use his own words, <hi>That it may be weighed with Gold Weights;</hi> and if it be found fit, will concur thereto when time shall be. I could have wished to have been present with you at the survey of it, to have rendred the reason of some things, which will now perhaps be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; but your Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Experience, and Knowledg of the Place, will easily pierce through, and disperse all those Mists which perhaps overcloud my understanding; and howsoever I shall hereby, <hi>dare sapienti occasionem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my speedy return, which your Grace presseth; I confess to them, that I am ready to forethink that ever I came there, so conscious to my self of mine own weakness and unfitness for the place, as I fear rather to be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som than profitable to the Colledg: Which also made me desirous to retain (if I might lawfully) the Title to my Benefice, resigning the whole Profits and care to some able Man, to be nominated by the Patron, and approved by the Bishop of the Diocess; that I might have, upon just cause, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to retire my self. I have not yet received your Grace's decision of this Case. I wrot also to the Society hereabout, who being <hi>conditores juris perpetui,</hi> are also <hi>interpretes:</hi> Neither have I understood what they conceive. Since my coming away, by occasion of my Lord Deputy his voluntary Offer, to confer upon me the Treasurership of St. <hi>Patricks;</hi> I entreated them to present a Petition to his Lordship, for the enjoying the 40 <hi>l.</hi> anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently granted to the Colledg, for the enlarging the Provost's Maintenance, and upholding the Lecture at <hi>Christ's Church,</hi> whereof I was put in hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my coming. They have not so much as vouchsafed me an Answer.
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:60492:182"/>
When I took my Oath to the Statutes, I made protestation, that I intended not to renounce my Benefice, that place being litigious, and my Affairs not yet accommodated here. Since my coming home hither, my Corn, Cattel, and some Goods, and a Lease of some Pasture Grounds which I held, I have forgone; but the main Matter of my Estate lying in Mony, I cannot yet recover. At my coming up hither, I left one of my Children sick of an Ague, which he hath had these three Weeks; and if he should be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, he cannot be presently fit to travel; neither are the Ways and Weather indeed seasonable thereto. But that which (to deal plainly) doth most of all trouble me, is, the report of the new Broils in the Colledg; which I see, partly in other Mens Letters: for to my self (as if I were but a Cypher in Algorism) they vouchsafe not a word. That some Fellows are displaced by the Visitors, others placed by Mandate of my Lord Deputy; old Grudges and Factions revived, <hi>&amp; malè sarta gratia necquicquam coit &amp; rescinditur.</hi> I never delighted, nor am made for it, <hi>ignum gladio fodere.</hi> Some of my Friends represented to me the Examples of Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Alvey;</hi> and that comes to my mind, Better sit still, than Rise and Fall. I have now an honest Retreat, with that form,</p>
                  <q>Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites.</q>
                  <p>It is written hither, and I have seen it with mine Eyes, That I am said to be a weak Man, and so thought to be by wise Men. This Witness is most true. In all these regards, I humbly beseech your Grace, by your undeserved love to me (which God knows how much I value, and that it was no small en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to me to enter into this Business) by your love to the Colledg, which I know is great; by your love to our Lord Jesus Christ, whereof he takes that proof, your <hi>love to his Lambs.</hi> Since you know now my weakness a little better than when you first nominated me to that place, and the want of the Colledg of an able Head, dispose of my place as you shall think most fit for that Colledg, University, Church, and Kingdom. For my part, I do here absolutely resign all my Interest unto it, into your Grace's hands, or the hands of those whom it may concern. Assuring your Grace that I shall account your freeing me from this burden, the greatest favour that you can do me: under the which, if it had not been for the fear of offending God, I think I had never put my shoulder so far as I have done. But if you shall esteem in Conscience I cannot go back, I beseech you be pleased freely to set down your Opinion touching my Case propounded in my last. I desire of God, that neither my Living, nor my Life, may be so dear unto me, as to finish my Course with joy, and the Ministry that I have received of the Lord Jesus. Upon the receipt of your Graces Letters, I shall resolve presently (if God let not) to come, or stay.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Parliament-Affairs, I know your Grace hath better adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement than I can give you. The beginnings yet go marvellously well; the Lower House excellently tempered. Nothing hath as yet been so much as put to question. The Upper House joined with them; insomuch as when they had received the Motion for a publick Fast, they added a Motion, to petition to his Majesty for the putting in execution all Laws and Acts of State against Recusants. This Petition was penned by the Bishops of <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and presented to his Majesty by both Houses. The former is appointed by Proclamation, to be <hi>April</hi> 21. The latter the King hath taken into consideration, with good signs of approbation. The Lower House is now employed about the Liberties of the Subjects; which they deduce even from the Conquest, and so down. They purpose (it seems) to proceed to the examination of the infringing of them, and of their Causes and Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. It is resolved among them, that the Grievances of the Subjects shall go
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:60492:183"/>
hand in hand with the Supply of the King's Wants, which are so great, as his Majesty, when he received the latter Petition, told them, <hi>(March</hi> 3.) <hi>That without present Supply he could not set forth one Ship,</hi> &amp;c. God of his Mercy grant, that the Progress and End may be correspondent. In which hearty Prayer I end, recommending your Grace to the Lord's Protection, and my self to your Prayers, and rest,</p>

                  <p>HAving the opportunity of this Bearer's return from his Friends, my Neighbours, to <hi>Kelles,</hi> I thought fit to send by him, if it were but the Duplicate of my last to your Grace, from <hi>London,</hi> the first of this Month, sent, as Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> told me, by one Mr. <hi>Goodwyn</hi> of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> who had special occasion to repair to your presence. Wherein I satisfied you (I hope) of the rightness of my Intention, in the restriction of the Statute for Batchelors Probationers to seven Terms standing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to your Grace the chief exercise of my Thoughts since my leaving <hi>Ireland,</hi> I mean, the Draught of a new Patent, and new Statutes to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for the University; which, I hope, you have safely received. You may perhaps esteem it a pragmatical unquietness of Spirit in me, that would busy my self with things beyond mine own line. But since it hath pleased God to embarque me, by their means, in the Affairs of that Country, I take my self bound to further the Voyage what I may; not only for mine own safety, and the rest of the Passengers, but for the honour of your self, that are the Pilot, and the Glory of God especially, unto which Port I am well assured all your Course is directed. I suppose it hath been an Error all this while, to neglect the Faculties of Law and Physick, and attend only to the ordering of one poor Colledg of Divines; whereas, with a little more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and a few Priviledges attained, a great many more good Wits might have been allured to study, and seasoned with Piety, and made Instruments for the bringing in Learning, Civility, and Religion, into that Country. I did communicate the Plat to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> at my first being with him, especially in that Point of admitting all Students that should be matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated, though they lodg in <hi>Dublin</hi> in private Houses; and of the four Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, with their several Promoters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who seemed not to dislike it; but required it should be maturely thought of, by your Grace and the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and promised his assistance if it were found fit. At that time I left with him the Statutes of our Colledg, which I had this Winter written out with mine own hand, and caused to be fair bound. He retained them with him till the very morning of my departing from <hi>London.</hi> At which time he sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his good approbation of the whole; only accounted that too strait, for the <hi>Provost's absence but six weeks,</hi> whereas many Causes there would be, which would require longer discontinuance. I shewed his Grace, that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg-Business was excepted, and that we had not innovated any thing in that Statute, it being so before my Election. Another Point he disliked, was, touching Students wearing Gowns always in the Colledg, <hi>and if it might be when they went into the Town.</hi> Whereas that of all other, (said he) would have been provided for. I answereth, The Streets in <hi>Dublin</hi> were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foul, and that by the Statutes, Scholars were not permitted to go ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily into the Town, without their Tutors consent. He said, they might, if the Streets were never so foul, take their Gowns under their Arms. I told him, that this was also an old Statute, e're I came there. With the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I told his Grace of the new Stirs I heard of in the Colledg; (for even but the day before, I had understood by other Mens Letters, more perfectly, of my Lord Deputy's putting in certain Fellows, and of their displacing of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:60492:184"/>
Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> by your Grace, and the Visitors, whereof I had no intelligence till then, save by Rumors only). I added, of mine own fears, that I should make a very ill Pilot in so rough Seas. He perswaded me to go on, using that Verse, <hi>Tu ne cede malis, &amp;c.</hi> I told him of my deafness, and that the Law not allowing <hi>surdum procuratorem,</hi> how could it be but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd in the Provost of such a Society. He told me, that was not so great a matter, for a great many did <hi>male andire.</hi> He bad me not be dismayed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting to me the future Reward. I told him, indeed if that were not, I had little eneouragement, sith neither I should, for ought I saw, have the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for the Lecture, which I was put in hope of, nor retain the Title of my Benefice only, renouncing the Profits. To that he said, there was no question I might: that I had not <hi>beneficium;</hi> and he would maintain it to any Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With these Discourses, having brought his Grace from his Chamber to his Barge, I recommended my self to his Prayers. The same morning, e're my departure, I wrote to <hi>Dublin,</hi> amongst others, to Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> endeavouring to let him see his Fault, and to keep him from being hardned in it. At my return home, I found one of my Sons yet afflicted with an Ague, which hath held him these six weeks; and the Ways being not yet fit for travel, (the Spring having been very late and winterly) I have resolved to attend your Grace's. Letters, both in answer to my Case propounded, in my Letters of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> and of my last from <hi>London,</hi> wherein I did put my place there wholly in your disposition; and if you think it may be more to the good of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Church there, that I forgo it, did (and do again by these Presents) absolutely resign it into your hands, or the hands of them whom it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Your Grace may be pleased to consider seriously my insufficiency, which by my last being there, partly by your own experience, and the report of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, you may have understood to be more than perhaps you imagined before.

I have ever liked and loved to proceed by that good old Form, <hi>Ut inter bonos bene ageir, &amp;c.</hi> I have seen it written from thence, that you and other wise Men, account me a weak Man; and in truth I do know my self so to be.

                     <salute>Most Reverend and my very good Lord;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THough I must needs acknowledg my neglect in writing, or forgetfulness, or both, since your last going into <hi>Ireland;</hi> yet now I could have no further pretext for the omission of that Duty, by which I am obliged by no few Bonds, especially having such conveniency of sending, by my most worthy Friend, with whom I am most loth to part, but that upon higher considerations, I conceive God may use him as an Instrument of much good in that place, if God send him health and life. I assure your Lordship, I know not where you could have pitched upon a Man, every way so qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for such a place. He is a sincere honest Man, not tainted with avarsee of ambition; pious, discreet, wise, and stout enough, <hi>si res exigat;</hi> he will be <hi>frugi,</hi> and provident for the Colledg: and for converse of a sweet and amiable disposition, and well experienced. In a word, he is <hi>homo perpaucorum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, si quid judico.</hi> I pray the God of Heaven to bless his coming to you, to the good of your Colledg, and the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I suppose your Lordship will desire to hear somewhat of our <hi>Cambridg-Affairs;</hi> though I doubt not but you hear, by some <hi>Cambridg</hi> Men which come over to you. I suppose you have heard of a Lecture for reading of History, intended to be given us by the Lord <hi>Brook.</hi> Who, as you know, first intended to have had Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> of <hi>Leyden;</hi> afterward his Stipend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing augmented by the States, he resolved of Dr. <hi>Dorislaw</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> also. He, before his coming hither, took his Degree of Doctor of the Civil Law at <hi>Leyden:</hi> was sent down to <hi>Cambridg</hi> by my Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> with his Majesty's Letters to the Vice-Chancellor, and the Head, signifying my Lord <hi>Brook's</hi> intent: and also willing us to appoint him a place and time for his Reading; which accordingly was done. He read some two or three Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, beginning with <hi>Corneh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:60492:185"/>
Name, to prohibit the History-Reader to read. But after that, both his Majesty, and the Bishop, and all others above, and here, were satisfied; but then his Patron kept off, and doth to this day, and will allow his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Stipend for his time; but we fear we shall lose the Lecture. I see a Letter which his Patron writ to him, to <hi>Malden,</hi> to will him to be gone into his Country; but he would assure him of his Stipend. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor kept with me, while he was in Town. He married an English Woman about <hi>Malden</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> where now he is. He is a fair-conditioned Man, and a good Scholar.</p>
                  <p>I had a Letter from Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> before <hi>Christmass,</hi> with a Book of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Historians, which he lately set forth, and dedicated to my Lord the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> He sent also a Book to his Majesty, and the Court-Bishops. I writ back unto him, and sent him my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on the <hi>Colossians,</hi> willing him to revise his Pelagian History, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about the Points of Original Sin, and the Efficacy of Grace.</p>
                  <p>As touching my self, in my Readings, I have suspended my Reading upon the Real Pretence, though I had almost finished it. And have read this Year and half, at least, upon that Point which I chiefly insist upon in my Sermon in Latin, to shew, that the Grace of Conversion giveth not only <hi>posse convertere,</hi> but also <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> hath lately set forth a Book of the <hi>Attributes of God;</hi> wherein, in the Preface to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> he doth profess himself an <hi>Arminian,</hi> ascribing to the opposites of <hi>Arminius,</hi> as I conceive, that God's Decrees, before the Creation, take away all possibilities of contrary Events after the Creation. True it is, that God's eternal Decree of any Event, as that <hi>I should write at this moment;</hi> cannot consist, with <hi>my actual not writing at this time:</hi> But none say it taketh from me <hi>all possibility of writing at this time,</hi> unless it be <hi>sensu composito.</hi> This conceit (as I conceive) maketh him elsewhere to impugn all. Divine Predefinitions as prejudicious to Man's Liberty and Freedom; which is a most silly conceit. I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, all that which he disputeth in his Book, against Negative Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as not sorting with the antecedent Will of God, for the Salvation of all, to be against the seventeenth Article of Religion, which plainly aver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eth a gratuitous predestination of some, and not of all. Therefore from thence is inferred, a not-election of others to that Grace, which is that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is stiled, Reprobation.</p>
                  <p>As for our University, none do patronage these Points; either in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <p>I Cannot express with what humble gladness I received your Letters: First, For that they gave me assurance of your Recovery; then, that among your weighty Affairs of Church and Common-wealth, you should descend to think on me, so remote in Application to your Lordship, though no Man nearer in Affection and Devotion. I register it in my Memorials of your Goodness; as also your sending to me the Copy of the Synod of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> which I much desired; and many thanks to your Lordship for it.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Books it pleased you to require my help in procuring them, by some of my Friends and Kindred in <hi>France;</hi> your Grace knoweth, that all intercourse between us and them is now stopped up: Yet have I taken order with Mr. <hi>Boswell,</hi> who is gone over with my Lord of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and to pass near <hi>Province,</hi> that if any opportunity may serve, he will endeavour to procure them; and my Son, who is gone after them, shall put him in mind of it. It is said, that my Lord of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> having treated beyond the Sea with the States of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and not satisfied in their Answer, hath left some Protestation against them, as he passed from them; and that the States have done the like against us. I hope it is not true, we have Enemies enow.</p>
                  <p>I suppose your Lordship would gladly hear how the great Orb of State moveth here in Parliament, (your own and many others depending on it): And I would very willingly have been the first that should have done you that Service, if the Messenger had staid a day or two longer, that we might have seen the Event. For all hangeth yet in suspence; but the Points touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Right of the Subject in the Property of their Goods, and to be free from imprisonment at the King's Pleasure, or without lawful cause ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed upon the Commitment, hath been so seriously and unanswerably proved and concluded by the Lower House, that they have cast their Sheat Anchor on it, and will not recede from any tittle of the Formality proposed in their <hi>Petition of Right</hi> touching the same. The Upper House hath, in some things, dissented from them, proposing a Caution to be added to the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:60492:186"/>
Petition for preservation of the King's Soveraign Prerogative; which the Lower House affirms they have not rub'd upon in ought that of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to it. Yet will they not admit that Addition, lest it impeach the whole intent of their Petition. Wherein they are so resolute, that having upon <hi>Thursday</hi> last, admirably evinced the Right of the Subjects in every part thereof, at a Conference with the Upper House, they refused to meet the Lords the day following in a Committee required by them, for qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as was conceived. Thereupon the Lords spent <hi>Saturday</hi> in debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, but concluded nothing that we hear of. It is reported, the Lord <hi>Say</hi> did then speak very freely and resolutely on behalf of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, with some unpleasing rubs upon the Duke there present; but by others interposition, all was well expounded. What this Day will produce, Night must relate. And of what I have written, I have nothing but by hear-say, for I am no Parliament-man.</p>
                  <p>My Lord of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> with the Navy that went for the rescue of <hi>Rochel,</hi> is returned, without blow or blood-draught. It is said, their Commission gave them not sufficient Warrant to fight; and one Captain <hi>Clark</hi> (suspected in Religion) is committed to the <hi>Gatehouse</hi> for disswading them.

                  <p>TWo things do occasion me to write to your Lordship; the one, to show the continuance of my dutiful and best respect to your Lordship, which I have born to your Lordship ever since your Childhood; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed descended first from your Father, who loved me always in his life-time, as I did him truly and faithfully. The other is, upon some mislike I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand your Lordship hath conceived of the Lord <hi>Camfield,</hi> my Son-in-Law; which indeed I am sorry for, for I never found him but honest and religious. I know he may have ill Instruments about him, and the World is full of Pick-thanks, and such as usually do lewd Offices amongst Men of Place and Quality. But if your Lordship would please to take him into your favour, and upon any occasion (if any happen) to make known to him what is or may be reported to your Lordship, of any of his miscarriages, or unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealings towards your Lordship, I would not doubt of his conformity, and giving of your Lordship meet satisfaction: and this is my Suit and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to your Lorship; for of all Men in that Kingdom, I do wish him, and all others that are my Friends, to be serviceable and respective to your Lordship: and for my self, so long as it shall please God to give me Life, I will pray for your Lordship, which is all the Service I can do you. Our worthy Bishop here, who I have found here, ever since I came hither, a
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:60492:186"/>
worthy Friend, and a godly Pastor and Pillar of the Church, hath many times, and often, most kindly remembred your Lordship; and surely he is as good a Man as may be, yet in this Parliament, which is yet scarcely ended, some have conceited not so well of him as before; but who can or doth escape the malice of wicked Men this being the last and worst Age of the World, and surely for all crying and notorious Sins, as Whoredom, Lying, Swearing, and Drunkenness, I am perswaded that now our own Nation is become the very worst of any in the Christian World, which makes me much afraid that God Almighty hath some heavy Judgment a preparing for us. It is certain, that in <hi>Spain</hi> are wondrous great preparations for War, especially for Sea-Service; which some think is rather for <hi>Denmark,</hi> and those Eastern parts, than for us; and the rather it is conjectured of, because Monsieur <hi>Oillur</hi> lies yet with a great Army of above 60000 Men about <hi>Stoade, Hambourgh,</hi> and other parts. If his Fleet come on this Summer, as it is thought it will, and pass the Narrow Seas unfought withal, and unbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by us, it is to be feared, that <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> or one of them, will next land upon our Continent, and sit down and fortify; being hopeful, as it may be well imagined, of aid from English Papists, whereof the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is too well stored. <hi>Rochel</hi> is much doubted cannot long hold out, and then there is little hope of any Mercy from the King of <hi>France;</hi> which would be a woful case to have so many poor Souls put to the Sword. It is thought his Majesty would relieve them, if these Subsidies could come in time: And it is to be wished now, that his Majesty had never medled with them; for in the beginning they were well provided to have made their own Peace. It is strange to be believed how this Kingdom is weakned by the loss of Shipping; for within this three years, it is said, <hi>England</hi> hath lost of Vessels, great and small, 400. All things concur very untowardly against us; but God Almighty hath reserved Victory to himself only. We had great rejoicing every where for his Majesty's gracious and good agreement with the Parliament; but some ten days ago, the House of Commons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving exhibited certain Remonstrances to his Highness, which, as it seemed, touched the Duke: after reading thereof, his Majesty rose up, and said, They should be answered; and instantly gave the Duke his Hand to kiss: which the Parliament-men, and others, were much amazed at. God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty amend what is amiss, if it be his blessed Will and send Unity at Home, that we may the better keep off and withstand our Enemies Abroad, and continue Peace in these Kingdoms; and more pertinently I pray to keep the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for we shall far better hold tack, with them here, if they should land, than you can do there, where too many are ready to join with them. I know I can write nothing to your Lordship which is News to you, yet express my Love, and hearty and humble Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to your Lordship, I make bold to trouble you with a long Letter: And so, with my Service to Mrs <hi>Usher,</hi> I take leave, and rest,</p>

                  <p>I Have nothing since my Letter by your Servant Mr. <hi>Sturges</hi> to trouble you with; but this Bearer, my Kinsman, coming to see your noble Country, I have requested him, and therewith enjoined him, to present my humble and most devoted Service to your Lordship; and to bring me certain word how it standeth with you for your Health: which to the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, as well as my own particular respect, no Man more desireth and prayeth for.</p>
                  <p>For the Passages here of note, I know you receive them by many Pens, and therefore I will not enter into any relation of them; only I wish they were better. Yet amongst them, I desire to present your Grace with the first printed Copy of the Petition of Parliament to his Majesty, for their ancient Rights and Liberties, with his gracious Answer thereto. And by much instance I (even in this hour) obtained it from Mr. <hi>John Bill</hi> the Printer, before they yet are become publick, and to the laming of the Book from whence they are taken. I send you also Mr. <hi>Glanvill</hi>'s and Sir <hi>Henry Martyn</hi>'s Speeches to the Upper House about this Matter; and the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation agaisnt Mr. Doctor <hi>Manwaring</hi>'s Sermons. But the King, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, hath (as it is credibly reported) released him of all the censure imposed upon him by the Upper House of Parliament, and this next month he is to serve in Court. The Deputys Lieutenants also of the West Country, are released; and some of them repaired with the dignity of Baronet, others of Knighthood, all with Grace. Mr. <hi>Bill</hi> desired me to remember him most humbly to your Lordship, and to advertise you, that he willingly will print your noble Work in one Volume, as well in Latin as in English; which with multitude of others, I shall much rejoice to see. Thus with all humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to your Grace, I rest,</p>

For his tuition, I have placed him in <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledg, with Mr. <hi>Bodley,</hi> a Batchelor of Divinity, and Nephew to the great Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley</hi> of whose sob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

He assures me, that he finds his Scholar tractable and studious; In that such a Disposition, having met with such a Tutor to direct and instruct it, I make no doubt but it will produce an effect answerable to our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and desire: And during mine abode in the University, my self shall not be wanting to help it forward the best I may.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordship shall do well to take order with his Friends, that he may have credit for the taking up of Monies in <hi>London,</hi> for the defraying his Expences; for that to expect it from <hi>Ireland,</hi> will be troublesome and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
                  <p>I wish I could write your Lordship any good News touching the present state of Affairs in this Kingdom; but in truth, except it please God to put to his extraordinary helping hand, we have more reason to fear an utter downfal, than to hope for a rising.</p>

I have, upon receipt of these, a second time, humbly presented Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi>'s Suit to his Majesty; with all fair representation to his Majesty of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a good <hi>Commendam</hi> to the Arch-bishop of <hi>Tuam.</hi> And tho, in my judgment, I hold it very unfit, and of ill, both Example and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the Church, to have a Bishop, much more an Arch-bishop, retain a Deanery in <hi>Commendam:</hi> Yet because there is (as I am informed) much service to be done for that Arch-bishop, and because I have conceived this Man will do that Service, (for so he hath assumed); and because much of that Service must be done at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where that Deaury will the better fit him, as well for House as Charge; and because it is no new thing in that Country to hold a Deanry with a Bishoprick; I made bold to move his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty for it, and his Majesty is graciously pleased to grant it; and I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, by his Majesty's special Command, given order to Sir Hen. Holcross to send Letters to my Lord Deputy to this purpose. But there two things his Majesty commanded me to write to your Lordship; The one, that young Men be not commended to him for Bishops; The other, that he shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I am glad I have been able to serve your Grace's desires in this Business. And for Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> I with him joy; but must desire your Lordship to excuse my not writing to him; for between Parliament and Term I have not lenure. So I leave you to the Grace of God, and shall ever rest,</p>

                  <p>SInce your Graces departure from <hi>Dublin,</hi> I began to peruse the Papers you left me of Dr. <hi>Ghaloner</hi>'s hand, about the first foundation of the Colledg; which although in some places I cannot read word for word, yet I perceive the sense, and have transcribed so far as they go without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: But they refer to some Copies of Letters which I have not, nor yet are in our Chest, as namely, the City's Letter to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Lord Deputy and Comisales; and hers to the Lord Deputy here, for the founding of the Colledg: All which if they might be had, would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted into the History of the Colledg, <hi>ad Verbum.</hi> And which is worse, the third Duernion is wholly missing, noted, it seems, in the Front with the Figure 3. This makes me bold to write to your Grace to search if you can find any thing more of this Argument, that there may be somewhat left to Posterity concerning, the beginnings of so good a Work. I have also, since your Grace's departure, drawn a Form of the Confirmation of our Rectories, from the Bishop of <hi>Clougher,</hi> in conformity, to two Instruments, <hi>viz.</hi> the Resignation of <hi>George Montgomery,</hi> sometime Bishop thereof, and <hi>Derry,</hi> and <hi>Rapho;</hi> and our Colledg Patent. I have used all the means I can, to know whether any Predecessor of your Grace, did in like manner resign into the King's Hands any Patronages within your Diocess, and what their Names be; which if I could understand, I would entreat your Grace to go before in your Diocess, and to be our Patron in the soliciting the other Bishops to follow in theirs. I send your Grace the form of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and the Names of the Rectories in our Patent, referring the rest to your wisdom and love to the Colledg. This is a Business of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to this Society, and hath already been deferred so long, and Mr. <hi>Usher</hi>'s sudden taking away, (to omit my Lord of <hi>Kilmore)</hi> admonishes me to work while the day lasts. Another Business there is, which enforceth me to have recourse to your Grace; which is this, Yesterday, as I was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Mr. <hi>Usher</hi>'s Funeral, there was delivered me a Letter from my Lord Chancellor, containing another to his Lordship from Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> together <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But here is not all, for it seems he hopes, by the words of your Decree, to hold all this till he be possessed of some Ecclesiastical Benefice, notwithstanding his Term by the Charter expires at Midsommer. We have answered my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, as your Grace shall find by these inclosed; and do humbly desire your Grace, to certify either him or us of your intention; and to draw a Line or two to be sent to the rest of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

These Letters your Grace will be also pleased to send us back, as having, by reason of the shortness of time, no time to copy them. We have obtained this night, a Warrant from my Lord Chancellor to the Serjeant at Arms, to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:60492:189"/>
arrest Sir <hi>James Caroll;</hi> who in all this time of your Grace's being in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> would never be seen, and is now, as we hear, in Town. We have not yet delivered your Grace's return of the Reference made to you at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Table, touching the Inclosure at the Colledg-Gate, as having but lately received it. In the mean while the Scholars, upon St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Day at night, between Supper and Prayer-time, have pulled it all down, every Stick, and brought it away into the Colledg to several Chambers. Yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on warning that night given at Prayers, that every Man should bring into the Quadrangle what he had taken away; there was a great pile reared up in the Night, which we sent Mr. <hi>Arthur</hi> word he might fetch away if he would; and he did accordingly.</p>
                  <p>This Insolency, though it much grieved me, I could not prevent; I did publickly upon the Reference, pray them to be quiet, signifying our hope that we had of a friendly composition; but when they heard that Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> fell off, they would no longer forbear.</p>

                     <salute>Most Reverend in Christ, my very good Lord;</salute>

                  <p>I Must first desire your Grace's pardon for my long silence, and that you will be pleased to believe, that it proceeded not from any neglect of him whom I have so long and so much honour'd. I presume your Grace conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually receiveth advertisement of what passeth here from abler Pens than mine, and therefore my pains in that may well be spared. Among the rest, you cannot be ignorant of the close imprisonment of your Grace's Friend and Servant, Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> for some offence given, or rather taken, at his carriage and deportment in Parliament. Here is lately deceased, the Earl of <hi>Marleburgh;</hi> I was often with him about his Irish Collections, and was so happy in the pursuit of them, that I received from him the greatest part of them, not many days before his death. Also the Earl of <hi>Westmoreland</hi> is lately dead; and my ancient Friend and Kinsman, the Earl of <hi>Totnes,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his sight, and not like to live many days: If his Library will be sold, I will strain my self to buy it wholly, for it is a very select one. But howsoever, I will not miss (God willing) his Irish Books and Papers. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi> is ready to come forth here, and his <hi>De Diis Syris</hi> at <hi>Leyden,</hi> both well enlarged; I wish he were so too, that his Friends who much love him, might enjoy him. Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> doth add to his inestimable Library. Mr. <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> hath been lately bountiful to it;
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:60492:190"/>
He is now in <hi>London,</hi> and also Mr. <hi>Brigges.</hi> If I should only enumerate those who make enquiry of your Grace's Health, their Names would fill a Letter. Mr. <hi>Brigges's</hi> Book of <hi>Logarithms</hi> is finished by a Dutch-man, and printed again in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Brigges</hi> tells me that <hi>Kepler</hi> is living, and confesses his mistake in the advertisement of his Death, by being deceived in the similitude of his name, with one D. <hi>Kapper,</hi> who died in that manner as he related. But it appears sufficiently, by his long-promised <hi>Tabulae Rodolphiae,</hi> which now at last are come forth; but they answer not the expectation which he had raised of them.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Bainbridge</hi> is well at <hi>Oxford;</hi> Dr. <hi>Sutcleffe</hi> is lately deceased.</p>
                  <p>Yesterday at <hi>Newgate</hi> Sessions, <hi>Fa. Muskett,</hi> your Grace's old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was arraigned, and two other Priests; and one of them an Irish-man: they were all found guilty of Treason, and had judgment accordingly. There were an hundred Recusants presented at the same time. It is said, that a Declaration shall come forth concerning the Arminian Doctrine, done by those Divines who were at the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Jesuit's Reply to your Grace, is not to be gotten here; those that came into <hi>England</hi> were seized, and for ought I can hear, they lie still in the Custom-house: that which I used, was borrowed for me by a Friend of the Author himself, half a year since, he being then here in <hi>London,</hi> and going by the Name of <hi>Morgan.</hi>

                  <p>Since the Dissolution of the Parliament, there is a strange suddain decay of Trade, and consequently of the Customs; God grant there follow no inconvenience in the Common-Wealth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dunkerkers</hi> are very bold upon the Coast of <hi>England,</hi> and I hear of no means used to repress them.</p>
                  <p>It is said, that our Deputy shall be presently removed; his designed Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, my Lord of <hi>Danby,</hi> is expected from <hi>Garnsey:</hi> He was imployed thither, to furnish that Island with Munition, and other Necessaries, when there was some jealousy of the French, while that Army lay hovering about the parts of <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Normandy;</hi> but it is now gone for <hi>Italy,</hi> and is passed the Mountains; they have taken some Town in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> the King is there in Person. It is now said, that Matters are accommodated by Composition; if not, it will prove a bloody War between those two great Kings, and the French will put hard for the Dutchy of <hi>Millain.</hi>

                  <head>LETTER CXXXVII. A <hi>Letter from Mr.</hi> Archibald Hamilton, <hi>to the most Reverend</hi> James Usher <hi>Arch-bishop of</hi> Armagh.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Most Reverend;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>ON <hi>Thursday</hi> last, I understood by certain intelligence, that my Lord of <hi>London</hi> (whether by the perswasion of Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> or others, I know not) earnestly moved his Majesty in Dr. <hi>Bedell</hi>'s behalf, Provost of <hi>Dublin-Colledg,</hi> that he might be preferred to the Bishoprick of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> which his Majesty hath granted; and the Letter for his Consecration is like to be there as soon as this. I am heartily glad of his good Preferment, but am somewhat grieved withal that the Colledg hath enjoyed him for so small a time, who was like to make it much happy by his careful Government. Some fear there is conceived, that one or other from hence may be put upon the House, who will not (it may be) so truly aim at the religious Education of the Students; for some one (deeply tainted with the Arminian Tenets) putteth in close to be recommended thither by his Majesty; and thinks to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail by that means. This I thought good to certify, that your Grace may give timely warning thereof to the Fellows, that they may make a wary and a safe Election, of some sound Scholar, and Orthodox Divine. I will not presume to name any, but I think Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> might be well thought of, the place being formerly intended for him, and he generally reputed a very able Man for such a Charge.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Totnes</hi> departed this Life some ten days since, his Corps is not yet buried: Soon after his decease, I went and made enquiry after that Press of Books and Manuscripts which only concern <hi>Ireland,</hi> and asked whether he had left them as a Legacy to our Colledg, as your Lordship heretofore moved him, and as he himself lately promised (to Sir <hi>Fran Annesly</hi> and my self) that he would: whatsoever the good Man intended, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever direction he gave, I cannot learn, but the Colledg is not like to get them; for one Sir <hi>Thomas Stafford</hi> (the reputed Son of the said Earl) hath got them, and many other Things of my Lord's into his hands, out of which there will be hard wringing of them. Sir <hi>Fran. Annesly,</hi> and I have ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly dealt with him, that he would give them to the Colledg, as the Earl intended to leave them; and if not that he would let your Lordship have the refusal of them before any other if they be to be made away; he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely refuseth to part with them upon any terms, alleadging, that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth to erect a Library, wherein they, and all other the Earl's Books, are to be preserved for his everlasting memory. He promiseth withal that if your Grace, or any that your Lordship will appoint hath a mind to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify, write out, or collect any thing out of any of the said Books and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts, he will most willingly affoyd your Lordship, or them, a fire and leasurely use of the same, as to you shall seem sitting; and this was all that we could get from him. If your Lordship's Letter can be so powerful, it were not amiss to write to himself; for it may be conjectured (for all his fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences) that a ready sum of Mony may make an easy purchase of them.</p>
                  <p>In my last Letter I advertised your Lordship how far I had proceeded in the business of <hi>Armagh;</hi> since which time I have driven it to no further perfection, partly, because I expect to hear your Lordship's express plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure therein; and partly, by reason of the Lord Keeper, and Lord <hi>Grandison</hi>'s late Sickness, which hath kept them and the rest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:60492:191"/>
from meeting, to make a final determination of their Report, that his Majesty's Letter may be procured accordingly, for the setting off all things to your Lordship's desire. If the Report were once made, the Letter shall come speedily over, and in a sufficient time, to settle all before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament sit, or can conclude any Acts for restraining of Bishops, to set any Leases for any longer term than one and twenty Years. Thus recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending your Lordship to the blessed protection of the Almighty, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreating your Lordship to have a vigilant care for the providing of an able Head to the Colledg; I humbly take leave, and remain,</p>

                  <p>I Have received information, both of the unreverend manner of publishing the late Proclamation at <hi>Drogedah,</hi> and the ill observance of the same since it was published. For the first, That it was done in scornful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous sort, a drunken Souldier being first set up to read it, and then a drunken Serjeant of the Town, both being made, by too much Drink, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of that task (and perhaps purposely put to it) made the same seem like a May-game. And for the latter, That there is yet very little obedience shewed thereto by the Friers and Priests; only that they have shut up the Fore-doors of some of their Mass-houses; but have as ordinary recourse thither by their private Passages, and do as frequently use their superstitious Service there, as if there were no command to the contrary; those Mass-houses being continued in their former use (though perhaps a little more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately) without any demolishing of their Altars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I expected to have been informed as well of the publishing thereof there, as of the Effects it had wrought, from no Man before your Lordship, both in respect of your Profession, and the eminent place you hold in the Church, and of your being a Privy Counsellor, who was present and assistant in all the Consultations about setting it forth, and privy to the Resolutions of the Board thereupon. But since this is come to my hands from another, I do hereby pray and authorize your Lordship, calling to your assistance Mr. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice <hi>Philpot,</hi> who is now resident there, to enter into a serious examination of the Premises, and to give me a full information of what you find thereof, by the first opportunity.

                  <p>I Have had some Conference with my Lord Deputy about those Matters, wherein your Grace and I were lately imployed; he telleth me, that this day he will advise with the Counsel upon the Informations sent by us, and afterwards will take such course therein as shall be thought fit. His Lordship insisteth much upon that part of Mr. <hi>Sing</hi>'s Information, where he saith, That the Titulary Bishop of <hi>Rapho,</hi> did make a Priest at a publick Mass in an
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:60492:192"/>
Orchard. He saith, That the said Bishop is as dangerous a Fellow here in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as <hi>Smith</hi> is in <hi>England;</hi> and that he hath good Bonds upon him, and would be glad to this occasion to call him in; and therefore I pray your Grace to wish Mr. <hi>Sing</hi> to be ready to make good his Accusation, for the said Bishop is bound not to exercise Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction. I told my Lord Deputy how careful you were to see him before his going from hence; and that your Grace intended to make a journey of purpose hither, having now no other business here. He told me, that if your Grace had any such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that you need not make any great haste, for he hoped to have time enough before his going, to make some good progress in the Business begun, concerning the Jesuits and their Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he had not his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons yet to go away, which could not come till the Wind turned; and if it came then, he said, he would stay ten days after at the least; in which your Grace may have notice time enough to perform your desire. I told my Lord, that your Grace was somewhat troubled at his Letter; for which he was sorry, and blamed his Secretary, protesting he did not intend to give your Grace any cause of discontent. His Lordship told me, that the News of <hi>Mantua</hi> is true, which is relieved, and the French King returned: but there is no certainty, but a common report, of any Peace concluded with <hi>France.</hi> I shall be ready, upon all occasions, to do your Lordship any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Service; and will for ever remain,</p>

                  <p>I Am glad Mr. <hi>Bedell</hi>'s Preferment gives your Grace such contentment. Your former Letter came safe to my hands, so did your second. I see nothing is so well done, but Exceptions can fret it; for I hear that which I looked not for concerning Mr. <hi>Bedell</hi>'s Preferment, whole Name was never put to the King, till both the other Competitors were refused by his Majesty as too young.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ardagh</hi> is not forgotten in the Letter; for since upon receipt of your Lordship's last Letters, I spake with Sir <hi>Hen. Holcroft</hi> about it.</p>
                  <p>Beside those of your Lordship's, I have received Letters from Mr. <hi>Bedell,</hi> and from the Fellows, about their freedom of election of a Provost. My Lord, his Majesty would fain have a Man to go on where Mr. <hi>Bedell</hi> leaves. I am engaged for none. I heartily love Freedoms granted by Charter, and would have them maintained. If they will return which are come hither; and all agree, or a major part, upon a worthy Man that will serve God and the King, I will give them all the assistance I can to keep their Priviledg whole.</p>
                  <p>The King likes wondrons well of the Irish Lecture begun by Mr. <hi>Bedell,</hi> and the course of sending such young Men as your Grace mentions. I hope, before our Committee for the establishment of <hi>Ireland</hi> end, I shall find a time to think of the Remedy your Lordship proposes about scandalous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters; in which, or any other Service, I shall not be wanting. For the particulars concerning <hi>Clark,</hi> I have your inclosed; and if he stir any thing while I am present, you shall be sure I will do you right.</p>
                  <p>Now, my Lord, I have answered all your Letter, save about the Arch-bishop of <hi>Cassa</hi>'s for the old Dean. I have done all I am able for that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and well-deserving Gentleman; but the King's Majesty hath been pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed another way; and it seems upon like removes, hereafter will move more than one. And at this time he will give <hi>Cassils</hi> to my Lord of <hi>Clougher,</hi> if he will take it, and so go on with another to succeed him, of whom he is likewise resolved: And who shall be <hi>Cassils</hi> if my Lord of <hi>Clougher</hi> refuse.</p>

                     <pb n="410" facs="tcp:60492:193"/>
There is nothing which the Dean of <hi>Cassils</hi> can have at this time, unless he will with a good <hi>commendam,</hi> be content to take <hi>Kilfanora.</hi> To which, tho I do not perswade, yet I would receive his Answer: And I add, it will be a step for him to a better. As for <hi>Betts,</hi> the Lord-Elect that was, he hath lapsed it by not proceeding to Consecration.</p>
                  <p>I must now humbly intreat your Grace to send me the Names and Values of all the Bishopricks and Deaneries in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And what Bishopricks are joyned to others, that I may be the better able to serve that Church, being as yet one of the Committee. And I pray excuse my not writing to Mr. <hi>Bedle,</hi> for in truth I have not leisure. So I leave you to the Grace of God, and rest,</p>

                  <p>THE two Fellows of the Colledg of <hi>Dublin</hi> which are attendant here about the freedom of their Election, were commanded by his Majesty to send to the Colledg there, and to know whom they would pitch upon for their Governour. And his Majesty was content, upon the Reasons given by me, and the Petition of the Fellows, to leave them to freedom, so they did chuse such a Man as would be serviceable to the Church and Him. Upon this after some time, they delivered to the King, that they would choose, or had chosen Dr. <hi>Usher,</hi> a Man of your Grace's Name and Kindred: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty thereupon referred them to the Secretary, the Lord Vicount <hi>Dorchester,</hi> and my self, to inform our selves of his Worth and Fitness. My Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that they should think of another Man that was known unto us, that we might the better deliver our Judgments to the King. I was very sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of your Lordship's Name in him, and remembred what you had written to me in a former Letter concerning him, and thereupon prevailed with his Majesty that I might write these Letters to you, which are to let your Grace understand that his Majesty puts so great Confidence in your Integrity and readiness to do him Service, that he hath referred this business to the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness of your Judgment, and will exercise his Power accordingly. For thus he hath commanded me to write; That your Grace should presently upon receipt of these Letters write back to me what your Knowledg and Judgment is of the worth and fitness of Dr. <hi>Usher</hi> for this place, setting all Kindred and Affection aside: And upon that Certificate of yours the King
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:60492:193"/>
will leave them to all freedom of their choice, or confirm it if it be made. So wishing your Lordship all Health and Happiness, I leave you to the Grace of God, and shall ever rest,</p>

Whereas our Turky Merchants, trading at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> being now destitute of a Minister, have referr'd the choice of one unto your self; may it please you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that there is one Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> a Fellow of <hi>Magdalen-Colledg,</hi> who hath spent some Years in the Oriental Languages, and being desirous to improve his Knowledg therein is content to adventure himself in the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; he would take the pains to preach once a week, but not oftner; being desirous to spend the rest of his time in perfecting his Languages, and making such other Observations as may tend to the advancement of Learning.

                  <p>YOur Letters of the 25th of <hi>June</hi> I received the 8th day of <hi>August,</hi> wherein I found contained a large Testimony, as well of your special care of the welfare of our poor Colledg, as of your tender respect unto my Name and Credit; for which I must acknowledg my self to stand ever bound to perform all faithful Service unto your Lordship.</p>
                  <p>I have hereupon written unto the Fellows of the House, that in making their Election they should follow their Consciences according to their Oaths, without any by-respects whatsoever. Dr. <hi>Usher</hi> is indeed my Cousin german; but withal the Son of that Father, at whose instance, charge and travel, the Charter of the Foundation of the Colledg was first obtained from Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which peradventure may make him somewhat the more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected by that Society. To his Learning, Honesty, and Conformity unto the Discipline of our Church, no Man, I suppose, will take exception. And of his Ability in Government he hath given some proof already, while he was Vice-Provost in that House; where his care in preventing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Leases at that time was such, that thereby we have been now enabled so to order the matter, that within these six Years the Colledg-Rents shall be advanced well-nigh to the double value of that they have been. Whereunto I will add thus much more, that I know he sincerely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth the good of his Country, meaneth to go on where Dr. <hi>Bedell</hi> hath left, and in his proceedings will order himself wholly according as your Lordship shall be pleased to direct him. Which if it may prove an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to move his Majesty to confirm his Election; I shall hold my self strongly engaged thereby to have a special eye to the Government of that Colledg: seeing the miscarriage of any thing therein cannot but in some sort reflect upon my self; who would rather lose my Life, than not answer the Trust reposed in me by my Soveraign. In obedience unto whose sacred Directions, and discharge of the Care committed unto me by his Letters of the 7th of <hi>November</hi> last (the Copy whereof I send herewith) I humbly make bold to represent this also unto your Lordship's Consideration; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if the Lord Bishop of <hi>Glogher</hi> shall be removed unto the Arch-bishoprick of <hi>Cashell,</hi> the Dean of <hi>Raphoe</hi> may not be thought upon to succeed him in <hi>Glogher,</hi> as being a very well deserying Man, and one toward whom his Majesty hath very gracious Intentions. But of him I shall need deliver no more, than what is contained in the enclosed Testimonial, sent by my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor unto King <hi>James</hi> of blessed Memory.

                  <p>MY last Letter sent by Mr. <hi>Ja. Ware,</hi> I presume is come to your Grace's hands long before this time. I have the happiness to hear of your Grace sometimes by Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> which is a great Comfort unto me; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when I heard of your Health and Ability to perform so great a Journey, in your late Visitation of your Province, of which I shall ever wish the continuance. I am very sorry that it is my ill fortune, so often to advertise your Grace of the misfortune of your Friends here. Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> hath been lately committed to the Custody of the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and often strictly examined concerning the publication of a Project, tending to the oppression of the Common-wealth, and with him were restrained in several places the Earls of <hi>Bedford, Somerset,</hi> and <hi>Clare,</hi> and some others: after ten or twelve days close Imprisonment, and several Examinations, they were all enlarged; and an Information exhibited against them in the Star-Chamber, to which they are now to answer. Mr. <hi>Solden</hi> is also made a party to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; he is still a Prisoner in the Tower, but enjoyeth now the liberty of the Prison: At my last being with him, he desired me to present his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to your Grace; he would have done it himself, if he might with safety. Here hath been a good while with us <hi>Ger. Jo. Vossius</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> a Man well known to your Grace by his Books; and now to me <hi>de facie;</hi> and which is more, with whom I have contracted Familiarity and Friendship: He told me that your Grace was well known to him both by your Latin Book, which he had diligently read, and by the Report of divers learned Men. and when he understood by me, how much you esteemed and loved him, he desired me to return his humble Thanks, with desire that you would imploy his Service in whatsoever he is able to perform. His Majesty has conserr'd on him the Prebend in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which lately was Dr. <hi>Chapman</hi>'s. He is now
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:60492:195"/>
settling himself in it; he saith, he hath received a late Advertisement of the Death of <hi>Bertius,</hi> who over-lived his own Credit and Reputation. Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's Titles of Honour</hi> hath long slept under the Press, by reason of his long close Imprisonment; but now he tells me it shall go forward; and he thinks within two Months it will come abroad. The War in <hi>Italy</hi> is like to proceed; the <hi>French</hi> King raiseth a great Army for that Expedition. Here was a report that the States had taken <hi>Gulick,</hi> but it holds not for a certain Truth. One thing I must not over-pass, and that a strange and monstrous Accident lately happened here in <hi>England.</hi> One <hi>Dorington</hi> (a younger Son of Sir <hi>William Dorington</hi> of <hi>Hamp-shire,</hi> and Grand-Child to that <hi>Dorington</hi> who brake his Neck from St. <hi>Sepulchres</hi> Steeple in <hi>London)</hi> being reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for some disorderly Courses by his Mother, drew his Sword and ran her twice through, and afterwards she being dead, gave her many Wounds, and had slain his Sister at the same time, had he not been prevented. I presume your Grace hath heard of the Death of Dr. <hi>Tho. James:</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew Mr. <hi>Rich. James</hi> is fallen into some Trouble, by reason of his Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity and Inwardness with Sir <hi>Robert Cotton.</hi> I suppose you have the last Catalogue of <hi>Francfort,</hi> which hath nothing of note. But I fear I have been over troublesome to your Grace's more serious and weighty Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; wherefore with the remembrance of my Love and Service, I will ever remain</p>

                  <p>I Have received two or three Letters from you since I writ you any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. I hope your Grace is not of opinion that it is either idlenesi or neglect which have made me silent; for the plain truth is, I fell into a fierce burning Fever <hi>August</hi> the 14th, which held me above three Weeks. It was so fierce, that my Physicians, as well as my Friends, gave me for dead, and it is a piece of a Miracle that I live. I have not yet recovered my wonted Strength, and God knows when I shall; yet since I was able to go to the Court, tho not to wait there. I have done as much business as I could, and I think as your Grace hath desired of me, for the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as your Lordship will see by this brief Account following.</p>
                  <p>And first, my Lord, I have obtain'd of his Majesty, the new incorporating of the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Derry,</hi> and I think the Dean is returned. At the same time the King was pleased to give order for confirming the Election of Dr. <hi>Usher</hi> to be Governour of the Colledg in <hi>Dublin.</hi> Thirdly, upon the refusal of my Lord of <hi>Clougher,</hi> his Majesty gave, in the time of my Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:60492:196"/>
the Arch-bishoprick of <hi>Cassills</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Killally,</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick of <hi>Killally</hi> to the Dean of <hi>Rapho.</hi> And whereas your Grace, in the close of one of your Letters, did acquaint me, that there was a fear, lest some cunning would be used to beg or buy some Patronages out of the King's Hands; I moved his Majesty about that likewise, and he made me a gracious promise, that he would part with none of them.</p>
                  <p>And now, my Lord, I give your Lordship thanks for the Catalogue of the Bishopricks of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which I heartily desire your Grace to perfect, as occasion may be offered you. And for the last business (as I remember) concerning the Table of Tything in <hi>Ulster,</hi> I have carefully look'd it over; but by reason I have no experience of those parts, I cannot judg clearly of the Business; but I am taking the best care I can about it, and when I have done, I will do my best with his Majesty for Confirmation, and leave, Mr. <hi>Hyegate</hi> to report the Particulars to your Grace.</p>
                  <p>I have observed that <hi>Kilphanora</hi> is no fertile Ground, it is let lie so long Fallow. Hereupon I have adventured to move his Majesty, that some one or two good Benefices, lying not too far off, or any other Church-Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Cure, so it be not a Deanery, may be not for this time only, but for ever annex'd to that Bishoprick. The care of managing that Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he refers to your Grace, and such good Counsel in the Law as you shall call to your assistance. And I pray your Grace think of it seriously and speedily; and though I doubt you will find nothing actually void to annex unto it, yet if that Act be but once past, the hope of that which is annex'd, will make some worthy Man venture upon that Pastoral Charge; and so soon as you are resolv'd what to do, I pray send me word, that so I may acquaint his Majesty with it, and get pow'r for you to do the Work. These are all the Particulars that for the present I can recall out of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, sent unto me in the time of my Sickness. So with my hearty Prayers for your Health and Happiness, and that you may never be parch'd in such a Fire as I have been, I leave you to the Grace of God, and rest,</p>

Some things he denied, and others he shew'd Reasons for, so that he gave us all good satisfaction, and we hope we shall have much comfort in him.

Your Friends here, as many as I know, are all well. Sir <hi>Rob. Cotton</hi> is not altogether free of his Trouble; but he and his Friends hope he shall shortly.

Here is little News at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. The French Army is gone into <hi>Italy,</hi> commanded by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Richleau:</hi> The Imperialists are so terrified with their coming, that they have raised the Siege of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and drawn themselves into the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> for the defence thereof. There is a Treaty of Peace there, and in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> of a Truce between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the States; and the Spanish Ambassador is here about the same Business, and ours in <hi>Spain:</hi> And these several Treaties depend so one upon another, that it is thought it will either prove a general Peace, or a general War. I wrote to your Grace in my former Letter, of Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> being here in <hi>England.</hi> Within these two days I heard from him by Mr. <hi>Junius</hi> his Brother-in-law, who went over with him. He liked his entertainment so well in <hi>England,</hi> that he hath now a good mind to settle himself here. Concerning our own poor Country, I can say nothing, only that the Business of <hi>Philim Mac Teagh</hi> is in question; which I mention the rather, because your Grace had your part in it as a Commissioner. The King hath sat two days already with the Lords, and heard it with great patience and attention. My Lord of <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as I hear, hath ended his part; which was, to answer the Certificate and Report of the Commissioners in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as far as it touched himself. Sir <hi>Henry Beatinges</hi> part is next; when those have done, the other side shall have liberty to reply. I cannot hear any speech of a new Deputy; I believe the Government will continue as it is, and the rather, because it is a saving way, which these Times do easily hearken unto. I have sent your Grace, here inclosed, something that hath been lately done concerning the Church of <hi>England:</hi> I doubt not but your Grace hath received it from other hands, but I thought good to adventure it howsoever. I intend (with God's Assistance) to be in <hi>Ireland</hi> about the midst of <hi>March</hi> at the farthest. If your Grace desire any thing from hence, I shall willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh it to you; and if they be Books, I can do it conveniently, because I carry many of my own. I will desire your Grace to esteem me in the number of those who most reverence and honour you, and will ever approve himself,</p>

                  <head>LETTER CLII. A <hi>Letter from the Right Reverend</hi> William Bedell <hi>Bishop of</hi> Kilmore, <hi>to the most Reverend</hi> James Usher <hi>Arch-bishop of</hi> Armagh.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Most Reverend Father, my honourable good Lord;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE report of your Grace's indisposition, how sorrowful it was to me the Lord knows; albeit the same was somewhat mitigated by other News of your better Estate. In that fluctuation of my mind (perhaps like that of your Health) the saying of the Apostle served me for an Anchor; <hi>That none of us liveth to himself, neither doth any die to himself. For whether we live, we live to the Lord; or whether we die, we die to the Lord: Whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's:</hi> Thereupon, from the bottom of my heart commending your Estate, and that of his Church here (which how much it needs you he knows best) to our common Master, though I had written large Letters to you, which have lien by me sundry Weeks, fearing in your sickness to be troublesom, I thought not to send them, but to attend some other opportunity after your perfect recovery, to send, or perhaps bring them. When I understood by Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> of his Journey, or at least sending an express Messenger to you with other Letters; putting me also in mind that perhaps it would not be unwelcome to you to hear from me, though you forbore to answer: I yielded to the Example and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so much the rather, because I remembred my self a Debtor to your Grace, by my promise of writing to you more fully touching the Reasons of my difference with Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and now a Suitor in your Court at his instance.</p>
                  <p>And first, I beseech your Grace, let it be a Matter meerly of merriment, that I skirmish a little with your Court, touching the Inhibition and Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which thence proceeded against me, as you shall perceive by the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Recusation. For the thing it self, as I have written, I do submit it wholly to your Grace's decision. And to enlarge my self a little, not as to a Judg, but a Father; to whom, beside the bond of your undeserved Love, I am bound also, by an Oath of God; I will pour out my Heart unto you, even without craving pardon of my boldness. It will be perhaps some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diversion of your Thoughts, from your own infirmity, to understand that you suffer not alone, but you in Body, others otherwise, each must bear his Cross, and follow the steps of our high Master.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, since it pleased God to call me to this place in this Church, what my Intentions have been to the discharge of my Duty, he best knows. But I have met with many Impediments and Discouragements, and chiefly from them of mine own Profession in Religion. Concerning Mr. <hi>Hoil,</hi> I acquainted your Grace. Sir <hi>Ed. Bagshaw,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Flemming,</hi> and divers more, have been, and yet are, pulling from the Rights of my Church. But all these have been light in respect of the dealing of some others professing me kindness, by whom I have been blazed a Papist; an Arminian, a Neuter, a Politician, an Equivocator, a nigardly House-keeper, an Usurer; that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow at the Name of Jesus, pray towards the East; would pull down the Seat of my Predecessor to set up an Altar; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied burial in the Chaneel to one of his Daughters; and to make up all, that I compared your Grace's preaching to one Mr. <hi>Whiskins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Creighton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, and preferred them. That you found your self deceived in
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:60492:198"/>
me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These things have been reported at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and some of the best affected of mine own Diocess (as hath been told me) induced hereby to bewail with Tears the Misery of the Church; some of the Clergy also, as it was said, looking about how they might remove themselves out of this Country. Of all this I heard but little, till Mr. <hi>Price</hi> coming from <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> before <hi>Christmass</hi> to be ordered Deacon, having for his memory set down twelve Articles, among a number of Points more, required satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of me concerning them. Which I endeavoured to give, both to him, and to them of the Ministry, that met at our Chapter for the examination of Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>'s Patent. Omitting all the rest, yet because this Venim hath spread it self so far, I cannot but touch the last, touching the preferring others to your Grace's preaching. To which Mr. <hi>Price</hi>'s answer was, as he told me, <hi>I will be quarter'd if this be true.</hi> Thus it was, Mr. <hi>Dunsterveil</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me with his purpose to preach out of <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>But a faithful Man who can find</hi> Where he said, the Doctrine he meant to raise was this, <hi>That Faith is a rare Gift of God.</hi> I told him, I thought he mistook the meaning of the Text, and wished him to chuse longer Texts, and not to bring his Discourses to a word or two of Scripture, but rather to declare those of the Holy Ghost. He said, your Grace did so. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I answered, there might be just cause; but I thought you did not so ordinarily. As for those Men, Mr. <hi>Whiskins</hi> and the rest, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard any of them preach to this day. Peradventure their manner is to take larger Texts; whereupon the Comparison is made, as if I prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them before you. This Slander did not much trouble me; I know your Grace will not think me such a Fool (if I had no fear of God) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer before your excellent Gifts, Men that I never heard. But look as the French Proverb is, <hi>He that is disposed to kill his Dog, tells Men he is mad:</hi> And whom Men have once wronged, unless the Grace of God be the more, they ever hate. Concerning the wrongs which these People have offered me, I shall take another fit time to inform your Grace. Where they say your Grace doth find your self deceived in me, I think it may be the truest word they have said yet; for indeed, I do think both you and many more are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in me, accounting me to have some Honesty, Discretion, and Grace, more than you will by proof find. But if, as it seems to me, that Form hath this meaning, that they pretend to have undeceived you, I hope they are deceived. Yea, I hope they shall be deceived, if by such Courses as these they think to unsettle me, and the Devil himself also, if he think to dismay me. <hi>I will go on in the strength of the Lord God, and remember his Righteousness, even his alone;</hi> as by that Reverend and good Father my-Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> when I first came over I was exhorted, and have obtained help of God to do unto this day.</p>
                  <p>But had I not work enough before, but I must bring Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> upon my top one that, for his Experience, Purse, Friends, in a case already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, wherein he is ingaged, not only for his profit, but reputation also, will easily no doubt overturn me. How much better to study to be quiet, and to do mine own Business or, as I think, <hi>Stampitius</hi> was wont to bid <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> go into my Study and Pray. My Lord, all these things came to my mind, and at the first I came with a resolution to take heed to my self; and if I could, to teach others moderation and forbearance by mine own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But I could not be quiet; nor without pity hear the Complaints of those that resorted to me, some of them of mine own Neighbours and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, called into the Court, commonly by information of Apparators, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den there without just Cause, and not dismissed without excessive Fees, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they exclaimed. Lastly, One Mr. <hi>Mayot</hi> a Minister of the Diocess of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagh,</hi> made a Complaint to me, that he was Excommunicated by Mr. <hi>Cook;</hi> notwithstanding, as I heard also by others, the Correction of Ministers was
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:60492:198"/>
excepted out of his Patent. Whereupon I desired to see the Patent, and to have a Copy of it, that I might know how to govern my self. He said, Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> being then from home, should bring it me at his return: Himself went to <hi>Dublin</hi> to the Term. At the first view I saw it was a formless Chaös of Authority, conferred upon him against all reason and equity. I had not long after occasion to call the Chapter together, at the time of Ordination: I shewed the Original, being brought forth by Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> desired to know if that were the Chapter-Seal, and these their hands; they acknowledged their Hands and Seal, and said, they were the less careful in passing it, because they accounted it did rather concern my Predecessor than them. I shewed the false Latin, Non-sence, injustice of it, prejudice to them, contrariety to it self, and to the King's Grant to me. I shewed there were in one Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod above 500 words, and which passed the rest, hanging in the Air, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any principal Verb. I desired them to consider, if the Seal hanging to it were the Bishop's Seal. They acknowledged it was not. Therefore with protestation that I meant no way to call in question the sufficiency of Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> or his former Acts, I did judg the Patent to be void, and so declared it, inhibiting Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> to do any thing by virtue thereof, and them to assist him therein. This is the true History of this Business, howsoever Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> disguises it. I suspended him not absent, <hi>&amp; indicta causâ:</hi> It was his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission which was present, that I viewed, with the Chapter, and censured; which if he can make good, he shall have leave, and time, and place e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>And now to accomplish my promise, to relate to your Grace my purpose herein; My Lord, I do thus account, that to any Work or Enterprize, to remove Impediments is a great part of the performance: And amongst all the Impediments to the Work of God amongst us, there is not any one greater, than the abuse of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction. This is not only the Opinion of the most Godly, Judicious, and Learned Men that I have known, but the cause of it is plain: The People pierce not into the inward and true Reasons of things, they are sensible in the Purse. And that Religion that makes Men that profess it, and shews them to be despisers of the World, and so far from encroaching upon others in Matter of base Gain, as rather to part with their own, they magnify.</p>
                  <p>This bred the admiration of the Primitive Christians, and after of the Monks. Contrary Causes must needs produce contrary Effects. Wherefore let us preach never so painfully, and piously; I say more, let us live never so blamelesly our selves, so long as the Officers in our Courts prey upon them, they esteem us no better than Publicans and Worldlings: and so much the more deservedly, because we are called Spiritual Men, and call our selves Reformed Christians. And if the honestest and best of our own Protestants be thus scandalized, what may we think of Papists, such as are all in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that we live among The time was, when I hoped the Church of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was free from this Abuse, at least freer than her Sister of <hi>England;</hi> but I find I am deceived. Whether it be that distance of place, and being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the reach of the Scepter of Justice, breeds more boldness to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, or necessarily brings more delay of redress. I have been wont also in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to except one Court, (as he doth <hi>Plato):</hi> But trust me, my Lord, I have heard, that it is said among great Personages here, that, <hi>My Lord Primate is a good Man, but his Court is as corrupt as others;</hi> some say, <hi>worse.</hi> And which I confess to your Grace, did not a little terrify me from visiting, till I might see how to do it with Fruit; in that of your late Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they see no profit, but the taking of Mony.</p>
                  <p>But to come to Mr. <hi>Cook;</hi> of all that have exercised Jurisdiction in this Land these late Years, he is the most noted Man, and most cried out upon. Insomuch as he hath found from the <hi>Irish</hi> the Nick-name of <hi>Pouc.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:60492:199"/>
he came off with credit when he was questioned, and justified himself by the Table of Fees, (as by a leaden Rule any Stone may be approved as well-hewed); by that little I have met with sitice I came hither, I am induced to believe it was not for lack of Matter, but there was some other cause of his escaping in that Trial. By his pretended Commission, and that Table of Fees, he hath taken in my Predecessor's Time, and seeks to take in mine for Exhibits at Visitations, and his Charges there above the Bishop's Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for Unions, Sequestrations, Relaxations, Certificates, Licences, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations of Penance, Sentences (as our Court calls them) Interlocutory in Causes of Correction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such Fees as I cannot in my Conscience think to be just: and yet he doth it in my Name, and tells me, I cannot call him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to question for it. Alas, my Lord! if this be the condition of a Bishop, that he stands for a Cipher, and only to uphold the Wrongs of other Men, What do I in this Place Am I not bound, by my Profession, made to God in your presence, and following your words, <hi>To be gentle and merciful, for Christ's sake, to poor and needy People, and such as be destitute of help</hi> Can I be excused another day with this, That thus it was e're I came to this place, and that it is not good to be over just Or sith I am perswaded Mr. <hi>Cook's</hi> Patent is unjust and void, am I not bound to make it so And to regulate, If I may, this matter of Fees, and the rest of the Disorders of the Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which his Majesty hath betrusted me withal Your Grace saith truly, It is a difficult thing, if not impossible, to overthrow a Patent so confirmed; and I know in Deliberations, it is one of the most important Considerations what we may hope to effect. But how can I tell, till I have tried To be discouraged e're I begin, is it not to consult with Flesh and Blood Verily I think so, and therefore must put it to the trial, and leave the success to God. If I obtain the Cause, the Profit shall be to this poor Nation; if not, I shall shew my Consent to those my Reverend Brethren that have endeavoured to redress this Enormity before me. I shall have the Testimony of mine own Conscience, to have sought to discharge my Duty to God and his People. Yea, which is the main, the Work of my Ministry, and my Service to this Nation, shall receive furtherance howsoever, rather than any hinderance thereby. And if by the continuance of such Oppressions, any thing fall out otherwise than well, I shall have acquitted my self towards his Majesty, and those that have engaged themselves for me. At last I shall have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reason and juster Cause, to resign to his Majesty the Jurisdiction which I am not permitted to manage. And here I beseech your Grace to consider seriously, whether it were not happy for us to be rid of this Charge, which not being proper to our Calling, nor possibly to be executed without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, as subjects us to the ill conceit of their unjust or indiscreet carriage, and no way furthers our own Work Or if it shall be thought fit to carry this Load still, whether we ought not to procure some way to be discharged of the envy of it, and redress the abuse, with the greatest strictness we can devise For my part, I cannot bethink me of any course fitter for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, than to keep the Courts my self, and set some good Order in them. And to this purpose I have been at <hi>Cavan, Granard,</hi> and <hi>Longford,</hi> &amp;c. and do intend to go to the rest, leaving with some of the Ministry there a few Rules, touching those things that are to be redressed; that if my Health do not permit me to be always present, they may know how to proceed in mine absence. I find it to be true, that <hi>Tully</hi> faith, <hi>Justitia mirifica quaedam res multitudini videtur;</hi> and certainly to our proper Work a great advantage it is, to obtain a good opinion of those we are to deal with. But besides this, there fall out occasions to speak of God and his Presence, of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of a Witness, the Danger of an Oath, the Purity of Marriage, the preciousness of a good Name, repairing of Churches, and the like. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it self may enjoined, and Penitents reconciled, with some profit
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:60492:199"/>
to others besides themselves. Wherefore albeit Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> were the justest Chancellor in this Kingdom, I would think it fit for me, as things now stand, to sit in these Courts; and sith I cannot be heard in the Pulpits to preach as I may in them (albeit Innocency and Justice is also a real kind of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) I have shewed your Grace my Intentions in this Matter. Now should I require your direction in many things, if I were present with you. But for the present it may please you to understand, that at <hi>Granard,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> a Nephew as I take it to my Lord of <hi>Westmeath,</hi> delivered his Letter to Mr. <hi>Astre,</hi> which he delivered me in open Court, requiring that his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants might not be troubled for Christnings, Marriages, or Funerals, so they pay the Minister his due. This referred to a Letter of my Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor's to the like purpose, which yet was not delivered till the Court was risen. I answered generally, that none of my Lord's Tenants, or others, should be wronged. The like Motion was made at <hi>Longford</hi> by two or three of the <hi>Farralls,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Faganah</hi> in <hi>Rosse;</hi> to whom I gave the like answer; and added, that I would be strict in requiring them to bring their Children to be baptized, and Marriages to be solemnized likewise with us, sith they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleg these to be lawful and true; so as it was but wilfulness if any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear. Here I desire your Grace to direct me; for to give way that they should not be so much as called in question, seems to further the Schism they labour to make. To lay any pecuniary Mulct upon them, as the value of a License for Marriage, 3 or 4 <hi>s.</hi> for a Christening, I know not by what Law it can be done. To excommunicate them for not appearing or obeying, they being already none of our Body, and a multitude, it is to no profit, nay rather makes the Exacerbation worse.</p>
                  <p>Many things more I have to confer with your Grace about, which I hope to do <hi>coràm;</hi> as about the reedifying of Churches, or employing the Mass-houses (which now the State enquires of) about Books, Testaments, and the Common-Prayer Book; which being to be reprinted, would perhaps be in some things bettered: But specially about Men to use them, and means to maintain them, now that our English have engrossed their Livings: About the printing the Psalter, which I have caused to be diligently surveyed by Mr. <hi>James Nangle,</hi> who adviseth not to meddle with the Verse, but set forth only the Prose, which he hath begun to write out fair to the Press. Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugh King</hi> I have not heard of a long time, I hope he goeth on in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Books of the Old Testament. Mr. <hi>Crian</hi> was with me about a Fortnight after I came to <hi>Kilmore,</hi> since I heard not of him. Of all these things, if by the will of God I may make a journey over to you, we shall speak at fall.</p>
                  <p>As I was closing up these, this Morning, there is a Complaint brought me from <hi>Ardagh,</hi> that where in a Cause Matrimonial in the Court at <hi>Longford,</hi> a Woman had proceeded thus far, as after Contestation, the Husband was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to appear the next Court to receive a Libel; One <hi>Shane age</hi> in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerney,</hi> the Popish Vicar-General of <hi>Ardagh</hi> had excommunicated her; and she was by one <hi>Hubart</hi> in <hi>Cutril,</hi> a Popish Priest, upon <hi>Sunday</hi> lass, put out of the Church, and denounced excommunicate. Herein, whether it were more sit to proceed against the Vicar and Priest, by virtue of the last Letters from the Council; or complain to them, I shall attend your Grace's advices And now for very shame, ceasing to be troublesome, I do recommend your Grace to the protection of our merciful Father, and rest,</p>

                  <p>I Thank your Lordship for the great pains you have taken in writing so large a Letter unto me; and especially for putting me in mind of that comfortable place of the Apostle, which you mention in the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But as for the matter of Merriment (as you call it) contained in your inclosed Recusation, I confess my Ignorance to have been such, that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not where the Jest lay: Yet when I shewed it to those that had better skill in the Law than my self, I saw that they did heartily laugh at it: whose Reasons I had no list to examine, but referred the scanning thereof to the <hi>Judex ad quem,</hi> to whom the cognisance of this Matter now proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongeth.</p>
                  <p>Most of the Slanders wherewith you were so much troubled, I never heard of till you now mentioned them your self; only the course which you took with the Papists, was generally cried out against: neither do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, in all my life, that any thing was done here by any of ours, at which the Professors of the Gospel did take more offence, or by which the Adversaries were more confirmed in their Superstitions and Idolatry. Whereas I could wish, that you had advised with your Brethren, before you would adventure to pull down that which they have been so long a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so I may boldly aver, that they have abused grosly both of us, who reported unto you, that I should give out, that I found my self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in you. What you did, I know was done out of a good intention, but I was assured that your Project would be so quickly refuted with the present Success and Egent, that there would be no need that your Friends should advise you to desist from building such Castles in the Air. Of Mr. <hi>Whiskins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Creighton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bexter</hi>'s preaching, I heard not a word till now. Would God that all the Lord's People might prophesy, and there might be thousands of his faithful Servants that might go beyond me in doing our Master's Work: the Spirit that it in me (I trust) shall never last after such enuy.</p>

way to help this is, not to take away the Jurisdiction from the Chancellors, and to put it into the Bishops hands alone. All Bishops are not like my Lord of <hi>Kilmore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know a Bishop in this Land, who exerciseth the Jurisdiction himself; and I dare boldly say, that there is more Unjustice and Oppression to be found in him alone, than in all the Chancellors in the whole Kingdom put together; and though I do not justify the taking of Fees without good ground, yet I may truly say, of a great part of mine own, and of many other Bishops Diocesses, that if Men stood not more in fear of the Fees of the Court, than of standing in a white Sheet, we should have here among us another <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your course of taking pains in keeping Courts your self, I will commend, so that you condemn not them that think they have reason why they should do otherwise. As for my self, <hi>mecum habito,</hi> and am not ignorant, <hi>quam sit mihi curta supellex.</hi> My Chancellor is better skilled in the Law than I am, and far better able to manage Matters of that kind; <hi>Suam quis<expan>

                        </expan> norit ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> runneth still in my mind; and how easy a matter it is for a Bishop that is ignorant in the Law, to do wrong unto others, and run himself into a Premunire; and where Wrong is done, I know Right may more easily be had against a Chancellor, than against a Bishop. If my Chancellor doth Wrong, the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> lieth open, where I will be the Man that will cast the first Stone at him my self, as I did for the removing and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of him whom I found at my first coming into the Diocess of <hi>Meath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for my late visiting of your Diocesses, your Lordship need not a whit be terrified therewith. It is not to be expected that an Arch-bishop passing through a whole Province upon a suddain, should be able to perform that which a Bishop may do by leasure, in his every years Visitation: Neither may the Arch-bishop meddle with the Reformation of any thing but what is presented; If any such Presentation were made, and reformation of the Abuse neglected, there is cause to complain of the Visitation.</p>
                  <p>But as for the taking of Mony, your Lordship will find, that when you come next to visit your self, there will be great odds betwixt the Sum that ought to be paid unto you, and that which was delivered unto me; and yet if your Clergy can get but half so much for their Mony from you, as they did from me, they may say, you were the best Bishop that ever came among them.</p>
                  <p>When the Clergy of the Diocess of <hi>Ardagh</hi> was betrayed into the hands of their Adversaries, <hi>(à quibius minime omnium oportuorat)</hi> and like to be so overborn, that many of them could scarce have a bit of Bread lest them to put in their Mouths; I stood then in the Gap, and opposed my self for them against the whole Country, and stayed that Plague.</p>
                  <p>In the other Diocess of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> when complaint was made against the Clergy by that Knave, (whom they say your Lordship did absolve) I took him in hand, and if the Clergy had not failed in the prosecution, would have bound him fast enough, without asking any question for Conscience-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And whereas they held their Means, as it were, by courtesy from the State, I took the pains my self to make up the Table of all their Tithes and Duties, and at this very instant am working in <hi>England</hi> to have it firmly established unto them by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Authority. And yet the Sums of Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The Writings which you sent me, I had long before from the same hand which sent them unto you; I should be glad to hear your judgment of them,

                     <salute>My very good Lord;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Thank your Grace heartily for your Letters, especially for the Preface of this your last. It is true, my Lord, God hath restor'd me, even from Death it self, for I think no Man was farther gone, and scap'd. And your Grace doth very Christian-like put me in mind, that God having renewed my Lease, I should pay him an Income of some Service to his Church; which I hope, in the strength of his Grace, I shall ever be willing, and sometime able to perform. I have not yet recovered the great Weakness into which my Sickness cast me, but, I hope, when the Spring is come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, my strength will encrease, and enable me to Service.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, my Lord, as weak as I have been, I have begun to pay my Fine; but what the Sum comes to, God knows, is very little. Your Table of the Tithes of <hi>Ulster,</hi> and the Business concerning the Impropriations, are both past; and concerning both, I leave my self to Mr. <hi>Hygat</hi>'s Report.</p>
                  <p>As touching the Deanery of <hi>Armagh,</hi> I am glad to hear that any place of Preferment in that Kingdom, hath so good means of subsistence without Tithes. But I must needs acquaint your Grace, that neither my Lord of <hi>Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For, First, Upon an attempt made by the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> to bring <hi>Vossius</hi> into <hi>England</hi> to be a Reader in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> the <hi>States</hi> allowed him better Maintenance, and were unwilling to have him come; and himself was not very willing, in regard of his Wife, and many Children, being loth to bring them from all their Kindred and Friends into a strange place. And if he were unwilling upon these Grounds to come into <hi>England,</hi> I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will venture to <hi>Ireland</hi> or no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="427" facs="tcp:60492:201"/>
But, secondly, my Lord; since this, my Lord Duke in his life-time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him of his Majesty, the Reversion of a Prebend in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which is since fallen; and <hi>Voss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

After he had seen both the Universities, he return'd home again, and within these two days I received a Letter from him of the safety of his return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> notwithstanding his absence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     </hi> Now, I think, the Prebend of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (would he have been Priest, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided upon it) would have been as much to him as the Deanery of <hi>Armagh.</hi> But howsoever, (my Lord) the King having given him that Preferment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, will hardly be brought to give him another, especially considering what I could write unto you, were it fit. Nevertheless, out of my lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to the Work you mention, if you can prevail with <hi>Vossius</hi> to be willing, and that it may appear the Deanery of <hi>Armagh</hi> will be of sufficient Means for him and his numerous Family, if your Grace then certify me of it, I will venture to speak, and do such Offices as shall be fit.</p>
                  <p>And now, my Lord, for your own Business, Mr. <hi>Archibald Hamilton,</hi> who it seems, by your Grace's Letters, is your Agent here, hath not as yet been with me; but whensoever he shall come, he shall be very welcome; and I hope your Grace knows, I will be very ready to do that Church and you the best Service I can. As I had written thus far, Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> came to me; so that now I shall inform my self, as well as I can, of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Business, which he tells me is perple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, little or nothing can be done; but so soon as he comes back, I will not be wanting to that part which shall be laid upon me.</p>
                  <p>I formerly writ to your Grace about divers Businesses, and I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your Answer to the most of them, only to one particular you have answered nothing, which makes me think that Letter scarce came safe to your hands: It is about the Bishoprick of <hi>Kilfanora,</hi> which is so poor in it self, that no Man asks it of the King; and his Majesty is graciously pleased that your Lordship would think of some good Parsonage, or Vicari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And though nothing be now perchance actually void to fit this Purpose, yet I conceive the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexation may be presently made, though the Profit arising from the thing, come not to the Bishop till it become void. I pray your Grace take as much care of this as possibly you can, and let me hear from you what may be done.</p>
                  <p>This Letter, my Lord, is a great deal too long; but so many Occasions would not suffer it to be shorter. I wish you all Health, and so leave you to the Grace of God, ever resting,</p>

                  <p>THe Superscription of your Grace's Letters was most welcome unto me, as bringing under your own Hand, the best evidence of the recovery of your Health; for which I did, and do give hearty thanks unto God. For the Contents of them, as your Grace conceived, they were not so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant; but <hi>the Wounds of a Friend are faithful,</hi> saith the Wise Man: Sure, they are no less painful than any other. Unkindness cuts nearer to the Heart than Malice can do. I have some experience by your Grace's said Letters: Concerning which I have been at some debate with my self, whether I should answer them with <hi>David</hi>'s Demand; <hi>What have I now done</hi> Or as the Wrongs of Parents, with Patience and Silence. But Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> telling me, that this day he is going towards you, I will speak once, come of it what will.</p>
                  <p>You writ, <q>That the course I took with the Papists was generally cried out against; neither do you remember, in all your Life, that any thing was done here by any of us, at which the Professors of the Gospel did take more offence, or by which the Adversaries were more confirmed in their Superstitions and Idolatry. Wherein you could wish, that I had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised with my Brethren, before I would adventure to pull down that which they have been so long a building. Again, what I did, you know was done out of a good intention; but you were assured that my Project would be so quickly refuted, with the present Success and Event, that there would be no need my Friends should advise me from building such Castles in the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lord, all this is a Riddle to me. What course I have taken with the Papists; What I have done, at which the Professors of the Gospel did take such offence, or the Adversaries were so confirmed: What it is that I have adventured to do, or what Piece so long a building, I have pulled down: what those Projects were, and those Castles in the Air so quickly refuted with present success, as the Lord knows I know not. For truly, since I came to this place, I have not changed one jot of my Purpose, or Practice, or Course with Papists, from that which I held in <hi>England,</hi> or in <hi>Trinity-Colledg,</hi> or found (I thank God) any ill Success, but the Slanders only of some Persons discontented against me for other Occasions: Against which I cannot hope to justify my self, if your Grace will give ear to private Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. But let me know, I will not say my Accuser, (let him continue mask'd till God discover him) but my Transgression, and have place of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and if mine Adversary write a Book against me, I will hope to bear it on my Shoulder, and bind it to me as a Crown.</p>
                  <p>For my recusation of your Court, and advertisement what I heard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; I see they have stirred, not only Laughter, but some Coals too. Your Chancellor desires me to acquit him to you, that he is none of those Officers I meant: I do it very willingly; for I never meant him, nor any Man else; but thought it concerned your Grace to know what I credibly heard to be spoken concerning your Court. Neither, as God knows, did I ever think it was fit to take away the Jurisdiction from Chancellors, and put it into
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:60492:202"/>
the Bishops Hands alone; or so much as in a Dream condemn those that think they have reason to do otherwise nor tax your Grace's Visitation; nor imagine you would account that to pertain to your Reproof, and take it as a Wrong from me, which out of my Duty to God and you, I thought was not to be concealed from you. I beseech you pardon me this one Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>Si unquam posthac.</hi> For that <hi>Knave</hi> whom (as your Grace writes) they say I did absolve; I took him for one of my Flock, or rather Christ's, for whom he shed his Blood. And I would have absolved <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> under the same form.</p>
                  <p>Some other Passages there be in your Grace's Letters, which I—But I will lay mine Hand upon mine Mouth. And craving the blessing of your Prayers, ever remain,</p>

For although I easily grant, that my Lord Treasurer, and the Chancellor of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> might certify unto his Majesty, that there was no other thing left to be passed here but Impropriations, (though Sir <hi>John Bathe,</hi> I think, hath found already somewhat else to be passed in his Book, and may do more if he will not be so hasty, but take time to enquire): Yet how doth it appear that either of these two noble Gentlemen did as much as know that his Majesty had taken a former Order for the settlement of these things upon the Church To which Resolution had they been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, I do so presume of their Nobleness and care of the Publick Good, that the remittal of a Matter of two thousand pounds, would not induce them to divert his Majesty from making good that precious Donation, which (by the Example of his Father of never-dying memory) he had solemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God and his Church: such an eximious Act of Piety, as is not to be countervalued with two, or twenty thousand pounds of any earthly Treasure. But whatsoever they knew, or knew not of his Majesty's own pious Resolution, and constant Purpose, never to revoke that which he hath once given unto God; I rest so confident, as I dare pawn my Life upon it, that when he did sign those Letters of Sir <hi>John Bathe</hi>'s, he had not the least
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:60492:203"/>
intimation given unto him, that this did any way cross that former Gift which he made unto the Church, upon so great and mature deliberation, as being grounded upon the Advice, first, of the Commissioners sent into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> then, of the Lords of the Council upon their report in <hi>England;</hi> thirdly, of King <hi>James,</hi> that ever blessed Father of the Church; and lastly, of the Commissioners for Irish Affairs, unto whom for the last debating and conclusion of this business, I was by his now Majesty, referr'd my self at my being in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know Sir <hi>John</hi> and his Counsel do take notice of all those Reasons that may seem to make any way for themselves. But your Lordships may do well to consider, that such Letters as these have come before now, wherein Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have been expresly named, and those general <hi>Non obstantes</hi> also put, which are usual in this kind: and yet notwithstanding all this, his Majesty intimateth unto you in his last Letters, that he will take a time to examine those Proceedings, and punish those that then had so little regard to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and direct expression of his Royal Pleasure for the disposing of the Impropriations to the general benefit of the Church: Which whether it carrieth not with it a powerful <hi>Non obstante</hi> to that surreptious Grant now in question: I hold it more safe for your Lordships to take Advice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your selves, than from any other bodies Counsel, who think it their Duty to speak any thing for their Clients Fee.</p>
                  <p>As for the want of Attestation, wherewith the credit of the Copy of a Letter transmitted unto you is laboured to be impaired: If the Testimony of my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> who procured it, and the Bishop Elect of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fennora,</hi> who is the bringer of it, and of a Dean and an Arch-Deacon now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who themselves saw it, will not suffice; it will not be many days (in all likelihood) before the Original it self shall be presented to your Lordships. In the mean time, I desire (and more than desire, if I may presume to go so far) that your Lordships will stay your hands from passing Sir <hi>John Bathe</hi>'s Patent, until my Lord of <hi>London</hi> himself shall signifie his Majesties further Pleasure unto you in this Particular. And it my Zeal hath carried me any way further than Duty would require, I beseech your Lordships to consider, that I deal in a Cause that highly concerneth the good of the Church, unto which I profess I owe my whole self; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore craving Pardon for this my Boldness, I humbly take leave, and rest, still to continue</p>

YOU are to inform your self whether Sir <hi>John Bathe</hi>'s Patent be already sealed; and if it be, whether it were done before Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day (which was the day wherein I received and answered the Lords Justices Letters touching this business; and at which time they signified the Patent was as yet unpast) and use all speedy means, that the Patent may not be

delivered into Sir <hi>John Bathes</hi> hands before you be heard to speak what you can against it, and if that also be done, I authorize you to signifie unto the Lords Justices, that I must and will complain against them to his Sacred Majesty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You are to go unto Sir <hi>James Ware</hi> the younger from me, and enquire <note place="margin">

                     </note> of him whether he gave any Certificate unto my Lord Treasurer, and the Chancellor of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> that the King had not of Temporal Lands the annual Rent of 300 <hi>l.</hi> to grant in reversion; but that of necessity must be supplied with the Grant of the reversion of Tithes impropriate. And withal, learn of him, to what value the Temporal Rents, not yet passed in reversion, do arise; and what proportion thereof Sir <hi>John Bathe</hi> is now a passing in his Book.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas the Lords Justices in their Letter do signifie unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> that such a Certificate had been made unto his Majesty by the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, and Chancellor of the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> you may certifie them that Sir <hi>John Bathe</hi> sent unto me a Certificate under their hands, to view; wherein they do inform his Majesty, that in their Judgments the granting of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="4">4. Take a view of Sir <hi>John Bathe</hi>'s Letter, and consider (with your Counsel) first, whether there be any general <hi>Non obstante</hi> in it against all precedent Instructions and Directions (of which I much doubt.)

                  <p n="5">5. Let Sir <hi>John Bathe</hi> be demanded upon his Conscience, whether he did so much as know that I had obtained any such Letter from his Majesty when he procured his If he did; why did he not (to take away all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of surreption) cause a special <hi>Non obstante</hi> to be inserted against it as well as he hath done against another particular Instruction, mentioned in the end of his Letter If he did not (as his Kinsman, who brought me the Lords Justices Letters assured me he did not,) how in any common intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can it be presumed that the Particularities of my former Letter were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>MY very good Lord. The Book and Papers which you were pleased to send to me, I have now returned with Thanks. Of which I made this use so soon as I had received them, that I gave Directions to Mr. <hi>Price</hi> to insert those Additions unto the 13th Chapter of Perseverance, and § 3. both in the beginning, whereof I spake of <hi>Adulti, (of whom properly this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy is understood.)</hi> And in the end thereof, where I speak of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, touching whom, <hi>I say first, That this Controversy is not understood of those, who neither are endued with Habit of Grace, nor are able to produce the Acts thereof, as not having the use of Reason. And therefore being neither justified by Faith, nor sanctified by the Habits of Grace, cannot be said to fall from them.</hi> Thus I thought good to rid my self of that Question, rather then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess a difference from them, who, notwithstanding that Objection taken from Baptism, agree with me in the Doctrine of Perseverance; yet I must profess to your Grace, that I do not subscribe to their Opinion, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the benefit of Baptism beyond either the Purpose, or Covenant of Grace. But hereof more when it shall please God to give us a meeting. In the mean time, and always, I commend your Grace to the gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almighty; In whom I ever rest</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Since the receipt of your Lordship's Letters, there hath hapned the most doleful dissolving of our University, and the most suddain dispersion of our Students that ever I knew, occasioned by the Infection brought hither by a Souldier or two, dismissed not long since from the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Army, in <hi>February</hi> last. So as, whereas this time was our chief time of the Year for Acts and Disputations, now our School-gates are shut up, and our Colledges left desolate and empty almost. There have died of this Infection, from the last of <hi>February,</hi> till the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 24 Persons; and since then till <hi>May</hi> 15, 30 more, and 7 more. The Magistrates are careful. But the Charge groweth great, both in maintaining the Infected, and the Poor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <note place="margin">61 <hi>in all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </note> us, which want both Means and Work. I pray God we may be sensible of our Sins, and his heavy Hand, and may by serious Repentance meet him, that so he may forgive our Sins, and heal our Town and Land.</p>
                  <p>I received in your Lordship's Letter, the Copy of Sir <hi>John Breerton's</hi> Will inclosed, signed with your Grace's Hand: For which, in the Name of our whole Society, I humbly thank your Lordship. It seemeth the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:60492:206"/>
is not yet put in. I received also by Mr. <hi>Stubbin,</hi> a Letter from Mr. <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal-Breerton,</hi> sole Executor to Sir <hi>John</hi> his Brother; who at his coming into <hi>England</hi> from you, promiseth me to acquaint the Colledg with the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Brothers Bequest. I have heard Mr. <hi>Randal</hi> very well reported of; and I hope verily he will faithfully discharge the Trust reposed in him by his deceased Brother. I will still intreat your Lordship, when the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is exhibited, for a Copy to be sent us.</p>
                  <p>If my leasure permit, I will hearken (God willing) to your Lordship's Motion, of revising my Lectures of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Free-will.</hi> In my proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in my Readings, I acquainted your Lordship formerly, with some op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position I had from some in our University, under pretence of violating his Majesty's Declaration; which, I say, I do not. And so as yet I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in reading on that Argument, though not in naming the Authors <hi>[Remonstrants]</hi> whom I impugn. If God give opportunity, and health, I will do the like in my Readings upon the <hi>Eucharist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> hath transcribed his Readings, <hi>de Praedest. &amp; Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batione, &amp; morte Christi.</hi> I am instant with him to transcribe other Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his.</p>
                  <p>I suppose your Lordship hath heard of my Lord of <hi>Sarum,</hi> how he was questioned for his Sermon before his Majesty, in the beginning of <hi>Lent</hi> last; the Particulars whereof you shall more fully understand by the enclosed parcel of a Letter he wrote to me. I am right sorry, the delivery of the established Doctrine of our Church should thus be questioned.</p>
                  <p>I have vindicated my Reasons. I sent one in our University touching the <hi>17th</hi> Article, from such Answers as he had returned me; As also sundry Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> from the like opposition; which I sent the same Party, tending to shew, that according to St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> the <hi>Non-Elect</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to be justified by a true and lively Faith, nor ever are by that Bond mystically united to Christ as their Head, nor ever attain unto true Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is worthily done of your Lordship, to set forth <hi>Marianus Scotus emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datê,</hi> and his Abridger; who as it seemeth, abridged his Work in <hi>Marianus</hi>'s life-time; for <hi>Marianus</hi> died but a little before <hi>Rob. Lotharingus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As touching the History of <hi>Gotteschalcus,</hi> I wish it may be cleared out of the Ancient Monuments. It seemeth your Lordship hath taken pains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. It may occasion Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> to revise his Story touching him. I make no doubt but that the <hi>Semi-Pelagians</hi> &amp; <hi>Massilienses,</hi> were the first insertors of the <hi>Pradestinatiani</hi> into the Catalogue of Hereticks: And it may seem that <hi>Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius jun</hi> who writ upon the <hi>Psalms,</hi> was one of the first, that imposed the Name of <hi>Heresy</hi> upon the Doctrine of Predestination and Reprobation, as it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by St. <hi>Augustine, vid.</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 108. And was the first that stiled the <note place="margin">Biblioth. Sanct. lib. 4. in <hi>Arnob.</hi>
                     </note> holding of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Doctrine, <hi>Praedestinatus,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 146. For I conceive he was in time before <hi>Tyro Prosper, Faustus,</hi> or <hi>Gennadius.</hi> For the conjecture of <hi>S. Senenses</hi> seemeth to me probable, that this <hi>Arnobius</hi> lived in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Time, for that his Commentary upon the <hi>Psalms,</hi> is ascribed to two <hi>African</hi> Bishops, <hi>Laurentio &amp; Rustico Episcopis.</hi> Now <hi>S. Senensis</hi> saith, he findeth in a Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in which St. <hi>Austin</hi> was present, there were also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Laurentius Icositanus,</hi> and <hi>Rusticus.</hi> Though I find not this in any one Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> yet I easily believe it was so, for I find that <hi>Rusticus</hi> an <hi>African</hi> Bishop, was one of them Bishops, which in a Synodical Epistle to <hi>Innocentius</hi> 1. condemned <hi>Pelagins</hi> and <hi>Caelestius;</hi> the Epistle is the <hi>90th</hi> Epistle amongst St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Epistles; where two of that Name <hi>[Rusticus]</hi> are mentioned; this Epistle was written <hi>Anno</hi> 416. Now shortly after, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 419, in that Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> wherein the Book of Canons, which is <hi>Codex Africanus,</hi> was confirmed, there were present 217 Bishops, as the <hi>Code</hi> saith, of which only 24 are named; in which number are St. <hi>Austin</hi>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:60492:206"/>
and <hi>Laurentius Jositanus:</hi> And it is very credible, that <hi>Rusticus</hi> living a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before, was among the 193 the rest which were not named. Again it is observed, both by <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his Preface prefixed before <hi>Arnobius,</hi> and by S. <hi>Senensis</hi> also, That in these Commentaries are found, sundry unusual Latin words, which in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Time were very usual amongst the <hi>Africans;</hi> which though <hi>Laurentius de la Barre</hi> doth hold to be no sufficient Reason, yet it carrieth with it no little probability.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tyro Prosp.</hi> may seem to be the next, who (as it seemeth) was not that <hi>Prosp. Aquitanus,</hi> who was <hi>Episcopus Rhegiensis</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> though they both continued St. <hi>Hierome, ad eadem usque tempora.</hi> According to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Directions, I looked into the <hi>Prosper</hi> which is in <hi>Bennet-Colledg</hi> Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and I find, <hi>Ad Arcadii &amp; Honorii, An.</hi> xxiv. thus, <hi>Praedestinatorum hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resis quae ab Augustino accepisse initium dicitur, hiis temporibus serpere exorsa;</hi> just as it is in the Manuscript which is in his Majesty's Library at St. <hi>James</hi>'s (as I remember your Lordship told me). The four Divines of <hi>Leyden,</hi> in the Censure of the Remonstrants Confession, relate the words of <hi>Tyro Prosp.</hi> thus; <hi>Praedestinatorum Haeresis, quae ex Augustini libris malè intellectis accepisse dicitur initium, hiis temporibus serpere exorsa, sine specie tamen erroris,</hi> pag. 97. The last words are not in my <hi>Tyro Prosp.</hi> which is amongst the Works of <hi>P. Pithaeus,</hi> nor in the Manuscript of <hi>Bennet-Colledg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After these <hi>Faustus</hi> and <hi>Gennadius</hi> continued this Nick-name; the latter expresly, in the continuation of the <hi>Index Haeresium Hieronymi,</hi> where he perstringeth a Sentence of <hi>Augustine contra Julianum,</hi> lib. 5. c. 3. as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Now howsoever <hi>Sigebert</hi> relateth the Opinion of the <hi>Predestinati,</hi> as having grown out of the misunderstanding of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and not as any just sequel of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Doctrine. Yet it may seem that both the <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silienses,</hi> and some <hi>Africans</hi> in St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Time, did conceive the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is related by <hi>Sigebert,</hi> to be a just Sequel of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Doctrine, as it may appear by <hi>Prosp. in Epistola ad Augustinum.

                  <p>I send you here inclosed also <hi>Gulielmus Malmesburiensis</hi> his short Preface before his Abbreviation of <hi>Amularius.</hi> As for <hi>Scotus de perfectione Statuum,</hi> it is 16 Folio and 1 Page. The Argument, or Conclusion, which he goeth <note place="margin">Rather <hi>Fol.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 1.</note> about to demonstrate, is this, <hi>Quod status Praelatorum &amp; Pastorum Ecclesiae praesupponit statum alium perfectiorem quam sit omnis status Praelationis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storalis.</hi> If your Lordship desire a Copy, I will see, when God shall bring together our dispersed Students, if I can get a sit <hi>Amanuensis.</hi>

                  <p>As for Dr. <hi>Walsall</hi>'s Manuscript of <hi>Rathrammus,</hi> I know where it is. I think it were not amiss to print both those Treatises of <hi>Rathram</hi>'s, with that <hi>De Corpore &amp; Sanguine Domini,</hi> which is already extant. If I do not print them, your Lordship shall have a Copy.</p>
                  <p>As for the Latin Copy of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epistles, in <hi>Caius-Colledg</hi> Library, I was in good hope it had been the same with an old printed Translation which I have; but comparing them together, I find them differ much. I acquainted Mr. <hi>Thomas Whalley,</hi> now Dr. <hi>Whalley,</hi> with that you wrote in your Letter. He seemed to me not unwilling to undertake; but now in this contagious time he is gone into the Country. I spoke also with Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledg, who it seemeth hath taken some pains already in it, but then he was to go into the Country. I am informed by some Fellows in
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:60492:207"/>
that Colledg, that being shortly to depart from the Colledg, by his time there allotted, finding in himself some impediment in his utterance, he could wish to be imployed by your Lordship in such-like Business. He is a good Scholar, and an honest Man. The worst is, the Book cannot be lent out of the Colledg. I will see (by God's Grace) at the return of our Students, what can be done if God send life.</p>
                  <p>As touching those Papers which I sent, touching the Efficacy of Baptism in Infants; I do acknowledg it a Point in which the Scriptures are sparing. The occasion of my Determination, was (as I think I signified in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Letters) for that the Question was given with a purpose to impugn the Doctrine of Perseverance, as they conceived, by an undeniable Argument. I was very loth the Question should be brought upon the Commencement-Stage, and therefore signified to the then Vice-Chancellor, that it would intrench upon the Question of Perseverance, which is one of those Questions (I said) his Majesty would not have discussed, which he signifieth by his Declaration. Yet he replied, the Affirmative Part of the Question was the authorized Doctrine of our Church, as appeared in the Rubrick, of defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Confirmation: And the Answerer was importunate to have that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; and so accordingly it was over-ruled by the major part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. I had heretofore thought upon the Point somewhat. And my Lord of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and my self, at <hi>Dort,</hi> had speech of it, when we signified in our Judgment, That the Case of Infants was not appertaining to the Question of Perseverance. I considered also, that howsoever the Scripture sparingly speak of the Effect of Baptism in Infants, yet there are general Grounds, from the Nature of Sacraments, which may serve to inform and direct our Judgments herein. Again, I considered the perpetual Tradition of the Church is no way to be slighted, where it doth not cross the Scripture, but is consonant to general Grounds contained in them.</p>
                  <p>My Lord of <hi>Derry</hi> is a worthy Man, and whom I do much reverence; yet I would wish his Lordship to be well advised. I doubt not but the Doctrine of Perseverance may sufficiently be cleared, though we grant that all Infants baptized, be free from Original Guilt. The Speech in <hi>Lombard</hi> alleadged, as out of St. <hi>Augustine, Sacramenta in solis electis effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt quod figurant,</hi> is no where to be found in St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> And if it were, yet it is to be understood as <hi>Lombard</hi> doth gloss it, otherwise <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> should contradict himself, as is evident by the Testimonies he there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth out of <hi>Austin;</hi> and many more which might be brought for Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Original Sin in all baptized Infants, out of him. I know most of our Divines do make the principal End and Effect of all Sacraments to be Obsignation, and all Sacraments to be meerly Obsignatory Signs; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that Ablution of Infants from Original Sin, is only conditional and expectative, of which they have no benefit, till they believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; I cannot easily assent hereunto.</p>
                  <p>For so, 1. Infants Baptized, dying in infancy, have no benefit by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. And all Non-Elect Infants have no benefit at all, so that to both of these they are <hi>nuda &amp; inefficacia signa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, 2. what necessity of baptizing of Infants, if it produce no effect till Years of Discretion</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though our Divines do most-what run upon Obsignation, yet often they do expresly hold, that Sacraments do offer and exhibit that Grace which they signify, and as I conceive must needs offer and exhibit the Grace which they signify, before they Assure and Confirm. For God doth offer and exhibit Grace promised in the Sacrament, then we exercise our Faith in relying upon God, promising, offering, and exhibiting on his part; and so according to the Tenure of the Covenant, receive the Grace
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:60492:207"/>
promised, and then Sacraments in the second place do assure us of the Grace received. And thus much is signified in the definition of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our short Catechism, as I conceive, when it is said, <hi>It is an outward visible Sign, of an inward Spiritual Grace given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a Means whereby we receive the same, and a Pledg to assure us thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that first it is a Means whereby God doth offer and exhibit on his part the Grace it signifieth; which we receiving by Faith, it then also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a Pledg, to assure us of the receipt thereof. So the <hi>Eucharist</hi> doth first offer and exhibit, <hi>Augmentum gratiae &amp; auctiorem, auctiorem &amp; perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiorem communionem cum Christi corpore &amp; sanguine, &amp; participationem in beneficiis inde fluentibus;</hi> and then it is a Pledg to assure us thereof. And so <hi>Ursinus</hi> truly saith, <hi>Baptismus &amp; coena Domini sunt Sacramenta,—quia sunt opus Dei, qui aliquid in iis, nobis dat, &amp; se dare testatur;</hi> and he hath many Speeches to this purpose. So <hi>Calvin, Institut.</hi>

So that instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal conveyance of the Grace signified, to the due Receiver, is as true an Effect or End of a Sacrament, when it is duly administred, as Obsignation, and is praeexisting in order of Nature to Obsignation: for Obsignation must be of that, <hi>quod prius datur &amp; exhibetur,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> often saith. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in mine Opinion, doth truly explicate the Nature of Sacraments, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 57, 59, 60, 64, &amp; 67. Nay, it may seem, that Obsignation is not so essential as <hi>exhibitio rei signatae,</hi> for the latter may be without the former, as in the Baptism of Infants, where no preparation, <hi>ex parte suscipientis,</hi> but only Capacity and Not-resistance is sufficient, <hi>ad rem signatam recipiendam.</hi> All these I submit to your Lordship's Judgment, and will not be contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if any can bring that which is more demonstrative out of Scriptures, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> saith as we say, touching the efficacy of Baptism in Infants, and yet holdeth the Doctrine <hi>de perseverantia fidelium,</hi> as well as we do.</p>
                  <p>Thus fearing too much Prolixity may argue me to be unmannerly, I hold my hand—</p>
                  <p>I know not how my Lord of <hi>Kilmore</hi> doth sort with the Irish. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self he hath godly and pious Intentions: He is discreet and wise, industrious and diligent, and of great sufficiency many ways. I do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self, the more your Lordship doth know him, the more your Lordship will love him: And this I dare say, he truly honoureth and sincerely loveth your Lordship. And thus with my affectionate and earnest Prayers to the God of Heaven, for the continuance of your Lordship, and him, and my Reverend good Lord of <hi>Derry,</hi> for the good of his Church; and to multiply his Graces upon you, and to give you all, Health here, and Happiness hereafter: With tender of my best Service to your Lordship, I commend you to the most gracious protection of the highest Majesty.</p>

                     <hi>A Passage in my former Letters to Mr. Doctor</hi> Ward.</head>
                  <p>I Thank you for the two Treatises, that of my Lord of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and your own, which you were pleased to communicate to me. Concerning which, to give you mine opinion shortly, for the present. This I do yield to my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> most willingly, that the <hi>Justification, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption which Children have in Baptism,</hi> is not <hi>univocè,</hi> the same with that which <hi>adulti</hi> have. And this I likewise do yeild to you, that it is <hi>vera solutio reatus, &amp; veracitèr, &amp; in rei veritate</hi> performed, and all the like emphatical forms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all these <hi>sacramentalitèr,</hi> and that is <hi>obsiguativè ex formulâ &amp; conditione foederis.</hi> Where you make Circumcision and Baptism to be <hi>the remedy of Original Sin.</hi> I think it be too specially said, which is true of all Sin. And so much the Text <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. with the rest do shew. I do think also that <hi>Reprobates coming to Years of Discretion, after Baptism, shall be condemned for Original Sin.</hi> For their Absolution and washing in Baptism was but conditional and expectative, which doth truly interest them in all the Promises of God, but under the condition of repenting, believing, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which they never perform, and therefore never attain the Promise. Consider well what you will say of Women before Christ, which had no Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and of all Mankind before Circumcision was instituted; and you will perceive, I think, the nature of Sacraments to be not as Medicines, but as Seals, to confirm the Covenant, not to confer the Promise immediately. These things I write now in exceeding post-haste, in respect that this Bearer goes away so presently. I only give <hi>sapienti occasionem.</hi> I think the empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Speeches of <hi>Augustin</hi> against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and of <hi>Prosper</hi> are not so much to be regarded, (who say the like of the Eucharist also) touching the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and efficacy in the case of Infants, and they are very like the Speeches of <hi>Lanfranck</hi> and <hi>Guitmund</hi> of Christ's Presence in the Sacrament, opposing <hi>

                     <hi>A Passage out of his last Letters to me,</hi> May 28.</head>
                  <p>AS touching the Papers which I sent you, and had before sent to my Lord Primate, touching the Efficacy of Baptism in Infants; I would desire your Censure at your best leisure. You seem in your Letter to make the principal End and Effect of all Sacraments to be <hi>Obsignation,</hi> and all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:60492:208"/>
to be meerly obsignatory Signs, and that all ablution of Sin in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is only <hi>conditional and expectative,</hi> of which they have no benefit till they believe and repent. I cannot easily assent hereunto. For so, 1. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants baptized dying in Infancy, have no benefit by Baptism. 2. Non-elect Infants living, have no benefit at all: so that to both these they are made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>&amp; prorsus inefficacia signa.</hi> And, 3. What necessity can there be of baptizing Infants, if it produce no Effect till they come to years of Discretion</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Divines do generally hold, that the Sacraments do offer and exhibit that Grace which they signify; and in order of Nature, do first offer and exhibit, before they assure and confirm. For God doth offer and exhibit Grace promised in the Sacrament. Then we exercise our Faith in relying upon God promising, offering, and exhibiting, on his part, and so receive the Grace promised; and then the Sacrament assureth us of the Grace received. So it is in the definition of a Sacrament in our short Catechism; when it is said: <hi>It is an outward visible Sign of an inward spiritual Grace, given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledg to assure us thereof.</hi> So that, first, it is a means whereby God doth offer and exhibit the Grace it signifieth, which we receiving by Faith, it then also becometh <hi>a pledg to assure us</hi> of the receipt thereof. So the Eucharist doth first offer and exhibit growth and increase of Grace, and a nearer and faster Communion with Christ's Body and Blood, and all the benefits flowing thence; and then it <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> a Pledg to assure us hereof.</hi> For as Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> saith in <hi>Col. Mompel, Obsignari non potest quod non habetur,</hi> pag. 66, 76, &amp; 131. Ursin. Cat. Edit. Cant. <hi>p.</hi> 584. <hi>Sacramentum &amp; opus Dei erga nos, in quo dat aliquid scilicet signa &amp; res signalas, &amp; in quo testatur &amp; se nobis offerre ac dare sua beneficio—</hi>&amp; mox <hi>Baptismus ac Coena Domini sunt Sacramenta, quia sunt opus Dei qui aliquid in its nobis dat &amp; se dare testatur. Vid. etiam</hi> Calvin. Instit. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 17. §. 10, 11. and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 24. So that instrumental conveyance of the Grace signified to the due Receiver, is as true an effect of a Sacrament when it is administred, as obsignation, and is pre-existing in order of Nature to Obsignation. See more at large Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> l. 5. §. 57, 59, 60, 64, &amp; 67. who, in my opinion, doth truly explicate the Efficacy of Sacraments. The opinion of the <hi>Franciscans</hi> out of <hi>Soctus, Bonaeventure,</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> mentioned in the History of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> pag. 237, is a true opinion, tho they leave out the other use of the Sacraments, which is Obsignation. Tho <hi>Catherinus</hi> and <hi>Eisingren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us</hi> hold that also. Since then Infants are capable of Baptism, why not of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Ablution of Original Guilt, which is the thing signified, tho not of actual Obsignation of this, since they cannot interpose any impediment to hinder the operation of the Sacrament. It seemeth you conceive that I make Circumsion and Baptism to be the remedy of original Sin only: I neither so say, nor think. It is true, your Lordship saith, the true definition of a Sacrament in general will decide this Question, and so say I; and think the definition in our ordinary Catechism formerly mentioned, is a good and sound definition.</p>

                  <head>LETTER CLXIII. <hi>Part of a Letter from the Right Reverend</hi> William Bedell <hi>Bishop of</hi> Kilmore, <hi>to Dr.</hi> Samuel Ward.</head>
                  <p>FIrst, you say, <hi>If Sacraments be meerly obsignatory, and the ablution of Sons in Baptism only conditional and expectative, of which the Baptized have no benefit till they believe and repent. Then Infants baptized, dying in Infancy,</hi>
                     <pb n="442" facs="tcp:60492:209"/>
                     <hi>have no benefit by Baptism.</hi> This Consequence me-thinks is not good: For they are by Baptism received into the visible Church, which is a noble Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Comfort to Parents, and Honour and Profit to themselves. Again, there is presently granted them an entrance into Covenant with God, as was anciently by Circumcision with the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherein God promises Pardon of Sin, and Life eternal, upon their Faith and Repentance; and in this they have a present right, tho the accomplishment be deferred. Yet if God take them out of this World while the Condition is in expectation, most pious it is to believe that he takes the Condition for performed: Like to him that solemnizeth a Marriage with her to whom he was betrothed <hi>sub conditione.</hi> And here, if the Souls of Christians be indued with any actual Knowledg at all, so soon as they leave the Body; it seems the mystery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Christ is revealed unto them, and Faith is given them, whereby they cleave to God by him, the Author of their Blessedness, although they have no need now of the Obsignation of the Promise whereof they are in present possession.</p>
                  <p>The second Reason. <hi>Non-elect Infants living, shall thus have no benefit at all by Baptism.</hi> I answer. Where there be divers ends of one and the same thing, the denial of one is not the denial of the rest. These Non-elect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have offered by God the same with the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>obsignation of the Covenant, and aggregation to the Church.</hi> The same that he hath also, <hi>quifictus accedit ut ponit obicem, gratiae,</hi> as to the present possession of it. All that come to the Sacrament, Elect, or Non-elect, receive the Pardon of Sin Original and Actual sacramentally; and whosoever performs the Condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, hath the fruition of that, whereof before he had the Grant under Seal. So as the Sacraments are not <hi>nuda &amp; inefficacia signa</hi> on God's part, to the one or other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, (you say) <hi>What necessity of baptizing Infants, if their Baptism pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no effect till they come to years of discretion</hi> Though the most principal Effect be not attained presently, the less principal are not to be refused. So Children were circumcised, which could not understand the reason of it; and the same also did eat the Passover. And so did also Children baptized in the Primitive Church communicate in the Lord's Supper. Which I know not why it should not be so still, <hi>de quo alias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Our Divines, you say, generally hold that the Sacraments do offer and exhibit the Grace which they signify, and in order of Nature, do first offer and exhibit before they assure and confirm.</hi> For God doth,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <label>1.</label> Offer and exhibit Grace promised in the Sacraments.</item>
                     <item>
                        <label>2.</label> We exercise our Faith, resting upon God promising and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting.</item>

                        <label>3.</label> So we receive the Grace promised.</item>
                     <item>
                        <label>4.</label> Then the Sacraments assure us of the Grace received.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And this order you endeavour to confirm out of the Definition of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our Catechism: you declare it in the Eucharist, and bring divers Testimonies of our Writers to prove it.</p>
                  <p>I answer. The Grace which the Sacraments confer, is of three sorts. The first is, The spiritual things which are proportionable to the outward. The second, The Effects of these. The third, The Certification of the Party in the lawful use of the outward, of the enjoying the two former. As in Baptism, 1. The Blood and Spirit of Christ. 2. The washing of Sin, and new Birth. 3. The Obsignation to the Party baptized, that by Christ's Blood his Sins are cleansed.</p>
                  <p>The first of these is signified in that common Sentence, <hi>That Sacraments consist of two parts, An outward visible Sign, and an inward invisible Grace.</hi>

The second is the most usual and common notion of the word Grace; meaning some Spiritual Favour, in order to Salvation promised in the New Covenant. The last is most properly the Grace of the Sacrament it self. For the two former (which our Catechism seems to reduce to one) are properly the Grace of the Covenant, which God doth confirm and seal by the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>As when the King's Majesty grants Lands and Tenements with certain Immunities and Priviledges thereunto appertaining, as in his Letters Patents at large appeareth, and sets to the Great Seal; all the Grants and Articles in the Patent are confirmed thereby <hi>materialiter &amp; subjective,</hi> but the <hi>Ratification of the Patent</hi> is properly and formally that which the Seal works: Which also according to the form of the Patent may be simple or conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, present, or <hi>ad diem,</hi> according as his Majesty is pleased.</p>
                  <p>As touching the terms also of <hi>offering and exhibiting,</hi> they may be taken two ways: Either of the offering and <hi>propounding;</hi> so doth <hi>Calvin</hi> take the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iastitut. l.</hi> 4. c. 17. §. 10.</note> word <hi>[exhibet]</hi> in the Covenant, and Institution of the Sacraments; Or, 2. confirming in the use of them. These things thus premised, it seems to me that the Order is this: God doth,</p>

                     <item>
                        <label>1.</label> Offer his Covenant (under the condition of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) and therein Christ and his Benefits.</item>

                     <item>
                        <label>3.</label> God offers to confirm it with Sacraments proportional.</item>
                     <item>
                        <label>4.</label> We receive them, and so are certified of the performance of the Covenant, and have the Promises thereof conveyed by Covenant, and by Seal also unto us.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Where you say, <hi>In the Eucharist God doth first offer and exhibit growth, and increase of Grdce, and a nearer and faster Communion of Christ's Body and Blood, and all the Benefits flowing from thence; and then it is a Pledg to assure us thereof.</hi> It seems to me that God having in the New Testament (confirmed with Christ's Blood) offered unto us Life under the condition of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him; would confirm to as many as receive him that they have Life. Therefore he hath instituted Bread and Wine, the means of Natural Life, in a certain use, to be Seals of Spiritual Life. We now receiving them, they are Pledges unto us, and do certifie us of that Spiritual Life which we have by receiving Christ.</p>
                  <p>Where then you say, <hi>That the instrumental conveyance of the Grace signified, is as true an effect of a Sacrament as Obsignation; and is then existent in order of Nature unto it.</hi> I do conceive that the setting of Christ and his Benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the Gospel, <hi>(as the Bread that came down from Heaven)</hi> and in the institution of the holy Supper, in the proportional creatures of Bread and Wine, with condition that these, worthily received, shall confer those, must needs go before any Obsignation. But then our partaking of these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures duly, giveth unto us the Possession of the former by way of Obsigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which in our purpose is the sole and only instrumental conveyance which the Sacraments have.</p>
                  <p>You will ask, what is the due participation That which God requires. There can be required no more of Infants but the receiving of the outward washing in Baptism; they cannot prove themselves, nor repent and believe. Very true. Have they then that Obsignation Yes doubtless, according to the form of the Covenant. How is that That repenting and believing, their Sins are washed away. Then, because they do not yet repent and believe, nothing passes: Yes, this passes, <hi>The Confirmation that this Sacrament gives upon Repentance and belief of all God's Promises of the New Testament.</hi> The same thing which passes to him <hi>qui fictus accedit;</hi> who when afterward he doth
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:60492:210"/>
indeed repent of his Fiction, and receives Christ by Faith, hath also the actual enjoying of the thing so confirmed to him.</p>
                  <p>The Opinion of the <hi>Franciscans</hi> out of <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> mentioned in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> seems to be the true Opinion; for they make the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to be effectual, <hi>because God gives them, Effectus regulariter concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> and to contain Grace no otherwise then as an effectual Sign; and that Grace is received by them as an <hi>Investiture</hi> by a Ring or Staff, which is <hi>obsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando.</hi> Which agrees also with <hi>Catharines</hi> Opinion, <hi>de intenione Ministri:</hi> And <hi>Eisingrens</hi> saith, that God only can give to sensible Signs Vertue to <note place="margin">Pag. 192.</note> confer Grace. <hi>Confess.</hi> c. 1. Yet I believe they understand the matter other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then I have before expressed. Their Authority is of little moment either way. <hi>Beza, Ursine</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> have no other meaning then I have expressed. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> I have not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Since Infants</hi> (say you) <hi>are capable of Baptism, why not of spiritual Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Original Guilt which is the thing signified, tho not of actual Obsignation of this, since they cannot interpose any impediment to hinder the operation of the Sacraments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Questionless they are partakers of the actual Obsignation of Ablution from original and actual Guilt (say I.) Suppose they understand not this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, nor receive this Ablution otherwise then <hi>Sacramentally</hi> As I said before the counterfeit Convert also doth; tho he put a bar to his present Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his Sins, and consequently his own Certification thereof.</p>
                  <p>Where I said, <hi>The true definition of a Sacrament in general will decide this Question,</hi> which you grant, and commend that of our Catechism. I do not disallow it, being well interpreted; but do think incomparably better that of the Apostle; <hi>That they be Seals of the Righteousness of Faith.</hi> Or if we will include the Sacraments of the state of Grace before the Fall: <hi>They be Seals of God's Covenant concerning everlasting Happiness.</hi> If yet more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we will include the Rain-bow, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. <hi>They be Seals of God's Covenants.</hi>

                           <am>

                        </expan> Baptismus potissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum institutus sit ad solutionem originalis peccati,</hi> &amp;c. You know what it is to demonstrate specially of one sort of Triangles that which is true in all; which made me a little touch upon that point. But verily, I think this conceit of Sacraments to make them <hi>Medicines,</hi> is the root of all Error in this matter; and that it is good to take Light from the <hi>Tree of Life, and that of the knowledg of Good and Evil,</hi> that they are Seals only to God's Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. In my last to you, as I remember, I gave you occasion a little to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the case of Women under the Law, and of all Mankind before Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision. Methinks it is very inconvenient to say, that the Males should have a remedy against Sin, and the Females none. And the Schoolmen when they will first lay down their own conceit, that such a remedy there must be, and then divine what it must be; they make <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ridiculous, who from the silence of holy Scripture herein, labours to shew the Scriptures are <note place="margin">
                        <hi>De verbo non Scrip.</hi> c. 4.</note> insufficient, and yet he cannot help us here by any Traditions. This Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is well avoided by making the Sacraments to confer Grace only
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:60492:210"/>
by <hi>Obsignation</hi> of God's Promises, and the end of them to be Certioration. For so long as God would have Men rest upon his meer Word and Promise without a Seal, his Word alone was to suffice: When he gave a Seal, that was to have validity as far as he extended it. Now he extended Circumcision to all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, Males and Females, yea to the Males and Females of all that were adjoyned to <hi>Abraham,</hi> tho but bought with his Mony: And the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 10, 11, 12.</note> of the Males was an Obsignation of God's Covenant to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males also. Lastly; in the New Testament, willing to make more ample De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of his Love, and more abundantly to confirm the Truth of his Promises, he hath appointed the Obsignation of them even to both Sexes, and to every several Person: Whereby he hath not made their Condition worse, who without contempt do want it, but their's better which are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it. Which I speak in regard of the imagined necessity of Baptism to Infants to Salvation, as if it were indeed a Medicine to <hi>save Life,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is only an assuring that Christ <hi>gives Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider how Baptism was given to them who had remission of Sins and the gifts of the Holy Ghost also before, who therefore could have no other Intention therein but <hi>Certification</hi> only, and adjoyning to the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44.</p>
                  <p>Consider how it hath force about Sin, not only going before it, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing also; yea even to them that at the time of the outward receiving it do <hi>ponere obicem,</hi> else such ought to be re-baptized.</p>
                  <p>Consider that if the Faith of the Parents, or the Church, were effectual before Circumcision was instituted for the taking away of Original Sin from Infants, or under the Law from Female Children; it is no less effectual at the present under the Gospel. And this presupposing that some mean must come between to make them partakers of Christ. Wherefore the same mean yet standing, the effect of Baptism needs not to be assigned Justification, or Ablution from Sin, but Testification to the Receiver, when he repents and believes that he is washed from Sin.</p>
                  <p>Consider that if you will aver that Baptism washes away otherwise then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, that is, obsignatorily original Sin; yet you must allow that manner of washing for future actual Sins. And you must make two sons of Justification, one for Children, another for <hi>Adulti</hi> And (which passes all the rest) you must find some Promise in God's Covenant, wherein he binds himself to wash away Sin without Faith or Repentance (for that Children have these I think you will not say). You seem also to break the Chain of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Whom he hath justified, he hath glorified,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly; by this Doctrine you must also maintain that Children do spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eat the Flesh of Christ and drink his Blood, if they receive the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist (as for divers Ages they did, and by the Analogy of the Passover they may, (perhaps ought): since they do not <hi>ponere obicem contraria cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis aut pravae operationis.</hi> And sith the use of his Sacrament <hi>topics quoties</hi> must needs confer Grace; it seems it were necessary to let them communicate, and the oftner the better, to the intent they might be stronger in Grace. Which Opinion, tho St. <hi>Austine</hi> and many more of the Ancients do maintain, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you will not easily condescend unto, or that Children dying without Baptism are damn'd: Which if Baptism be the Remedy that takes away Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, I see not how you can avoid.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Propositions of <hi>Molina</hi> opposed by the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and the Letters of <hi>Hippolytus de Alonte-Peloso,</hi> I am glad you have met with them: For I sent you the Originals which P. <hi>Paulo</hi> gave me upon occasion of speech with him touching that Controversy, reserving no Copy to my self. The occasion was the contention of the Jesuits and Dominicans before Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> And those Letters were week by sent from <hi>Rome</hi>

                  <p>WE have lately (to our exceeding great comfort) received the glad Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement of the Queen's safe Delivery, in the Birth of a young Prince; which did surprize us with such extraordinary Joy, as is justly due from us upon so happy an occasion.

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Hope your Grace will pardon me, that in all this time I have not written unto you: For though I thank God I have recovered my Health in a measure, beyond expectation, yet I have been so overlaid with Business, that I have not been able to give you any account, or at least not such as I desired.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordship's first Letters (for I owe you an answer to two) bear date <hi>April</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> and your later <hi>June</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> 1630. The Main of both Letters is concerning Sir <hi>John Bathe.</hi> And though in your last Letters you be confident that Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Grant is not past the Seals, as he hath avouched it is: yet I must acquaint your Grace that you are mistaken therein; for it appeared, at the last sitting of the Committee, that the Seal was put to his Grant at the beginning of <hi>April</hi> last. Of which Doctrine you may make this Use; what close conveyance and carriage there may be, when the Church is to be spoiled. I understand by Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> that the Lord Chancellor of <hi>Ireland</hi> is in Holy Orders; and that being Deacon, he holds an Arch-Deaconry yet of good value. Surely, my Lord, if this be so, there is somewhat in it that I will not express by Letter; but were I his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in Ordinary, I know what I would do, and that I have plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, both to his Majesty, and the Lords Committees.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, for the Business; I have stuck so close unto it, both with his Majesty, and with the Lords, especially the Lord Treasurer, who hath been, and is very noble to the Church, that I hope Sir <hi>John Bathe</hi> will see his Error, and pitch upon some other Reward for his Services, and surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Patent, though seal'd, that we may go on with the King's Royal and Pious Grant to the Church.</p>
                  <p>Things being thus far onward once more; there are two things which stick with the Lords.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is, They like not the placing of these Impropriations upon any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporations, <hi>Dublin,</hi> or other. To this I answered, That neither did I like it; and that it must be alter'd, because it is against Law. So it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that we shall hereafter take, not only that, but all other material Passages of the Grant into consideration; and therefore, I think, neither your old, nor your new Letter will stand. Some thought it fittest, that these Impropriations should be left to the King to give. To this I replied, That that course would, by the Suit of the Clergy, and their Journeys over, take off a great part of the Benefit intended them. And to leave them in the Power of the Lord Deputy, that might be but to enrich his Secretaries, and expose the Church to that which I will not speak.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other Difficulty is, That this Grant to the Church, is too much against the King's Profit in these difficult Times, because in the Lay-way, the King's Rent may be improved; which according to this Grant cannot be. This Blow I looked not for; but answered upon the sudden, That I thought the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> would be glad to take the King's Grant, though it were with some improvement upon such Impropriations as might well bear it. This I did, partly to bear off the shock for the time, and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:60492:212"/>
partly to gain opportunity to write to you, who understand that Business better. And I pray you, by your next Letters, give me all the help you can towards this Business.</p>
                  <p>One thing more, and then I have done with Sir <hi>John Bathe.</hi> Upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of his Speech, That the Clergy had a third part of that Kingdom; I represented to the Lords the Paper which you sent me concerning the State of the County of <hi>Louth.</hi> It was a miserable spectacle to them all: yet at the last, some Doubt arose whether those Values there expressed, were the Rate in the King's Books, or the uttermost value to the Incumbent. To this I was not able to make a resolute Answer, yet I feared they were Rates to the utmost value. Hereupon the Lords required of me to write unto you, to desire you to send me word with all the speed you can, what value that Note of yours contain'd, of which I pray fail not.</p>
                  <p>Your Grace is pleased, in another Passage, to desire me not to be too strict to my Rule, in chusing Deans only to be Bishops. My Lord, it is true, Deans are, or should be the likeliest Men to be fitted for Bishopricks; but they, and no other, was never any Rule of mine to my remembrance. My Rule was, and is, and to that I shall ever be strict, not to suffer any Bishop to hold any Deanery in <hi>Commendam,</hi> if it lie in my power to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                  <p>For that which concerns the Bishop of <hi>Clonfert,</hi> and <hi>Killmacduagh,</hi> I have read the inclosed Papers you sent, and see cause more than enough to pity; but the way for remedy will be full of difficulty. And for <hi>Kill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>anora,</hi> there will be time enough to think upon Annexation. For the Colledg and their Chauntry-Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they come for their Patent, they shall not need to doubt all the lawful assistance that I can give them.</p>
                  <p>And now, my Lord, (for as my Business stands, 'tis time to make an end) I must needs thank you that you make it a matter of Joy to hear of my late Honour, in being chosen Chancellor of <hi>Oxford.</hi> My Lord, I speak really, it was beyond my deserts, and contrary to my desires; but since it hath pleased God, by their Love, to lay it upon me, I must undergo the Burden as I may. My honourable Predecessor enriched his Name by the Greek Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts he gave; and it gives me much content that I was the means of it. And now for the Bargain which you mention of Ancient Coins, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 5500, I cannot upon the sudden say any things, for my own Purse is too shallow, and my Lords, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> are dead. You say, they are a great Bargain at 600 <hi>l.</hi> I pray therefore, if you have so much Interest in the Seller, send me word, as soon as you can, how many Ounces the Gold Coin comes unto, and how many the Silver, and then I shall be able to judg of the Copper; and then, upon my return to those your Letters, I will give you answer, where I can find any noble Spirit that will deal for them or no.</p>
                  <p>You may judg by these Letters, I am not in haste, but indeed I am; and yet in the fulness of my Business, more troubled a great deal, that I cannot remedy what I see amiss, than at any disproportion between the weakness of my Shoulder, and the weight of my Load. Let me have your Prayers, and in them, and God's Grace, I shall rest,</p>

                  <p>HIS Majesty, by his Letters of the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> last, hath been graciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly pleased to signify unto us, that it hath pleased God, of his infinite Grace and Goodness, to vouchsafe his Majesty a Son, and us a Prince, born at the Palace of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, the <hi>29th</hi> day of <hi>May</hi> last: A Copy of which Letters, together with some of the Prayers framed in <hi>England</hi> upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and lately imprinted here, we have thought fit to send you here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed; that by timely order from you, the same may be communicated unto your Clergy, as to those, who with all Duty and loving Affection, will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace whatsoever may make for the prosperous advancement of the Publick Good, wherein all of us have Interest.</p>
                  <p>The Joy and Gladness we apprehend in this great Blessing, hath justly moved as to set apart one Day, to be jointly and unanimously celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a Festival throughout the whole Kingdom, in expression of the thankfulness due from us all upon this happy occasion; which Day we have resolved shall be the <hi>15th</hi> Day of this Instant: whereof we give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship notice, to the end you may cause the same to be notified to your Clergy; and that on that day there be publick Prayers, Thanksgivings, and Sermons in the several Churches of your Diocess; and that the said Prayers be then publickly read in the time of Divine Service; and that afterwards ringing of Bells, making of Bone-fires, and all other expressions of Joy may be made, to testify the general Joy and Gladness of that Day. And we pray and require you, to be with us here at that time, to the end all of us, who are partakers of this Benefit, may join in the Solemnities of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Festival. And so we bid your Lordship very heartily farewel. From his Majesty's Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> July 5. 1630.</p>

                     <salute>Most Reverend Father, my Honourable good Lord;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Cannot easily express what contentment I received at my late being with your Grace at <hi>Termonfeckin.</hi> There had nothing hapned to me, I will not say, since I came into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but as far as I can call to remembrance in my whole Life, which did so much affect me in this kind, as the hazard of your good Opinion. For loving and honouring you in Truth, (for the Truth's sake, which is in us, and shall abide with us for ever) without any private Interest; and receiving so unlooked for a blow from your own hand, (which I expected should have tenderly applied some Remedy to me, being smitten by others) I had not present the defences of Reason and Grace. And although I knew it to be a fault in my self, since in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our Duties, the judgment of our Master even alone ought to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice us; yet I could not be so much Master of mine Affections, as to cast out this weakness. But, blessed be God, which (as I began to say) at my being with you, refreshed my Spirit, by your kind renewing and confirming your love to me. And all humble thanks to you, that gave me place to make my defence, and took upon you the cognizance of mine Innocency. And as for mine Accuser (whose hatred I have incurred) only by not giving way to his covetous desire, of heaping Living upon Living, to the evident da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, not only of other Souls committed to me, but of his own: Truly I am glad, and do give God thanks that his Malignicy, which a while masked it self in the pretence of Friendship, hath at last discovered it self by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick opposition. It hath not, and I hope it shall not be in his power to hurt me at all, he hath rather shamed himself; and although his high Heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give his Tongue leave to acknowledg his Folly, his Understanding is not so weak and blind as not to see it: Whom I could be very well content to leave to taste the Fruit of it also, without being further trouble some to your Grace; save that I do not despair, but your Grace's Authority will pull him out of the Snare of Satan, whose Instrument he hath been to cross the Work of God, and give me more occasion of joy by his amendment, than I had grief by his perversion and opposition.</p>
                  <p>Your Grace's Letters of <hi>August</hi> 23. were not delivered to me till the <hi>

As I was at the Lord's Table, beginning the Service of the Communion before the Sermon, he came in; and after the Sermon was done, those that communicated not being departed, he stood forth and spoke to his purpose.</p>
                  <p>That where as the Book of Common Prayer requires, that before the Lord's Supper if there be any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     <pb n="452" facs="tcp:60492:214"/>
I answered, That he had good reason to be sorry, considering how he had behaved himself: For my part, I bare him no malice; and if it were in my power, would not make so much as his finger ake. Grieved I had been, that he in whom I knew there were many good parts, would become an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to oppose the Work of God, which I was assured he had called me to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was all that passed. He offered himself to the Lord's Board, and I gave him the Communion. After Dinner, he preached out of 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. ult. <hi>And this Commandment have we from him, that he that loveth God,</hi> &amp;c. When we came out of the Church, Dr. <hi>Shiriden</hi> delivered me your Grace's Letters. And thus Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> thinks he hath healed all; as you may perceive by his next Letters of <hi>August</hi> 30. Only he labours about <hi>Kildromfarten:</hi> Whereabouts I purposed to have spoken with your Grace at my being with you, but I know not how it came not to my mind. Whether it be, that the Soul as well as the Body, after-some travel, easily falleth to rest; or else God would have it reserved perhaps to a more seasonable time.</p>
                  <p>It is now above a Twelve-month (the Day, in many respects, I may well wish that it may not be reckoned with the days of the Year) that your Grace, as it were, delivered to me with your own hands, Mr. <hi>Crian</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Friar. To whom I offered my self as largely as my ability would extend unto; though I had already, at your Grace's commendation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Mr. <hi>Dunsterville</hi> to be in my house, with the allowance of 20 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day before my departing, Mr. <hi>Hilton</hi> made a motion to me, that where he had in his hands sufficient to make the Benefice of <hi>Kildrom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farten</hi> void, if I would bestow it upon Mr. <hi>Dean,</hi> he would do so, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it should remain <hi>in Statu.</hi> I answered, With profession of my love and good opinion of Mr. <hi>Dean,</hi> whereof I shewed the Reasons, I added, I did not know the Place, nor the People; but if they were meer Irish, I did not see how Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> should discharge the Duty of a Minister to them: This Motion was seconded by your Grace: But so, as I easily conceived, that being solicited by your old Servant, could do no less than you did, and notwithstanding <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>In his first Letter about Mr.</hi> N. King.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lecture he promised your Grace should read to me in the matter of Collations,</hi> would not be displeased if I did as became me, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Conscience, and in conformity to your former motion for Mr. <hi>Crian.</hi> Dr. <hi>Dean</hi> after pressed me, that if without my concurrence your Grace would confer that living upon him, I would not be against it. Which I promised, but heard no more of it till about <hi>April</hi> last. In the mean while, the Benefice next unto that which Mr. <hi>Dunsterville</hi> was already possessed of falling void, Mr. <hi>Crian</hi> not coming to me, nor purposing to do so till after <hi>Christmass;</hi> and whensoever he should come, my House, as I found, not affording room for him and Mr. <hi>Dunsterville</hi> both; whose former Benefice was unable (he said) to maintain him; chiefly he promising Residence, and taking of me for that purpose an Oath absolutely, without any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dispensation; I united it to his former, and dismissed him to go to his Cure. Wherein how carelesly he hath behaved himself, I forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
                  <p>To return to Mr. Dean; About mid<hi>-April</hi> he brought me a Presentation to <hi>Kildromfarten,</hi> under the Broad Seal. I could do no less but signify to the Incumbent, who came to me, and maintained his Title, requiring me not to admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Whereupon I returned the Presentation, indorsing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of my refusal. And being then occasioned to write to the Lords Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I signified what I thought of these Pluralities, in a Time when we are so far overmatched in number by the Adverse Party. This passed on till the Visitation, wherein Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> shewed himself in his Colours. When the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of <hi>Kildromfarten</hi> was called, he said, He was Vicar, but would exhibit
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:60492:214"/>
no Title. After the Curat, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> signified to me, that his Stipend was unpaid, and he feared it would still be in the contention of two Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents. Upon these and other Reasons, I sequestred the Profits; which I have heard by a Simoniacal Compact betwixt them should be for this Year the former Incumbents. Neither did Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> write or speak a word to me hereabout till the day before the Communion in the Inclosed. That very Morning I was certified, that he purposed to appeal to your Grace; which made me, in answer to his next, to add, <hi>Quod facis fac citius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I beseech your Grace give me leave to speak freely touching this matter; so much the rather, because it is the only Root of all Mr. <hi>Dean</hi>'s despite against me. Plainly I do thus think, that of all the Diseases of the Church in these times, next to that of the <hi>Corruption of our Courts,</hi> this of <hi>Pluralities</hi> is the most deadly and pestilent, especially when those are institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Charges Ecclesiastical, who were they never so willing, yet for want of the Language of the People, are unable to discharge them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which very Point, I know your Grace remembers the Propositions of the Learned and Zealous Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> before Pope <hi>Innocent.</hi> I will not add the Confession of our Adversaries themselves, in the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> nor the Judgment of that good Father, the Author of the History thereof, touching Non-residence. Let the thing it self speak, whence flow the Ignorance of the People, the Neglect of God's Worship, the Defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Poor of the remains of dedicate Things, the Ruin of the Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-houses of the Ministers, the desolation of Churches, the swallowing up of Parishes by the Farmers of them, but from this fountain There may be cause, no doubt, why sometimes in some Place, and to some Man, many Churches may be committed. But now, that, as appears by the late Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, there are besides the Titulary Primat and Bishop, of Priests, in the Diocesses of <hi>Kilmore</hi> and <hi>Ardagh,</hi> 66; of Ministers and Curats but 32; of which also three whose Wives come not to Church: In this so great odds, as the Adversaries have of us in number, (to omit the advantage of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the possession of the Peoples Hearts, the countenancing of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry) is it a Time to commit many Churches to one Man whom I will not disable; and he saith he hath a very able Interpreter: and I think no less, which made me once to say, that I would sooner confer the Benefice of <hi>Kildromfarten</hi> upon him, than upon himself; which Resolution I do still hold, in how ill part soever he takes it. But what hath he done in the Parishes already committed to him, for the instruction of the Irish that we should commit another unto him He that cannot perform his Duty to one, without a helper; or to that little part of it whose Tongue he hath, is he sufficient to do it to three No, it is the Wages is sought, not the Work. And yet with the Means he hath already, the good Man his Predecessor maintained a Wife and a Family; and cannot he in his <hi>Solitary</hi> (he had once written <hi>Monkish) Life</hi> defray himself Well, if there can be none found fit to discharge the Duty, let him have the Wages to better his Maintenance: But when your Grace assureth us, we shall lack no Men, when there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Mr. <hi>Crien,</hi> (whom D. <hi>Sheriden</hi> hath heard preach as a Frier in that very place; which I account would be the more to God's Glory, if there now he should plant the Truth, which before he endeavoured to root out); be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides him we have Mr. <hi>Nugent,</hi> who offereth himself in an honest and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Letter lately written to me. We have sundry in the Colledg, and namely two trained up at the Irish Lecture; one whereof hath translated your Grace's Catechism into Irish; besides Mr. <hi>Duncan</hi> and others: With what colour can we pass by these, and suffer him to fat himself with the Blood of God's People Pardon me, I beseech your Grace, when I say <hi>We,</hi> I mean not to prescribe any thing to you: My self I hope shall never do it,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:60492:215"/>
or consent to it. And so long as this is the cause of Mr. D's Wrath against me, whether I suffer by his Pen or his Tongue, I shall rejoice, as suffering for Righteousness sake. And sith himself in his last Letter excuses my <hi>Intent,</hi> I do submit my Actions after God to your Grace's Censure, ready to make him Satisfaction, if in any thing in Word or Deed I have wronged him.</p>
                  <p>For conclusion of this business (wherein I am sorry to be so troublesome to your Grace) let him surcease this his greedy and impudent pretence to this Benefice, let Mr. <hi>Nugent</hi> be admitted to it, or Mr. <hi>Crien</hi> if he be not yet provided for; to whom I will hope ere long to add Mr. <hi>Nugent</hi> for a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. If these second (questionless better) Thoughts, have any place in him, as in his last Letters he gives some hope, let my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against him be cast into the Fire. God make him an humble and modest Man. But if Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> will needs persist, I beseech your Grace to view my Reply, to the which I will add no more. As touching his tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing me in the Pulpit at <hi>Cavan,</hi> I have sent your Grace the Testimonies of Mr. <hi>Robins</hi> and Mr. <hi>Teate,</hi> altho he had been with them before and denied what they formerly conceived. And if your Grace will be pleased to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of Mr. <hi>Cape</hi> by a Line or two (with whom I never spake word about the matter) or compare the heads of his Sermon (which he saith were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) with his former Reports made of me, I doubt not but you will soon find the Truth.</p>
                  <p>I have sent also his Protestation against my Visitations: wherein I desire your Grace to observe the blindness of Malice. He pretends that I may not visit but at or after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> every Year. As if the Month of <hi>July</hi> wherein I visited were not after <hi>Michaelmas;</hi> for before the last <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmas</hi> I visited not. I omit that he calls himself the <hi>Head of the Chapter.</hi> The Canon Law calls the Bishop so: he will have the Bishop visit the whole Diocess together, directly contrary to that form which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons prescribe. But this Protestation having neither Latin, nor Law, nor common Sence, doth declare the Skill of him that drew it, and the Wit of him that uses it. Which if your Grace enjoyn him not to revoke, I shall be enforced to put a remedy to it otherwise, in respect of the evil Example and Prejudice it might bring to Posterity. And now to leave this unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Subject: Since my being with you, here was with me Mr. <hi>Brady,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him the Resignation of the Benefice of <hi>Mullagh</hi> which I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon Mr. <hi>Dunsterville,</hi> and united to his former of <hi>Moybolk;</hi> he brought with him Letters from my L. of <hi>Corke,</hi> and Sir <hi>W. Parsons,</hi> to whom he is allied. But examining him, I found him (besides a very raw Divine) unable to read the Irish, and therefore excused my self to the Lords for admitting him. A few days after, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> of this Month, here was with me Mr. <hi>Dunsterville</hi> himself, and signified unto me that he had revoked his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Resignation. Thus he plays fast and loose, and most unconscionably neglects his Duty. <hi>Omnes quae sua sunt quaerunt.</hi> Indeed I doubted his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation was not good, in as much as he retained still the former Benefice, whereto this was united. Now I see clearly there was a compact between him and Mr. <hi>Brady,</hi> that if he could not be admitted, he should resume his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice again.</p>
                  <p>I have received Letters from Mr. Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> of the Date of <hi>May</hi> 28, in which he mentions again the point <hi>of the Justification of Infants by Baptism.</hi> To whom I have written an Answer, but not yet sent it. I send herewith a Copy thereof to your Grace, humbly requiring your Advice and Censure (if it be not too much to your Graces trouble) before I send it. I have also written an Answer to Dr. <hi>Richardson</hi> in the question touching the <hi>Root of Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy,</hi> or Efficiency of Grace, but it is long, and consists of five or six sheets of Paper, so as I cannot now send it. I shall hereafter submit it as all other
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:60492:215"/>
my Endeavours to your Grace's Censure and Correction. I have received also a large Answer from my Lord of <hi>Derry,</hi> touching <hi>Justifying Faith,</hi> whereto I have not yet had time to reply. Nor do I know if it be worth the labour, the difference being but in the manner of teaching: As whether justifying Faith be an Assent working Assiance; or else an Assiance following Assent. I wrote presently upon my return from your Grace to my Lords Justices, desiring to be excused from going in person to take Possession of the Mass-houses, and a certificate that my Suit with Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> is depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. I have not as yet received Answer, by reason (as Sir <hi>Will. Usher</hi> signified to my Son) the Lord Chancellor's Indisposition did not permit his hand to be gotten. I do scarce hope to receive any Certificate from them, for the respect they will have not to seem to infringe your Grace's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. Whereupon I shall be inforced to entertain a Proctor for me at your Graces Court when I am next to appear, it being the very time when my Courts in the County of <hi>Leatrym</hi> were set, before I was with you.</p>
                  <p>Asham'd I am to be thus tedious; but I hope you will pardon me, sith you required and I promised to write often: And having had opportunity to convey my Letters, this must serve instead of many. Concluding with my humble Service to your Grace, and Thanks for my kind Entertainment, I desire the Blessing of your Prayers, and remain always,</p>

                  <head>LETTER CLXXII. <hi>A Letter from the most Reverend</hi> James Usher <hi>Arch-bishop of</hi> Armagh, <hi>to the most Reverend</hi> William Laud <hi>Arch-bishop of</hi> Canterbury.</head>

                     <salute>My most gracious Lord;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHen I took Pen to write, the first thing that presented it self to my thoughts, was that saying in the Scripture; <hi>Why are you the last to bring the King back to his House</hi> For methought I could not but be much blamed for coming thus late to congratulate both his Majesty's safe return, and your own advancement (joined therewith) unto the highest place of Church-Preferment, that is within his Highnesses Dominions. Wherein I may truly say thus much for my self, (to begin withal); that since the time I received the Letter you wrote unto me the day before you began your Journey for <hi>Scotland,</hi> no day hath passed hitherto, wherein I have not made particular mention of you in my Prayers unto Almighty God; who hath graciously heard my Request, and granted [therein] as much as my Heart could desire. But thus in the mean time did the Case stand with me: Upon the arrival of the Lord Deputy, I found him very honourably affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me, and very ready to further me, as in other things that concerned the Church, so particularly in that which did concern the settlement of the Lands belonging to the Arch-bishoprick of <hi>Armagh.</hi> Wherefore not being willing to let slip so fair an opportunity, I presently obtained a Commission for making an inquiry of all the Lands that remained in my quiet possession: and took my Journey (though in an unseasonable time of the Year) into the Northern Parts of the Kingdom. Where beside the speeding of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that were taken in the three several Counties of <hi>Armagh, Tirone,</hi> and <hi>London-Derry;</hi> there was offered the opportunity of solemnizing the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of the Bishop of <hi>Raphae,</hi> and a Consecration of the Bishop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagh,</hi> in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Armagh;</hi> where no such Act had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore performed within the memory of any Man living. And much about this time had we the News of your Grace's Election into that high Dignity which his Majesty hath called you unto: for which, as this poor Church in general, so none more than my self in particular, have great cause to rejoice. God having (no doubt) given you such high favour in our Master's Eyes, that you might be enabled thereby to do the more good unto his Church; and especially to put a happy end to that great Work (which hitherto hath received so many Impediments) of setling the Reversion of the Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Kingdom upon the several Incumbents. Whereunto I assure my self your Grace will easily work my Lord Deputy; who every day sheweth himself so zealous for the recovering of the dissipated Patrimony of the Church, that mine Eyes never yet beheld his match in that kind.</p>
                  <p>By the death of your Predecessor, our University of <hi>Dublin</hi> was left to seek a new Chancellor; whom I advised to pitch upon no other but your self: which they did with all readiness and alacrity. If your Grace will design to receive that poor Society under the shadow of your Wings, you shall put a further tie of observance, not upon that only, but upon me also, who had my whole breeding there, and obtained the honour of being the first Proctor that ever was there.</p>

I am further intreated by our Lord Treasurer, the Earl of <hi>Corke,</hi> to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify my knowledg touching the placing of his Monument in the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s, in the Suburbs of <hi>Dublin.</hi> The place wherein it is erected, was an ancient Passage into a Chappel within that Church; which hath, time out of mind, been stopped up with a Partition made of Boards and Lime. I remember I was present when the Earl concluded with the Dean to allow thirty Pounds for the raising of another Partition, betwixt this new Monument and the Quire, wherein the Ten Commandments might be fairly written: Which if it were put up, I see not what offence could be taken at the Monument; which otherwise cannot be denied to be a very great Ornament to the Church.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing at hand to present your Grace withal, but this small Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise written unto Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> by one of your Predecessors, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient Dignity of the See of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> Which I beseech you to accept at the hands of</p>

                     <salute>May it please your Grace;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>UPon my return from my Northern Journey, I wrote unto you by Sir <hi>Francis Cook;</hi> declaring the cause of my long silence, together with the extraordinary Zeal of our noble Lord Deputy; I may justly term him a new <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> raised by God, for the making up of the Ruins of this decayed Church; who upon an occasion, openly declared himself an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the greatest of those that have devoured our holy Things, and made the Patrimony of the Church the Inheritance of their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>I likewise made bold to intreat your Lordship (in the same Letter) to accept our poor University of <hi>Dublin</hi> into your gracious Protection. I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Draught of two other Letters to be made, in the Name of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, unto your Grace; the one penned by the Provost, the other by Dr. <hi>Hoyle</hi> the Divinity-Professor there. But the Fellows of the House were so factious, that nothing could please them which came from their Superiors; and so idle, that they would not take pains to do the like themselves. So that now I have the more cause to implore your Grace's Aid afresh, and to present you with a new Supplication of <hi>Miserere domus labentis.</hi> Wherein that I may conceal nothing from your Grace, the very Truth is this; The Provost, albeit he be a very honest Man, and one that mindeth the Good of the House, yet is of too soft and gentle a disposition to rule so heady a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The Lord Bishop of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> while he was Provost there, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Statutes for the good of the House, conformable to those of <hi>Emmanuel-Colledg</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> where he himself in former time lived. But there is so little Power given to the Provost for redressing of things that are amiss, without the consent of the greater part of the Senior Fellows, that they,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:60492:218"/>
finding thereby their own strength, perpetually join together in crossing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Provost attempteth for reformation, either of themselves, or of the Scholars; being sure never to give their consent, that any punishment shall be inflicted upon themselves, either for absenting themselves from the Church, or lying out of the House, or frequenting of Taverns, or other such Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. So that the Provost, by their perverse dealing, being now made weary of his place, it were to be wished, that some other Preferment might be found for him; and one of a more rigid Temper, and stouter Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion placed in his room; for such a Wedg, for the breaking of so evil a Knot, must necessarily be used.</p>
                  <p>The Earl fearing that my former Letter might not have come unto your hands, hath earnestly entreated me to write thus much again; which as I could not well deny unto him, being but the bearing of a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the very Truth, so do I wholly submit the same unto your graver Judgment.</p>

                  <p>I Received with your last Letter, the Penitential Canons of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> for which I heartily thank you: In lieu whereof, I hereby send you the History of <hi>Gottheschalcus,</hi> (the first Latin Book, I suppose, that ever was printed in <hi>Ireland);</hi> I have directed it (as you see) to Mr. <hi>Vossius;</hi> but upon your advertisement, forbore to commit the publication of it unto him. For the <hi>Arminian</hi> Questions, I desire never to read any more than my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Lectures touching Predestination and Christ's Death; and yours concerning Grace and Free-will; together with the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Question of Perseverance, which you shewed unto me, The Book of <hi>Scotus</hi> in <hi>Benet-Colledg,</hi> I guess to be the same with a Manuscript which I have my self, without the Author's Name, beginning thus; <hi>Quod status Praelatorum, viz. pastorum Ecclesiae presupponit statum alium, probatur sic.</hi> I had thought the other had been written by <hi>Johannes Erigena,</hi> or else I had not much desired it: but now I discern it came from <hi>Johannes Duns,</hi> I do not much esteem it.</p>
                  <p>If I be not deceived, being once in talk of <hi>Scaliger</hi> at your Table, Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> made mention of some Mistake of his, in the Fragments of <hi>Aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denus,</hi> or <hi>Berosus,</hi> which he hath published at the end of his Book <hi>De Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datione Temporum,</hi> but what it was, I cannot call to remembrance: If you have a better memory, I pray you help mine; or else enquire of Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> himself when you shall next see him. I received a very kind Letter from Mr. <hi>Vossius,</hi> for my History of <hi>Gottheschalcus.</hi> A Copy of your Writings, touching the Efficacy of Baptism, and the Questions, with the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants, I much desire. Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> I see (as you feared) hath followed the rigid part.</p>
                  <p>I have gotten a good large Fragment of the beginning of <hi>Clement</hi>'s genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>

                     <salute>Most Reverend, and my very good Lord;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Received your Grace's Letter of the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> for which I humbly thank your Lordship, and crave pardon withal of my long silence. I am right sorry to hear of the late decease of the worthy Bishop of <hi>Derry; Boni deficiunt, mali proficiunt.</hi> I heard, before the receipt of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Letter, of it at <hi>London.</hi> I heard also there, that Dr. <hi>Bramhall</hi> of our Colledg was likely to succeed him: I pray God he may succed him, as in place, so in all his Vertues and vertuous Actions. I pray God to be assistant to the Parliament of State with you, and to bless all the Proceedings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to give an happy success to that Honourable Meeting, in all their Important Affairs. For my Lectures of the Eucharist, I have as yet no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to transcribe them, nor others touching the Remonstrants. As for my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> his Readings, I will see if I can get Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to procure them to be transcribed. As for an Answer to the Animadversions you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will (God willing) e're long send your Lordship a Copy of them. The Author of the Animadversions is now with us. We have had some do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings here of late about one of <hi>Pembrook-Hall,</hi> who preaching in St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, about the beginning of <hi>Lent,</hi> upon that Text, <hi>James</hi> 2. 22. seemed to avouch the insufficiency of Faith to Justification, and to impugn the Doctrine of our <hi>11th</hi> Article of Justification by Faith only; for which he was convented by the Vice-Chancellor, who was willing to accept of an easy acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but the same Party preaching his Latin Sermon, <hi>pro gradu,</hi> the last week, upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. he said, he came not, <hi>palinodiam canere, sed eandem cantilenam canere;</hi> which moved our Vice-Chancellor, Dr. <hi>Love,</hi> to call for his Sermon; which he refused to deliver. Whereupon, upon <hi>Wednesday</hi> last, being <hi>Barnaby</hi> day, the day appointed for the admission of the Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of Divinity, and the choice of the Batchelors of Divinity, which must answer <hi>Die comitiorum;</hi> he was stayed by the major part of the Suffrages of the Doctors of the Faculty. And though sundry Doctors did favour him, and would have had him to be the Man that should answer <hi>Die comitiorum,</hi> yet he is put by, and one Mr. <hi>Flatkers</hi> of our Colledg chosen to answer. Whose first Question is,</p>

                  <p>The truth is, there are some Heads among us, that are great Abettors of Mr. <hi>Tourney,</hi> the Party above mentioned, who no doubt are backed by others. I pray God we may persist in the Doctrine of our Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our Articles and Homilies. Innovators are too much favoured now a-days. Our Vice-Chancellor hath carried Business for Matter of Religion, both stoutly and discreetly. Dr. <hi>Lane</hi> died on <hi>Sunday</hi> last, and was buried in the night upon <hi>Tuesday,</hi> in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Colledg.</p>
                  <p>It may be you are willing to hear of our University Affairs. I may truly say, I never knew them in worse condition since I was a Member thereof, which is almost 46 years. Not but that I hope the greater part is Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox; but that new Heads are brought in, and they are backed in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Novelties, and them which broach new Opinions, (as I doubt not but
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:60492:223"/>
you hear) others are disgraced and checked when they come above, as my self was by my Lord of <hi>York</hi> the last <hi>Lent,</hi> for favouring Puritans in Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story; and all from false Informations from hence, which are believed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any examination. At that time also I intreated my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to speak to the Dean of <hi>Wells</hi> that now is (who had sundry times excepted against me for not residing three months <hi>per Annum,</hi> as I should by Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) which I nothing doubt but it was by his instigation, he promised me then he would; but not having done it yet, I repaired again to my Lord's Grace about it in <hi>November.</hi> But now he cannot, for that his Majesty hath given him in charge to take account of the Bishops in his Province, how Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence is kept. I told him my Case was not every Man's Case; and that I had a Benefice, at which I desired to be in the Vacation-Time; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would prevail. And yet, as I told him, I am every Year at <hi>Wells,</hi> sometimes a month or six weeks. I think they would have me out of my Professor's place, and I could wish the same, if I could have one to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to my mind, for then I should have leasure to transcribe things. Well, howsoever, God's Will be done, and he teach us Humility and Patience. I heard also of some doings with you. The Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven direct you and us, and teach us to submit to him in all things. I have not yet sent my Answer to Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> but intend e're long. I have not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished yet one Point, to shew the Arminian Opinions were condemned in the Synods which condemned the Pelagian Heresy. At Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, who could not get a good Scrivener to transcribe my Lord of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>'s Readings, <hi>de Praedestinatione, &amp; morte Christi;</hi> I gave way that he should send it to you; which I intreat your Lordship, if you have received it, to return it me, as soon and as safely as you conveniently can. The Tractate <hi>de Praedestinatianis,</hi> in defence of your Lordship (I know not your Adversary, nor his Name) is Dr. <hi>Twisses;</hi> it may be he hath sent your Lordship a Copy of it. He is a deserving Man. We have a Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor that favoureth Novelties, both in Rites and Doctrines. I could write more, <hi>sed manum de Tabula:</hi> The greatest part of this was inclosed in the Letter your Lordship had sent <hi>Jan.</hi> 14. I made now a few additions. And so I rest,</p>

                  <p>OUR Commencement is now over, where Dean <hi>Baden,</hi> now Dr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> did well perform his part, who answered the Act <hi>Vesperiis Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorum.</hi> And so did the Batchelor of Divinity, <hi>Die Comitiorum,</hi> being one of the Fellows of our Colledg. The Vice-Chancellor, Dr. <hi>Love,</hi> did well perform his part, especially in encountring with one <hi>Franciscus de S. Chara,</hi> [but his true name is <hi>Davenport]</hi> who in a Book set forth at <hi>Doway,</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile <hi>(si diis placet)</hi> our Articles of Religion, with the Definitions of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But we have dismissed the Auditors this Year, with much more content than they were the Year before. Our Stirs we had a little before the Commencement, are prettily well over. There is a little Book intituled <hi>Brevis Disquisitio,</hi> which I suppose your Lordship hath seen: It containeth in it sundry, both <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Pelagian</hi> Points; as also that the Body which shall be raised in the Resurrection, is not <hi>idem numero;</hi> also Souls do not live till the Resurrection; besides sundry other Points: It is printed <hi>Eleutheropoli:</hi> it is said it cometh out of <hi>Eaton-Colledg,</hi> and that <hi>Alesius</hi> should be the Author, who was at <hi>Dort</hi> with us. I am sorry such a Book should come thence. In my last Letters from my Lord of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> he was inquisitive of the Ancient Codes of Canons, as being desirous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the ancient Discipline of the Church. Your Lordship could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him for Books. If he would undertake it, he would do it to some purpose. And there are not many Books necessary to know the substance of it; as <hi>Codex Canonum Universalis Ecclesiae, &amp; Codex Aphricanus;</hi> with <hi>Zonarus</hi> and <hi>Balsamon</hi> upon them, and the <hi>Trullan</hi> Canons, and <hi>Codex Romanus</hi> reprinted, which obtained in the Western Church. At better leisure I will write to him more at large. In the mean time, I told him your Lordship could show them all the fore-named. Thus in some haste. I beseech God to bless you, and your Parliament in all their weighty Affairs; and so intreat your Prayers for us.</p>
                  <p>And so with my Salutations to you, my much honoured Lord, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the gracious protection of the highest Majesty, resting,</p>

                     </expan> Deus &amp; Rex concessere: &amp; gratulationis testimonium solenne inscriptionem hanc extare volui. Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarem insuper Dominationi vestrae gratiam debet hoc opus, cujus sumptibus &amp; cura exemplar Samaritanum nobis in Anglia primo communicatum suit; &amp; in Bibliotheca Cottoniana, in doctorum seculis etiam futuris commodum, reconditum. Ex illo enim codice habuimus discrepantes Samaritani textus ab Hebraica veritate lectiones, quarum quanta fuerit utilitas, ac propemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum necessitas ad rabiem Morini plene retundendam; non opus est hic dicere, siquidem suis id locis manifesto apparebit. Ad Cardinalem Gallum aspirat Morinus: cur non ego ad Archiepiscopum Hibernum Dedicationem hanc praeterea à me flagitat foelix ille calamus tuus, quo Pontificiae superstitionis fibras faeliciore quàm multi alii successu in utroque idiomate dissecuisti. Quoties Polemica tua vere aurea revolvo, nescio quo modo in ima cordis penetralia ingens autoris admiratio, ingens erga autorem affectus, nunquam nisi me moriente, moriturus irrepit. Urgent praeterea sacrae manus illae mihi sacrum munus adeunti inter alias impositae. Cogit denique quae mihi tecum intercessit, si de tanto viro tali verbo tam pusillo uti licuerit, per multos an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos continuata necessitudo. De operis necessitate non opus est longa praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione. Biblia Hebraica recepit Synagoga Judaica oraculorum divinorum custos, Rom. 3. 2. Ad nos eadem ista transmisit. Patres ad unum omnes pro authenticis habuere, in linguas alias transtulere, translationem discrepan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam ex his correxere. In Ecclesia Romana viri doctissimi plurimi sacram eorum autoritatem scriptis suis communivere. Ecclesiae Orientales omnes approbavere. Protestantes pleno ore pro fonte sacro illa venerantur. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus Samaritanorum aduocatus interim in hoc Judaeis, quos oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat tamen, similis, nec Deo placet, &amp; hominibus omnibus contrarius est. 1 Thess. 2. 15. Cum inprimis observatum esset dogmatibus Pontifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is parum propitios esse codices Hebraeos, reperti sunt, qui corruptos esse clamarent rivulos iis anteferrent. Sed fontem novum qui aperiret, ante Morinum inventus est nemo. Gratuletur patrono suo Ecclesia Pontificia. Nos interim libros sacros antiquos colimus, quibus usus est Christus ipse, &amp; Apostoli, cum tamen characterum mutationem longe antea factam somniet Morinus. Cloaca quo magis agitatur, eo Mephitin exhalat magis. Morinus Samaritanis antiquis Samaritanior etiam evasit. Illi enim, teste Eulogio, Jesum filium Nave Prophetam praedictum, Mosi similem futurum, profite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur. Librum ejus pro Canonico certò habuere, qui hanc illi gloriam tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buebant. At hunc librum nobis eripuit cùm aliis prophetiis Dositheus Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini antecessor. Det nobis Morinus charactere Samaritano scriptos Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum

libros, aut fateatur se plures scripturae sacrae codices quam dederit ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulisse. Sed nec ferendum est hominem Christianum Samaritanos Dei hostes Judaeis Dei populo in libris sacris tuendis anteferre. Praecipuè cum constet Prophetas fuisse post commentitiam characterum mutationem in populo Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daico; in Samaritano nullos.

                  <p>I Thank you heartily for your Letters, and am as heartily glad that your Parliament and Convocation are so happily ended, especially for the Church; and that both for the particular of your letting Leases, which is for Maintenance, and for the quiet, and well-ordering and ending of your Book of Canons. I hope now the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> will begin to flourish again, and that both with inward Sufficiency, and outward Means to support it. And for your Canons, to speak Truth, and with wonted li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedom; though I cannot but think the English Canons entire,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:60492:226"/>
(especially with some few amendments) would have done betterly yet since you, and that Church, have thought otherwise, I do very easily submit to it, and you shall have my Prayers that God would bless it. As for the Particular about Subscription, I think you have couched that well, since as it seems, there was some necessity to carry that Article closely. And God forbid you should, upon any occasion, have rouled back upon your former Controversy about the Articles. For if you should have risen from this Convocation in heat, God knows when or how that Church would have cooled again, had the cause of Difference been never so slight. By which means the Romanist, which is too strong a Party already, would both have strengthned, and made a scorn of you. And therefore ye are much bound to God, that in this nice and picked Age, you have ended all things cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically, and yet in peace. And I hope you will be all careful to continue and maintain that which God hath thus mercifully bestowed upon you.</p>

                  <p>I Have been almost tired with continual attendance on out long continued Parliament and Convocation; which being done, they would needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon me also the moderating of the Divinity Act; and the creating of the Doctors at our last Commencement. I am now at last retired from <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> to my old: Place, where I begin at length, <hi>Redire in gratiam cum veteribus Amicis.</hi> I send you herewith <hi>Harrys</hi> his Book against the Friars, and our New Canons. The Articles of Religion agreed upon in our former Synod, <hi>Anno</hi> 1615, we let stand as they did before. But for the manifesting of our Agreement with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we have received and approved your Articles also, concluded in the Year 1562, as you may see in the first of our Canons. But while we strive here to maintain the Purity of our ancient Truth, how cometh it to pass that you in <hi>Cambridg</hi> do cast such stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blocks in our way by publishing unto the World such rotten Stuff as <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> hath vented in his five Discourses; wherein he hath so carried himself, <hi>ut Famosi Perni amanuensem possis agnoscere.</hi> The Jesuits of <hi>England</hi> sent over the Book hither to confirm our Papists in their obstinacy, and to assure them that we are now coming home unto them as fast as we can; I pray God this Sin be not deeply laid to their charge, who give an occasion to our blind thus to stumble.</p>
                  <p>I thank you most heartily for communicating my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures unto me, they are excellent, learnedly, foundly, and perspicuously performed, and I hope will do much good here for the establishing of our

Neither were it amiss that you should make a Collection of all your Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, as you see the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> hath done; and cause your Lectures of the Eucharist to be transcribed, and left in a safe hand, that it may not (as I have heretofore warned you) <hi>periclitari in unico exemplari.</hi> Of these particulars I desire to hear your Resolutions in your next Letters; and in the mean time recommend you and your godly Labours unto God's good Blessing; evermore resting,</p>

                  <p>I Have been put to no small pains, considering my other Occasions, to read over, and in a manner to study the several Letters and other Papers, which have been sent and come to my hands, some from your Grace, some from the Provost and Fellows that join with him; some from <hi>Pheasant</hi> and the other Party; and some from the Lords Justices, and Council there to the Lord Deputy, and from his Lordship to me; and all of them about the late unhappy difference fallen between the Visitors of the Colledg near <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and the Provost. The more carefully I have read over these Papers, the more (I clearly confess to your Grace) I am troubled at the Business, and could heartily wish some friendly way were thought on there, to prevent a formal and legal Decision by me. Of which yet seeing so little hope as I do, I have taken all the pains which I can, preparatory to a final Sentence: For I have very carefully, and with all indifferency, drawn a brief History of the Fact, and the whole Proceedings, with relation in the Margent to every several Paper that hath come to my hands. A Copy of this Brief, together with all the several Papers to which it relates, I have sent to my Lord Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and desired him to shew it to your Grace, and all the other Parties whom it concerns: to this end, that if your Lordship and they agree upon the Fact, I may have it returned unto me, and go on to my Decision. But if you agree not upon the Fact, as I have set it down, that then you may there set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle any Difference, and agree upon it, that no one whom it concerns, may say I had not a right state of the Question before me. When this is done, I shall go on to do my Duty with Justice to all Parties, as far as I can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Cause, and as far as my learned Counsel here shall be able to advise me. But I cannot but still wish, and that very heartily, that my Decision may be prevented by the care and wisdom of my Lord Deputy, and the moderate and prudent respects of the Parties interessed, which I presume your Grace will further: For it appears very ill to his Majesty, (who was of necessity to be made acquainted with the Business, because the Censure of the Provost, if he deserve it, is referr'd to himself) and must needs appear so to all wise Men, both here and there, that such a Difference concerning young Men newly started up from Boys, should cause so great a disturbance among grave and wise Men, as this hath done. And 'tis somewhat too that the Romanists which swarm in those Parts, have such an occasion as this Difference, to please themselves withal. My Hopes are great in your Grace's Moderation; but if all fail, I shall make a binding Decision so soon as ever the state of the Business is sent me back. So wishing your Grace all Health and Happiness, I leave you to God's blessed Protection, and rest,</p>

                     <salute>Most Reverend Father in God, my most honoured Lord;</salute>

                  <p>I Have received a Letter from your Grace by Mr. <hi>Cullen,</hi> with much joy, as well to hear of your Grace's good Health (which I pray to God may continue long so for the Good of Christendom) as to see me favoured with some Employment again for your Grace, than whom I know no body living I desire to serve with more affection: I will with one word, set down here what hath been done in your Lordship's Business since Mr. <hi>Cullen</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival. I brought him first to my Lord the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who for your Grace's sake, and his own worth, shewed him all kindness, and to Mr. <hi>Joanes.</hi> I carried him to Mr. <hi>Duluy,</hi> where he made acquaintance, bestowing a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement upon them from your Grace. <hi>Pere Sirmond</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rigault,</hi> we could not find at home yet, nor <hi>Gabriel</hi> the <hi>Sionita,</hi> whose great Bible I shewed him also, and conferred the Syrian Characters together, of which
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:60492:232"/>
there be three or four here; but of this Mr. <hi>Cullen</hi> will give a better account a while hence; for I have written also to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where such a Character is to be sold, to have the sight of it in print, and at what rate they mean to sell it, to compare the Prices and Characters together with these here. In the mean while Mr. <hi>Cullen</hi> is advised to sequester himself from English and Irish, to profit the more in the French Tongue, for conversing afterwards with those that he hath business withal, and to that end I hope he will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied a prorogation of his licence of travelling and absenting himself from the Colledg for some few months longer, with the continuation of his Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend (he being imployed in Work so good for the Common Wealth) especially upon your Grace's Commendation. I have set one to work for the transcribing of <hi>Concil. Lemovicense,</hi> and <hi>Theodori Poenitentiale,</hi> and will go on with the rest one by one, as I can get them; for to demand so much at once, would seem strange to them, although they be very courteous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious. Of printed Books, I bought <hi>Vita Leonis &amp; Caroli</hi> of <hi>Sirmondus;</hi> but the rest marked to me, are not his. <hi>Hincmari Opusc.</hi> are of <hi>Cordesius,</hi> and I think you Grace hath them. <hi>Ivo Carnotensis</hi> of <hi>Juret. Damianus</hi> of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> a <hi>Benedictine. Bellarm. de Script. Eccl.</hi> of <hi>Sirmond,</hi> but scarce any thing altered in it. <hi>Browerus de Treverensis Ecclesiae Antiquit,</hi> I cannot get yet. There is nothing added to the Councils of <hi>Binius,</hi> nor any thing printed of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> but what your Grace hath. <hi>Du Chesnes</hi>'s third and fourth Volume are a printing, but not yet finished.</p>
                  <p>This Kingdom being now in Wars on all sides, doth not afford any great Design for the advancement of Learning. Of late, one Mr. <hi>Gallant</hi> a Counsellor of State, and a Protestant, set forth a Book <hi>de Franco allodio</hi> in French, in which he gives a touch unto the <hi>Waldenses</hi> History, and <hi>Simon de Montfort:</hi> I wrote of this Man heretofore to your Grace, as one best versed in that History, and best stored with their Writings; this Book I will send with the rest.</p>
                  <p>I wonder your Grace hath not received my former, with one from Mr. <hi>Buxtorf;</hi> if I am not deceived, I sent them away with those of the City and University of <hi>Basil</hi> to my Lord Deputy; to whom I made bold to add one of mine, to thank his Greatness for the Favour of my Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for his nobleness to my Kinsman <hi>Frey.</hi> I am not so out with <hi>Ireland,</hi> (where I have heretofore received so good entertainment) but I hope to see it again; which I desire the more for your Grace's sake, to tender my best Respects in Person to so much worth; and should think me happy if I could deserve a mean Prebend in your Cathedral, to wait more close upon your Grace. I humbly crave your Grace's Blessing, and remain with my hearty Prayers for your Health and Prosperity,</p>

                  <p>ALL my expectancies for observation of this Lunar Eclipse last <hi>Tuesday</hi> morning, were lost in the cloudy disposition of the Heavens for that time; which offered matter of more consequence to my meditation, in that idle interim of expecting a fairer Season: That <hi>Hysteron Proteron</hi> of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in translating the Sun into the Center, and making it Stationary; In advancing the Earth up into an Orb, and making it Ambulatory: Howsoever it hath suffered by popular prejudice in some, and the resty disposition of others in their own Errors, yet doth it excellently accommodate many irregular Motions to Account, and open a large Field for the search and invention of high things: for thus, By the apparent Semidiameter of the Sun in his Apoge, and the Angle of half the Conick shadow of the Earth, is most artificially and easily determined the true Parallax of the Sun; And by the Parallax his distance from the Earth; And by these, the semidiamiter of the fixt Stars and Planets, together with the several parallaxes they make upon the Orb of the Earth, and their distances. Upon this Account the Semidiameter of the Orb of the Earrh in his middle-distance from the Sun, is 1498 semidiameters of the Earth, the Cube of 1498 is 3, 361, 517, 992: And so many times is the Orb of the Earth or Sun, bigger than the Earth it self; yet all this whole Orb, in respect of the Orb of <hi>Saturn,</hi> (which makes not one minute of parallax upon it) is but a Point: And the Orb of <hi>Saturn</hi> again, in respect of the Firmament, is but a Point; for the fix'd Stars make but a Parallax of five minutes at the Orb of <hi>Saturn,</hi> (as by the Difference of the Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters of their Orbs may appear); so that I wonder at many of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, that have shrunk and shrivelled up these two Heavens of the Planets, and of the fix'd Stars into one, whereas they are not only almost infinitely and disproportionably distant, but are also distinguish'd by their different Heat and Light; this Planetary Heaven having its Heat and Light from its Heart and Centre, the Sun, which from thence communicates his Heat and Light to all the Planets, more or less, as they are nearer or farther from him: And therefore we see how languishing a Light he lends to Saturn, as being twice farther from him than some of the rest, and the last of those Bodies receive Light from him. What the World (now come to Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) hath by her Optick Eyes of Glass lately discovered, is obvious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man; namely, that <hi>Saturn</hi> (a Body 46 times bigger than this Earth that bears us) hath, besides the same Sun common to us with it, to serve it by day, a certain number of Moons also appropriate to it to serve it by night: And that <hi>Jupiter</hi> (a Body 25 times bigger than this Earth) hath, besides the same Sun common to us with it, to serve it by day, three Moons also appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to it to serve it by night: and whereof (if need were) we could give the Places, and the several Vicissitudes of their Changes, Wains, and Fulls.</p>
                  <p>Our Earth also (proportionable to her bigness) hath one Moon assigned her for her service by Night; which, howsoever great by its very nearness it appears to us on Earth, yet undoubtedly is as undiscoverable from the Orb of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as are his Moons from hence, which are not seen without
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:60492:234"/>
Spectacles: What all these things may import, I spare to speak, that this Earth may enjoy her own Opinion, to have been the only work of God in his Creation in this kind; yet of <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and others of that kind, with that rich and fair Furniture about them, I only say, as upon the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of some sumptuous richly hung House, and all shining with Lights and Torches, surely that House was not so made and furnish'd for Rats and Mice to dwell in. Upon the Suburbs of <hi>Saturn,</hi> begin the Confines of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and starry Heaven, whose almost infinite extension, is such, as that the whole Planetary Heaven (whose Bounds is the Orb of <hi>Saturn)</hi> bears but the proportion of a Point unto it, and gives but a Parallax of five minutes at the fix'd Stars; the Light of this starry Heaven, as far transcending the Light of the Sun, as doth the Sun that of a Candle. And here to measure out these starry Bodies, we take not the short scantling of the Earth, or Sun's Semidiameter, but the whole Orb of the Earth, or Sun it self; and they come out so vast, that had I not the warrant of a Demonstration to do it, I should think they did exceed all belief, though not the truth. A Star of the first Magnitude, comes out twenty thousand and three and fifty times bigger than the whole Orb of the Earth or Sun. A Star of the second Magnitude, 5935 times bigger than the Orb of the Earth; and so propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably the rest. And therefore is the extent of this starry Heaven such, and so vast, that the Light and Heat of these huge and many Suns, might not confound the Light, and fire the Frame of this lower Heaven. If then the Light of one petty Sun here below be such as no Eye can endure it, what inaccessible Light must that of this second and starry Heaven be, where are such inexhaustible Suns, and so many of them, that though <hi>Ptolomy</hi> from <hi>Alexandria</hi> could count but 1202; and <hi>Tycho</hi> from his <hi>Uraniburgh</hi> but 1000, yet appear they by the Perspective, as infinite for number, as they are almost incomprehensible for their vastness. All these vast Lights, and that vaster Heaven that holds them, are but the Portal to that third and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Heaven which he inhabits, whom St. <hi>James</hi> calls <hi>Pater Luminum,</hi> the Father of these vast Lights, which yet are but Torches to him that made them. This is a Building well befitting him that framed it, as near Infinity as may be, yet not Infinite; yet compared to Him that made it, it is all as a Point, as Nothing. From this Height have we a full survey of the true poorness of Man; for from this starry Height, look but down towards the Earth, and how many thousand degrees beneath, (nothing to be seen) is it vanish'd away Where then are the pompous Parts of it, <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and the new-found <hi>America</hi> What is become of <hi>Europe,</hi> the least and last part of it What of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the several subdivisions into which it is shted; and those petty parcels of it to which we so ambitiously intitle our Names and Vanities What great share enjoy we of those fathomless Fountains of Heat and Light, those many glorious Suns send out yet we must be (by our own account) the only Creatures of Excellency, for whom all these things were made So might the Spider, nested in the Roof of the Grand Seignior's Seraglio, say of her self, All that magnificent and stately Structure, set out with Gold and Silver, and embellish'd with all Antiquity and Mosaick Work, was only built for her to hang up her Webs and Toyls to take Flies. We the glorious Ants of this Earth, magnify our selves upon this Mole-hill here, to be the great and sole End of the World's Workmanship; whilst we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider not how little and nothing we are of it. From hence I sometimes take down mine own towring thoughts, when they prompt me forward to the pursuit of these petty Preferments here below; for but looking up to this starry Heaven, they are lost, and come out, upon account from thence, no more considerable than the cast Dust under my Feet. From hence also I learn Temper, and am put into a large possession of my self; for take but
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:60492:235"/>
the opinion of Man's own Excellency from him, he will then be becalm'd into temper, and receive his Sufferings without risings and rebellion of Heart, and as no indignities done him; whilst comparing himself with himself, and things below him, he dwarfs his Understanding, and swells into a Conceit of being Some-body; whom when his turn of Trouble and Afflictions overtake him, he knows not what he hath done may deserve them, or why he alone, amongst all Men, should be singled out for such a Suffering, and hath secret risings of Heart against God, that sends it sometimes belch'd out in Blasphemies, or other symptoms of a proud and ignorant Spirit, who with his low-built Knowledg, never soaring higher than the pitch of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and Men about him, takes himself to be the Complement of the whole Creation, and all things tied to his Service; and therefore takes all Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Affronts and Indignities done him; whereas he that from this height beholds himself in the infinite lustre of all these Lights and Suns that never set about him, shall see himself comparatively such a thing as comes out many degrees beneath Nothing; and is taken up in admiration, how a God served by Hosts of Creatures of such excellent Glory, should vouchsafe such honour to his despicable Dust and Ashes, as to seek his own glory in his Sufferings, which makes him strangely ambitious of offering up his Body to the Rack, the Flame, and other Instruments of Torture, and that with such a setledness of suffering in them, as if he suffered in a borrowed Body, or one of Air. I have chawed many times upon those Husks and Chaffy Terms of <hi>Infinitum, Aeternum,</hi> and the like, which the Schools give us to apprehend God in; but I confess I could never get them down, or swallow them any way, to enlarge my Conceit of God by them; whereas he that orderly ascends the Rounds of these two visible Heavens; First, By the chaste observations of his own, and undeceived sense; Secondly, By Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, fresh and unadulteratly drawn from those Observations; And lastly, by undeniable Demonstrations built upon those Inductions; shall find his Understanding so exalted, and his Heart enlarged in the apprehension of God's Omneity, and his own Nothing (and that not petitory, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Assent) that I dare say, No means (not Divine) can make a Man walk more humbly with his God, more honestly with his Neighbour, or more soberly with himself, than the almost Infinity of these Creatures so made sensible. If by your Grace's leave I may but borrow these Hypotheses for such Purposes as these, you shall not further need to fear that I will find out new Worlds where God hath made none.</p>

                  <p>THE Manuscript Latin Copy of <hi>Ignatius</hi> in <hi>Caius</hi> Colledg Library, hath this singular in it, That in the genuine Epistles, (for the other I heed not) those Passages are wanting, which are excepted against as insititious
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:60492:235"/>
and supposititious by our Writers; and that the place touching the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist cited by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> out of the Epistle to the <hi>Smyrnians,</hi> which is wanting in all other Books, is to be found in this. But I intend, e're long, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Ignatius</hi> my self, as considering it to be a Matter of very great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to have a Writer of his standing to be freed (as much as may be) from these interpolations of later Times.</p>
                  <p>Your Observation, that the Canons of the Apostles are of a later Date, is very right; as also of the Time of the <hi>Laodicen</hi> Councils, wherein <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> is undoubtedly deceived. Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> sent me a part of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of our British Councils, printed in a large Folio, as much as reacheth from <hi>pag.</hi> 31, to 375, which I am now a revising, and supplying with some <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which may be added by way of Appendix. Both that Work of his, and mine also of the Antiquities of the British Churches (with the Pelagian History inserted thereunto) will come abroad, I hope, this next Term.</p>
                  <p>I sent to <hi>Paris</hi> to get a new Transcript of <hi>Rathramus de Corpore &amp; San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Domini,</hi> out of <hi>Thuanus</hi> his Library; but instead of the Text which I desired, they sent me only an Appendix subjoined thereunto out of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose Augustine, &amp;c.</hi> touching the same Argument. I had a Copy also from thence of <hi>Rathramus</hi> his Collections against the Grecians, which is a large Tractate. Those other two Treatises of his, I suppose you have compared with the Manuscript belonging to the late Master of <hi>Benet-Colledg;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Manuscript of the same, you may find in the Library of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Infirmities of old Age (which I am sorry do come so fast upon you) being so many Messengers to give us warning of our dissolution, should put you in mind of putting your Writings in good Order, that in them you may live and speak unto the Church when you are dead. So with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my best Wishes, I recommend you, and all your godly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to the Blessing of Almighty God; evermore resting,</p>

                  <p>YOur Letter of the first of <hi>February</hi> came unto my hands the seventh of <hi>April;</hi> but my journy to <hi>Dublin</hi> following thereupon, and my long stay in the City, (where the multiplicity of my <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>private</hi> Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would scarce afford me a breathing time) was such, that I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to defer my <hi>Answer</hi> thereunto, untill this short time of my <hi>retiring</hi> into the Country: Where, being now absent also from my <hi>Library,</hi> I can rather signify unto you, how fully I <hi>concur</hi> in judgment with those grounds, which you have so <hi>judiciously</hi> laid in that question of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> than afford any great help unto you in the building, which you intend to raise thereupon (For when I gave my self unto the reading of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> I took no heed unto any thing that concerned this <hi>Argument,</hi> as little dreaming that any such <hi>controversy</hi> would have arisen among us); Yet generally I do remember that the word <hi>Sabbatum</hi> in their writngs doth denote our <hi>Saturday:</hi> although by Analogy from the manner of speech used by the <hi>Jews,</hi> the term be sometimes transferred to denote our <hi>Christian Festivities</hi> also, as <hi>Sirmondus</hi> the Jesuite observeth, out of <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris,</hi> (lib. 1. Epist. 2.) where, describing the moderation of the Table of <hi>Theodorick, King of the Goths, upon the Eves,</hi> and the excesse on the <hi>Holy-day</hi> following; he writeth of the one, that his <hi>convivium diebus profestis simile privato est;</hi> but of the other, <hi>De luxu autem illo Sabbatario narrationi meae super sedendum est, qui nec latentes potest latere personas.</hi> And because the <gap reason="foreign">

Whereupon you may observe, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his <hi>speculum (in operum tomo</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.) purposely selecting those things which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto us <hi>Christians;</hi> doth wholly pretermit that Precept, in the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the Commandments of the Decalogue; Not because the substance of the Precept was <hi>absolutely</hi> abolished: but because it was in some parts held to be <note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

Whereupon <hi>Caesarius Arelatensis</hi> in his twelfth homily, doubted not to preach unto the people; <hi>Verè dico, Fratres, satis durum &amp; prope nimis impium est, ut Christiani non habeant reverentiam diei Dominico, quam Judaei observare videntur in Sabbato, &amp;c.

                  <p>But touching the old <hi>Pentecost,</hi> it is very considerable, that it is no where in <hi>Moses</hi> affixed unto any one certain day of the Month, as all the rest of the Feasts are: which is a very great presumption that it was a moveable Feast, and so <note n="*" place="margin">Against Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Heylin,</hi> part 2. cap. 1. pag. 14.</note> varied, that it might always fall upon the day immediately following the ordinary Sabbath. And if God so order the matter, that in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Feast of Weeks, the Seventh should purposely be passed over, and that Solemnity should be kept upon the First: what other thing may we imagine could be presignified thereby, but that under the State of the Gospel, the solemnity of the weekly Service should be celebrated upon that day That on that day the famous <hi>Pentecost</hi> in the <hi>2d</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> was observed, is in a manner generally acknowledged by all: wherein the Truth of all those that went before being accomplished, we may observe the Type and the Verity, concurring together in a wonderful manner.

                  <p>The <hi>Revelation</hi> exhibited unto St. <hi>John</hi> upon the Lord's Day, is, by <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> (in his fifth Book) referred unto the Empire of <hi>Domitian;</hi> or, as <note place="margin">Revel. 7. 10.</note> S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Catalogue more particularly doth express it, to the fourth Year of his Reign: Which answereth partly to the forty-ninth, and partly to the ninty-fifth Year of our Lord, according to our vulgar computation; and was but eleven or twelve Years before the Time, when <hi>Ignatius</hi> did write his Epistles. Of whom then should we more certainly learn, what the Apostle meant by the Lord's Day, than from <hi>Ignatius</hi> who was by the Apostles themselves ordained Bishop of that Church, wherein the Disciples <note place="margin">Acts 11. 26.</note> were first called <hi>Christians:</hi> And in his Epistle to the <hi>Magnesians,</hi> clearly maketh the Lord's Day to be a weekly Holy-Day observed by Christians, in the room of the abrogated Sabbath of the Jews; than which can we desire more But here you are to know, beside the common Edition, wherein the genuine Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> are fouly depraved, by a number of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Patches added unto his Purple by later hands: There is an ancient Latin Translation to be found in the Library of <hi>Caius</hi> Colledg in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg;</hi> which, although it be very rude, and corrupt, both in many other, and in this very same place also of the Epistle to the <hi>Magnesians,</hi> yet is it free from these Additaments, and in many respects to be preferred before the common Greek Copy, as well because it agreeth with the Citations of <hi>Eusebius, Athanasius,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret;</hi> and hath the Sentences vouched by them out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> (and particularly that of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> in the Epistle to the <hi>Smyrnians)</hi> which are not at all to be found in our Greek; and hath in a manner none of all those places in the true Epistles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> against which exception hath been taken by our Divines; which addeth great strength to those Exceptions of theirs, and sheweth that they were not made without good cause. Now in this Translation, there is nothing to be found touching the Sabbath, and the Lord's Day, in the Epistle to the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesians,</hi> but these words only; <hi>Non ampliûs sabbitazantes, sed secundùm Dominicam viventes, in quâ, &amp; vita nostra orta est:</hi> Whereunto these of our common Greek may be made answerable; <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note> All those other words alleadged by Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> (Part. 2. pag. 43.) to prove that <hi>Ignatius</hi> would have both the Sabbath and the Lord's Day observed, being afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by some later Grecian, who was afraid that the custom of keeping both days observed in his time, should appear otherwise to be directly opposite to the sentence of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whereas his main intention was to oppose the <hi>Ebio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> of his own time: who, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> witnesseth in the third Book of his Ecclesiastical History, did both keep the Sabbath with the Jews, and also <gap reason="foreign">

one of those that <hi>brought the prices of their Goods, and laid them down at the Apostles feet;</hi> as the universality of the observance may be gathered, by the Argument drawn from thence by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> towards the end of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Praises of <hi>Constantine,</hi> to prove the Preeminency of our Saviour Christ, above all the Gods of the Heathen; because this Prescript of his, touching the Celebration of this Day, was admitted and submitted unto; not within the Dominions of <hi>Constantine</hi> only, but also throughout the compass of the whole World: <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>I Should be glad to hear that your Grace had received, either from the <hi>Vaticane</hi> Library, or that of the <hi>Escurial</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> a Transcript of <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> or rather <hi>Hipparchus,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> So much the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in perusing of some of my <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> MSS. I have found some Observations, which may much conduce to the clearing of that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have not now leisure to send your Grace those which were made by the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Kôbah,</hi> and <hi>Kandahar,</hi> or those others, which were made by the <hi>Persians</hi> before <hi>Yezdegerd</hi>'s time, and by <hi>Yezdegerd,</hi> and long after him in <hi>Almamon</hi>'s time, as I find them mentioned by <hi>Alhashamy</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Author. Those of the <hi>Chatéans,</hi> and of <hi>Nassir Eddin,</hi> and of <hi>Aly Kôsgy,</hi> as later than the former, so exacter, I could not but send them to your Grace.</p>
                  <p>The true Solary Year,</p>

                  <p>According to <hi>Aly Kôsgy,</hi> who observed in the 841 Year of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> almost 200 Years after <hi>Nassir Eddin,</hi> 365 days 14′ 33″ 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, whereas <hi>Ptolemy</hi> is much more, 365 days 14′ 48″.</p>
                  <p>I have finished those <hi>Lemmata</hi> of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and if I be not deceived, such as wish well to the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks will think my Pains well bestowed: As indeed it was no small labour to correct the Diagrammes, and the Letters (which were too often perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the MS.) and sometimes to supply what was defective in the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration it self.</p>
                  <p>According to your Grace's advice, I have made a Persian Lexicon out of such words as I met with in the Evangelists, and in the Psalms, and in two or three Arabian and Persian Nomenclators. So that I have now a stock of above 6000 words in that Language, I think as many as <hi>Raphelengius</hi> hath in his Arabick Dictionary. Wherefore I have a greater mind than ever to go to <hi>Leyden,</hi> and peruse their Oriental Manuscripts, which were procured by the expence of the States, a thing which long since your Grace would have had me to have done. But yet considering my Lecture in <hi>Oxford</hi> (though as yet it cannot be read) it will not be fit for me to go without special leave from our Honourable Chancellor, and two or three more of the Lords of his Majesties Privy Council. I shall therefore desire your Grace to procure this Favour for me in writing, with this Caution, that my absence for a while may be no prejudice to me at home; especially since my Journey is for the improvement of Learning, and for the publishing of some of those Books, which I long since have finished. There I shall have an opportunity of printing your Grace's Map, and of perfecting and publishing that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Dr. <hi>Bainbrigg</hi> concerning the <hi>periodus Sothiaca:</hi> and I hope your
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:60492:243"/>
Grace will think of something else, in which I may be serviceable to you, and useful to the Commonwealth of Letters. Your Grace cannot sufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, whom by your many Favours you have ever made,</p>

                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN <hi>August</hi> last I did cursorily survey that Edition of <hi>Ignatius</hi> out of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Copy by <hi>Isaac Vossius,</hi> and found with content, what I look'd after with greediness, your Lordship's Judgment in discerning and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing the Genuine from the Spurious, confirmed by a new Testimony of that Antiquity and Authority, as few will hereafter dare to question, tho your Lordship's Reasons before were to me (and I doubt not to many others) of that moment, and the Conjecture built upon so good grounds, that (as <hi>Pliny</hi> says of <hi>Eratosthenes) puduit non credere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That your Lordship goes on in the same course, notwithstanding all the Opposition and Discouragements of the Times, as we cannot doubt but there remains a Blessing for your self, so it may (I am sure it ought) have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon us here below. The publication of the Martyrdoms of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> sure cannot be unseasonable; we are born to those times, <hi>quibus sirmare animum expedit constantibus exemplis.</hi> For my self, I cannot tell what account to make of my present Employment, I have many Irons in the Fire, but of no great consequence: I do not know how soon I shall be called to give up, and am therefore putting my House in order; digesting the confused Notes and Papers left me by several Predecessors, both in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity and Colledg; which I purpose to leave in a better method than I found them. At Mr. <hi>Patr. Young</hi>'s request I have undertaken the Collation of <hi>Constantines Geoponicks,</hi> with two MSS. in our publick Library, upon which I am forced to bestow some vac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nt hours. In our Colledg I am <hi>ex officio,</hi> to moderate Divinity-Disputations once a week. My honoured Friend Dr. <hi>Duck,</hi> has given me occasion to make some enquiry after the Law. And the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of an ingenious young Man (come lately from <hi>Paris)</hi> who has put up a private course of Anatomy, has prevailed with me to engage my self for his Auditor and Spectator upon three days a week, four hours each time. But this I do, <hi>ut explorator non ut transfuga.</hi> For tho I am not sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to engage my self in that great and weighty Calling of the Ministery after this new way, yet I would be loth to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as to Divinity: Tho I am very insufficient to make a Master-buider, yet I could help to bring in Materials from that publick store in our Library, to which I could willingly consecrate the remainder of my days, and count it no loss to be deprived of all other Accommodations, so I might be permitted to enjoy the liberty of my Conscience and Study in that place. But if there be such a price set upon the latter, as I cannot reach without pawning the former,

I am resolved, the Lord's Will be done. I shall in all conditions, be most desirous of the continuance of your Grace's Affection, and at this time more especially of your Prayers for him, who is</p>

                  <p>YEsterday I received your Letter, sent by Mr. <hi>Patrick Young;</hi> and thank you very much for your readiness in contributing your pains to the furtherance of my little Treatise, <hi>de Fidei Symbolis,</hi> which is now in the Press: I hold therein against <hi>Vossius,</hi> and the vulgar Opinion, that the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Creed, in our Common-Prayer Book, is indeed the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and not the <hi>Constantinopolitan:</hi> I mean the <hi>Nicene,</hi> as it is recited by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his <hi>Anchoratus,</hi> (p. 518. <hi>Edit. Graec. Basiliens.)</hi> a Book written seven Years before the Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was held, and yet therein both the Article of the Holy Ghost, and the others following, are recited <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which have been hitherto thought to have been added to the Symbol first by that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. If the <hi>Synodicon,</hi> which you think to have been written <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 583, have any thing touching the distinction of <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Constantinopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> Creed; I would willingly understand, and with what number your <hi>Synodicon</hi> is noted in the former disposition of the <hi>Baroccian</hi> Library, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which my Catalogue is framed.</p>
                  <p>In the first Tome of the <hi>Graeco-Latin.</hi> Edition of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 728 Page, there is a kind of Symbol: the first part whereof I find at the end of the Acts of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in <hi>Crabbes</hi> Edition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Fides Romanorum,</hi> that is, as I conceive it, <hi>Constantinopolitanorum.</hi> It is to be found also (if I remember aright) among the Manuscript Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> translated by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> in <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledg Library, in the first Edition of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his Works, and in <hi>Georgius Wicelius</hi> his <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chologium.</hi> By comparing of all which together, if I might get a right Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py thereof, it would do me some pleasure. It is also by some attributed to <hi>Athanasius;</hi> and happily may be that Symbol of his, differing from ours, which <hi>Cazanorius</hi> (or <hi>Czecanorius)</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Calvin,</hi> saith to be so common in the Moscovitical and Russian Churches, of whose Ecclesiastical Offices you have in the publick Library some Copies; by which we might understand the truth hereof. I will trouble you no further at this time, but rest,</p>

                     <salute>My Lord;</salute>

                  <p>I Received yours of the <hi>22d,</hi> upon the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and have bestowed the most part of the last Week in the search of those Particulars there mention'd. I am sorry the Event has not answered my Desires and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. I do not doubt but your Lordship will make good that Assertion of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, though I profess I yet look upon it with some prejudice, as being prepossessed with an anticipated Notion to the contrary. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in these Papers which I have collected in haste, do in the general look that way; upon perusal (if it be not too much trouble to your Lordship, and the time not overpast already) your Lordship will make the Consequence. In that <hi>Synodicon</hi> of <hi>Basilius Jalimbanensis,</hi> I met with nothing directly to the purpose; only in the beginning of the Book, this enclosed of <hi>Germanus de sex Synodis.</hi> What he says of the two first, as only to the purpose, I have transcribed. In each of them is mention of a Symbol, but not of the difference. I have in the same Argument sent to—and confronted two pieces of <hi>Photius,</hi> the one out of his Epistles, the other I met with in a Copy of his <hi>Nomocanon,</hi> with <hi>Balsamon</hi>'s <hi>Scholia,</hi> much larger than the printed. I have looked upon that in <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and compared it with that in <hi>Crab,</hi> which he calls <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Romanorum,</hi> and do readily subscribe, that by <hi>Romanorum</hi> must be meant the Eastern Church; but then he that made that Title, must be supposed to have writ since the division of the Empire. In <hi>Magd.</hi> Coll. Library, I spent two days in search after <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s Translation by <hi>Ruffin,</hi> but in vain, I do not find they have any such Book: What seem'd next like it, was some pieces of <hi>Basil</hi> of <hi>Ruffin</hi>'s Translation; at the end whereof there is indeed a part of his Exposition on the Creed. While I was there tumbling amongst their Books, I light upon an old English Comment upon the Psalms, the Hymns of the Church, and <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s Creed, which I presently conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured (though there be no Name to it) to be <hi>Wickliffs;</hi> and comparing the beginning with <hi>Bale,</hi> found that I had not erred in the Conjecture, and therefore writ this piece out, in which he calls the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, the <hi>Creed of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I remember, two Years ago, when I had an opportunity to read some Saxon Books that had formerly (as I suppose) belonged to the Church of <hi>Worcester;</hi> I met twice with the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed in Saxon; but I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any difference from that we use. I have sought in the ancientest Editions of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> but return with a <hi>non est inventus. Wicelius</hi> we have not; and for the <hi>Russian</hi> Offices, if I can find any thing, you shall have it by the next.</p>

                     <pb n="514" facs="tcp:60492:245"/>
I presume you have already a Copy of that old Latin Creed, at the end of the ancient Copy of the Acts, given by my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and therefore I forbore to send it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gulasius,</hi> in the Acts of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, brings in the Philosopher disputing against the Holy Ghost, as well as against the Son; and that may be (as far as the authority of the Author will bear) somewhat to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>I received my Copy of the Arch-bishops of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and do return unto your Grace with thanks, that Oration of <hi>Himerius</hi> which I had from your Lordship.</p>
                  <p>The Papers which I send, are somewhat confused, and some not right writ I fear; some my Boy has left in the Publick Library, and the Carrier will be gone before the Library be open. I have in the Margent thus * marked what I conceive your Grace may possibly make use of.</p>
                  <p>I am very much straitned in time, and therefore desire your Lordship's favour for thus scribling. I am,</p>

                  <p>SInce my last (this day seven-night) I have enquired (and I do here send you what I met with) concerning the use of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Russians,</hi> which I conceive full to your purpose. I perceive my haste made me then omit at sealing, that Oration of <hi>Himerius,</hi> which I now return with thanks to your Lordship; and perhaps, by mistake, I might send some other Papers no way pertinent.</p>
                  <p>I have thought sometimes, and have not yet found any sufficient reason to remove me from that Opinion, That notwithstanding what <hi>Vossius</hi> hath said, the Church was never without some Form of Confession, which they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before they admitted any to Baptism. I know not otherwise how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. For though <hi>Vossius</hi> affirm no more to have been required, but barely, <hi>In nomina Patris, Filii, &amp; Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus sancti;</hi> yet methinks that of <hi>Repentance from dead Works,</hi> of <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Dead,</hi> and <hi>everlasting Judgment,</hi> are made parts of those Fundamental Doctrines; and <hi>Faith in God</hi> seems to comprehend the rest. To this purpose I conceive <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> Apolog. 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 93. speaks for the Requisites to Baptism, in the Practice of the Church in his Time; <gap reason="foreign">

Wherein (if it were not written, we may suppose it capable of more) we may be content to bear with some in words, so long as they bear up to the same sense, considering that the Quotations of those most ancient Writers out of Scripture it self, are made with so much liberty; and yet no Man doubts but they had a much more certain Rule to go by. I am again overtaken by the Time, and with the desire of your Lordship's Prayers, and the continuance of your Love and Encouragement, take leave, and rest,</p>

The King of <hi>France</hi> hath as much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Church-Businesses, as the King of <hi>England</hi> claims, so far as I can perceive. Among the Doctors of the faculty of Divinity of <hi>Paris</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> is but a little part) here be divers that are not for the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Church; but such a certainty of an inferior degree, as yet for the Authority of the Church and her Pastors, we are all bound to submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; a Point I think very well gained, and of good consequence. <hi>David Blundell</hi>'s last Book about Episcopacy, is much cried up by those of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion: who are generally very sharp against our English Hierarchy, upon the Credit of Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> and <hi>Bastwick</hi>'s Papers and such like Testimonies. I hope your Grace will vindicate your Order in general, and in particular the Credit of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles, against his Exceptions; as I hear young <hi>Vossius</hi> in part hath done; but I have not yet seen the Book. That which is my great Comfort, my young Master is his Fathers Son, and peremptorily constant to the Principles wherein he was bred, which makes me hope that our Posterity may yet see the Sun shine again.

Lordship may see by those two Translations in <hi>Grabb</hi> (followed by the rest) and that of <hi>Justellus,</hi> in his <hi>Codex Can. Ecclesiae Universae,</hi> pag. 2. which runs thus<hi>—Chorepiscopis non licere Presbyteros, vel Diaconos ordinare: Sed nec Presbyteris Civitatis, sine literis Episcopi, in alienâ Parochià aliquid agere:</hi> Where <hi>Justellus</hi> adds these two last words <hi>[Aliquid agere]</hi> as if <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Upon which I should not doubt to build, that this is the same <hi>Robert,</hi> the deflorator of <hi>Marianus</hi> mentioned by <hi>Malmesbury</hi> (though the historical part be here wanting) the Name, the Time, the Place, the Subject, all concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to strengthen this Conjecture.</p>
                  <p>This, and somewhat more concerning <hi>Marianus,</hi> either in my Letters, or Papers, I have formerly transmitted to my good Friend Dr. <hi>Duck;</hi> from whom, if your Lordship think it may be <hi>tanti,</hi> you may at any time recieve those indigested Notes, which being bur ordinary, will add nothing to your Lordship, in a Point which you have already so thoroughly canvassed.</p>
                  <p>The second enquiry which your Lordship was pleased to employ me in, was (as I remember) about a Greek Piece concerning <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Months, in the Catalogue of the King of <hi>France</hi> his Library; but upon search not found by the <hi>Puteani Fratres.</hi> I conceived then, the best direction for the search, would be to note what other Tract were next Neighbours, in the Catalogue, which might be a means to help me with that Volumn, in which surely this concerning the Months makes the least part: Which I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done hereunder. And becuase, upon perusal of the Catalogue, I found it very corrupt, and that the Writer is guilty of many obvious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, I conceived this of ours to be only a Transcript of some other, which possibly may be there in the Library; and therefore I took the pains to page our Catalogue, as hoping that might expedite the search, if the Enquirer make use of any other Catalogue of the same kind with this, by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proportion of Pages, whereof this contains in all 280, and is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly writ. I find several Pieces of that Subject, how diverse in themselves I know not; but I chose rather to set down all, than to run the hazard of omitting what possibly you might most desire.</p>

                  <p>I Have lately read Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> the late Dean of <hi>Laghlin,</hi> his <hi>Exomologesis,</hi> who in his <hi>27th</hi> Chapter, pag. 178. informs, That <hi>in his hearing one of the most learned Protestant Prelats in the King of</hi> England<hi>'s Dominions</hi> (quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Grace in the Margent) <hi>professed, That whereas he had had, of many Years before, a design to publish the New Testament in Greek, with various Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Annotations; and for that purpose had used great diligence, and spent much Mony to furnish himself with Manuscripts and Memoires,</hi> &amp;c. I humbly desire to be informed from your Lordship how much of Truth there is in that Report; and whether you collated the Manuscripts in our Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Library I have in some part made enquiries upon some suspected or doubtful places, and it was in my thoughts to have gone through the whole; which if by your Lordship's pains, or means, it hath been done already, I should be loth, <hi>actum agere.</hi> Together with the Greek, I would have compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

that venerable Latin Manuscript of the four Gospels in the <hi>Bodlean,</hi> which is writ in fair large Letters, (partly Saxon) in a continued order, without distinction of words; which seems to promise some considerable variety: for I find in <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. after the words, <hi>Sicut filius hominis non venit ministrari sed ministrate, &amp; dare animam suam redemptionem pro multis;</hi> these added, (I know not whether, according to any other Greek or Latin Copy) <hi>Vos autem quaetitis de modico crescere, &amp; de minimo minui.</hi> I would likewise willingly know whether your Lordship be not of opinion (as I profess I am) that the additional Passage (which <hi>Robert Stephens</hi> says he found in two of the most ancient Manuscripts, and <hi>Beza</hi> in one of those which he used) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Man whom our Saviour is said to have seen working upon the Sabbath, &amp; <hi>c.

I do not expect your Lordship should undergo so much trouble, as to give me any account in writing; but I have taken this occasion, to mention so much of my own desires, hoping when I shall wait upon your Lordship in Person, to receive that satisfaction in these, as I have done in others of this kind.

                  <p>I Read over your Book with no small admiration, both of the infiniteness of the pains which you have taken, and the exactness of the judgment which you have shewed therein. The only thing I could wish is, that the accurate Tractate of the Gnostic Heresy, should come out apart in a Disserta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by its self, without any reference to the Argument of your other main Discourse; for howsoever the occasion of bringing it in be not unapt, yet the application of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Prophecy thereunto, is not like to find such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance in the reformed Churches beyond the Sea, that I should desire the principal Argument in hand might be adventured in the same Bottom with the other.</p>
                  <p>The varieties of the Readings of the New Testament, out of the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg</hi> Copies, I have sent unto you; but those out of the <hi>Oxford</hi> ones (wherein your self had a chief hand) I can by no means find, and do much fear that they were plundred, among my other Books and Papers, by the rude Welch in <hi>Glamorganshire.</hi> Yet instead thereof I have sent unto you, the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>IT is an extraordinary comfort to me, in the midst of my Troubles, to hear, not only of your Grace's Health, which I am bound daily to pray for, but that you should be so affected with the hearing of mine.</p>
                  <p>I never shall forget the Favours which you were pleased to shew me in <hi>Bristol;</hi> and though these silly Things of mine are far unworthy of your judicious perusal, yet I choose rather to lay open mine own weakness, than disobey the least of your desires.</p>
                  <p>For the Resolution of Spherical Triangles, I take the Sextant of any Circle; this I divide into 90 equal Parts, and suppose each Part a Degree; by this means I keep always <hi>(in Circulis Maximis)</hi> the same Radius that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with; and the length of that Radius is always the measure of a Right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. This course I find to be the most speedy for practice, though for the measuring of other Arches and Angles, the Scale is not to be trusted, but use is to be made of the common Rules of Trigonometrical Calculation.</p>
                  <p>Touching my Treatise of Eclipses, I know how far it is from perfection; for want of better Authors, my Grounds are for the most part taken out of <hi>Calvisius,</hi> whose Rules (of any that I have seen) I find to be the most compendious: but the exemplification of his Rules is extreamly misprinted in many places. In his first Table, upon which many of the following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, there is an overfight committed by himself;</p>

they have cost me no little labour, and I have never another Copy of them if these should happen to miscarry. If I forget not, you made mention of one <hi>Mullerus,</hi> (whose Works I never had a sight of); I would fain know whether it be not the same <hi>Mollerus,</hi> whose <hi>Tabulae Phrisicae</hi> I find thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended (how justly I cannot say) in <hi>Calvisius, A Mundi,</hi> 3178, 3963, and 4283.

But I trespass too far upon your patience, to trouble you so long about these Trifles. To make some Recompence, I have sent up with them that elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Work of the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury;</hi> which being committed to my charge, your Grace has done me unspeakable favour to undertake the publishing of it. I send the Book it self, which my Lord left with me to be printed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that I shewed you at <hi>Bristol,</hi> which was but a Transcript out of this. The weakness of my Body, and other Troubles which now lie heavy on me, will not permit me to attend upon the printing; my hope is, you will find some Divine there at hand, that will look to preserve it from the Errors of the Press. The short answer of his unto the French Divines, (which I found scattered amongst his Papers) is sent up in the Book; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to your Grace's Judgment, whether it be fit to be added or omitted in the Impression. If Dr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Works, touching the same Subject, may come forth together in one Volume, I believe it will be no less agreeable to the mind of the deceased Authors, than grateful to the sight of surviving Posterity.

                  <p>MAY it please your Grace to give me leave, since in these Times I come not to <hi>London,</hi> to tender my most humble Duty to you in this Paper-fashion. I most humbly thank your Grace for mentioning me to Mr. <hi>Cudworth:</hi> who, as his Name also promiseth, is a young Man of good worth; and so, had he liv'd (when the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> lately flourished under your Grace's Primacy) furnished with such Abilities, no wonder if you had called him into that then flourishing Kingdom, as were many more of his Parts and Merits. Your Grace was pleased to ask him what I was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. My Lord, I cannot spend my time better, than after the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in gathering your Lordship's Observations upon many obscure Texts of the Bible; but by my constant attending on my Lectures, I am prevented of doing what I otherwise might. <hi>Sir Henry Spelman</hi>'s Saxon Lecture, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by your Lordship's first motion to the Heads of Houses, (and have I not cause to admire God's Providence, as my Lord of <hi>Exeter</hi> told me, that the Work should be countenanced by so transcendent Patronage) hath
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:60492:261"/>
made me your Grace's Scholar; as in truth the <hi>Ecclesiae ipsae Britannicae Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versae</hi> at this time are. But, my Lord, pardon my boldness, and give me leave to chalenge the Stile, if not of Scholar, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, since I never counted my self worthy to wait on your Person, yet a true admirer of all your Lordship's most rich Treasures, now, in your most learned Writings bequeathed to the Church; but my Saxon Imploiment will bind me much to be acquainted with your <hi>Primordia Eccles. Britannicarum;</hi> tho your Grace will pity my Condition, as being not able to compass the use of those rare Manuscripts cited in that most rich Magazine; yet I am glad that we have many excellent and rare Antiquities there at large cited to us. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, two Years since, to send Mr. <hi>Hartlib</hi> a Specimen of my Intentions, and beginnings of a Confutation of the <hi>Alcoran:</hi> It was according to my poor skill, a discovery of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s, and his Chaplains devilish Policy, to raze out of the Faith of the Eastern People, the memory of the Three Persons, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Glory be to God, the Lord of the World, &amp;c.</hi> for this intent, to square out a Platform of Faith easy for all the World to believe, that so he and his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Chalifs, may gain such a false believing and seduced World to the infernal See of <hi>Meccha;</hi> and that was his meaning in binding all to pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Meccha.</hi> Had I Skill, and Means, and Encouragement from your Grace, I would endeavour to make some progress in the same Work: not but that I know many in this Kingdom far more able than my self, but that I fear none of them will attempt it, but rather smile at the Design. The Language of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> to write in that stile, may be attained; the matter of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may be easy to any that will attend to the wicked Plots of Apostates, then, and ever, practised in the World. But Mr. <hi>Hartlib</hi> returned my Papers, and told me they were not, or else my Intention, was not approved. I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posedly was desirous to be ignorant who should give this severe Censure, lest they should think I should grieve thereat. Mr. <hi>Hartlib,</hi> I thank him, did me the pleasure as to conceal it from me. I could scarce keep my self from some such Imployment about the <hi>Alchoran;</hi> but these Times call us now to other Thoughts: The fear of losing the <hi>Univers.</hi> as well as <hi>Regnum, &amp; Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> doth not a little amaze us. When a Messenger comes hither from your Grace, I shall be glad to be informed by him, wherein I may best, in this <hi>Lambeth</hi> Library, be serviceable, and express my bounden Duty to your Lordship. The Lord still add to the number of your Days, to the comfort of the afflicted <hi>Britain</hi> Churches, which, next to God, cast their Eyes upon you in these sad Extremities which they have already suffered.</p>

                     <hi>To the most Reverend, and his much honoured Lord and Patron,</hi> James <hi>Lord Arch-bishop of</hi> Armagh, <dateline>

                  <p>I Have at last return'd, what I intended to have brought to your Lordship, those two pieces of <hi>British</hi> Antiquities which your Lordship was pleased to impart to me, and whereof I have taken Copies, and may possibly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after give some better account than as yet I can; I mean, as to that of <hi>Vale Crucis.</hi> As for the other, unless the Characters can be more exactly taken from the Original, I give for desperate. What Character the ancient <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> used, whether that which the <hi>Saxons</hi> after, as your Lordship (if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well) is of Opinion, or the same with your ancient <hi>Irish</hi> (which I conceive to be not much different from the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and to which this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But the Characters are in the Manuscript much more elegant and neat than I could express.</p>
                  <p>What I said of an Irish Saxon Character, I am bold to call it so, because I find it used in our old Irish Chronicle, and some other Latin pieces of good Note and Antiquity, writ, if not in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet by an Irish hand: In which kind I have met with <hi>Chalcidius</hi> his Translation of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Timaeus;</hi> and, I think, a Dialogue of his own about the State of the Soul after Death, both for the Matter and Stile somewhat remarkable, but imperfect. We have two Copies of the Acts of <hi>Sylvester</hi> in Manuscript Latin, in our Publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary; one in a good old Book, which was sometime the Passional of the Monastery of <hi>Ramesey;</hi> in which those Acts are divided into two Books. The other Copy is one continued Story; the Book in which it is found, is of a good fair Hand, well bound, gilt Leaves, and has been perused by <hi>John Leland,</hi> whose notes occur <hi>sparsim</hi> in the Margin, besides his Tetrastich at the beginning of the Book, which containing the Lives of divers Saints, and in the first of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> by <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> occasioned these Verses from him.</p>

                  <p>I Have here made bold to send you my Sufferings on the back-side of the Prayer; and I desire that your return to <hi>London</hi> may be hastned, if it may stand with your own conveniency; for if you had not been so wholly taken up with Printing and Preaching, truly, my Lord, I would have been bold to have taken your advice in some Points of Learning. And now you are in the Country, I suppose you are at best leasure, but you want your Library; yet I doubt not the good Lady with whom you are (God reward and bless her for being such a Nursing-Mother) hath many good English Books; and I suppose, amongst others, you may find Bishop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi>'s Sermons; I pray peruse that Sermon at <hi>Easter,</hi> upon this Text, <hi>If any one will be contentious, we have no such custom;</hi> and then let me know whether any Man did ever speak more for <hi>Traditions,</hi> than he doth there for <hi>Customs,</hi> both which words are the same in effect. Then how many things there are in the old Law, whereof we have no Scripture but only Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then, I pray, let me have your Opinion of <hi>Torniellus,</hi> I have read him over; though I have forgotten much, yet I remember he shows some defects. And, I pray, let me know when the Kingdoms of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> were divided, upon the death of <hi>Solomon,</hi> whether the Power of the High Priest were acknowledged in both Kingdoms alike, until <hi>Israel</hi> fell to Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>I will trouble your Grace no further at this time; if you please to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn any answer, I pray let it be left at the House where you were, and once within a fortnight my Servant shall call there. So desiring that we

may remember each other in our Prayers, I commit you to God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and rest,</p>

                  <p>I Was with Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> after I had been with your Grace; whom upon some intimation of my present Condition and Necessities, I found so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as that he did not only presently furnish me with a very considerable Sum, but was so free and forward in his Expressions, as that I could not find in my heart to tell him much (somewhat I did) of my purpose of selling, lest it might sound as a further pressing upon him, of whom I had already received so much. Neither indeed will I now sell so much as I intended; for I did not think (besides what I have in the Country) to keep any at all that would yield any Mony. Now I shall, and among them, those Manuscripts I spoke of to your Grace, and <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Epistles particularly; the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I make use of it in my <hi>de Cultu Dei,</hi> (the first part whereof your Grace hath seen) which I think will shortly be printed. As for my Father's Papers, I do seriously desire to dispose of them some way, if I can, to my best advantage, but with a respect to their preservation and safety. Which I think would be, if some Library, either here, or beyond the Seas, had them. I pray, good my Lord, help me in it if you can: and when you have an opportunity, conser with Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> about it. I will shortly (within these few weeks, God willing) send a Note to your Grace of what I have that is considerable, and will part with. Not but that I had much rather keep them, had I any hopes at all, ever to be accommodated with Books, and Leasure to fit them for publick use my self. But that I have no hopes of; and certainly so disposed of as I would have them in my life time, they will be safer than in my keeping, in that condition I am. It would be a great ease to my mind, to see that well done, for I have always reckoned of them as of my Life; and if any mischance should come to them whilst they are in my keeping, (and indeed they have been in danger more than once, since this my tumbling condition) I should never have any comfort of my Life.</p>
                  <p>I have sent your Grace the <hi>Jerome,</hi> that you may see it; and if you desire to keep it by you, I shall humbly crave a Note of it under your Grace's hand.</p>

                  <p>SI non plane ignores eruditionem et magnitudiem CHRISTINAE, dubitare non possis, vir Reverendissime, opus tuum Chronologicum longe ei fuisse gratissimum. Bidui tantum effluxit spatium quod id ad manus ejus pervenerit, plurimum vero praeteriit temporis, ut existimo, ex quo nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ei tam carum contigit munus. Placuit ei supramodum, cum ipsius ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ordo &amp; oeconomia, tum etiam illud quod res Aegyptiacas &amp; Asiaticas à nemine hactenus in unum redactas, diligenter adeò &amp; copiose tradideris. Vidit &amp; ex parte jam pervolvit alia nonnulla scripta quae jam olim in lucem protrusisti; vel ex iis solis ingenium &amp; doctrinam tuam satis perspicere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuisset, etiamsi nemo alius nominis tui praedicator accessisset: nunc vero cum &amp; literis et munere tuum erga se animum fueris testatus, mirum quoque in modum auctus est ejus erga te affectus &amp; benevolentia. Voluit itaque ut tibi suo nomine gratias agerem quam maximas, hortarerque praeterea hoc te argumentum persequi &amp; ad nostra usque tempora, si otium &amp; occasio per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteret, perducere. Sed tamen cum norit esse hoc opus maximi &amp; temporis &amp; laboris, non minus forsan gratum feceris, si ea antiquorum scripta, quae ad illustrationem historiae Ecclesiasticae pertinent, &amp; qualia te multa habere intellexît Serenissima Regina prius in lucem emiseris. Legit illa non sine max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ima voluptate Acta illa de Polycarpo quae Ignatianis tuis adfixisti: Nunc vero quod alia ejus generis plura à te exspectet, facit Bibliotheca tua recepta, quam flammis esse absumtam constans jam olim ad nos detulerat rumor. Multum itaque &amp; tibi &amp; literis gratulatur, quod tam insignis thesaurus salvus ad te sit reversus, postulatque, ut si quae in ea rarioris generis scripta exstent, id efficias, perire posthac ne possint; id quod nonerit metuendum, si ea publici feceris juris. Jussit me praeterea petere à te Catalogum meliorum codicum manu exaratorum, qui in tua adservantur Bibliotheca, praesertim si Graeci sint aut Latini: quem ego perlibenter te missurum esse existimo. Gratissimum quoque erit Serenissimae Reginae si una transmiseris indicem manuscriptorum qui in Cotoniana &amp; Regia exstant Bibliothecis. Diu est quod de Seldeno &amp; Patricio Junio nulli omnino huc perlati sunt nuntii: Eorum virorum studi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ex animo favet Regina. In Patricium vero si quid Reginae nostrae esset juris, non tamdiu textus ille Bibliorum Graecus in tenebris delitesceret. Sed non cuique contingit doctis parere dominis. Peto autem ut si fieri possit quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primum transmittas indices eos quos te postulari. Amabit te Regina plurimum ubi cognoverit te non minus promtum esse in praestandis quam offerendis officiis. De me vero ita habeas velim ita me erga te ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum, uti debet esse is, quem tu tot tantisque obstrinxeris beneficiis.

                  <p>BY Mr: <hi>Hartlib</hi>'s Letter of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 21. I understand, that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Copy of my Treatise against <hi>Capellus;</hi> which by the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Friend I had sent him for your Lordship; and that you had been pleased to take the pains, to send him an Extract of that part of my Letter which concerned him; for which I heartily thank your Grace. By his last Letter before, he sent me a Note from you, whereby you desired me to consult the Original of <hi>Georgius Syncellus</hi> his Chronicle, for to know whether to <hi>Simon</hi> the Son of <hi>Onias,</hi> nine Years are given, or nineteen. I have done so, and to my great wonderment find, neither the one nor the other, but twenty Years assigned to that High Priest; the Author's own words being such as follow.</p>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not seen the original Manuscript; but I dare assure your Lordship, that the Copy out of which I have transcribed these Parcels, is as authentical as it self; as having been transcribed by <hi>Peter Goartus,</hi> a Dominican Friar, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously known by his Edition of <hi>Codinus Curopalata,</hi> and his most learned Notes upon him. This Man, at the request of some eminent Persons there, (wearied with the endless delays of <hi>Altinus,</hi> and despairing of ever getting this Copy for the Press, but upon such terms as they liked not of) hath with his own hands transcribed the whole Work of <hi>Syncellus</hi> and <hi>Theophanes,</hi> and added thereunto, <hi>interpretationem latinam per columnas, cum annotationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus fusissimis ac pereruditis in omnes locos difficiliores.</hi> And he assureth me upon his Honour, that as all along he hath had a singular care not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any the least Error in transcribing, so in the passage in question he hath used an extraordinary attention, because of several remarkable defects in it. For besides the omission of the two High Priests, and the giving of <hi>Jesus filius Sirach</hi> for a High Priest, (who never was so, as is well enough known) there is a Fault in the <hi>Anni Mundi</hi> of the said <hi>Jesus Sirach,</hi> where 5408 are
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:60492:267"/>
given in lieu of 5402: For to 5382, the Year of the World wherein <hi>Simon</hi> begun his Priesthood, being added, the 20 Years that <hi>Simon</hi> served his place, it cometh to 5402, and not to 5408.</p>
                  <p>How these Faults may have been occasioned, and how in probability they are to be corrected, <hi>Goartus</hi> sheweth at large in his Annotations: of which part of them, and of any other, as of any thing in the Text of <hi>Syncellus</hi> and <hi>Theophanes,</hi> he is very willing to let your Grace have a Copy if you shall desire it; he being indeed one of the most kind affable and serviceable Men that ever I have had to do withal in that kind. So as it is a thousand pities that here is not a Copy of your <hi>Annales,</hi> for to bestow it upon him: of which I judg him so worthy, that rather than he should go without it, I would bestow mine own Copy upon him, if I had it still. But a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went to <hi>Goartus</hi> about your Commission (that being the first time that ever I saw him) Friar <hi>Cressy</hi> got that from me; who having seen it with me, and borrowed it of me, was so exceedingly in love with it, as I could not be quiet till I bestowed it upon him.</p>
                  <p>I have sent your <hi>Syriack</hi> Treatise of <hi>Ephrem,</hi> as likewise your <hi>Kimchii Radices Hebraicae;</hi> of which Book, although I have as much use as ever, and shall have as long as God giveth me life and opportunity in my Studies (in which the illustrating the Hebrew Text holdeth the chief place with me) yet I thought it unreasonable to detain it any longer from you, having had it so many Years already.</p>
                  <p>That breach in Popery about Grace, groweth wider and wider every day; and whereas hitherto <hi>Jansenism</hi> hath contained it self within <hi>France</hi> (where most part of the Prelats and Sorbonists are addicted to it) and the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> now it hath found entrance into <hi>Spain,</hi> and among the very Jesuits, those eager opposers of it; one of whom having written a Book in defence of it, the University of <hi>Salamanca</hi> gave their approbation to it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the amplest and most solemn manner; and at the same time caused pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to be burnt a Treatise written by the Jesuits, against a little Jansenical Book, published here at <hi>Paris,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Catechisme de la Grace:</hi> And having sent the Jesuit to <hi>Rome,</hi> with their Letters to the Pope, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his Person and his Book, he hath there very boldly asserted his Writing before the Pope and the Cardinals; and in the manner, as they (although hitherto professed and bitter Enemies of that Doctrine) could find no Exceptions against him. Which hath made those of his Order such bitter Enemies to him, as they have secretly made him away; out of which Fact great Troubles are like to follow: for the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> both, upon complaint made to them, have injoined the Jesuits to produce that Colleague of theirs, alive or dead, upon pain of their highest Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: Which News having been first told me by others, was confirmed to me by Mr. <hi>Cressey</hi> for a certain Truth. Thus humbly taking leave of your Grace, and praying God to add many and happy Years to your Life, in the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation whereof the Church of God hath so great an interest, I rest,</p>

Testamenti.</hi> As for the other Copy of your <hi>Annales,</hi> that for Friar <hi>Goart;</hi> I delivered it him within two days after, and he expressed a great deal of sence of the savour which you have done him in it. He gave me also an Extract about the Priesthood of <hi>Simon Onia,</hi> and told me, that <hi>Syncellus</hi> with his Notes is begun now to be printed, and will be done by the
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:60492:268"/>
end of this year. He told me also of the Latin Translation of an Arabian Chronologer (who lived above 400 years ago, and hath writ the Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy <hi>ab initio Mundi ad suam aetatem,</hi> with an extraordinary exactness of supputation) newly printed here; of which I intend, God willing, to send you a Copy, together with those Books formerly desired by you, at <hi>Ellis</hi> his next return thither, which he maketh me believe will be within these two or three weeks.</p>
                  <p>The Disputes and Animosities between the Jansenists and the Molinists, do grow hotter and hotter every day; and lately some Irish-men here having been busy to get Subscriptions of their Country-men, in prejudice of <hi>Janseniana Dogmata;</hi> they have been sharply censured for it by a Decree of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, a printed Copy whereof you will receive by <hi>Ellis.</hi>

                     <hi>Capell</hi> hath written an Apologetical Epistle to you, in answer to mine Epistle against him, and somewhat about the same bulk; the which being not only fraught with most injurious Language against me, but taxing your Grace of rashness and injustice, for having condemned his Opinion upon my Relation: I have writ an additional Sheet to my former Treatise, in vindication of your Grace, and of my self; the writing and printing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of having been dispatched in the space of three days, <hi>ne impune velitaret ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninum illud scriptum:</hi> I am now going to write, <hi>Justum volumen, sub titulo Vindiciarum sacri Textus Hebraici, contra Morinum &amp; Capellum junctim, in quo scripto omnes Criticae Errores, ut &amp; scriptorum Morini, ad vivum persequar.</hi> For these here, who vaunted of their intention of writing against <hi>Capel,</hi> have all given over; and <hi>Buxtorf</hi> too will make no full answer to his <hi>Critica;</hi> as you may see by the following Extract of his Letter to me, dated 3 <hi>Januarii.</hi> 
                     <q>Vindiciae meae directe opponentur ejus Defensioni, sed methodicae erunt &amp; planae, atque in capita distinctae.

                  </p>
                  <p>I have printed just as many Copies of the said Sheet, as of the <hi>Epistola</hi> it self, for to send an equal number of it, as of the Epistle, to all the Places where I have sent the other; so as a great many of them shall go into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by <hi>Ellis.</hi> In the mean while, that you may not stay too long for it, I send you a Copy of it here inclosed, and shall be very glad to have your Grace's Judgment about it.

                  </opener>
                  <p>IN performance of your Request, and my Promise, I have at last sent you the <hi>Annales</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> as out of the ancient Copy which you saw with me; I did faithfully translate them into the English Tongue, as near as I could, word by word; wherein (knowing my weakness) I laboured not so much to render a sweet harmony of Speech, as the plain and simple Phrase of that Age wherein it was written; which I thought would best please you, tho happily with others it will not so well relish; be pleased to receive it as a Token from him that honours your Worth: as you read it, I pray you correct it, for I know it hath need. There was a Leaf wanting in my Book, which defect <hi>(viz.</hi> from <hi>An.</hi> 900, to <hi>An.</hi> 950.) and some Passages besides, I was fain to make up out of other ancient Copies; whereof though we have many in <hi>Wales,</hi> yet but few that agree <hi>verbatim</hi> one with another. And I believe some Mistakings will be found in the Times of some Transactions in this Book, if they be narrowly examined, as in the very Frontispiece of this Author we find, in most Copies, that <hi>Cadwalader</hi> went to <hi>Rome An.</hi> 680, or the Year after, as it is in my Copy. Nevertheless it is confessed and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all of them, that the great Mortality hapned in that Year that he went to <hi>Rome;</hi> but I find no mention of any extraordinary mortality of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that happened about <hi>Anno</hi> 680, and therefore I think it is not very likely that <hi>Cadwalader</hi>'s going to <hi>Rome</hi> was deferred to that Year. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> and other ancient Writers, do affirm, that the great Mortality fell <hi>Anno</hi> 664, about the <hi>22d</hi> Year of King <hi>Oswis</hi> Reign over <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in whose Time <hi>Cadwalader</hi> lived and reigned; as is manifest in the Tract which is added to some Copies of <hi>Nennius</hi> (if I may give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to that corrupt Copy of it which I have) in the words following: <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid filius Edelfrid regnavit</hi> 28. <hi>An. &amp; sex mensibus, dum ipse regnabat, venit mortalitas hominum, Catqualater regnante apud Brittones post patrem suum, &amp; in ea periit.</hi> This Evidence doth perswade with me, that <hi>Cadwalader</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> far before <hi>Anno</hi> 680. But if <hi>in ea periit</hi> be meant of <hi>Cadwalader,</hi> for King <hi>Oswi</hi> ruled five or six Years after, unless we grant that the Plague endured twelve Years, as our Welch Historians do aver, it maketh such a breach in the History, that I (for my own part) know not how to repair it: for if it be true that <hi>Cadwalader</hi> died of that Plague, then went he not to <hi>Rome;</hi> and to deny his going to <hi>Rome,</hi> is no less than to deny the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all our British and Welch Antiquities in general: Therefore I desire you will vouchsafe, not only to give me your sense of <hi>Cadwalader</hi>'s going to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Time, (whereby I may rest better satisfied then at present) but also the loan of your best Copy of <hi>Nennius,</hi> with that Tract before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is added to some Copies thereof. And if I be not overtrouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to your patience already, I have another Request unto you, which is, that you will select all the Notes and Histories you have, that treat of the Affairs of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Princes thereof; and that you will candidly impart them unto me by degrees; as I shall have done with one piece, so be pleased to lend another, and you may command any thing that I have, or can come by; for it is not Labour, Pains, or expence of Mony (to my power) shall
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:60492:269"/>
retard me in your Service. My Love and Zeal to my poor Country, and desire to know the truth and certainty of things past, moves me sometimes to a passion, when I call to mind the idle and slothful Life of my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who in the revolution of 1000 Years almost, afford but only <hi>Caradoc Llancarvan,</hi> and the continuance thereof, to register any thing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Acts of the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> that I could come by, or hear of, (some few piecemeals excepted). Dr. <hi>Powel</hi> in his Latin History of the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> citeth <hi>Tho. Maclorius, de Regibus Gwynethiae;</hi> but I could not hitherto meet with that Book, and I am perswaded he lived not much before <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>6th</hi>'s Time, peradventure you have seen it: and I do not remember that he citeth any other Author of our Country-men; it may be there are some extant yet, though I had not the felicity hitherto to see them. I hope, by your good means hereafter, I shall attain to some hidden know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Antiquity: but I am too tedious, pardon me I pray you. Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father, think of my Request, and put me not off with Excuses any longer, and my Prayer shall be for your Health, Peace, and Prosperity in this World, and everlasting Felicity in the World to come.</p>

Argenteus ille codex membranaceus, qui quatuor Evangelia aureis &amp; argenteis literis Gothicè descripta continebat, ad Werdeni sive Werdinensis Monasterii Bibliothecam pertinuit, in regione Bergensi quatuor fere à Coloniâ Germanicis miliaribus distantis. Inde ex vi<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Matthaei, &amp; i<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Marci capitulo ab Arnoldo Mercatore nonnulla descripta, Inscriptionum suarum Corpori (pag. 147 &amp; 158.) inseruit Gruterus.

                  <p>ON <hi>Saturday</hi> last there went away from hence, for <hi>Galais</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> the Lady <hi>Bannatire,</hi> in whose House I live here; by whom I sent you a <hi>Pugio Fidei,</hi> and a <hi>Chronicon Orientale</hi> (the first whereof costeth ten Franks, and the other six); as likewise an Extract of the <hi>Obelisci</hi> and <hi>Asterisci Membranarum Sardoianarum;</hi> the which being a Work of much more Time and Pains, than I was able in my present condition to bestow upon it; I was fain to hire Mr. <hi>Coque,</hi> your Professor of the Greek Tongue, for to do it; who would have done it for five Franks (and not under) If I would have been content with the bare transcription of the Obelisks and Asterisks out of the Membranes. But to compare them all along with the Roman Edition, and out of the same to add every where the Chapters and the Verses, <hi>quorum nec vola nec vestigium in Membranis exstat (ubi omnia uno teno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re scripta extant, nullo ne inter voces quidem spatio aut discrimine relicto, quod immensum auget transcribendi molestiam);</hi> and without the marking whereof, I could not see how the Transcript would have been of any use to Mr. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;</hi> that he would not do for a penny less than twenty Franks, protesting, when he had done, that if it were to do again, he would not do it for dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Monies, as having been a whole sevennight busied with it, and found it incomparably more toilsome than he had imagined it. And although he be a very able Grecian, and wonderful diligent and faithful in what-ever he undertakes, yet I would not rely solely upon him, but compared every Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk and Asterisk of his transcription, (in which he hath made use of <hi>notae Paratheseon</hi> for the Obelisks, and of Sublineation in lieu of Asterisks) with the <hi>Membranae,</hi> for to be sure that all was right, and that he had no where exchanged one for the other. And I can give your Lordship an entire assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:60492:270"/>
that his Transcript agreeth most exactly with the Original, not only in marking the <hi>Obel</hi> and <hi>Aster;</hi> but in every word and syllable, <hi>ne vitiis quidem orthographicis, quae hic illic occurrunt, exceptis.</hi> The only Error committed by him, is, that he hath misplaced some Chapters of <hi>Deuter.</hi> the which nevertheless cannot be of any other prejudice to Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> than that of the transposing of a <hi>quaternio</hi> by a Bookbinder useth to be. He hath also in most places added, as I have desired him, <hi>quomodo Editio Romana se haberet quantum ad verba obelis &amp; asteriscis conclusa, &amp; utrum ea ibi adsint vel absint:</hi> About the verifying whereof, I have not taken the same pains, as about that of the main Matter; because that the Errors here, if any be, are not of any dangerous consequence, and may easily be mended by Mr. <hi>Junius</hi> himself; who, if he have not some skill in the Hebrew, will have much ado to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the sense and the reason of some of the Asterisks, there being divers of them very perverse or frivolous.</p>
                  <p>I had lately a Letter from Mr. <hi>Croy,</hi> dated 7. <hi>Idus Augusti,</hi> 1651. who writes to me, that being at a Synod at <hi>Mompelier,</hi> when he received the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the <hi>Anticritica</hi> which I had sent him; and having made report to the Synod of the Contents of the same, <hi>Ea omnium animos ita perculerunt, ut si eam rem urgere voluissem, decreto publico Criticam illam damnaturi fuerint.</hi> He tells me further, to have also read afterwards, <hi>Ipsam Gapelli Criticam à capite ad Calcem;</hi> adding. <q>Tecum jam sentio, vir nobilissime, &amp; profiteor, Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticam illam non esse sacram appellandam, sed potius <gap reason="foreign">

This Proposition is so fully agreeable to mine own Thoughts; and, if I be not much deceived, to Truth and Equity, as I do most humbly beseech your Lordship to accomplish it; which as you are able to do now to the full, after the perusal of all <hi>Capellus</hi> his own Writings, so methinks it may be done in few words; <hi>viz.</hi> first, to state the Question about <hi>Capellus</hi> his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as it appeareth to you by the perusal of his Works; and then to give your own <note n="*" place="margin">Judgment on the same.</note> Subject, with a brief touch of the principal Arguments which move you, either to concur with, or dissent from him or me in any of the most material Particulars. I am told, by them that had it from your Grace's own Mouth, that <hi>Capel,</hi> for fear of some such thing, and for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, hath written fawning Letters to your Grace. But that, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, will not hinder you from appearing freely and fully in a Cause, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God's Truth and Sacred Word is so deeply concerned; and as I have great cause to think, that a full and free declaring of your mind, will be a condemning of <hi>Capellus</hi> in all the main Points in controversy between me and him; so if it be otherwise, and that in any of them you find him in the right, and me in the wrong <note n="†" place="margin">Either in <hi>questione facti, aut juris.</hi>
                     </note>, I seek no favour, but an absolute impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And as I dare prescribe your Grace nothing concerning the form of your delivering of your self, so I hope that you will approve of that poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at by <hi>Buxtorfius,</hi> of setting down your Mind in the form of an Epistle, to be writ, <hi>iisdem verbis,</hi> unto <hi>Capellus,</hi> and unto me, <hi>mutatis tantum mutandis.</hi> But however, and whether you be resolved to fulfil this Request of <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> and of mine; or whether that you have no mind to meddle in it, (the which nevertheless is no way credible to me) I do pray your Grace most earnestly, to let me hear from you about it at your first commodity: And if it were not too troublesome to you, I should be glad at the same time to hear, in a few words, your Opinion about the <hi>Septimanae Danielis,</hi> and where you fix the beginning of them; as likewise your judgment upon <hi>Marshami Diatriba,</hi> and his great Innovation touching that weighty Subject; and what distance of time you find, upon your most exact enquiries, <hi>à primo anno Cyri ad tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Nativitatis Christi; &amp; quantum ex illo tempore sibi vindicet duratio monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiae Persicae.</hi>

                  <p>I humbly thank your Grace for the offer of Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> his Notes on the <hi>Psalms;</hi> but if he be so wholly of <hi>Capellus</hi> his Mind in the Controversy I have with him, as his Epistles to <hi>Capellus</hi> do seem to speak him, I would not at all be beholden to him for any of his Labours.</p>
                  <p>If it be known to your Grace, whether Dean <hi>Bernard</hi> be alive yet, and where he is, and how he doth, you will oblige me greatly to impart the same unto me.</p>

                  <p>THough of late I wanted direction to find your Grace's Aboad (not being at <hi>Rigate</hi> this last Summer) my devotion of Service which needs no guide but your own transcendent Worth, most habitually falls towards you wheresoever you are. As a testimony of this Service, I did in <hi>August</hi> last, present by one, who undertook the delivery at <hi>Harrow-Hill,</hi> a small Book (and least that should fail, my Brother sent another by your Chaplain:) which may render your Grace some account of my Exercise &amp; Employment in this retirement. The truth is, one <hi>Sunday</hi> at Church, hearing a Psalm sung, whose wretched expression quite marred the Pen-man's Matter, &amp; my Devotion, I did at my return that Evening, try, whether from the Version of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I could not easily, and with plainness, suiting the lowest Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, deliver it from that garb, which indeed made it ridiculous. From one to another I passed on until the whole Book was ran through. Which done, I could not resist the advice &amp; importunity of better Judgments than mine own to put it to the Press. I was (I confess) discouraged, knowing that Mr. <hi>George Sandys:</hi> and lately one of our praetended Reformers, had failed in Two different Extreams: The First too elegant for the vulgar use, changing both the Meter and Tunes wherewith they had been long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted: The Other as flat and poor, as lamely worded, and unhandsomly rhimed as the Old; which with much confidence he undertook to amend. My Lord, I now come forth an Adventurer in a Middle-way, whose aim was without affectation of Words, to leave them not disfigured in the Sense. That this was needful, your Grace well knowes; but whether my self fit for the attempt, my modesty suspects. Thus whilst your Grace, and other Champions of the Church (the Chariots and Horsemen of Israel) engage against the Publick Adversaries of Truth, I come behind with the Carriages, and humbly in the Temples Porch fit the Songs of <hi>Sion</hi> to celebrate the Triumph of your Pens. Though it be too sad a Truth, <hi>Cythara nostra con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versa in luctum,</hi> yet some of these Psalms may serve as <hi>Threnes</hi> and <hi>Dirges</hi> to lament the Present Miseries; whose Change, as I find not much Reason to hope, so I have more Religion than to despair. That God may long preserve your Grace amongst us, to see a revolution of better Times; or if not so, to comfort by your Presence many who languish under These, is the daily and most earnest prayer of,</p>

Qua perlecta, quam longè alius Eyrius ille fuerit qui ad te ab eo qui ad me scripsit, facilè animadvertes. Ad me quod atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net: sententia mea haec perpetua fuit. Hebraeum Veteris Testamenti codicem Scribarum erroribus non minus esse obnoxium, quàm Novi codicem &amp; libros omnes alios: sed ad errores illos dignoscendos &amp; corrigendos peculiare hîc nobis suppeditavisse subsidium tantopere ab omnibus praedicatam Masoretha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum industriam. Ex quibusdam Veterum interpretationibus excerpi aliquas posse variantes textus Hebraici lectiones: ex vulgata Graeca versione, &amp; edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Samaritana, nullas. In variantibus lectionibus magnam antiquitatis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarium unde eae sunt desumptae rationem esse habendam: &amp; ubi ea quibus antiquiores Interpretes sunt usi cum hodie recepta Hebraici textus lectione consentiunt, non esse eam eo nomine sollicitandam, quòd posteriorum vel Interpretum vel aliorum etiam, Hebraicorum exemplarium lectio ab ea discrepet. Denique ubi caetera omnia reperiuntur paria, ad illum tuum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currendum esse Canonem: ut ex variantibus lectionibus ea praeferatur, quae sensum parit commodiorem, atque cònsequentibus &amp; antecedentibus magis cohaerentem.</p>
                  <p>Ita in Genes. XI. 26. ubi Syra paraphrasis Tharae ante <gap reason="foreign">

Etsi enim codices illi Graeci &amp; Samaritani ab Hebraicis nostris dissentientes, dubiam lectionem non reddant; quia Graeco illi Judaeo ex Gentium contemptu (ut dictum est) Samaritano alteri ex Judaeorum odio, quod Hebraici habebant codices repraesentare non libuit: ubi consentiunt tamen, &amp; eodem quo nos modo etiam ipsos legisse constat, de receptae lectionis antiquitate non contemnendum ferunt illi testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium.

                  <p>I Humbly thank you for that excellent Piece of <hi>Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus;</hi> which though in my younger days I had met withall in Latin, yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw it in his own Language till now. And indeed the Book hath been a double Feast to me; for besides my first course, which is <hi>Origen</hi> himself, I find in the same Volume that piece of <hi>Gregory</hi> his Scholar, which was wrote by way of Panegyrick of him, and hath served me instead of a Banquet. But besides that which the Ancients have done, (of whom many have been liberal in this Argument, either by way of Praise, or of Apology) I find in some Notes that I have taken, the mention of two more modern Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists for him; the one <hi>Jo. Picus</hi> of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> the other more obscure to me (for I have not otherwise met him cited) <hi>Jacobus Merlinus.</hi> If the latter of these be in your Lordship's Judgment worth the reading, and in your power to communicate and impart to me, I beseech you to afford it me for a time; for <hi>Origen</hi> hath had so many Enemies, that I cannot in charity pass by his Friends, without seeing what they can say in his defence. I have something else to be a Suitor for, and that is, your Lordship's own Book; I dare not beg it of you, (for this is no time for you to be a giver) I shall only desire the loan of it, that I may have a fuller view than I had from that which I borrowed from Sir <hi>Edward Leech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I beseech you, my Lord, pardon this boldness of mine, which your own Goodness hath made me guilty of. I have no more to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship withal, but only to remain,</p>

                     <salute>Reverend Father;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>MY Duty most humbly remembred unto you, with thanks for your Opinion of King <hi>Cadwalader;</hi> which hereafter shall be unto me a Tract to follow, as best agreeing with Reason and Truth. I hope you have received your Books in <hi>November</hi> last; and if they are any way impaired in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, if you please to send them me, I will have them fairly written again for you. What I omitted in my last Letter, by reason of the Bearers haste, is, that in your <hi>Giraldus</hi> his first Book <hi>Laudabilium,</hi> and 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> I observe that my Countrymen in his time used to yoke their Oxen for the Plow and Cart, four in a breast, in these words; <hi>Boves ad aratra vel plaustra non binos jungunt sed quaternos, &amp;c.</hi> (which I find not in the printed Book). This may happily give some light and help to understand a clause in our ancient British Laws, treating of Measures, made, as is there alleged, by <hi>Dyfrewal Moel-mud</hi> King of <hi>Britain,</hi> where it is said that the Britains in his time used four kinds of Yokes for Oxen; the first was four foot long, the second eight foot, the third twelve, and the fourth was sixteen foot long. The first was such as we use now a-days for a couple of Oxen: the second was that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Giraldus,</hi> serving for four Oxen; the third (as I suppose) suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with those two, for six Oxen: and the fourth consequently for eight Oxen. The two last are clean forgotten with us, and not as much as a word heard of them, saving what is in that old Law: but of the second, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Giraldus,</hi> we have a Tradition that such was in use with us about sixscore Years ago; and I heard (how true I know not) that in <hi>Ireland</hi> the People in some places do yet, or very lately did use the same: I pray you call to your mind whether that be true, or whether you have heard or
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:60492:279"/>
read any thing of the use of the other two in any Country, and be pleased to let me know thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Copy of <hi>Ninnius</hi> (you sent me) hath holpen me well to correct mine; but finding such difference between the three Manuscript Books, which the Scribe confesseth to have made use of, I presume your Transcript comprehends much more, in regard you have had the benefit of eleven Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies (as you confess) to help you; which Differences are very requisite to be known of such as love Antiquity. And also where those several Copies (that you have seen) are extant, and to be found at present; and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those Copies bear the name of <hi>Gildas</hi> before them, and how many the name of <hi>Ninnius:</hi> And what those of <hi>Gildas</hi> do comprehend more or less in them, than those of <hi>Ninnius;</hi> And whether the Notes of <hi>Samuel Beulan,</hi> are found in any of those of <hi>Gildas,</hi> or yet in every one of the Copies of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnius;</hi> and whether the name of <hi>Samuel</hi> be added to those Notes in any of those Copies, and to which of them: All which (with the antiquity of the Character of those several Copies) are very necessary to be known, and may easily be discovered by you, and very hardly by any other ever after you.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, about three Years ago, I sent a Copy of the Tract concerning the Saxon Genealogies (extant, if I mistake not, in <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Ninnius)</hi> unto you to be corrected by your Book; and Sir <hi>Simon D'Ewes</hi> undertaking that charge for you (as Mr. <hi>Dr. Ellis</hi> told me) returned me only this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer upon the back of my own Papers, <hi>viz.</hi> The eldest Copy of this <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymon Chron.</hi> doth in some places agree with the Notes sent up, but in others differs so much, as there can be no collation made of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But those my Notes do agree very well with the Book you sent me, and differs not in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty words in all the Tract; whereof either many are only Letters wanting or abounding; and therefore I marvel what he meant in saying so, unless he had seen a larger Copy of the same than that I had; but your last Letter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me tells, that it is only extant in Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi>'s two Books, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the other Books that bear the name, either of <hi>Gildas</hi> or <hi>Ninnius;</hi> and that Book you sent me, was copied out of one of Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi>'s Books, and examined by the other. He further addeth, that the Author of that Tract (being, as he saith, an English-Saxon.) lived in the Year of our Lord 620: upon what ground I know not. Yet I cannot think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but that Sir <hi>Simon D'Ewes</hi> had some grounds for the same; and it may be the very same that <hi>Leland</hi> the famous Antiquary had to say, that <hi>Ninnius</hi> lived, <hi>tempore inclinationis Britannici imperii;</hi> and <hi>Jo. Bale,</hi> who more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saith, that he lived in the Year 620, just as Sir <hi>Simon D'Ewes</hi> hath. And (for that Sir <hi>Simon</hi> is dead) I desire to know of you whether the said Tract be not more copious in one of Sir <hi>Thomas Cottom</hi>'s Books, than it is in the other: Or whether Sir <hi>Simon D'Ewes</hi> might not find a larger Copy of the same elsewhere; for if it be not the work of <hi>Ninnius,</hi> nor <hi>Samuel Beulan,</hi> it may as well be in other Books as in those, especially if an English-Saxon was Author of it: But if it be not found elsewhere, I pray you tell me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what grounds is the Author of it said by Sir <hi>Simon</hi> to live <hi>Anno</hi> 620, and <hi>Ninnius</hi> by <hi>Leland,</hi> and <hi>Bale</hi> likewise, said to live in the same Time; when by the first Chapter of some Copies of <hi>Ninnius</hi> his Book, it seemeth he wrote not two hundred Years after Moreover, in regard you prefer that small Tract (so much spoken of by me) before all the rest of the Book, it were a deed of Charity for you to paraphrase a little upon it; whereby such as are but meanly skilled in Antiquity, may reap some profit by it: Truly some remarhable Passages from the Reign of <hi>Ida</hi> to the Death of <hi>Oswi,</hi> Kings of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> are contained in it; which being well understood, would add a greater luster to the British History.</p>

                     <pb n="583" facs="tcp:60492:279"/>
Lastly, Most Reverend Father, I pray you be pleased to lend me your Copy of that Fragment of the Welch Annals sent by the Bishop of St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s <hi>Rich. Davies,</hi> to <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed a Copy thereof upon the Library in <hi>Bennet-Colledg</hi> in <hi>Cambridg;</hi> or your Copy of the Book of <hi>Landaff,</hi> and I shall rest most heartily thankful unto you; and I do hereby faithfully promise to return whatsoever you shall send me, as soon as I shall have done writing of it. I have already taken order to provide a little Trunk or Box for the safe carrying of it to and fro: And my loving Friend Doctor <hi>Ellis</hi> (who in these dangerous Times hath suffered many Assaults and Storms at the hands of his Adversaries, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and constancy) will, I know be very careful of the safety of your things.</p>
                  <p>I have troubled your patience too long, therefore (craving pardon for my boldness) I rest, and commit you to the protection of God Almighty.</p>

                  <p>BY your Letter of <hi>June</hi> 30, I do find, that my last to you having staid so long by the way, hath made me lose the benefit promised by you of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Apologetical Epistle jointly with yours to <hi>Capellus;</hi> whereat, as I have cause to be not a little grieved, so I am glad to find on the other side, by that part of your Epistle already printed, which you have sent me, that you do overthrow the principal Grounds of <hi>Gritica Capelli,</hi> and so confirm the main part of mine Assertions against the same.

                  <p>BEsides the forementioned Letter, he gave me also one from you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was inclosed a Specimen of the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta.</hi> I am of opinion that that Design is not of so high a Concernment for the advancement of true Religion, as the Authors thereof do perswade themselves: and yet I think very well of it, and hold it to be of great use, <hi>pro omnibus Literarum studiosis,</hi> if it be done as it should be; which I fear it will not be, and that many ways.</p>
                  <p>For whereas the main care of the Undertkers should be to give us a most correct Edition, as that of the <hi>Biblia Regia,</hi> I find abundance of Faults in all the Text of this first sheet, <hi>quod si caetera siut ad eundem modum,</hi> the whole Book will be good for nothing else, but to be thrown into the fire and burnt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I think it very superfluous, to give us the Persian <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> as being translated not out of the Original, but out of the Chalde and the Hebrew Samaritan; Whereof it were sufficient to give the discrepancies from our Hebrew <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which are not the hundreth part of it, all the rest being word for word the same.</p>

                     <pb n="589" facs="tcp:60492:282"/>
Thirdly, The Syriack and Arabick being that which chiefly must make that Edition to be considerable, (for every body hath the Hebrew, and the Vulgar Latin, and most Men the Greek, and the Chaldee) they ought to give us those two Texts as authentical as may be: Whereas if they take them only out of the <hi>Paris-Bible,</hi> they will not be worth a Rush, <hi>Gabriel Sionita</hi> having interpolated them in innumerable places, and so utterly spoyled the authenticalness of them; There besides, the Hebrew Character is a very scurvy one, and such as will greatly disgrace the Work: I would that these things were represented to the Contrivers of that, in it self, most laudable Work, before it be too late; for pitty it were but they should be put in the right way. <hi>In Summa</hi> they must very much out-do the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, or else they were as good, and much better to do nothing at all; and in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they would do infinitely better, both for the Publick, and for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, too (in regard of the readier Venting of the Impression) if letting alone all the rest, they gave us only the Syriack and the Arabick (not taken <hi>ex Bibliis Iuiianis,</hi> where they are worth nothing, <hi>ob rationes modo dictas sed ex bonis MSS.) cum Sionitae translatione Latina;</hi> and the Chaldee, taken, <hi>ex Bibliis Regiis (sed cum omnibus variis Lectionibus, deprehendendis ex collatione cum editionibus Venetis) cum sua itidem translatione Latina.</hi>

                        <p>IN the same Letter I gave you likewise my Judgment about the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> that they are going to print at <hi>London;</hi> having nothing to add unto what I told you then, but that I am amazed at several Expressions in the printed Papers, concerning that Design, which you sent me by these last Packets, <hi>viz.</hi> at that honourable and most notoriously false Character they give to that Adulterine Samaritan <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> the <hi>Morinian</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellian,</hi> calling of the true Hebrew Text by the name of <hi>Modern;</hi> and at their making so great an account of <hi>Critica Capelli;</hi> and of the <hi>Variae Lectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> to be collected out of the same; whereas of <hi>Verae Variae Lectiones,</hi> there is not one to be found there but what he hath borrowed from others, being vulgarly known. And as for those Chimerical ones, wherewith the <hi>Critica</hi> is stuffed, from one end to the other, if they pretend to take them into the number of the true Ones, they are altogether inexcusable, after that the folly of the same hath so evidently been laid open, not only by me and <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torfius,</hi> but by my Lord Primat too.—</p>

                  <p>I Made account to have waited upon your Grace before you went out of Town, but was prevented by your early departure from <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> where I was about an hour after you were gone. I have been with my Lord of <hi>Ardah,</hi> and have left with him the Copy of the LXX, which he is to follow. I perceive he will be engaged in Work of his own for this half Year; yet I hope he will not neglect this, but take some care of it himself, because we cannot rely upon Mr. <hi>Huish.</hi> I would gladly know whether Mr. <hi>Young</hi>'s Executor will let us have his Notes, or upon what Terms; they will be of very great use, if they may be had: if your Grace please to give me order to write, or call to Mr. <hi>Atwood</hi> about them, and to make use of your Name, I will see what may be done. <hi>If your Syriack Copy be come out of</hi> France, Mr. <hi>Thornedike</hi> would gladly have it to collate, both with the <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>your other Manuscript,</hi> for all may be done with the same labour. If yours cannot be had as yet, I will borrow some part of Mr. <hi>Pocock</hi>'s till the other come over. Mr. <hi>Whelock</hi> hath sent me a Specimen of what he hath done about the Samaritane Version; where it differs from the Heb. Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, I have sent your Grace a Copy of it. Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> as I hear from a Friend, is willing, if it be desired, to undertake the same Task, or part of it: and because of Mr. <hi>Wheelock</hi>'s infirm Body, I would gladly have some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidiary help. He accounts it a thing easy, (the Samar. being a Dialect of the Chaldee) and I would gladly have something done in it, both to satisfy the Desires and Expectations of many that write about it; as also that we may have something more than is in the <hi>Paris</hi> Bibles, if your Grace thinks fit. Mr. <hi>Whelock</hi> propounds another thing concerning the whole Work, which I look upon as a thing hardly practicable, or which will at least require a great deal of time, <hi>viz.</hi> to have all the Homogeneal Languages together, and one Latin Translation of them all, as the Heb. Chald. Samar. and our Latin Translation for all. So the Roman. LXX, with the Complutense, and that of <hi>Tecla</hi>'s, and our Latin Translation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I look upon as a Fancy, yet I promised to acquaint your Grace, and others, with it, and to desire your Opinions. I hope we shall shortly begin the Work, yet I doubt the Founders will make us stay a week longer than we expected: as soon as the first Sheet is printed, I shall make bold to send one to your Grace. In the mean time, with my Prayers for your Grace's Health and Happiness, I take leave, and rest,</p>

Neither in <hi>Smetius, Lipsius</hi> his <hi>Auctarium,</hi> or <hi>Gruter,</hi> can I find it, no nor in <hi>Boissardus,</hi> who puts together all at <hi>Rome</hi> by their places, not in method of their quality, as the rest do. <hi>Sigonius A. ab V.

That <hi>M. Seneca</hi> had three Sons, whereof <hi>L.</hi> was the second, appears in <hi>Epist.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <q>Sic mihi sic Frater Majorque Minorque superstes.</q>
                  <p>As likewise in the Titles of the Controversies and Declamations. <hi>Novatus; Seneca, Mela,</hi> so reckoned; whence <hi>Novatus</hi> is taken for the Eldest. That <hi>L. Seneca</hi> had a Brother called <hi>Gallio,</hi> appears by himself in his Inscription of his <hi>de Vita Beata;</hi> and also in that of <hi>Statius,</hi> in <hi>Genethliaco Lucani,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Hoc plus quàm Senecam dedisse mundo,</l>
                     <l>Aut dulcem generasse Gallionem.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And in that of <hi>Tacitus, Annal.</hi> 15. under <hi>Nero; Junium Gallionem Senecae Fratris morte pavidum &amp; pro incolumitate supplicem increpnit Salienus Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens;</hi> besides the mention of him by the Name of <hi>Junius Gallio Frater Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necae</hi> in <hi>Eusebius, num. MMLXXX,</hi> (where that ridiculous Mistake is of <hi>propria se manu interfecit, mortem ejus Nerone in suam praesentiam differente, in Editione Scaligerana aliisque,</hi> for <hi>Olymp.</hi> 211. <hi>non est acta, Nerone in suam praesentiam differente).</hi> And afterward <hi>MMLXXXIV. L. Anneus Melas Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necae Frater &amp; Gallionis bona Lucani poetae filii sui à Nerone promeretur.</hi> And <hi>Tacitus</hi> also, <hi>lib.</hi> 16. <hi>Mela quibus Gallio &amp; Seneca parentibus natus, &amp;c.</hi> Which of these three were Eldest, is not altogether clear. But it is a good Argument taken from the enumeration by their Father, that their Births were agreeable to that Order: And then <hi>Novatus</hi> or <hi>Gallio</hi> must be eldest. And <hi>Tacitus</hi> proves <hi>Gallio</hi>'s priority in the place now cited. Hence <hi>Lipsius</hi> in <hi>de Vita Seneca, cap.</hi> 2. and divers times, on his Works, makes <hi>Novatus</hi> the Eldest. But in his <hi>Elect.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. he makes him the second, and <hi>L.</hi> the first. So doth <hi>Pontacus</hi> on <hi>Eusebius,</hi> pag. 573. And <hi>Grotius,</hi> ad Act. 18. 12. <hi>Erat hic Frater Magni Senecae dictus cum junior esset Novatus, sed adoptatus postea à Junio Gallione.</hi> But, I confess the Father's Enumeration sways most with me. Touching the Adoption, I can find no unlikelyhood that <hi>M. Seneca</hi> should give away any of his Sons by adoption, which was usually made for advantage. And <hi>Junius Gallio</hi> the Father might well deserve it. And that of <hi>Seneca ad Mareium,</hi> rather confirms the reasonableness of it, and the like use. Now for that <hi>Gallio</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> (whom the <hi>Arab</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; as <hi>Dio, Galonus,</hi> the Father <hi>Gallio)</hi> it sorts very well with all Circumstances, that he should have been <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Brother, as <hi>Baronius,</hi> Anno 53. §. 33. <hi>Pontacus in Eusebium, Grotius, &amp;c.</hi> doubt not. <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Power in Court will warrant it, and his Comfort to his Mother of her two Sons, <hi>(cap.</hi> 16.) <hi>Alter honores industriâ consecutus est, alter contemsit;</hi> plainly meaning <hi>Novatus</hi> or <hi>Gallio,</hi> and <hi>Mela.</hi> And of <hi>Gallio</hi>'s greatness, <hi>(in Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. ad Nat. Quaest.</hi> 4.) <q>Solebam tibi dicere Gallionem fratrem meum (quem nemo non parum amat, Etiam qui amare plus non potest) alia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia non nosce, hoc etiam (adulationem) odisse.</q> And it doth not well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what became of <hi>Gallio</hi> the Father; likely enough, before, lost upon his Banishment. But neither doth it clearly appear that either Father or Son was Proconsul in <hi>Achaia,</hi> there being no necessity that the mention of <hi>Gallio</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> together only, with relation to his Sickness contracted there, <hi>(Epist.</hi> 104.) should prove him Proconsul of it. And it may be as much wondred at, and more, that <hi>Seneca,</hi> after his way, had not mentioned or touched his dignity, when there was an unavoidable mention to be had of <hi>Achaia</hi> (whence he speaks of his coming as of an ordinary Traveller) more, I say, than that he calls him <hi>Dominus meus Gallio.</hi> Whether he were his
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:60492:285"/>
elder Brother, or not, he might, by reason of his Dignities, which he so had and affected (as <hi>Seneca</hi> expresly takes notice of in that to his Mother) complementally call him <hi>Dominus meus,</hi> though <hi>Lipsius</hi> refers it every where, after he grew of the mind that <hi>Novatus</hi> was eldest, to the Eldership. Pardon my thus troubling your Lordship, and especially my ill writing and blotting, which I could not mend by transcribing, because I was to dispatch it away as soon as I had done.</p>

                  <head>LETTER CCLXXXII. <hi>A Letter from Dr.</hi> Price, <hi>to the most Reverend</hi> James Usher <hi>Arch-bishop of</hi> Armagh.</head>

                     <salute>Most Reverend, my good Lord;</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have been somewhat the longer in answering your Letter, conveyed to me by Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> as desiring to satisfy you about the Tractate of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> against <hi>Apollinarius.</hi> Much search hath been made in this Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but as yet it appears not; and no great wonder, here being almost thirty Volumes of that Father, some of them without beginning, others without end; and some, like Eternity, without beginning and end: if the <hi>Pluteus</hi> and Number had been specified by your Lordship, it would have facilitated
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:60492:286"/>
the Enterprize. And perhaps there is no such thing here, for neither hath your Lordship specified from whom you learned it: <hi>Canisius</hi> (whom to that end I looked into) citing only in Latin two Passages out of it, but not tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us in the Margin where the Greek Manuscript is. Of <hi>Gregory Nyssen, contra Apollinarium,</hi> we have the Greek here, but that we know is printed. I will not yet count your Business desperate, perhaps that piece of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> may be lighted upon in some other Volume of promiscuous Tractates; and what we could not by Industry, we may obtain by good Fortune.</p>
                  <p>I understand, with much both satisfaction and consolation, of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of your Lordship's <hi>Chronology,</hi> but despair (for the present at least) in this interruption of Traffique, by the War between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> to get sight of it: as likewise of Mr. <hi>Young</hi>'s <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Version and Notes on the New Testament.</p>
                  <p>Some Notes of mine, upon a part of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles (which I would not have mentioned, but that your Lordship is pleased to enquire of my low Studies) lie ready by me, and had been printed above a Year since, if in <hi>Venice</hi> at least (for here in <hi>Florence</hi> is not so much as a Greek Stamp) there could have been found <hi>(ô tempore, ô moribus!</hi> as says Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>'s <hi>Rhombus)</hi> a fit Corrector. In those Notes, on the passage of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. there is somewhat concerning <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which coming yesterday under mine eye, while I was thinking of writing to your Lordship occasionally, (and, I hope, without your dislike) I will insert <hi>verbatim,</hi> desiring your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to confirm me, or (which perhaps there will be more cause for) to reform me.</p>

                  <p>I have had Letters from Sir <hi>G. R.</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> which call upon me for <hi>A. Gellius,</hi> upon whom I have more Matter congested, than I have published upon <hi>Apuleius;</hi> but the digesting (which is the more troublesome) part, remains. Which when I shall have leisure or appetite for, I yet see not. I heard long since (and I doubt by too true a Reporter) of the death of my intimate Friend <hi>Sarravius,</hi> in that City. Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> I hear, as he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes in Estate, so declines in strength; it will be your Lordship's favour, when you see him, to mention my humble Service to him.</p>
                  <p>I live here, God be praised, in no want, but in little health, and much solitude, which hath cast me into the <hi>passio Hypocondriaca,</hi> that afflicts me sore, and (which is worse) into some fits of <hi>Acedia,</hi> 'gainst which I arm

my self, as I can, by Prayer and otherwise. The Air of this place in the Winter is (as to many others) most pernicious to me; the Conversation of this place, both in Winter and Summer, is most contrary to me, but the Great Duke's Civilities, rather than ought else, have made me thus long abide here.</p>
                  <p>Much Comfort and Favour I should esteem it, sometimes to hear from your Lordship, there being no Man in the World, near whose Person (and indeed at whose feet) I would die so willingly, as at your Lordship's, and at those of <hi>Bignonius,</hi> whose infinite Learning, and transcendent Christian Humility, have made me a perpetual Servant and Slave to him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Jeremy Bonnel</hi> Merchant, in the <hi>Old Jewry,</hi> (who perhaps will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this Letter) hath the ready and weekly means of conveyance hither.</p>

                  <p>YOur last Letter to me, dated <hi>April</hi> 7. I received not till <hi>Easter-even, April</hi> 15. your Messenger bringing it too late to my Nephew, (as he saith).</p>
                  <p>The Holy-days being past, I have since wholly attended to satisfy your demands touching the <hi>Autumn. Aequin.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lin.</hi> computation <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is <hi>Ecl. ad a<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> I<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Olymp.</hi> 293<hi rend="sup">ae.</hi> which I have here sent you inclosed, with my whole Proceedings therein, that you may the better judg thereof; where if you espy any Error, (as well may be among such variety, and wanting the help of any other Man, albeit, I have been very careful to examine my whole working over and over again) let me intreat so much, that you would be pleased to certify me thereof.</p>
                  <p>Indeed at last I found out <hi>Garsilias</hi> (whom you call <hi>Garsills)</hi> his other Copy, which also transcribed by my Scholar (for lack of leasure in my self) because I have not my own Copy at home to compare the difference only, I have sent you examined, though by my self and him together.</p>
                  <p>D. <hi>Ward</hi> saith, he remembreth your Business, and will be with you (as he sent me word) within this week.</p>
                  <p>Though I have calculated the <hi>Autum. Aequ.</hi> as precisely as I could by the Prutenicks, yet you know, by <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Observations, the Prut. fail of the true Ingress into the Aequinoctial, 12 hours sometimes, and sometimes more, which 4000 Years backward, will perhaps make a greater difference than in 400 of <hi>Tycho</hi>'s. You may read in <hi>Peucer</hi> whereabout the <hi>Aequin. Vernal</hi> was at the first Olymp. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Amandus Polanus,</hi> in <hi>Syntagm. Theolog.</hi> and <hi>Origan</hi> in his <hi>Ephem.</hi> have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued contrarily touching the World's Original Time; which, methinks, in regard of correspondence of the Second <hi>Adam</hi> with the first <hi>Adam,</hi> as in other things, so in this, should be in the Spring (as <hi>Polanus</hi> holdeth) when our Saviour suffered for the Recreation (as I may so speak) of the World. Notwithstanding I am of opinion, the stay of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise was much longer than most Men hold, and Reasons I could yield for it, perhaps so long as Christ lived upon Earth after his Baptism; but in such a nice Point I list not to be curious.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Lively</hi> seems to render a Reason why <hi>Whitsunday</hi> was deferred from <hi>May</hi> 21 <hi>d.</hi> to 28 <hi>d.</hi> because the <hi>Easter</hi> before fell upon the Jewish <hi>Pascha;</hi> which Reason I leave to your better Judgment than mine, if it be not good; but by mistaking the Eclipse, that Year of Christ current 394, I think this Calculation I have sent will sufficiently demonstrate.</p>
                  <p>Hoping you will accept these endeavours for this time, I cease to trouble you further, commending your Welfare to the Grace of God.</p>

                  <p>SInce the late receipt of your Letter, I have had very little time and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to make answer thereto, and am inforced at this present to abbrevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the same. Your acceptance of my small pains, I am rather to thank you for, than you to account them any trouble to me, who would be right glad if in any Matter my Service may stand you in stead.</p>
                  <p>If I thought you had not taken a Copy of my <hi>Garsilias</hi> whilst you had it, I would send you the difference so soon as I can.</p>
                  <p>The precise time of the <hi>Autum.

                  <p>About <hi>Adam</hi>'s continuance in Paradise, as I affirm nothing, so think it cannot be evicted, his stay might not be many Days, or some Years.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. To visit and search the Properties also of so many sorts of Herbs and Plants, in likelihood, that he might see and know what great things God had done for him, and whereof he was made Sovereign, (that so after his fall he might have the greater compunction and remorse for his trespass, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the Glory he lost).</p>

                  <p n="10">10. And both of them to sew for themselves Garments of Leaves. All these (with other Circumstances that might be added) seem to imply a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spit of more than one or two days.</p>
                  <p>And if there was no necessity of knowing his Wife in three or four days, why in three or four years, considering it is not unlike but that God would first limit some time for him to behold and contemplate the Creatures, and acknowledg his bounty therein.</p>

                  <p>Your correspondence of the Feast of Expiations on the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>Tisri,</hi> in memory of the first Sin, I hold very ingenious, howsoever other Expositors deem that Time appointed as fit for Humiliation at the end of the Ecclesiastical Year, when all their Fruits were reaped. But granting that good, the consequence of his Creation in <hi>Autumn</hi> is not necessary, unless we suppose he fell within few days.</p>
                  <p>The forbidden Fruit, 1. in the midst of the Garden; and, 2. but some individual; and, 3. pleasing to the Eye, seemeth to be different from the Pomegranat; and so I suppose you will not deny.</p>
                  <p>For Mr. <hi>Livlys</hi> mistaking of <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> I have not to say, till leasure suffer me to examine whether fourteen Years after the Vernal Aequinox fell that Year upon the Lord's Day. But I thank you heartily for imparting so much as you have to me, whereby to make further search hereafter.</p>
                  <p>And so having been both tedious and troublesome to you, I cannot but crave pardon, in regard of your important Occasions, and commit your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare to the Grace of God; resting ever,</p>

                  <p>IF in omitting a day of the Bissextile Year, I committed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I hope you will bear with elder Years, and long discontinuance from these kind of Supputations; I suppose the Default may easily be amended in the Total, without any great change in the Particulars.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Bainbridg</hi> in his <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> what certainty they are of, may be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Erasmus</hi> his Tables have obtained authority (sufficient for Chronology) hitherto by the consent with the Heavenly Motions.</p>
                  <p>Which <hi>Mulerius</hi> taxing in <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Gordianus</hi> Eclipses, might have done well to have noted also the place in which the <hi>Errata</hi> (and those but <hi>typographica</hi> perhaps) were committed.</p>
                  <p>Your noting their defects, in <hi>Tab. Med. Syz. ab aera Christianâ, fol.</hi> 86. b. <hi>edit. Witenberg.</hi> 1585. (which Edition, with the other also of <hi>Tubinge</hi> I have) more studied me. Who having examined the whole numbers of <hi>fol.</hi> 56. b. <hi>sub columna Temporis,</hi> found no such Errors as you mention; but in <hi>fol.</hi> 87. <hi>a.</hi> I found as you said <note n="*" place="margin">Under <hi>anom. lun.</hi>
                     </note>; but the best is, I have not used to Calculate heretofore by that Table.</p>
                  <p>Yesterday was a Sevenight, I lent Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> (out of our Library) an imperfect Manuscript, fair written, concerning the Endowments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Glassenbury-Abby;</hi> I suppose he acquainted you therewith, if happily it may serve your turn; for I should be right glad if in ought I were able any ways to further your Godly Proceedings, wherein you shall always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledg your kindness, in acquainting me with these Discourses; of which,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Tree of Life (by consent of many good Divines and Schoolmen) was not only a Sacrament, but as a Medicine to defend Man's Nature in his Integrity, from injury of Age and Mortality.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I never imagined <hi>Adam</hi> once to eat thereof; your Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22. evinceth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But I doubt whether it therefore follows, he fell the next Sabbath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Creation, or next Year either. There might be just cause of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance to eat of that Fruit (notwithstanding his continuance in Paradise) known to him, unknown to us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Cedrenus in Compend. Histor. pag.</hi> 4, &amp; 5. relates how some held his aboad there 100 Years, others 7. <hi>Mercator in Prolegom. Atlantis Geogr.</hi> seems to approve thereof. My self only think it not improbable, but that he might live there some Years; the rather, for that at the birth of his third Son <hi>Seth,</hi> he was 130 Years old; whereby it seemeth that either other Descents are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Holy Writ, besides those three of <hi>Cain, Abel,</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> or else the distance of Time betwixt them very long, or his abode in Paradise not so short as is imagined.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 4. I read of Linnen Garments which the Priest put on, but nothing of the Sacred Robes on which the Pomegranats were wrought:
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:60492:289"/>
and <hi>Tostatus</hi> is of my Opinion, that he wore not then these Robes, upon that place of <hi>Levit.</hi> who seemeth also to approve Mr. <hi>Livly</hi> his Opinions touching the difference betwixt the Jewish and Christian <hi>Easter-day,</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 9, 10. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. 9, 19. though, methinks, Mr. <hi>Lively</hi> himself hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that Point in <hi>Olymp.</hi> 202. 8. best: yet can I not but highly esteem your judicious Censures therein.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Pomegranats might be fair, yet are nothing so pleasing to the Eye as other Fruits; they remain to this day, the forbidden Fruit, being extinct; my meaning heretofore was not the mere Fruit in it self considered, to be one individual, but the Tree with all the Fruit thereon. It was but my haste that bred the ambiguity of Phrase.</p>
                  <p>Though unreasonable Beasts ingender once in a Year, (whereof some Authors doubt in the Lion and Elephant) yet reasonable Man (for the causes often alleadged) might abstain in his innocence a longer season.</p>
                  <p>Thus thanking you for all your kindness, and craving pardon of my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousness, I commend you to the Grace of God.</p>

to be curious in the precise Number of his Example, but contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with one more gross, though sufficient to illustrate his Precept.

                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Copernicus,</hi> I dare not undertake to clear him altogether of differing from himself, considering his Numbers are so often false printed, and his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations also not so accurate, and so I can easily yield to you therein; but that <hi>Rheinold</hi> should differ 9.<hi rend="sup">iii</hi> from him, it is no marvel: for where you write he professeth to follow <hi>Copernicus;</hi> therein, Sir, you may please to conceive it is but in part, or <hi>secundum quid,</hi> namely, in his <hi>Copern.</hi> Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Demonstrations, not in his Calculations, wherein he professeth to dissent quite from him, as indeed he doth usually almost every where: Read, if you please, his Epistle, <hi>ad Albertum Marchionem,</hi> Dedicatory, straight after the midst; and his Preface also to the <hi>Prutenick Canons,</hi> in the very Front or beginning thereof.</p>
                  <p>I might, I confess, have been more copious in this Answer, and with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order, but I hope you will pardon, both slackness heretofore, and haste at this present, in regard of my urgent Occasions: But if this do not satisfy, or be not to your contentment, I shall indeavour to amend the same upon your advertisement sent at any time. And for your other Conjectures of <hi>Adam</hi>'s continuance in Paradise, shall be thankful if you will vouchsafe to impart your learned Meditations, either therein, or in ought else, unto me: whom I beseech the Lord to bless with his Spirit, to his Glory, your Comfort, and the Churches Good; desiring always to be accounted,</p>

The second part of your Annales is here extreamly longed for by all of them that have seen the first; but I find, by what you tell me of at this time, that it goeth therewith, as it hath done with my Work against <hi>Morinus</hi> and <hi>Capellus, quòd crescat sub manu:</hi> whereby it hath come to pass, that instead of a <hi>Prodromus</hi> of fourteen or fifteen Sheets, which at first I thought to have had, it is now come to be a compleat <hi>Vindiciae Veritatis Hebraicae,</hi> of full thirty Sheets. I have made an end a sennight since, and the Printer promiseth me to do as much for his part before the end of the next week; and I hope I shall suddenly find an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sending to <hi>London</hi> the 250 Copies for Mr. <hi>Pullen;</hi> wherewith I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to send likewise the Chronological Work of <hi>Labbaeus,</hi> the which I bought the next day after I had received your Letter. In my last I told you how I had enquired of Friar <hi>Goare</hi> about the <hi>Addenda ad Eusebii Chronicon Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> and what answer I had of him: And by this Letter of his which he hath brought me since, you will find a much more ample account concerning the same. Monsieur <hi>Sionita</hi> being gone out of <hi>Paris</hi> into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> a few months before his decease, and having carried all his Papers and Books with him thither, they are fallen into the hands of some Persons, who will never let them appear: insomuch as Monsieur <hi>Auvergne Flavignii</hi> his Colleague, <hi>in Professione Linguae Hebraicae,</hi> who died the matter of half a Year ago, could never hear any news of them, although he used all possible diligence for that end. But as for his Syriack and Arabick Bible, by which those in <hi>Le-jayes</hi> Edition have been printed, they were two excellent Copies, and of a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Antiquity, as he assured me, and I partly discovered my self when I saw them with him, at my first coming to this Town. But I believe it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to you, how that in printing the Syrrack, he hath interpolated it in very many places, and so utterly spoiled the Authenticalness of it, according to what I have informed you very amply some Years since; so as the <hi>Editores</hi> of the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta</hi> there, must in no wise take his Syriack Edition for their Pattern, or else they will spoil all. I am no ways taken with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of putting in so much. For besides that, it is a very superfluous thing to add the Samaritan Pentateuch (of which nothing should be printed but the Discrepancies from ours, which is not an hundredth part, all the rest being, word for word, the same); I cannot see to what purpose it is to—the like Editions with the Hebrew and Greek Texts, with their Latin Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations, and with the Vulgar Latin, these being so easy to be had apart, and no Body being without them: And I would think it much more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of much more utility for the Publick, and for themselves too, (in regard of the ready venting of the Impression) to print nothing else but the Syriack, Chaldee, Arabick, Ethiopick, and the Pentateuch in the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Language, with the Latin Translations. And that Edition too will
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:60492:291"/>
not be worth a Rush, if it be not done with the self-same exactness as the <hi>Biblia Regia</hi> were; whereas those of <hi>Le jay</hi> are basely defaced with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Faults, and therefore fit for nothing but to be burnt. When I shall send you any Books hereafter, I will observe your directions, of addressing them to Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> at <hi>Calais;</hi> being most heartily sorry that <hi>Theophanes</hi> has been so unreasonably long before he came to your hands. Thus humbly kissing your Hands, and praying God to bless his Church, and us your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, with the prolonging of your days in perfect health and strength, I remain ever,</p>

                  <p>WIth never enow thanks for this precious Gift which I receive from your Grace's Hand.

Howsoever, certainly (my Lord) it would give great satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to many, and amongst them, to my self, if by your accurate search, I might understand whether the Chronology of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his Prodigies and affectation of Deity, may well stand with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Prediction of an <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I beseech your Grace to pardon this bold importunity of him, who, out of the consciousness of his deep devotion to you, and his dependence upon your oracular Sentence in doubts of this Nature, have presumed thus to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt your higher Thoughts: In the desire and hope whereof, I humbly take leave, and profess my self,</p>

                  <p>I Thank God I do take my Pilgrimage patiently, yet I cannot but condole the Change of the Church and state of <hi>England.</hi> And more in my Pilgrimage than ever, because I dare not witness and declare to that stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flock of our Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> who have misled them, and who they are that feed them. But that your Lordship may be more sensible of the Churches Calamities, and of the Dangers she is in of being ruin'd, if God be not mercifull unto Her, I have sent you a part of my Discoveries, and it from credible hands, at this present having so sure a Messenger, and so fit an Opportunity.</p>
                  <p>It plainly appears, that in the Year 1646, by order from <hi>Rome,</hi> above, 100 of the Romish Clergy were sent into <hi>England,</hi> consisting of English, Scotch, and Irish, who had been educated in <hi>France, Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> part of these within the several Schools there appointed for their Instructions. In each of these Romish Nurseries, these Scholars were taught several handicraft Trades and Callings, as their ingenuities were most bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, besides their Orders, or Functions of that Church.</p>
                  <p>They have many yet at <hi>Paris</hi> a fitting up to be sent over, who twice in the week oppose one the other; one pretending <hi>Presbytery,</hi> the other <hi>Independency;</hi> some <hi>Anabaptism,</hi> and other contrary Tenents, dangerous and prejudicial to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to all the Reformed Churches here abroad. But they are wisely preparing to prevent these Designs, which I heartily wish were considered in <hi>England</hi> among the Wise there.</p>
                  <p>When the Romish Orders do thus argue <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> there is appointed one of the Learned of those Convents to take Notes and to judg: And as he finds their fancies, whether for <hi>Presbytery, Independency, Anabaptism, Atheism,</hi> or for any new Tenents, so accordingly they be to act, and to exercise their Wits. Upon their Permission when they be sent abroad, they enter their Names in the Convent Registry, also their Licences: If a <hi>Franciscan,</hi> if a <hi>Dominican,</hi> or <hi>Jesuit,</hi> or any other Order, having several Names there entered in their Licence; in case of a discovery in one place, then to fly to another, and there to change their Names or Habit.</p>
                  <p>For an assurance of their constancy to their several Orders, they are to give monthly Intelligence to their Fraternities, of all Affairs where-ever they be dispers'd: so that the English abroad, know News better than ye at home.</p>
                  <p>When they return into <hi>England,</hi> they are taught their Lesson, to say (if any enquire from whence they come) that they were poor Christians for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly that fled beyond-Sea for their Religion-sake, and are now returned, with glad News, to enjoy their Liberty of Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The 100 Men that went over 1646, were most of them Soldiers in the Parliament's Army, and were daily to correspond with those Romanists in our late King's Army, that were lately at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and pretended to fight for his sacred Majesty: For at that time, there were some Roman-Catholicks who did not know the Design a contriving against our Church and State of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="612" facs="tcp:60492:294"/>
But the Year following, 1647, many of those Romish Orders, who came over the Year before, were in consultation together, knowing each other. And those of the King's Party asking some why they took with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's side, and asking others whether they were bewitched to turn <hi>Puritans,</hi> not knowing the Design: But at last, secret Bulls, and Licences being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by those of the Parliament's side, it was declared between them, there was no better Design to confound the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than by pretending Liberty of Conscience. It was argued then, that <hi>England</hi> would be a second <hi>Holland,</hi> a Common-Wealth; and if so, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the King It was answered, Would to God it were come to that point. It was again reply'd, your selves have preached so much against <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Holiness, that <hi>Rome</hi> and her Romanists will be little the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that Change: But it was answered, You shall have Mass sufficient for 100000 in a short space, and the Governors never the wiser. Then some of the mercifullest of the Romanists said, This cannot be done unless the King die: upon which Argument, the Romish Orders thus licensed, and in the Parliament Army, wrote unto their several Convents, but especially to the Sorbonists whether it may be scrupled to make away our late Godly King, and his Majesty his Son, our King and Master; who, blessed be God, hath escaped their Romish Snares laid for him It was returned from the Sorbonists, That it was lawful for Roman Catholicks to work Changes in Governments for the Mother-Churches Advancement, and chiefly in an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Kingdom; and so lawfully make away the King.</p>
                  <p>Thus much, to my knowledg, have I seen and heard since my leaving your Lordship, which I thought very requisite to inform your Grace; for my self would hardly have credited these things, had not mine Eyes seen sure Evidence of the same. Let these things sleep within your gracious Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Brest, and not awake but upon sure grounds, for this Age can trust no Man, there being so great Fallacy amongst Men. So the Lord preserve your Lordship in Health for the Nations Good, and the Benefit of your Friends; which shall be the Prayers of</p>

Which, though he confesses to be the Opinion of their Doctors, he easily refutes, because <hi>Abraham</hi> was 75 Years old when he came out of <hi>Haran,</hi> much more then.

But this being in his Eye but a <hi>Midrash,</hi> he says, according to the Letter, that when it is said, <hi>Thy Seed shall be a Pilgrim</hi> 400 <hi>Years,</hi> the intent is, only to express the time in gross, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine

precisely the time of it, which he reserves a latitude for, by men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the fourth Generation, and the wickedness of the <hi>Amorite</hi> to be compleated, which occasioned also 40 Years stay in the Wilderness. And so the construction of the words he makes to be this, and the Pilgrimage of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was till 430 Years that they dwelt there, until that were fulfilled to them which was said, <hi>In a Land not their own.</hi> Which is the same phrase, saith he, with that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>And the days that we travelled from</hi> Kadesh Barnea, <hi>till we passed the Brook</hi> Zered, <hi>were</hi> 38 <hi>Years.</hi> For this time was not spent in travelling from <hi>Kadesh Barnea,</hi> for there they staid many Years, and passed the Brook <hi>Zered,</hi> where 38 Years were accomplished. And so <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>Happy is he that expects and attains to</hi> 1335 <hi>days.</hi> Which is not, to those days, but to the end of them. Here, I confess, having <hi>Jarchi</hi> his reason to begin the 400 Years at <hi>Isaac,</hi> and this to add 30, I thought he might have taken that course. But then the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi> must have dwelt 240 Years in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is with him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, because the Text <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by <hi>Gemara,</hi> signifies, that they were to stay in <hi>Egypt</hi> but 210. But another consideration he hath, of good account to my thinking; That the Revelation of 400 Years, tending to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the time when God would give his Seed the Land which presently he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him, it is to be understood from the time of the Promise. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then they must have dwelt in <hi>Egypt</hi> 220 Years, or thereabouts, he says, if the 210 Years be a Tradition in <hi>Israel,</hi> it may be salved, by imputing it to the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> only, not reckoning the 17 Years that he lived in it to be of the number. For thus, 227 in <hi>Egypt,</hi> 190 from the birth of <hi>Isaac</hi> unto <hi>Jacob</hi>'s going down, and 13 from the Promise to the birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi> make 430, so I understand him. He saith further, That the 30 Years must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be added for the sins of the Israelites in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Idolatry, neglect of Circumcision, and the like, upon this rule, that all Promises that are not with Oath, imply a tacit Condition: And that, upon the same account, their Pilgrimage is prolonged 40 Years in the Wilderness, a Land not theirs, but belonging to the Serpents and Scorpions. This is the effect of his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon that place, which being close couched, I would not undertake to abridg further, if perhaps any thing in it may prove Novelty to your Grace.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Abarbniel,</hi> I can easily assure, that he understands the calling of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 12. 1. to have been out of <hi>Charan,</hi> for he calls the Opinion of <hi>Abenezra</hi> expounding that Text of his calling out of <hi>Ur,</hi> which we follow, as agreeing with S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a plain Lye: for, he doth not believe at all that <hi>Terah</hi> or <hi>Abraham</hi> came out of <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> upon any call of God, but observes all the Text of <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 25—to intimate the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of <hi>Terah</hi> in <hi>Ur;</hi> that whereas the Posterity of <hi>Sem</hi> had Children at 30 Years, he had none till 70. That, whereas they begat Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he had but three Sons; that of these three, one died young, another having married, had no Children, and the like: and infers, that these were the occasion to resolve him to leave <hi>Ur,</hi> and to come into <hi>Canaan,</hi> whether as more healthy, or whether as more fortunate, according to his Astrology. Something nevertheless he delivers, which seems to justify S. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s words, in that he holds both <hi>Ur</hi> and <hi>Charan</hi> to have been in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> beyond <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> according to the words of <hi>Joshua</hi> 24. 2. For, though <hi>Chaldea</hi> he supposes to be on this side the River, yet he supposes that a place beyond the River may well be called <hi>Ur</hi> of the Chaldees. As, for the purpose, if we suppose that the Chaldees under <hi>Nimrod</hi> should conquer beyond the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this place, as well as those we read of <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 10, 11. which he thus understandeth, that <hi>Nimrod</hi> went forth from those parts, when he said afore,
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:60492:297"/>
that the beginning of his Kingdom was, to inlarge it in those parts which he mentions afterwards. In this then he seems to comply with S. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s words. But for the coming of <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Ur,</hi> he acknowledges no Call of God, though he maintains the Truth of the Tradition, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was to have been cast into the Furnace of Fire, because he disputed against <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s Gods; and that being cast into Prison in the mean time, he was let go, to avoid further inconvenience; which concurring with <hi>Terah</hi> in his former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations, resolved them to go from thence into <hi>Charan,</hi> a place of the Country of <hi>Syria,</hi> out of the Dominion of the Chaldeans. And this is that which I find <hi>Abarbniel</hi> acknowledg that they have by Tradition. Now I cannot say that I have found any thing in <hi>Bereshith Rabba,</hi> that he came out of <hi>Charan</hi> after the death of <hi>Terah;</hi> but I conceive I have found something that might move a Man to think so. For there it is said, that one <hi>R. Isaac,</hi> observing that there wants 60 Years to the death of <hi>Terah,</hi> by the time of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s travelling, excuses it by the mystical sense, that the Wicked are said to be dead when they are alive. <hi>Abraham,</hi> he says, was afraid that they would blaspheme God's Name, if his Servant should forsake his Father in his old Age. Whereupon God said, I will dispense with the honour of Father and Mother in thee, though in no body else: And besides, he shall die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou shalt go forth. Which, in regard of the Promises, I should take to signify, that it shall be said in the Scripture, <hi>Terah</hi> died, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to wit, in the mystical sense. It followeth there immediatly, that <hi>R. Judah,</hi> and <hi>R. Nehemiah</hi> both said, that there was a twofold <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>R. Judah</hi> said, one out of <hi>Aram Naharaim,</hi> and another out of <hi>Aram Nachor. R. Nehemiah</hi> said, one out of <hi>Aram Naharaim,</hi> and <hi>Aram Nachor,</hi> and another when he blew him from between the cloven Sacrifices to <hi>Haran</hi> back again: To wit, according to <hi>Seder Olam,</hi> as I conceive it. Which I would not omit to put down, because it evidences a calling out of <hi>Ur,</hi> according to the old Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, a <hi>M</hi> as <hi>Abenezra.</hi> To which purpose there is another <hi>Midrash</hi> afore upon <hi>Jerem. L I.</hi> 9. in the Name of Rabbi <hi>Azariah.</hi> We have cured <hi>Babylon;</hi> to wit, in the days of <hi>Enoch; Prusthel</hi> was not healed, in the days of the Flood: Let her alone at the division of Languages: And let us go every Man to his own Land, in the days of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For here <hi>Abraham</hi>'s going forth is from <hi>Babel,</hi> that is, from among the Chaldeans. This is all that I have found, for <hi>Zoar</hi> is not to be found in our Colledg Library, and therefore I purpose to write to Mr. <hi>Pocock</hi> to look into it at <hi>Oxford</hi> to the same purpose.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I have dealt with Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> as in a Business that I am affected with. He shewed the difficulty to be doubled by the Arabick, following the Roman Copy. I proposed to change the order of the Roman Copy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Text. To which he answered, upon consideration, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience was incurred already, because many transpositions are passed in the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Proverbs,</hi> so that it is too late to avoid it in <hi>Jeremy.</hi> I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to print a twofold Greek, one to answer the Hebrew out of the <hi>Antwerp</hi> Copy, another to answer the Arabick in a space below. But he stood so hard upon the foresaid Reasons, that I am afraid I shall not prevail.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Manasse Ben Israel,</hi> I had agreed with Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> upon a day and hour to go to him. But meeting him occasionally the day before, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to him, but could not learn from any thing that he knew, concerning any received number of Marginal Readings. And for the saying of <hi>Elias,</hi> he utterly slighted it, not acknowledging, or not discovering any thing he knew of it. Hereupon I thought it not fit for me, equally a stranger to him, to meet him in the same thing, till I have got some introduction to him, (for I hear he is like to stay here a time) and then I shall remember your Question of R. <hi>Judah,</hi> which I count desperate, unless <hi>Broughton</hi> had told
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:60492:297"/>
us what he hath written, or that he is one of them that are recorded in the Talmud.</p>
                  <p>This is that which I have at present for answer to your Grace's Letter. And if there be any thing which you please to command me further, I shall be very glad to be imploy'd in it. In the mean time, with my humble Service, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending my self to your Grace's Prayers, I pray God to keep your Grace in good health, and take leave to rest,</p>

                  <p>SInce I sent unto you the approbation of Monsieur <hi>De Muys</hi> his Works, which were to be printed by Mr. <hi>Vlack</hi> (which I do not know whether they be yet published) I received but one from you. In that which is miscarried, I suppose you wrote unto me therein, what is like to become of <hi>Justellus</hi> his <hi>Geographia Ecclesiastica</hi> so long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and such other of his Works as he left behind him. The Papers which I lent him, and his own Collection of the Greek Canons, I received at several times. But the Collection of the Canons I am forc'd to send back unto you again, because I can by no means procure any of our Printers here to intermeddle with it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Work is as yet imperfect: The Latin Interpretation, as well of the first Collection of <hi>Johannes Antiochenus,</hi> as of that other <hi>Simeonis Magistri ac Logothetae</hi> (whom I make to be the very same with <hi>Simeon Metaphrastes)</hi> being altogether wanting.

I should be much also to blame, if I did forget to return you thanks, for your defending of me against <hi>Capellus.</hi> I did not condemn his Book before I saw it, (as he chargeth me) but declared hypothetically, That if there were such a Proposition therein as you told me there was, and he himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth not, it was both very unreasonable and very dangerous. I see by your Reply, that you intend to set out a full Refutation both of his, and of <hi>Morinus</hi> his particular Objections against the integrity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text: But how you can spare so much time from your practices, I know not. Yet if you shall continue still in that Mind, the Psalter being the only Book, wherein the Papists generally stand for the <hi>Greek</hi> reading (out of which their vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> is rendred) against the verity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, I will send you Mr. <hi>William Eyre</hi> his censure upon all the particular places excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst therein, which forasmuch as concerneth that Book will ease you of much Labour.

If he could have but the patience to stay until the return of the other, I should willingly continue that allowance unto him, which I have now assigned unto the other. But the troubles of these times are such, that my Rents cannot be received in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the event so uncertain, that I know not whether so much will be left me, as may in any competent sort maintain my self and my Family. Yet if things do prove otherwise: I shall be content to allow him ten Pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> the first payment beginning, from the first notice you shall receive of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> I gave order unto Mr. <hi>Ravius,</hi> to procure me a Copy of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Language, to which he hath returned me no full answer. I am sure there is a <hi>Syriack</hi> Copy of them in <hi>Rome;</hi> and therefore not improbable it is, that a like to that may be found among the <hi>Maronites</hi> in the East. If I might get either a <hi>Syriack,</hi> or an <hi>Arabick,</hi> or an <hi>Armenian,</hi> or a <hi>Persian</hi> Translation of them, it would serve me to exceeding good purpose.

                  <head>LETTER III. <hi>A Letter from</hi> Padre Paulo, <hi>(Author of the History of the Council of</hi> Trent) <hi>to the Abbot of St.</hi> Medard.</head>
                  <p>THE Advertisements, which yours of the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> doth give me, concerning the means whereby the most Christian King doth recover his Demains, were most acceptable to me. I have also a great desire to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand when there happeneth any singular and remarkable Sentence in the Court of Parliament, in Ecclesiastical Matters. It seemeth to me an Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour worthy of your self, to imploy your leisure in the study of Divinity, and of the Ecclesiastical History: For which I do hold you so well prepared, that you have no need to be directed by any whoever, much less by me; yet I will not omit to obey you in writing my opinion, what is the course that a Man of sincere Affections should hold therein. And to begin with the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, wherein you do particularly require me; I will tell you, that one had need to beware of those Writers that do give their Resolutions too like Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, with a <hi>Respondeo dicendum,</hi> as if they were Arbitrators; and rather to read them, which deliver their Opinion with reservation, and in Matters not decided, do not play the Pedants over others. The University of <hi>Paris</hi> hath much used to apply themselves to the best Judgments that did spring up amongst them; and the last that offered himself was <hi>William Occam,</hi> whom, if you lay his Barbarism aside, you shall find a Judicious Writer. I have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60492:301"/>
still esteemed him above all the School-men. His Work upon the Sentences doth render the Conceit of him that reads him quick and fit to judg. His Dialogues, which pass from the speculative matters to the more practical and in use, are much esteemed where they are permitted to be read. <hi>Gerson</hi> teacheth well of that which he toucheth; but he did not propound to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to treat of the whole Subject: St. <hi>Thomas</hi> is currant among the Jesuits and Prelates as a Writer very easy, and who doth not intangle the mind of the Reader with doubts, but resolves him indeed too much. If you resolve to read him, it will be good very punctually to examine his <hi>Sorites,</hi> for so are almost all his Proofs; and he is in the number of those that I named first. If you will read the Controversies that do at this present exercise the World, you shall do well to bear in mind that the Writers do all of them exceed in Affection to their own side, and do accommodate matters to their own Taste, and in the ancient Writers do see not that which is there, but that which they desire. And therefore it is necessary to use with them the caution that a good Judg should use; not to pronounce till both the Parties be heard. As for the means to get the understanding of the Ecclesiastical History, it will be necessary to put in your Head a Chronology of all the Princes and famous Men that have been in the World; all of them distinguished in their Times and Countries. In the reading of the Historiographers to be very wary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause for the most part, they are interested on the one side or the other, when they treat of any Controversies. The most sincere Authors are the <hi>English, Paris, Hoveden, Walsingham.</hi> The most sincere and faithful History is to be drawn out of the Epistles of the Fathers and other Writers of every time. Above all, it is necessary in reading to bear a neutral Affection, and not to suffer that which you find in one Author, to take so deep root in you, that it may not give place to the Truth or greater Probability which you may find after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But according to my Judgment, to give a general and infallible Rule for all the Difficulties that may occur in the process of your Studies; I take it to be, to consult with the Jesuits, and to resolve the clean contrary to that which they say. There remaineth (you say) the Parliament for a Bank to keep them from overflowing, but still I see the Water to encrease, and the Earth of the Bank to diminish, which puts me in great doubt: We indeed are free from their Persons, but not from their Vexations and Ambushes. I know not whether mischief to be the greater; that which they do being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or that which they do being present. I begin to believe, for that which now I see, that they have been re-accepted in <hi>France</hi> to free that Kingdom from greater Mischief, which they did in their absence, and peradventure I am not deceived. Your Worship doth esteem me more than is fitting, in thinking that the Jesuits have any thought of me. Assure your self that I am not high enough to be stricken with such a Lightning; (unless they were (whereof I doubt) in the number of those curious Men that do not overslip, no not the least matters): However it be, every one is subject unto danger, only it rests to rely our selves on God in those things whereunto no humane caution can arrive. I beseech your Lordship to make me partaker sometimes of your Letters, whom you shall oblige thereby. You shall not be obliged to write <hi>Italian,</hi> because however I answer you in this my Language, yet it is to me indifferent to read yours in this, or in <hi>French.</hi> Our Lord God give your Lordship all Happiness, whose Hands I do reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently kiss.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>My good Cousin,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>ACcording to your Request in your Letter (dated the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Orleans,</hi> I received here the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>December)</hi> I have sent you by your Merchant 30 <hi>l. Sterling</hi> for your present supply, and had sent you a greater Sum, but that my extraordinary Charge this Year hath utterly unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished me. And now, Cousin, though I will be no fevere exacter of Account, either of your Mony or Time, yet for the love I bear you, I am very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, both to satisfy my self, and your Friends, how you prosper in your Travels, and how you find your self bettered thereby, either in knowledg of God, or of the World; the rather, because the Days you have already spent abroad, are now both sufficient to give you Light, how to fix your self and end with counsel, and accordingly to shape your Course constantly unto it. Besides, it is a vulgar scandal to Travellers, that few return more religious than they went forth; wherein both my Hope and Request is to you, that your principal care be to hold your Foundation, and to make no other use of informing your self in the Corruptions and Superstitions of other Nations, than only thereby to engage your own Heart more firmly to the Truth. You live indeed in a Country of two several Professions, and you shall return a Novice, if you be not able to give an account of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Strength, and Progress of each, in Reputation, and Party, and how both are supported, ballanced, and managed by the State, as being the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Humours, in the temper of Predominancy, whereof the Health or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of that Body doth consist. These things you will observe, not only as an English-man, whom it may concern, to what Interest his Country may expect in the Consciences of their Neighbours, but also, as a Christian, to consider both the Beauties and Blemishes, the Hopes and Dangers of the Church in all places. Now for the World, I know it too well, to perswade you to dive into the practices thereof; rather stand upon your own guard, against all that attempt you thereunto, or may practise upon you in your Conscience, Reputation, or your Purse. Resolve, no Man is wise or safe, but he that is honest: and let this Perswasion turn your Studies and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations from the Complement and Impostures of the debased Age, to more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60492:310"/>
real grounds of Wisdom, gathered out of the Story of Times past; and out of the Government of the present State. Your guide to this, is the knowledg of the Country and the People among whom you live: for the Country, though you cannot see all places, yet if, as you pass along, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire carefully, and further help your self with Books that are written of the Cosmography of those Parts, you shall sufficiently gather the Strength, Riches, Traffick, Havens, Shipping, Commodities, Vent, and the Wants and Disadvantages of all places. Wherein also, for your own good here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and for your Friends, it will be fit to note their Buildings, Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, their Entertainments; all their Husbandry, and ingenious Inventions, in whatsoever concerneth either Pleasure or Profit.</p>
                  <p>For the People, your Traffick among them, while you learn their Language, will sufficiently instruct you in their Habilities, Dispositions, and Humours, if you a little enlarge the privacy of your own Nature, to seek acquaintance with the best sort of Strangers, and restrain your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Participation for your own Country-men of whatsoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>In the Story of <hi>France,</hi> you have a large and pleasant Field in three Lines of their Kings, to observe their Alliances and Successions, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, their Wars, especially with us; their Councils, their Treaties; and all Rules and Examples of Experiences and Wisdom, which may be Lights and Remembrances to you hereafter, to judg of all Occurrents both at Home and Abroad.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, For the Government, your end must not be like an Intelligencer, to spend all your time in fishing after the present News, Humours, Graces, or Disgraces of Court, which happily may change before you come Home; but your better and more constant ground will be, to know the Consanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Alliances, and Estates of their Princes; the proportion between the Nobility and Magistracy; the Constitutions of their Courts of Justice; the state of their Laws, as well for the making, as the execution thereof: How the Soveraignty of the King infuseth it self into all Acts and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; how many ways they lay Impositions, and Taxations, and gather Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues to the Crown. What be the Liberties and Servitudes of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; what Discipline and Preparations for Wars; what Inventions for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Traffick at Home, for multiplying their Commodities, encouraging Arts and Manufactures, or of Worth in any kind. Also what good establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to prevent the Necessities and Discontentment of People, to cut off Suits at Law, and Duels; to suppress Thieves, and all Disorders.</p>
                  <p>To be short, because my purpose is not to bring all your Observations to Heads, but only by these few to let you know what manner of Return your Friends expect from you; let me, for all these and all the rest, give you this one Note, which I desire you to observe as the Counsel of a Friend, not to spend your Spirits, and the precious time of your Travel, in a captious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and censuring of all Things, nor in an infectious collection of base Vices and Fashions of Men and Women, or general corruption of these Times, which will be of use only among Humorists, for Jests and Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talk; but rather strain your Wits and Industry soundly to instruct your self in all things between Heaven and Earth, which may tend to Vertue, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Honour, and which may make your Life more profitable to your Country, and you self more comfortable to your Friends, and acceptable to God.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, let all these Riches be treasured up, not only in your Memory, where Time may lessen your Stock; but rather in good Writings, and Books of Account, which will keep them safe for your use hereafter.</p>

And if in this time of your liberal Traffick, you will give me any adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement of your Commodities in these kinds, I will make you as liberal a Return from my Self and your Friends here, as I shall be able.</p>
                  <p>And so commending all your good Endeavours to him that must either wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or prosper them, I very kindly bid you farewel.</p>

                  <p>AS soon as Term was ended, supposing your leisure to be more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I was coming to thank you two or three times, rather chusing to do it by Word than Letter, but was still disappointed of my Purpose, as I am this present upon an urgent occasion, which doth tie me fast to <hi>Fulham,</hi> and hath made me now determine to impart my Mind by Writing. I think you know I have read your <hi>Cogitata &amp; Visa;</hi> which I have done with great desire, reputing it to be a Token of your singular Love, that you joined me with those of your chiefest Friends, to whom you would commend the first perusal of your Draught: For which I pray you give me leave to say this, first, That if the depth of my Affection to your Person and Spirit, and to your Work and Words, and to all your Abilities, were as highly to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, as your Affection is to me, it might walk with yours Arm in Arm, and claim your love by just desert: but there can be no comparison, where our states are so uneven, and our means to demonstrate our Affections so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; in so much as for my own, I must leave it to be prised in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that it is, and you shall ever-more find it most addicted to your worth.</p>
                  <p>As touching the Subject of your Book, you have set on foot so many rare and noble Speculations, as I cannot chuse but wonder (and shall wonder at it ever) that your expence of Time, considered in your publick Profession, which hath in a manner no acquaintance with any Scholarship or Learning, you should have culled out the Quintessence, and sucked up the Sap of the chiefest kinds of Learning: for howsoever in some Points you vary altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from that which is, and hath been ever the received Doctrine of our Schools; and was always by the wisest (as still they are deemed) of all Nations and Ages adjudged the truest; yet it is apparent, that in those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Points, and in all your Proposals and Plots in that Book, you show your self a Master-Workman. For my self, I must confess, and do speak it <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuè,</hi> that for matter of Learning, I am not worthy to be reckoned among Smatterers. Howbeit, sith it may seem, that being willing to communicate this Treatise to your Friends, you are likewise willing to listen to whatsoever they can except against it. I must deliver unto you that for my private Opinion, I am one of that Crew that say there is, and we possess a far greater hold-fast of certainty in the Sciences, than you by your Discourse
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60492:311"/>
will seem to acknowledg: for, where at first you do object the ill Success and Errors of Practitioners of Physick; you know as well they proceed of the Patient's unruliness, (for not one in an hundred do obey his Physician, in observing his Counsels) or by misinformation of their own indisposition, (for few are able in that kind to explicate themselves;) or by reason their Diseases are by Nature incurable, which is incident, you know, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Maladies; or for some other hidden Cause, cannot be discovered by course of Conjecture. Howbeit, I am full of this belief, That as Physick is ministred now-a-days by Physicians, it is much to be ascribed to their Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or Ignorance, or other touch of Imperfection, that they speed not better in their Practice; for few are found of that Profession so well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in their Art, as they might be by the Precepts which their Art af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth; which if it be defective in regard of full Perfection, yet certainly it doth flourish with admirable Remedies, such as Tract of Time hath taught by experimental Events, and are the open High-way to that principal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which you recommend. As for Alchimy and Magick, some Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they have worth the preserving, but all their Skill is so accompanied with Subtilties and Guiles, as both the Crafts and Crafts-masters are not only despised, but named with derision: Whereupon to make good your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Assertion, methinks you should have drawn the most of your Examples from that which is taught in the Liberal Sciences, not by picking out Cases that happen very seldom, and may by all confession be subject to reproof; but by controuling the Generals and Grounds, and invent Positions and Aphorisms, which the greatest Artists and Philosophers have from time to time defended: for it goeth currant amongst all Men of Learning, that those kinds of Arts which Clarks, in time past, termed the <hi>Quadruvialls,</hi> confirm their Propositions by infallible Demonstrations; and likewise in the Trivials, such Lessons and Directions are delivered unto us, as will effect very near, or as much altogether as every Faculty doth promise. Now in case we should concur to do as you advise, which is, to renounce our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions, and cancel all our Theorems, Axioms, Rules, and Tenents, and to come as Babes, <hi>ad Regnum Naturae,</hi> as we are willed by Scripture to come <hi>ad Regnum Goelorum;</hi> there is nothing more certain to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, than that it would instantly bring us to Barbarism, and after many thousand Years, leave us more unprovided of Theorical Furniture than we are at this present, for it were indeed to become very Babes, <hi>Tabula Rasa,</hi> when we shall keep no impression of any former Principles, but be driven to begin the World again, and to travel by trial of Actions and Sense (which are your Proofs by Particulars) what to place in <hi>intellectu,</hi> for our general Conceptions, it being a Maxim of all Mens approving in <hi>intellectu, Nihil enim quod non prius fuit in sensu:</hi> and so in appearance it would befal us that till <hi>Plato</hi>'s Years become about, our insight in Learning would be in less esteem than now it is accounted. As for that which you inculcate of a Knowledg more excellent than now it is among us, which Experience might produce, if we would assay to retract it out of Nature by particular Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is no more upon the matter, but to cite us to that which, without instigation by natural instinct, Men would practise of themselves; for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reason be otherwise thought, but that there are infinite numbers in all parts of the World (for we may not in this case confine our Cogitations within the Bounds of <hi>Europe)</hi> which imbrace the course you propose with all diligence and care that any ability can perform; for every Man is born with an appetite of Knowledg, wherewith he cannot be so glutted, but still as in Dropsies, they will thirst after more: but yet why they should hearken to any such Perswasion, as wholly to abolish those setled Opinions, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Theories to which they have attained, and by their own and their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60492:311"/>
Ancestors former experience, I see nothing yet alleadged to induce me to think it. Moreover, I may speak with good probability, that if we shall make a mental survey, what is like to be effected all the World over, those five or six Inventions which you have selected, and imagine to be but of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern standing, will make but a slender show, among more than many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of all kinds of Notions, which are daily brought to light by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of Wit or casual Event, and may be compared, and partly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above those that you have named: but were it so here, that all were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that you can require, the augmentation of our Knowledg, and that all our Theorems, and general Positions were utterly extinguished with a new substitution of others in their places, what hope may we have of any benefit to Learning by this alteration: assuredly as soon as the new are brought <hi>ad</hi>

                     </gap>, by the Inventors and their Followers, by an interchangable course of natural Things, they will fall by degrees to be buried in oblivion, and so in continuance perish out-right, and that perchance upon the like to your present Pretences, by proposal of some means to advance our Knowledg to a higher pitch of perfection; for still the same Defects Antiquity found, will reside in Mankind, and therefore other uses of their Actions, Devices, and Studies, are not to be expected than is apparently by Record in former Time observ'd. I remember here a Note which <hi>Paterculus</hi> made of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Wits of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> in their flourishing States, that there might be this reason of the notable downfal in their Issue which came after, because by Nature, <hi>quod summo studio petitum est, ascendit in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, difficilis<expan>

                        </expan> in perfecto mora est;</hi> insomuch that Men perceiving that they could not go further, being come to the top, they turned back on their own accord, forsaking those Studies that were most in request, and betaking themselves to new Endeavours, as if the thing that they fought had been by prevention fore-priz'd by others: so it fared in particular with the Eloquence of that Age, that when their Successors found they could hardly equal, but by no means excel their Predecessors, they began to neglect the study there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and both to write and speak, for many hundred Years, in a rustical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, till this latter Revolution brought the Wheel about again, by inflaming gallant Spirits to give a fresh onset, with straining and striving to clime unto the height and top of Perfection, not in that Gift alone, but in every other Skill in any part of Learning: for I hold it not an erroneous Conceit to think of every Science, that as now they are professed, so they have been before in all precedent Ages, though not the like in all Places, nor at all Times alike in ours, and the same, but according to the Changes and Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Times, with a more exact or plain, or with a more rude and obscure kind of teaching. If the question should be asked, What proof I have of it I can produce the Doctrine of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the deepest learned Clarks of whom we have any means to take notice of, that, as there is of other things, so there is of Sciences; <hi>Ortus &amp; interitus,</hi> which is also the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if I should expound it, of <hi>Nihil novum sub sole,</hi> and is as well to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>ad facta,</hi> as <hi>dicta, ut nihil neque factum neque dictum quod non dictum &amp; factum prius.</hi> I have further for my Warrant, that famous Complaint of <hi>Solomon</hi> to his Son, against the infinite making of Books in his Time: of which in all congruity it must be understood, that a very great part were Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations and Instructions in all kinds of Literature, of which there is not now so much as one petty Pamphlet (only some parcel of the Bible excepted) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to Posterity, as there was not then any bound of millions of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that were long before <hi>Solomon;</hi> yet we must give credit to what he affirmed, that whatsoever was then, or had been before, it could never be averred, Behold, this is new. Whereupon I must for final conclusion infer, seeing all Indeavours, Studies, and Knowledg of Mankind in whatsoever
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60492:312"/>
Arts or Science have ever been the same as at this present, though full of Mutabilities, according to the Changes and accidental Occasions of Ages, and Countrys, and Clarks dispositions, which can never be but Subject to Intention and Remission, both in their desires, and in the practices of their Knowledg; if now we should accord in opinion with you, first to condemn our present knowledg of Doubts and Incertitude; but you confirm, but by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, without other force of Argument, than to disclaim all our Axioms, Maxims, and general Assertions that are left by Tradition from our Elders unto us, which have passed (as it is to be intended) all probations of the sharpest Wits that ever were.</p>
                  <p>And, Lastly; to devise (being now become <hi>A, B, C, Darii)</hi> by the frequent spelling of Particulars, to come to the notice of new Generals, and so afresh to create new Principles of Sciences; the end of all would be, that when we shall be dispossessed of the Learning we have, all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent travail, will but help in a Circle to conduct us to the place from whence we set forward, and bring us to the happiness to be restored <hi>in integrum,</hi> which will require as many Ages as have marched before us to be perfectly atchieved. All which I write with no dislike of increasing our knowldg with new Devices, which is undoubtedly a practice of high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, in regard of the benefit they will yeild for the present. And the World hath ever been, and will assuredly continue full of such Devisers, whose industry, that way, hath been eminent, and produced strange Effects, above the reach and hope of Mens common capacities; yet our Notions and Theorems have always kept in Grace, both with them, and with the rarest that ever were nominated among the Learned. By this you see to what boldness I am brought by your kindness, that if I seem too sawcy in this Contradiction, it is the opinion I hold of your noble disposition, and of the freedom in these Cases that you will afford your special Friends, which hath induced me to do it. Now, though I my self, like a Carriers Horse, cannot blauch the beaten way in which I was trained, yet such is my censure of your <hi>Cogitata,</hi> that I must tell you (to be plain) you have much wronged your self and the World, to smother such a Treasure so long in your Coffer; for though I stand well assured (touching the tenour and subject of your main discourse) you are not able to impannel a substantiall Jury in any Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity that will give up a Verdict to acquit you of error; yet it cannot be gain-said, that all your Treatise over doth abound which choice Conceits of the present state of Learning, and with so worthy Contemplations of the Means to procure it, as may perswade, with any Student, to look more narrowly to his business, not only by aspiring to the greatest persection of that which is now-adays divulged in the Sciences, but by diving yet deeper, as it were, into the Bowels and Secrets of Nature, and by Inforcing the power of his Judgment and Wit, to learn of St. <hi>Paul, consectari meliora dona:</hi> which course would to God (to whisper so much in your ears) you had followed at first, when you fell to the study of such a Study as was not worthy such a Student: nevertheless, being as it is, that your were therein setled, and your Country soundly served, I can but wish, with al my Heart, as I do very often, that you may gain a fit reward to the full of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, which I hope will come with heaps of Happiness and Honour.</p>

                  <p>I Have received two Letters from you, the one written in Latin, the other in French, which I take in good part; and will you to exercise that Practise of learning often, for it will stand you in stead in that profession of Life, which you are born to live in. And now, since that this is my first Letter that ever I did write to you, I will not that it be all empty of some Advices, which my natural care of you provoketh me to wish you to follow, as Documents to you in this your tender Age.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let your first Action be, the lifting up of your Hands and Mind to Almighty God by hearty Prayer; and feelingly digest the words you speak in Prayer, with continual meditation and thinking of him to whom you pray, and use this at an ordinary hour; whereby the time it self will put you in remembrance, to do that thing which you are accustomed in that time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Apply your study such hours as your discreet Master doth assign you earnestly; and the time I know, he will so limit, as shall be both sufficient for your Learning, and safe for your Health: And mark the sence and matter of that you read, as well as the words; so shall you both enrich your Tongue with Words, and your Wit with Matter: and Judgment will grow as Years grow on you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be humble and obedient to your Master: For unless you frame your self to obey; yea, and to feel in your self what Obedience is, you shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to teach others how to obey you hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be courteous of gesture, and affable to all Men with universality of Reverence, according to the dignity of the Person; there is nothing that winneth so much with so little cost.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Use moderate Diet; so as after your meat you may find your Wit fresher, and not duller, and your Body more lively, and not more heavy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Seldom drink Wine, and yet sometime do, lest being enforced to drink upon the sudden, you should find your self enflamed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Use exercise of Body, but such as is without peril of your Bones or Joints; it will much encrease your Force, and inlarge your Breath.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Delight to be cleanly, as well in all parts of your Body, as in your Garments; it shall make you grateful in each Company, and otherwise loathsom.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Give your self to be merry: for you degenerate from your Father, if you find not your self most able in Wit and Body to do any thing when you be most merry: But let your Mirth be ever void of all scurrility and biting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60492:313"/>
words to any Man; for a Wound given by a Word is harder to be cured, than that which is given by a Sword.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Be you rather a hearer, and bearer away of other Mens Talk, than a beginner or procurer of Speech; otherwise you shall be accounted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to hear your self speak.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Be modest in each Assembly; and rather be rebuked of light Fellows for a maiden-like Shame-facedness, than of your sober Friends for pert Boldness.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Think upon every word you will speak before you utter it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how Nature hath (as it were) rampir'd up the Tongue with Teeth, Lips, yea and Hair without the Lips, and all betoken Reins and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to the restraining the use of that Member.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Above all things tell no Untruth, no not in Trifles; the custom of it is naught: And let it not satisfy you, that the hearers for a time take it for a Truth; for afterwards it will be known as it is, to your Shame: And there cannot be a greater Reproach to a Gentleman, than to be accounted a Liar.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Study and endeavour your self to be vertuously occupied; so shall you make such a habit of well-doing, as you shall not know how to do evil tho you would.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Remember (my Son) the Noble Blood you are descended of by your Mothers side; and think that only by a vertuous Life and good Actions, you may be an Ornament to your Illustrious Family; and otherwise through Vice and Sloth you may be esteemed, <hi>labes generis,</hi> one of the greatest Curses that can happen to a Man.</p>
                  <p>Well (my little <hi>Philip)</hi> this is enough for me, and I fear too much for you at this time: but yet if I find that this light meat of digestion do nourish any thing the weak stomach of your young Capacity; I will, as I find the same grow stronger, feed it with tougher Food: Farewel. Your Mother and I send you our Blessing; and Almighty God grant you his, nourish you with his Fear, guide you with his Grace, and make you a good Servant to your Prince and Country.</p>

                  <p>MY Son, the vertuous Inclination of thy matchless Mother, by whose tender and godly Care thy Infancy was governed, together with Education under so zealous a Tutor, puts me rather in assurance than hope, that thou art not ignorant of that summary Bond, which only is able to make thee happy, (as well in thy Death as Life) I mean the Knowledg and Worship of thy Creator and Redeemer, without which all other things are vain and miserable; so that thy Youth being guided by so sufficient a Teacher, I make no doubt but he will furnish thy Life with Divine and Moral Documents. Yet that I may not cast off the Care that beseemeth a Parent towards his Child; or that thou shouldest have cause to derive thy whole
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60492:313"/>
Felicity and Welfare rather from whom thou receivest thy Birth and Being, than from those unto whom the Charge of well-living is allotted; I think it fit and agreeable to help thee with such Advertisments for the squaring of thy Life, as are rather gained by long Experience than much Reading, to the end that thou entring into this exorbitant Age, mayest be the better prepared to shun those Courses, whereunto this World, and the want of Experience, may easily draw thee: And because I would not confound thy Memory, I have reduced them into ten Precepts; and next unto <hi>Moses</hi>'s Tables (if thou imprint them in thy Memory) thou shalt reapt the Benefit, and I the Contentment; and here they follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When it pleases God to bring thee to Man's Estate, use great provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and circumspection in the choice of thy Wife, for from thence will spring all future Good or Evil; and it is an Action, like a Stratagem of War, wherein a Man can err but once: If thy Estate be good, match near home, and at leasure; if weak, far off, and quickly: enquire diligently of her Education, and how her Parents have been inclined in their Youth: let her not be poor, how generous soever, for a Man can buy nothing in the Market for Gentility: nor chuse a base or uncomely Creature, although Wealthy, for it will cause contempt in others, and loathing in thy self: Neither make choice of a Dwarf, or a Fool, for by the one thou shalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a race of Pigmies, and the other will be thy daily disgrace, and it will irk thee to hear her talk; for thou shalt find to thy great Grief, that there is nothing more irksom than a She-Fool. And touching the Government of thy House, let thy Hospitality be moderate, and according to the measure of thy Estate, rather plentiful than sparing, but not costly; for I never knew any grow poor by keeping of an ordinary Table: But some consume themselves through secret Vices, and then Hospitality beareth the blame. But banish Swinish Drunkards out of thy House; that is a Vice that impaireth Health, consumes much, and makes no shew: And I never heard Praise ascribed to a Drunkard, but the well-bearing of Drink, which is a Commendation fitter for a Brewer's Horse or Dray-man, than for a Gentleman or a Serving-man. See that thou spend not above three of the four parts of thy Revenues, nor above a third part of that in thy House, for the other two parts will do no more than defray thy Extraordinarie, which will always surmount the Ordinary by so much, otherwise thou shalt live like a rich Beggar in continual want; and the needy Man can never live happily, nor content: for every one left in an unfortunate estate, makes him ready to sell Lands; and that Gentleman that sells one Acre of Lands, sells one ounce of Credit; for Gentility is nothing but Ancient Riches: So that if the Foundation shrinks, the Building must needs follow after.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Bring thy Children up in Learning and Obedience, yet without auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; praise them openly, reprehend them secretly, give them good Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and convenient Maintenance, according to thine Ability; otherwise thy Life will seem their Bondage: And what Portion thou shalt leave them at thy Death, they will thank Death for it, and not thee. I am perswaded that the foolish cockering of some, and the over-stern carriage of others, causeth more Men and Women to take ill courses, than their own vicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. Marry thy Daughters, lest they marry themselves: and suffer not thy Sons to pass the <hi>Alps,</hi> for they shall bring home nothing but Pride, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and Atheism: And if by Travel they get few broken Languages, it will profit them no more, than to have one sort of Meat serv'd in divers dishes. Neither by my Advice trained up to Wars; for that he that sets his rest to live in that, can hardly be an honest or good Christian; for that every War is of it self unjust, except the Cause make it just. Besides it is a Science no longer in request than use; for Souldiers at Peace are like Chimnies in Summer.</p>

                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60492:314"/>
3. Live not in the Country without Corn and Cattel about thee; for he that presents his hands to his Purse for every expence, is like him that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to keep Water in Fire; and what Provision thou shalt want, prepare to buy it at the first hand; for there is a penny in four saved, between buying at they need, and when the Season and Market serveth fittest for it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be not served with Kinsmen, Friends, or Men intreated to serve (for they will expect much, and do little); nor with such as are amorous (for their Brains are ever intosticated); and rather be served by two too few, than one too many: Feed them well, and pay them with the most, and thou mayst boldly require Duty and Service at their hands.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let thy Kindred and Alliance be welcome to thy Table; grace them with thy Countenance, and further them in all honest Actions, for by these Means thou shalt find Advocates to plead an Apology for thee behind thy back; but shake off those Glow-worms, (I mean, Parasites and Hypocrites) who will feed and fawn upon thee in Prosperity, but in Adversity will shelter thee no more than an Harbour in Winter.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Beware of Suretyship for thy best Friends; he that payeth another Man's Debt, seeketh his own overthrow; but if thou canst not chuse, rather lend thy Mony thy self upon good Bonds though thou borrow, for so shalt thou both please thy Friend, and secure thy self. Neither borrow Mony of a Neighbour, or Friend, but of a Stranger, where paying for it, thou shalt hear no more of it, otherwise thou shalt eclipse thy Credit, lose thy Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and yet pay as dear as to another: But in borrowing, be precious of thy Word, for he that hath a care to keep his Days of Payment, is a Lord over another Man's Goods.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Undertake no Suit against any poor Man, without much wrong, for thou makest him thy Competitor; and it is a base request to triumph where there is small resistance; neither attempt Law with any Man, before thou be throughly resolved that thou have right on thy side; then neither spare for Mony, nor Pains; for a Cause or two so followed, will free thee from Suits a great part of thy Life after.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Be sure to keep some Gentleman thy Friend, but trouble him not with every trifling Complaint; often present him with many, yet small Gifts: And if thou have cause to bestow any great Gratuity, let it be such as may be daily in his sight; otherwise, in this ambitious Age, thou shalt remain like a Hop without a Pole, live in obscurity, and be made a Footstool for every insulting Companion to spur at.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Towards thy Superiors, be humbly generous; with thy Equals, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar; yet respective towards thy Inferiors; shew much humility, and some familiarity, as to bow thy Body, stretch forth thy Hand, and to uncover thy Head, with such be popular Complements; the first prepares the way to Advancement; the second makes thee known for a Man as well bred; the third gains a Man good report, which once being gotten, is easily kept; for high. Humilitudes take such deep root in the minds of the Multitude (who are more easily won by unprofitable Courtesies, than curious Benefits) that I advise thee not to affect nor neglect Popularities.</p>
                  <p>Trust not any Man with thy Estate, for it is a meer folly for a Man to enthral himself to his Friends, as though, if occasion be offered, he should not dare become his Enemy.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Be not scurrilous in thy Conversation, nor Stoical in thy Jests; the one will make thee unwelcome to all Companies, the other will breed Quarrels, and get thee hatred of thy best Friends; for Jests, when they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour too much of Truth, leave bitterness in the minds of those that are touched. Although I have pointed at all these inclusive, yet I think it fit and necessary to leave it thee as a special Caution, because I have seen many
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60492:314"/>
so prone to quip and gird, that they will rather lose their Friend than their Scoff, then they will travel to be delivered of it as a Woman with Child: these nimble Apprehensions are but the Froth of Wit.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>AS I am here employ'd by our Soveraign Lord the King, your Grace can testify that I have left no Stone unturn'd for his Majesty's Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; neither can I omit (whenever I meet with Treacheries or Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies against the Church and State of <hi>England)</hi> the sending your Grace an Accompt in General. I fear Matters will not answer your expectations, if your Grace do but seriously weigh them with deliberation. For be you assur'd, the Romish Clergy have gull'd the misled Party of our English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that under a Puritanical Dress; for which the several Fraternities of that Church, have lately received Indulgences from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Council of Cardinals, for to educate several of the young Fry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who be Natives of his Majesty's Realms and Dominions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them in all manner of Principles and Tenents contrary to the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be in the Town of <hi>Hague,</hi> to my certain Knowledg, two dangerous Impostors, of whom I have given notice to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who have large Indulgences granted them, and known to be of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> altho they seem <hi>Puritans,</hi> and do converse with several of our English Factors.</p>
                  <p>The one, <hi>James Murray,</hi> a Scotchman, and the other <hi>John Napper,</hi> a York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire Blade. The main drift of these Intentions is, to pull down the English Episcopacy, as being the chief Support of the Imperial Crown of our Nation: For which purpose above sixty Romish Clergy-men are gone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these two Years out of the Monasteries of the French King's Dominions, to preach up the Scotch Covenant, and Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> his Descriptions and Rules within that Kirk, and to spread the same about the Northern Coasts of <hi>England.</hi> Let therefore his Majesty have an inkling of these Crotchets, that he might be persuaded, whenever Matters of the Church come before you, to refer them to your Grace, and the Episcopal Party of the Realm: For there be great Preparations making ready against the Liturgy and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And all evil Contrivances here and in <hi>France,</hi> and in other Protestant Holdings to make your Grace and the Episcopacy odious to all Reformed Protestants abroad. It has wrought so much on divers of the Forreign Ministers of the Protestants, that they esteem our Clergy little better than Papists. The main things that they hit in our teeth are, our Bishops to be called Lords; The Service of the Church; The Cross in Baptism; Confirmation; Bowing at the Name of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60492:315"/>
Jesus; The Communion Tables placed Altar-ways; Our manner of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations: And several other Matters which be of late buzz'd into the Heads of the Forreign Clergy, to make your Grievances the less regarded in case of a Change, which is aimed at, if not speedily prevented.</p>
                  <p>Your Grace's Letter is carefully delivered by my Gentleman's own hands unto the Prince.</p>
                  <p>Thus craving your Graces hearty Prayers for my Undertakings abroad, as also for my safe arrival, that I may have the freedom to kiss your Grace's hands, and to tell you more at large of these things; I rest,</p>

For in our Liturgy (which is confirmed by Supream Authority, Sacred and Civil, by Convocation and Parliament) in the Communion-Offices, after the repeating of the Fourth Commandment, concerning the Observation of the Sabbath, it follows; <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us, and incline our Hearts to KEEP THIS LAW:</hi> Whence it is evident, that in the Judgment of our Church, not only the Jews, but we Christians, are under the Obligation of that Law.</p>

After the word Sufferings, add; But when that Doctor argues thus: <hi>This Proposition, Christ is a Sacrifice for Men, is indefinitely set down without limitation,</hi> therefore it must mean <hi>for all Men;</hi> he forgets his Logick, for all know, that <hi>Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio indefinita in materia contingenti aequevalet particulari.
