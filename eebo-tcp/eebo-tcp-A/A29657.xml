            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>AS underdeath an Oak one Day</l>
                  <l>Free from unpeaceful Thoughts I lay</l>
                  <l>A gentle Slumber o'er my head</l>
                  <l>His downy Wing had softly spread:</l>
                  <l>When lo! before me seem'd to stand</l>
                  <l>Bright Beauty's Queen, and in her hand</l>
                  <l>Her little winged Son she had;</l>
                  <l>A peevish, proud, unhappy Lad</l>
                  <l>He is, tho' then h'appeared mild,</l>
                  <l>And humble as a sucking Child.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Dear Shepherd, I commend to thee</l>
                  <l>My Son: pray take him home (said she)</l>
                  <l>And teach him Poetry, for well</l>
                  <l>I know, thou dost therein excel:</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>This said, away she went, and I</l>
                  <l>(Proud of the Office) by and by</l>
                  <l>Took my young Scholar, and began</l>
                  <l>To teach the wanton Wag to scan</l>
                  <l>A Verse upon his Fingers: but,</l>
                  <l>The D—a dram would Cupid do't.</l>
                  <l>No; He began to sing to me</l>
                  <l>Songs of Love and Jolity,</l>
                  <l>Songs of God's and Mortal's Pleasures,</l>
                  <l>And t'unfold his Mother's Treasures.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Soon, alas! soon I forgot</l>
                  <l>All that the Youth I meant t' have taught.</l>
                  <l>But his wicked Ballads out</l>
                  <l>Of my Mind I ne'er could put,</l>
                  <l>Nor ever since my lips could move</l>
                  <l>To sing of any thing but Love.</l>

                  <l>LEt me but have a Wife what e'er she be</l>
                  <l>So she be Woman, 'tis enough for me:</l>
                  <l>I ask not one in whom all Graces shine,</l>
                  <l>Her Sex alone endears her to be mine.</l>
                  <l>If she be young, she is not stubborn grown,</l>
                  <l>And I may form her Manners to my own:</l>
                  <l>If old, a Wife and Mother both I have,</l>
                  <l>And either may a Kiss or Blessing crave.</l>
                  <l>If she be fair, she's lovely as the Light:</l>
                  <l>If ugly, why? what's matter in the Night?</l>
                  <l>If she be barren, I am free from Care:</l>
                  <l>If Fruitful, Children costly Blessings are.</l>
                  <l>If Poor, she'll Humble, and Obedient be:</l>
                  <l>If Rich, O! who'd fear golden Slavery?</l>
                  <l>If Scold she be, she'll teach me Patience:</l>
                  <l>If Sluttish, I may Temp'rance learn from thence.</l>

                  <l>That Wives and Husbands Humours seldom meet,</l>

POEM
UPON
<hi>Christmas-Day.</hi> In Imitation of the
Fourth Eclogue of VIRGIL,
Entitled,

PREFACE.</head>
               <p>THe Fourth Eclogue of <hi>Virgil,</hi> taken by him out
of <hi>Sibylla's</hi> Oracles, containeth a famous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
concerning the Birth of our blessed Saviour
(which was then at hand) and the Benefits of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,
together with the State of his Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Restitution of all things. Which the Poet not
understanding, nor imagining that a Person so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
could arise any where but among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
applies to <hi>Saloninus</hi> the Son of <hi>Pollio,</hi> then
newly born; or as Irather think, to some young In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
of the Imperial Family: for he would hardly
ascribe so great a Kingdom, and such mighty Acts to
a private Person, for fear of displeasing <hi>Augustus,</hi>
on whose Line all Power and Greatness was by the
Flattery of Courtiers entailed for ever.</p>
               <p>I have here endeavoured to rectifie <hi>Virgil's</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
and restore this excellent Poem to its right
owner: there being several things in it, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
with any shew of Truth, he applied to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52514:64"/>
but the Son of God. And herein I have taken
the Liberty (which the Poet, I suppose did with the
Prophetess) to leave out some things, to add others,
and by a Paraphrase to make the Sense more plain
and easie. Yet the Reader will find very little in
the Translation, that is not hinted in the Original,
which will appear, if any Man will take the Pains
to confer them together.</p>
               <p>Tho' <hi>Virgil</hi> was not so happy as to understand his
own Verses, yet in After times the reading of them
did incline several Persons to the Christian Faith,
and the Primitive Fathers made use of them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the Pagans, that a <hi>Messias,</hi> a King from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
a Restorer of all things was promised by God,
and about that time expected by Men.</p>
               <p>Thus God left not himself without Witness, even
amongst the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tho' through their Pride and
Ignorance they misapplied the Intimations given them
from Heaven.</p>
