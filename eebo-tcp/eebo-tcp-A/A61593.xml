            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi>
at that time, the <hi>High-Priest</hi>
and <hi>Judge</hi> over <hi>Israel,</hi> upon
Occasion of the Wickedness of his Sons,
and the <hi>Hishonour</hi> brought upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
thereby; which was so great


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44333:3"/>
that it is said,<note place="margin">v. 17.</note> 
               <hi>they made the People ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
the Offering of the Lord.</hi> But that
we may the better comprehend their
Scope and Design, there are some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
particulars to be considered;
with respect to the Circumstances that
attend them.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That their Sins were of a high
and scandalous Nature, being an open
Affront both to the Ceremonial and
Moral Law. <hi>The Offering of the Lord</hi>
was that which himself had appointed
in the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> wherein it was
expresly required, that the <hi>Fat of the
Sacrifices</hi> of Peace-Offerings must <hi>be
burnt upon the Altar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 7. 31.</note> and after that, the
Joints were to be divided, and the
Priest was to have his share,<note place="margin">v. 33, 34.</note> and the
People that offer'd them the rest. But
these Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> thought themselves
too great to be tied up to such a strict
observance of the Niceties of the Law;
and therefore they sent their Servants
to demand what they pleased,<note place="margin">v. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> without
any Regard to that Order which the
Laws appointed. It is possible, they
might <hi>think</hi> (although such lewd and
and profane Persons are not much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>thinking)</hi> that the matter was


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44333:3"/>
not great, how, or in what manner,
they took the share which belong'd to
them; but God, who best knew what
was pleasing to himself, saith, <hi>The
Sin of the young Men was very great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 17.</note> For God will and
ought to be served in his own Way,
and they, who thought to be Wiser
than his Laws, smarted for their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">Lev. 10. 1.</note>
Thus <hi>Nadah</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> (two
brisk young Men) had a mind to try
the Experiment of offering <hi>strange Fire
before the Lord</hi> (not taking it from the
Altar as God had appointed.)<note place="margin">Lev. 1. 7. ch. 6. v. 12. ch. 16. v. 12.</note> And what
came of this Presumptuous violation of
God's Law? They were immediately
consumed by <hi>a strange Fire</hi> themselves;
for,<note place="margin">ch. 10. v. 2.</note> it is said, <hi>A Fire went out from the
Lord and devoured them, and they died
before the Lord; i. e.</hi> they were struck
dead with Lightning upon the Place,
and their dead Bodies were carried
forth <hi>from before the Sanctuary out of the
Camp;</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 4.</note> that all the People might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Truth of what <hi>Moses</hi> said to
<hi>Aaron</hi> on this Occasion:<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> 
               <hi>This is that
the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified
in them that come nigh me, and before
all the People I will be glorified.</hi> It is


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44333:4"/>
true, God did not punish <hi>Hophni</hi> and
<hi>Phinehas</hi> in the same manner, who
added great Lewdness and Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to their other faults;<note place="margin">v. 22.</note> but He se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
threatens the whole House of
<hi>Eli</hi> for their Sins; and as a sign of
the rest, he declares, that these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
Wretches should both be taken
off the same Day;<note place="margin">v. 34.</note> Which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
accomplished with dreadful
Circumstances;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. 4. v. 11.</note> For, <hi>the Ark of God
was taken</hi> at the same time.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That the House of <hi>Eli</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to that Dignity which it then
enjoy'd by an Extraordinary Method
of Providence: For, when <hi>Nadab</hi> and
<hi>Abihu</hi> the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd,<note place="margin">Lev. 10. 6. 1 Chr. 24. 2.</note>
there remained <hi>Eleazar</hi> and
<hi>Ithamar,</hi> (for the other died Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,)
from them descended two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Family.<note place="margin">Num. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Eleazar</hi> was
of the Elder House; but <hi>Eli,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from <hi>Ithamar,</hi> was in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the High Priesthood by God's
Approbation. And when <hi>Abiathar</hi> in
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s time was put by the High
Priesthood,<note place="margin">1 Chr. 14. 2. 5.</note> it is said, <hi>that he descended
from Ithamar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 24. 27.</note> and was of the House of
<hi>Eli;</hi> and he was <hi>therefore thrust out


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44333:4"/>
that God might fulfil his Word, which he
spake concerning the House of</hi> Eli <hi>in</hi> Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh.
By which we find, that God had
raised up the House of <hi>Eli</hi> after an
Extraordinary manner; and no doubt,
according to the Wise Methods of
Divine Providence for an Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
End; and we find no ill Character
fixed upon <hi>Eli</hi> himself, although <hi>he
had judged</hi> Israel <hi>forty years;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 18.</note> but there
were those about him, and very near
him, who were loose, profane and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Persons, and although, those
who are most concerned, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
hear the last of the Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
of those related to them; yet the
Cry was so great that it came to his
Ears, and he took notice of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
them for it;<note place="margin">ch. 2. v. 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>And he said to
them, why do ye such things? &amp;c.</hi> The
good old Man seems to be heartily
concerned and troubled for his Sons
Follies; but this did not answer God's
End; for the Reason He gives of
the heavy Judgments denounced a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst
his Family,<note place="margin">ch. 3. v. 13.</note> was, <hi>because his
Sons made themselves vile, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
them not.</hi> God expects some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than meer Words, or bare


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44333:5"/>
Reproofs, where his <hi>Honour,</hi> and that
of <hi>Religion,</hi> are so much concerned.
But when Profaneness, Looseness and
Irreligion, crept in among them,
and grew too hard for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
God threatens to do such <hi>a
thing in</hi> Israel,<note place="margin">ch. 3. v. 11.</note> 
               <hi>at which both the ears of
every one that heareth it shall tingle.</hi> I
need go no farther.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That although God was justly
provoked by the Sins of the House of
<hi>Eli;</hi> yet there was a concurrence of
the Peoples Sins in bringing down
such severe and astonishing Judgments.
There was no great loss in <hi>Hophni</hi> and
<hi>Phinehas,</hi> unless they had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but it was a terrible Judgment to
have <hi>the Ark of God</hi> taken, and carried
Captive; and thereby their whole
Religion exposed to scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
among their Neighbours, who
hated them for the sake of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For when the Idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
about them had corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and the Worship of God, He
was pleased, by the Ministry of <hi>Moses,</hi>
to set up a Form of Worship among
the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> according to his
own Will. This gave great Dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44333:5"/>
to all their Neighbours, and
encreased their Spight and Malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; which they were ready
to shew on all Occasions; but never
more than when <hi>the Ark of God</hi> was
taken Captive and carried about in
Triumph among them: For this was
the <hi>Symbol</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s particular <hi>Presence</hi>
among the People of <hi>Israel.</hi> The <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi>
with all its Rich and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Furniture, was as his <hi>Court;</hi> but
the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> as his <hi>Chamber</hi> of
<hi>Presence;</hi> and there <hi>the Ark</hi> was the
Place where God gave his Answers to
his People on great and Solemn Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
And what could be more
grievous and dishonourable to them,
than to have this <hi>Ark of God</hi> carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by their Enemies? For, then
the Name of the whole Nation might
have been <hi>Ichabod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ch. 4. v. 22.</note> 
               <hi>for the Glory was
departed from Israel.</hi> But was all this
meerly for the Sins of <hi>Hophni</hi> and
<hi>Phinehas?</hi> No; the Punishment on
that account related to the <hi>House</hi> of
<hi>Eli;</hi> but this was a Judgment on the
whole Nation: And God himself
gives a sad Account of it, but it was
such, as reached to the Nature and


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44333:6"/>
Extent of the Judgment. <hi>Go ye now,</hi>
saith <hi>God</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Place which was in</hi> Shiloh, <hi>where
I set my Name at the first, and see what
I did to it for the wickedness of my People
Israel.</hi> So that here was a Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sins of all sorts to bring
down so heavy a Judgment upon
them.</p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavour'd to
clear the way towards the right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the full Scope and Design
of these Words, <hi>Them that honour me
I will honour; and they that despise me
shall be lightly esteemed.</hi> Wherein are
two things to be spoken to;</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Honour</hi>
which is due to God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The</hi> Rules <hi>and</hi> Measures <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God bestows</hi> Honour <hi>on Mankind.</hi>
Them that honour me I will honour; and
they that despise me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Honour</hi>
which is due to God.</p>
            <p>There are three sorts of Men to be
consider'd with Respect to the <hi>Honour</hi>
due to God;</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Such as <hi>despise</hi> him instead of
honouring him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44333:6"/>
(2.) Such as pretend to <hi>Honour</hi> him
but do not.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Such as give him that real
Honour which is due to him.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There are such as <hi>despise</hi> him
instead of honouring him. Such as
the Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> here mention'd, who
are said to be <hi>the Sons of</hi> Belial, <hi>who
knew not the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 12.</note> A strange Character
of such, who had not only the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Advantages of the People of <hi>Israel</hi>
to <hi>know God</hi> above all Nations of
the World; but a particular Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to serve and Worship him! But
those do not <hi>know God</hi> who despise his
Service. It is impossible to <hi>despise</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Goodness and Power and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
for those are things, which all
that understand them cannot but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and highly Esteem. For a
poor Creature to despise his Creatour;
or one that lives upon the Bounty of
another to despise his Benefactour,
seems to be such an Inconsistency in
Morality, as if humane Nature were
uncapable of it. But not withstanding,
God himself, who knows the most
secret Thoughts of Mens Hearts, saith
here, <hi>They that despise me shall be lightly


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44333:7"/>
esteemed;</hi> Although God cannot be
despised for his glorious Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yet his Authority may be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised,
when Men presumptuously
break his Laws; when they do not
regard what he hath Commanded or
forbidden;<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>When they profess to know
God, but in Works they deny him;</hi>
when they own a God, and yet live
as if there were none, giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
over to a profane and irreligious
Temper of Mind, if not to all sorts of
Wickedness in their Lives. And if
once such a Temper prevails, there is
nothing to be expected but an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the other. For those who despise
God and Religion can have little Regard
to the Differences of Good and Evil;
and when once the Awe of God and
Conscience is gone, there is nothing
can be effectual enough to restrain the
violence of Natural Inclinations.</p>
            <p>There are two sorts of Profane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
too easie to be observed in the
World. Some are Profane in their
Practises; who give way to their
Sensual Inclinations and pursue them,
as they see Occasion, without Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Consideration. These do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44333:7"/>
shake off the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Vertue, although they Act
against them. They know they
ought <hi>to Fear God and to Abstain from
Evil;</hi> but they do neither, leading a
loose, dissolute, and wicked Life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
if they would but consider
what they do, they might soon be
convinced of the Folly of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
because they Act against those
<hi>Principles</hi> which they have seen no
Reason to question, but they have not
the Grace and Resolution to Observe
them. While they continue thus,
there is some hold to be taken of
them; and although their Sins be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Conscience, yet they are not
past Hope; because there is some
Life left, but under great Struglings
and Decays.</p>
            <p>But there are others (I wish I could
only say there had been) who are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi>
out of <hi>Principles;</hi> who not only
<hi>Neglect</hi> Religion, but <hi>Despise</hi> it; and
<hi>Affront</hi> and <hi>Ridicule</hi> it, as far as they
dare with regard to their own Safety.
The other are Mischievous to the
World by <hi>Example,</hi> but these by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;</hi>
Those are Enemies to themselves


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44333:8"/>
and to such as follow them; but these
ought to be look'd on, as the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of all that is Good, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters
of all Evil and Mischief, and
therefore as the truest <hi>Enemies to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
and <hi>the Pest and Bane</hi> of Humane
Society; The Dishonour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of their Age and Country;
And not meerly Enemies to Mankind,
but to God himself, the best and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
Being in the World; whom as far
as in them lies, they endeavour to
Dethrone from his Soveraignty over
it. And where such <hi>Monsters</hi> of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi>
grow numerous and bold, they
bode the most fatal Consequences to
such a People, where they appear
without a Publick Detestation of
them.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) There are such who pretend
to <hi>Honour</hi> God, but do not. <hi>Honour</hi>
is an Act of the Mind, (if it be spoken
of real and inward <hi>Honour,</hi> and not of
the external Signs of it) and it is in
Him that gives, and not in him that
receives it. But yet those who intend
to give <hi>Honour</hi> to another, may do it
in such an improper and unsuitable
manner, that He for whom it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44333:8"/>
may look on it as an Affront
and Dishonour to him. Therefore
he that would give true <hi>Honour</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
must have a just Apprehension
of his Worth and Excellency, and give
it in such a manner as is most becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and agreeable to him.</p>
            <p>Now, there are two ways whereby
Men may be guilty of Dishonouring
God under a pretence of Honouring
him.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By entertaining false Notions
of God in their Minds, and Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own Imaginations instead
of Him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) By doing Honour to him, not
according to his Nature and Will, but
according to their own Intentions and
Imaginations.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By false Notions of God in
their Minds, and by Worshiping
their own Imaginations instead of him;
<hi>i. e.</hi> when Persons form in their
Minds false Imaginations or Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Him; and so give their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
not to the true God, but to an
Idol of their own Fancy. But there
is a great deal of difference between
such Conceptions of God in our Minds,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44333:9"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>


               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44333:10"/>
which fall short of the Perfections of
the Divine Nature, (as all ours must
do for want of Faculties to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him) and such which attribute
something to him which is unworthy
of him. Not, that if any happen to
be mistaken in their Conceptions of
God, we must presently charge them
with Idolatry; for the Scripture
makes that to lie in an open and
publick Dishonouring of God, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that Worship which is alone due
to him, to any thing besides himself;
It is the setting up of another Interest
among Mankind in opposition to his
Power and Soveraignty; It is such an
Exposing the proper Object of Divine
Worship as to render it mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible:
For nothing can be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Disparagement to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
than to be supposed to be like
the Work of Mens hands; or to have
any of his own Creatures to have that
Worship given to them which belongs
to himself; And so it takes away the
due Apprehension, which ought to be
always maintained of the Infinite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between God and the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of his Hands. But these Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44333:10"/>
do not reach to inward false
Conceptions of God; yet they ought
by all possible Means to be avoided
by those who would give unto God
in their Minds the Honour which is
due unto him. And to avoid all
wrong Apprehensions concerning him,
we must settle in our Minds such a
fixed Notion of him, as results from
those Evidences which prove his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20</note>
For, <hi>the invisible things of God,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>are understood by the
things that are made; i. e.</hi> the visible
frame of the World doth afford such
plain Evidence of the Wisdom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Goodness of the Maker of
them, that from thence we may form
a distinct and clear Notion of God in
our Minds, as a Being Infinitely Wise,
Powerful and Good. This is the most
natural, easie, and orderly Conception
we can have of God in our Minds;
because it arises from the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which prove his Being. And
when our Minds are fixed and settled
herein, the next thing is to exclude all
mean and unworthy Thoughts of him,
as inconsistent with his Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Therefore, whatever savours of


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44333:11"/>
Impotency or Cruelty; whatevertends
to abate our Reverence, to lessen our
Esteem, to damp our Affections, or
to cool our Devotion towards him,
cannot be agreeable to those just Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
we ought to have always in
our Minds concerning him. For the
<hi>Honour</hi> of God doth not lie in having
such terrible Apprehensions of his
Majesty and Power and Justice as
may drive us into Horrour and Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair;
but in entertaining such an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his Wisdom, Goodness and
Loving kindness as may incline us to
Love him and to Trust in his Mercy.
And then God is truely honoured by
us, when we preserve a deep Sense
and Awe of him upon our Minds;
When we Adore him for his Infinite
Perfections; When we Esteem him
as the most proper Object of our Love,
as well as of our Fear; When we put
our Trust and Confidence in him, and
depend upon him as to the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of this Life and the Happiness
of another; when <hi>the desire of our Soul
is towards him,</hi> and our Meditation
of him is frequent and serious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to us; when we <hi>set him always


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44333:11"/>
before us,</hi> and direct the Course of our
Lives and Actions to the Pleasing
him; When we dare not wilfully do
any thing to offend him; but make
it our chief study and business to do
what tends to his Honour, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it in the World.</p>
            <p>It is therefore of very great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as to the whole Course of
Religion to keep up in our Minds, such
a true and setled Notion of God, as
may influence our Devotion, reform
our Disorders, inflame our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and keep us from being led aside
by the violent and impetuous Heats
of Imagination. For this is the true
Source of most of the Extravagancies of
Mankind about Religion; They have
no true Notion of God in their Minds,
but they dread his Power, and know
not how to please him; and so run
from one thing to another, through
the several Methods of Superstitions,
or Enthusiasm, as agrees best with
their Fancies; which is so unstable
and uncertain a Principle, that no
steady Course of Religion can be
steer'd by it. A Man who Acts by
Imagination, is like a Ship at Sea


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44333:12"/>
without Anchor or Compass, which
Rouls up and down just as the Wind
and the Waves carry her. But Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Understanding is a steady and
uniform Principle, and being well
fixed from a due and thorough Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the Nature and Will of
God, keeps the Mind even and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and goes on its Course as well as
it can, and makes its way, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Force of the Current and
Tide of Natural Inclination be against
it; and that the Clouds and Vapors
of Imagination often hinder the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of its Motion. Nothing is so
uncomfortable, nothing so ungoverna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as a restless Imagination; and
when it is oppressed with a Religious
Melancholy, then every thing seems
dark and confused; we neither know
God nor our selves as we ought to do,
and we must judge amiss when we
judge by such a false Light: And
therefore our wisest course in such a case
is to be Humble and Patient; to suspend
any Peremptory Judgment as to our
selves till we have clearer Light, and
those Mists and Vapors are dispersed,
which darken and perplex our
Thoughts.</p>

(2.) Men <hi>dishonour</hi> God, when
they pretend to <hi>honour</hi> him, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Will, but their own
Intentions and Imaginations. There
are some things practised and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Christian World, which one
would hardly think possible to have
ever prevailed, had it not been that
they thought to do Honour to God
by them. I shall not insist upon the
pretences in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of
<hi>Honouring God</hi> against his Will, by
giving Divine and Religious Worship
to Images, Saints and Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though there be a great deal of
Folly and Superstition, and real
Dishonour to God in them, yet there
is no such Mischief to the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
unless they take up an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
that God will be honoured by
rooting out and destroying all such as
cannot comply with them in their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Follies. But as the true
Spirit of Religion wears off, that of
Persecution often comes in the place
of it, like Wasps and Hornets out of a
dead Carkass. Thus in the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Church in our Saviour's time, there
was the same outward shew and


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44333:13"/>
Pomp of Religion, which had been in
their best times; and our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
frequented both the Synagogue
Worship and the Solemn Festivals at
the Temple;<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 16. Mat. 23. 2.</note> nay he allow'd that the
Scribes and Pharisees <hi>sate in Moses</hi>'s
<hi>Chair,</hi> and that his Disciples should
observe what they taught agreeable
to the Law; but yet, he elsewhere
charges them that by their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary
Doctrines they had enervated
the Force of the Law; and therefore
<hi>they did honour him with their Lips,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 8.</note> 
               <hi>but
their Heart was far from him; i. e.</hi>
they had no true Love of God or their
Neighbour, but they thought to make
amends for all that, by a wonderful
zeal for their own Traditions and the
lesser things of the Law; which they
shewed not only by an unwearied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
to gain Proselytes, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destroying
all such as opposed their
Designs; and that not in an ordinary
way of Passion and Revenge, but they
would needs have all this to be done
for the Honour and Service of God.
<hi>Whosoever killeth you will think that he
doth God service.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 2.</note> A strange kind of
<hi>Service</hi> indeed, to take away the


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44333:13"/>
Lives of his best and most useful <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants!</hi>
But although no Religion in
the World be so directly contrary to
all Acts of Cruelty an Inhumanity as
the Christian is, yet upon the Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy
of that, the same kind of Spirit
hath risen up and prevailed over too
great a part of the Christian World.
But especially the very same Jewish
Spirit of Zeal and Hypocrisy and
Cruelty had enter'd in these last Ages
into a Society of Men (whom I need
not Name) who have undermined
the genuine Principles of Morality, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
the Spirits of Princes to all the
Effects of a Cruel War and a Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Persecution; and used their utmost
Endeavours to root out all such as
dare not Sacrifice their Consciences to
the Will of a Prince under their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
And which adds to all this,
they have the Impudence to assume
that Motto to themselves, <hi>Ad majorem
Dei Gloriam;</hi> as though they aimed
at nothing but doing greater Honour
to God. Such as these go beyond
<hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas;</hi> for their
Wickedness, although great, was
confined to a narrow Compass, but


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44333:14"/>
these disperse themselves into all States
and Kingdoms, and carry on the same
uniform Design, <hi>viz.</hi> to do all the
Mischief they can under the pretence
of Advancing the <hi>Honour</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) But certainly there is a Way
left to give to <hi>God</hi> that <hi>Honour</hi> which
is due to <hi>Him;</hi> otherwise, it were to
little purpose to say, <hi>Them that honour
me I will honour.</hi> But I shall not take
in here all the ways how we may
<hi>Honour God,</hi> but consider that which
is most proper to the Design of these
Words. For which we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that the External Worship and
Service of God was in general, well
enough kept up and observed in the
<hi>Tabernacle</hi> at <hi>Shiloh.</hi> There the High
Priest attended, the Daily Sacrifices
were offer'd, and the People resorted
thither at the Solemn Feasts from all
parts of the Land: But the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Wickedness in the Sons of
<hi>Eli</hi> had spread themselves so far, that
the People were generally corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the best Part of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which lies in a <hi>Reformation</hi>
of <hi>Manners,</hi> was almost gone.
There were some Pious and Devout


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44333:14"/>
Persons, such as <hi>Eli</hi> himself (a Good
Man but a Bad Magistrate, being
Remiss and Careless in the Execution
of his Office) and no doubt, many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the People, as well as <hi>Elkanah</hi>
and <hi>Hannah,</hi> were devout and serious
in the Service of God, and other Duties
of Religion; but yet God himself
takes notice of <hi>the Wickedness of his
People Israel,</hi> at the time when the
<hi>Ark</hi> was removed from <hi>Shiloh.</hi> And
therefore we have Reason to take
particular Notice of that Passage to
<hi>Eli,</hi> concerning the Reason of the
Punishment of his House, <hi>Because his
Sons made themselves vile and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
them not.</hi> For, their Sins
were of a very Contagious Nature,
and by <hi>not restraining them,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were run into a great degree of
Looseness and Profaneness. So that
it was not for <hi>Eli</hi>'s Personal Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
that God thought himself so
<hi>dishonoured</hi> by him, but for want of
taking due Care for the Suppressing
Profaneness and Corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in others. And this shews the
true way how God may and ought to
be <hi>Honoured</hi> by those who are bound


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44333:15"/>
to take Care of others; <hi>viz.</hi> by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all due Encouragement to
true Religion and Vertue, and by
making use of the most effectual
Means for suppressing Irreligion and
Profaneness.</p>
            <p>And this indeed is a Great and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Design</hi> fit for the greatest Minds
and Persons of the highest Station to
to be Employed about. I cannot
deny, that it is a Difficult Work; for
it is easier to subdue the Bodies than
the Passions of Men; and how many
will rather venture their Lives than
mortify their Lusts? And let them
pretend what they will, we find that
they will sooner part with any thing
than with their Sins. Do we not daily
see that they will let go Honour, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
Interest, Health, and the
hopes of Heaven, rather than those
Vices they have been accustomed to
the Practice of? How can we then
imagine, that the meer Fears of the
Execution of Humane Laws should
presently restrain those, whom no
Fear of Hell or Damnation could hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
Reform? But yet a stop may,
and ought to be put to the insolent


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44333:15"/>
Growth of Profaneness; for if it be
suffered to be too hard for our Laws,
it will in time be too hard for all sort
of Government. Yet how shall a stop
be put to it under such Difficulties?
For it cannot be denied, that we have
Excellent Laws against Vice and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,
and that Magistrates have
had sufficient countenance from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
for the due Execution of them.
But yet the Complaints are great of a
mighty overflowing of all sorts of
Wickedness still among us; I hope
they are not all true; but yet I am
afraid, there is too much ground for
them. What is the Reason of such
a complaint of Profaneness and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
among us at a time we pretend
so much to Reformation? It is no
wonder that the bad Examples of
those who ought to Reform others
bring Vice into Fashion; but when
that cannot be alledged, what is the
Reason that good Examples do so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
towards the <hi>Reforming</hi> others?
It is easie to resolve all into the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Humane Nature; but that
is a General Answer which serves for
all Times and Places, and must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them alike: And if it be a good


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44333:16"/>
and sufficient Answer, it is to little
purpose to talk of <hi>Laws, Religion</hi> and
<hi>Reformation:</hi> For unless they may
have some Power to alter and amend
the Course of Mens Actions, they
signify very little to the real Benefit of
Mankind, no more than <hi>Sea-Marks</hi>
do towards hindring the course of the
Tide; But meer Examples, although
of excellent use to all Ingenuous
Minds, yet to others they are but like
<hi>Statues</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Road, which
point to the right way, but Men will
go which way they please notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>Therefore to <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> the
Magistrates <hi>Power</hi> must be added,
which was appointed for this purpose,
to be <hi>Terrour to those that do evil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 3.</note> as
well as an Encouragement to those
that do well. And then the Apostle
supposeth <hi>the Sword is born in vain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 4.</note>
when the Magistrate is not <hi>the Minister
of God</hi> in this respect; <hi>a Revenger to
execute Wrath upon him that doeth evil.</hi>
It was the Great and Just Honour of
Princes of Old, that by their means,
Mankind was reduced from a rude
and disorderly kind of Life, to the
Practice of Civility and Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44333:16"/>
and it is as great a Foundation
of Honour still, when Men are so
much Apostatized from them, to
bring them back again to the due
Order and Decency of Living. The
Case is much harder of those who are
Degenerate under Laws, than of those
who were so without them; For they
have learnt to despise their Remedy,
and by Arts and Subtilties to avoid
the Force of that, which was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for their Good.</p>
            <p>But, however, none ought to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
from so Excellent a Design;
which Recommends it self to all Wise
and Good Men, and will never want the
Assistance and Prayers of all that are so;
and God himself will in an especial
Manner give <hi>Honour</hi> to Those who
thus <hi>Honour</hi> him in his own Way; by
using the most <hi>Effectual</hi> Means for the
Reforming the Manners of Men.</p>
            <p>But what are those ways which
may be called <hi>Effectual?</hi> It's true, that
depends upon the Favour and Blessing
of God; but it is no hard Matter for
us to judge what are the most likely
Means to be <hi>Effectual.</hi> Such as,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) An Universal Discounten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancing
of all sorts of Vice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness,


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44333:17"/>
be the Persons of what Rank
or Quality soever. For, if those of
the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Eli</hi> be suffer'd to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
the People will follow their
Examples; although the Good Old
Man did not like their Doings, but he
did not take Care enough to <hi>Restrain</hi>
them.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) An Even, Steady, Vigorous
and Impartial Execution of the Laws
against Looseness and Debauchery;
so that it may not look like a sudden
Heat or Design of Popularity, but
proceeding from a due and well-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
Zeal for God and Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) A Wise Choice of fit Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to pursue so Good an End; I
mean such as <hi>Jethro</hi> recommended to
<hi>Moses, Men of Courage and Integrity,
Fearing God and hating Covetousness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 18. 21.</note>
And such I hope are to be found in
the several Parts of the Nation.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Lastly, A diligent Inspection
into the Behaviour of those who are
the proper and immediate Instruments
for carrying on so good a Design.
For, if there be no Inspection after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
it will be look'd on as a meer
matter of Form, or an Order given
out to satisfie the Importunities of


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44333:17"/>
some and the Clamours of others. It
were to be wished, that all who are
Imploy'd in such a Work had an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Mixture of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Zeal;</hi> but
it is not possible to hinder some from
having unequal shares of these; And
it is great Pity so Good a Cause should
Miscarry through the Indiscretion of
any who are Zealous for it. On the
other side, It is possible that some
who pretend to an Equal Zeal for it in
general, may Use such Artifices and
Fair Pretences, as may effectually
baffle and undermine it, while they
seem to be concerned to promote it.
So that, what through the Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Heats of some, the Coldness and
Indifferency of others, and the certain
Averseness all bad Men have to any
real Design of <hi>Reformation,</hi> there is a
Necessity for such an Affair to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
look'd into, and an Account taken
of the Management of it, if any great
Advantage be expected by it.</p>
            <p>And surely no greater Advantage
can be expected as to this World, than
from such a Design managed, as it
ought to be. For, what can we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to our Selves, that can tend more
to promote the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Almighty


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44333:18"/>
God,</hi> which we ought above all other
things to be concerned for. For, <hi>the
Righteous God loveth Righteousness;</hi>
and <hi>he abhors all kind of Wickedness:</hi>
What then can be more Pleasing to
him, than to have all sorts of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
and Profaneness discountenanced,
punished, and if it be possible, root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out? What can tend more to the
<hi>Honour</hi> of his <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> than to shew
so much of a Resemblance to Him, as
to Love what God Loves, and to hate
what he hates; and to imploy their
Power for the same End which God
himself doth his, <hi>viz.</hi> to Advance his
Glory and to do Good to Mankind?
What can tend more to the <hi>Honour</hi> of
our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> than to let the
World see by such Good Works as
these, what the <hi>Reformation</hi> is, which
we aim at; Not meerly of some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
Points, as to Doctrine and
Practise, (which we have earnestly
contended for, and with great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,)
but a true and serious <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Hearts and Lives of Men;
without which all our other Pretences
will fall infinitely short of what God
expects from us, and the very Name
of <hi>Reformation</hi> will be a Reproach to
us.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:44333:18"/>
II. I now proceed to the second
Particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the Rules and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
which God observes in distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Honour among Men, <hi>Them that
honour me, I will honour; but they that
despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which may be understood two
ways;</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. As to the Societies of Men which
have one Common Interest.</item>
               <item>II. As to the Interests and Honour
of Particular Persons.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. As to such Societies of Men,
which have one Common Interest.
And so it implies, that the
Welfare and Reputation, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Condition of such, depends
upon their Zeal and Concernment for
God and Religion. But here, we
meet very great Difficulties; for <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and <hi>Experience</hi> seem to contradict
each other about it. On the one side,
it seems most agreeable to the Justice
of Divine Providence to Reward and
Punish those in this World who will
not be Capable of being rewarded or
punished in another; for there will
be no Communities in another World.
But on the other side, we cannot deny
matter of common Experience; for,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44333:19"/>
how long have the <hi>Turkish and Papal
Monarchies</hi> (to name no other) flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
when the <hi>seven Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi>
and the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> have been
long since destroyed? How strangely
hath <hi>Mahometism</hi> spread in the <hi>Eastern</hi>
Parts of the World? And what a
Check hath there been, upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
in these <hi>Western</hi> Parts?
With what a mighty Torrent did it
prevail at first? Then it stood at a
stand, and hath of late Years gone so
much backward, and suffer'd so very
much in many Parts of it: And yet
we think, and that very justly, that
the <hi>Honour of God</hi> is concerned in all
this. What shall we say to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
Oppressors of Mankind who
make no Conscience of ruining Cities
and Countries, and offering Violence
to the Bodies and Consciences of Men
to Advance and Support their own
Grandeur; and yet have been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to prevail so far as to be made an
Argument against Providence by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical
Men? It is to be hoped that
God in his own time will vindicate
his <hi>Honour</hi> and clear this point to the
Satisfaction of all reasonable Men;
but yet, we cannot penetrate into the


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44333:19"/>
Wisdom and Secrets of Providence.
God will (no doubt) take Care of
his own <hi>Honour;</hi> but he is not bound
to give such Men an Account of the
Ways and Methods and Seasons of his
doing it. He often raises up a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
fit for his purpose, and makes
them as a Scourge to Neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and when they have done his
Work, he suffers them to be humbled,
if not destroyed, by the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
they have used to others. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he raises up one Kingdom and
Nation against another, when their Sins
make them ripe for Vengeance; and
so he takes the Potsheards of the Earth
and breaks them upon one another;
and thus, by their mutual Punishment,
they both become the Executioners of
his Wrath; and we cannot determine
by the Event which was in the greater
Guilt. So that God takes Care of his
own <hi>Honour,</hi> by Methods we are not
able to comprehend. For who can
weigh the Nations in a Balance, and
determine how far the Sins of one
doth exceed the other? And if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know the Number and Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a People Sins, we can never
fix the Measures and Degrees of their
Punishment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:44333:20"/>
But, however, some things are certain;</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the Sins of a Nation do
naturally tend to the Weakness and
Dishonour of it. Thus a factious,
seditious, turbulent Temper, not only
is the Reproach of a People; but the
ready way to destroy it. And yet it
hath so happen'd, that when the
Factions have been almost equally
poised, as at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> they
have raised such an Emulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, which by their endeavours
to out-vie each other, hath for some
time preserved their Country. Who
can deny that Luxury and Debauchery,
and all sorts of Intemperance, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sink the Reputation of a People, but
effeminates and softens them, and
makes them Careless and Idle, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless
of any thing but what makes
for their own Ease and Voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
And in all humane probability,
such a Nation must sink, when a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of more Wisdom and Courage and
Resolution, makes it their business to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
them. So that these sorts of
Sins are <hi>Natural Causes</hi> of weakning the
Power and Interest of a Nation. But
there are other Sins, as Profaneness
and Contempt of God and Religion,


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44333:20"/>
Hypocrisy, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of such
which Work as <hi>Moral Causes,</hi> God
himself is the only Judge, when the
Measure of their Iniquity is filled up.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Sometimes God steps out of
his Ordinary Method and Course of
Providence, either in a way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Mercy. And then he more
particularly shows, that <hi>those that
Honour him, he will honour; and those
who despise him shall be lightly esteemed.</hi>
These things are not every days Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
but when they do happen they
deserve to be taken Notice of, in a
more than Ordinary Manner.<note place="margin">Eudem. l. 7. c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
who was no great Friend to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as to Humane Affairs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses,
that he did not know what to
make of <hi>the extraordinary Success some
Persons had in their Affairs, without
any extraordinary visible Causes.</hi> It is
possible, he might have the Success of
his <hi>Macedonian Friends</hi> in his Thoughts;
who swallow'd up the <hi>Common-wealths</hi>
of <hi>Greece,</hi> as so many Morsels, and
then destroy'd the mighty <hi>Persian
Monarchy.</hi> But in these Cases, he
allows a <hi>Divine Impulse,</hi> carrying
them on beyond the Ordinary Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of humane Prudence; and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44333:21"/>
so many things in Order to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
as nothing but a Divine Hand
could manage. And when great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
come to a Nation in such a
manner, a more than Ordinary Degree
of Thankfulness is justly expected, that
God may be <hi>honoured</hi> in a particular
manner for the Deliverance he Works
by such Means, and the Mercies he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
or continues thereby.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As to particular Persons; how far
this holds, will appear by these things:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That Esteem and Honour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follows the Opinion of anothers
Desert or Excellency. For it is not
an Arbitrary thing, but is founded on
the Supposition of something that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
it. It is like the Assent given
to Mathematical Evidence, which is
not because they will do it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot help it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Sincere Practise of Piety
and Vertue doth command Esteem and
Reverence. Hypocrisy indeed lessens it
to the utmost degree; because it argues
a mean and false Temper of Mind;
but there is nothing in true Religion
but what tends to raise Esteem, For
it implies all the things which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by all Persons to gain <hi>Honour</hi>


               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44333:21"/>
among Men. For one that is truely
Religious is a true Lover of God and
of Mankind; He is grateful to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour,
and always owns in the
most solemn manner his Dependence
upon him, both by Prayers and
Praises; He is ready to do Good to
all Men, as far as is consistent with
his Duty to God; He is just, righteous,
and merciful, sober and temperate in
the whole Course of his Life; He acts
not by Chance, or for by Ends; but by
a fixed Principle of being and doing
Good; He keeps himself within the
Bounds which God hath set him; and
with Chearfulness and Resolution sets
himself to do and suffer his Will; and
hath so much Courage, as to dare to
do his Duty, and is afraid of nothing
so much as Offending God. And now
let any one judge, whether there be
any thing Mean or Contemptible in
all this; whether every one that hears
this Character doth not wish it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to himself. And that is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
token that it brings Honour and
Esteem with it.</p>
            <p>Let me then, for a Conclusion of
all, Recommend the Practise of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
and <hi>Vertue</hi> to all such as are the


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44333:22"/>
most concerned for <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Esteem.</hi>
The World is always vain enough to
flatter Greatness, either out of Weakness
or Design; but true Greatness of Mind
despises Flattery; and where that is
wanting in any, this very Flatterer
despises them. But this is a Way to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reach of Contempt,<note place="margin">Micah 6. 8.</note> 
               <hi>To do Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly
with God;</hi> and these are the things
which God himself assures us are the
main Parts of our Duty. If we be
Careless of God's Honour and Service
now, the time will shortly come, when
we shall heartily wish we had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
For, how great soever
your <hi>Honour</hi> be now, you and that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
must in a little time be <hi>laid in
the Dust.</hi> And then the main Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
will be according to the <hi>Honour</hi>
we have done to God; For, although
the Text doth hold good, as to this
World, as I have already shew'd; yet
the most glorious Accomplishment
of it will be made Evident to all
Mankind, that <hi>Those that honor him, God
will honour; and they that despise him
shall be lightly esteemed.</hi>
