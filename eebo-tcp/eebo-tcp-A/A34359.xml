            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NOt only our Education, and the common Courſe of our Studies for many Years, but much more the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Frame and Agreement of Minds, have by a ſecret Sympathy drawn our Souls into the ſacred Tye of a firm and inviolable Friendſhip; and I ſhould diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and highly derogate from that Divine Vertue, if I did not as well participate in your Sorrows, as ſhare in your Felicity.</p>
            <p>When the laſt Poſt brought me the unfortunate News of the Death of your beloved <hi>Placidia,</hi> I was equally concerned with your ſelf for her immature Fate: And becauſe I find your great Sorrow makes you uncapable of giving your ſelf that relief which you have frequently beſtowed upon others, from thoſe ſeveral Arguments, that both Religion and Philoſophy furniſh us withal; ſuffer me at leaſt now to refreſh your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate Mind with ſome of thoſe Topicks, which (when ſequeſtred from the Noiſe and Tumult of the World, and locked in the pleaſing Union of each others Soul) we were wont to entertain our ſelves with upon ſuch Spectacles of Mortality; which I ſhall ſet down in a looſe manner, not being over-curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ranking them in a diſtinct Order and Method.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:44762:3"/>
The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> ſuppoſe the Deſcent of Humane Souls into Terreſtrial Bodies, not to be equal and alike in all: For as there were ſome who let themſelves looſe without bounds or meaſures, to all the irregular and exorbitant Motions of their congenite Bodies, and in whom the <hi>Plaſtick</hi> Life became ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely invigorated, as quite to ſuppreſs and ſilence that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Principle, to whoſe Inſpirations while they carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, they remained happy in the free Exertions of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more intellectual Life: And, by this means, taking their full ſwinge, and drowning themſelves in Corporeal Joys, they became perfectly unfit for any other degree of Vitality, but the Terreſtrial, and muſt have lain in a State of Inactivity for ever, had not a Gracious Providence ſent them down upon Earth to try their Fortunes once more: So there are others, who deſcended indeed ſomewhat from the height and ſummity of the Aethereal Life, and experienced the Joys and Pleaſures of the lower Life; yet ſtill within ſuch bounds and limits, as did not utterly incapacitate them for a Return, but thereby they contracted a nearer Aptitude and Fitneſs of actuating a Terreſtrial Body. Now as the firſt of theſe are obſerved in theſe their Earthly Bodies to have a ſtrong Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity to Vice, and are carried headlong to all manner of Gratifications of Senſe, be they never ſo feculent and courſe, in ſpight of all better Perſwaſions to the contrary, and are very hardly and difficultly reclaimed: So the other coming into the World with a good Meaſure of that Divine Life, ſtill awakened in them, notwithſtanding the Encumbrances of Fleſh and Blood, they make more eaſie Returns, and more happily recover that Bleſſed Life (to which they have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity yet remaining) upon their Departure from their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bodies.</p>
            <p>And if this Hypotheſis of theirs be true, your <hi>Placidia</hi> may well be thought to be one of this latter ſort, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring even in her blooming Years ſuch an Angelical Temper, which diſcovered it ſelf in a quick and lively Senſe of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a firm and radicated Love of Vertue, of Sanctity and Purity, of Innocency and a hearty Benignity, Kindneſs, and Readineſs of Mind, to do all the good Offices ſhe could to all the World. And for you now to bewail her Death, it is to be ſorry for her Return to the Poſſeſſion of that bleſſed Life, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44762:3"/>
full Enjoyment of which was greatly interrupted by her ſtay and continuance in this her Earthly Priſon. And the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſeems to call the Departure of a Holy Soul from its Earthly Tenement, by the Name of a Return, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23.<hi>—having a deſire,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to depart,</hi> but is more fitly rendred <hi>to return, viz.</hi> to a Man's own Houſe, or Native Home, as the Word is uſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 36. And to this may be imputed her haſty flight from this Earthly Region, it being a merciful Providence to her, that that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life, which ſhone ſo bright through the Veil of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, might not be in danger to be extinguiſhed and oppreſſed by a longer Continuance under the weight and preſſure of ſluggiſh and dull Fleſh and Blood.</p>
            <p>Give me leave farther to repeat (not as if you were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it, but that I may attempt ſomething to break and diſpel that Cloud of Sorrow which ſeems to ſit heavy upon your Brows) what the Divine <hi>Plato</hi> tells us, that true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy is nothing but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Meditation of Death; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Separation of the Soul from its cloſe adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Body, that in that abſtracted and ſilent State, it might more freely contemplate Truth, and the bright <hi>Idea</hi>'s of the incorporeal World. And there is great Reaſon for this: For (as the ſame contemplative Philoſopher informs us) when the Body, with all its Train of Luſts and Affections, ſhall by a kind of Magical Devocation draw the Animadverſion after it, the Mind is filled with a kind of Tumult, and ſtruck with Amazement, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and, by this means is rendred unable and uncapable to diſcern the Face of Truth.</p>
            <p>Wherefore he that would philoſophize aright, and attain the Height and Perfection of Humane Nature, muſt learn to die to the Body, and ſeparate himſelf from all Contagion of the Animal Life, and have no farther Communication with it than pure Neceſſity requires. For this Disjunction and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Soul from Senſe and Corporeity, is a Prelude to her Immortality, and the raiſing her from this obſcure Life ſhe leads in the Body, to a Capacity of converſing with the Root and Centre of all Life in more pure and defecate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44762:4"/>
And now in this Philoſophy, <hi>Placidia</hi> was an excellent and early Proficient, having rarely well learned the Art of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugating all Corporeal Motions, Affections, and Deſires, to the <hi>Imperium,</hi> and Rule of the Intellectual Life; never ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any youthful Pleaſures or Delights, to betray her to an Action of Ignominy or Shame; but uſing ſuch innocent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, as only ſerved for the unbending and Relaxation of the Mind for a while, that it might return with freſh Alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vigour to a preſs Obſervance of the great End of her Creation. She never was taken with any of thoſe Fooleries and ſecular Vanities, with which her Sex is the moſt eaſily betrayed, chuſing rather a becoming Neatneſs than affected Curioſity in her Dreſs; and ſpending that Time in her Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and the ſecret Retirements between God and her own Soul, which others would more vainly conſume, <hi>inter pecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; ſpeculum.</hi> Nor ought you to wonder to ſee your <hi>Placidia</hi> in ſuch a Philoſophical Garb, while ſhe endeavoured after that, which you and I labour for, and which is not only the Top and Summity of <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> but of <hi>Chriſtian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> it ſelf. For what elſe is this dying to the Animal and Corporeal Life in <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> but only the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Mortiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all our Earthly Luſts and Paſſions? Or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the raiſing of the Soul to behold and unite with that Firſt and Original Pulchritude, but in the Chriſtian Dialect, a Participation of the Divine Nature? And can you now over-lament, that Death hath perfected that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Separation or Sejun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Soul from the Body, which <hi>Placidia</hi> herſelf had ſo happily begun? Eſpecially, when you conſider that by this practical Meditation, ſhe daily made Death familiar to her, and by dreſſing up afore-hand her Soul for Immortality, verified what in the conſtant courſe of her Sickneſs ſhe would frequently ſay, that <hi>ſhe was not afraid to die,</hi> nor diſturbed at the Name or Thoughts of that King of Terrors, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready become dead to all the Blandiſhments and Ineſcations of Senſe, and, by an early Piety ſhown her ſelf only alive to God and Vertue. For doubtleſs nothing more fatally threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the utter Extinction of the Diviner Powers of the Soul, and takes away all Care of a Future State, than the luxuriant growth of the Animal Life. And therefore thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44762:4"/>
themſelves wholly to Senſuality, they do (as <hi>Cicero</hi> 
               <note place="margin">De Conſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</note> ſpeaks) <hi>ſtertere potius quàm ullo pacto vivere, ſnort rather than any way live;</hi> or more fully, according to the Apoſtle, <hi>they are dead while they live;</hi> that State only being worthy to be <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5 6.</note> called Life, when the Soul is united to, and made one with the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if you look upon Death in a Phyſical Sence, you ſhall find it only the Conſopition, or laying aſleep of ſome Faculties, that others may awake and act in their ſtead. And when the Terreſtrial Congruity is either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unwound, or violently broken aſunder, another and more large Capacity and Degree of Life immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes. For, queſtionleſs, the Soul of Man was made by the eternal Wiſdom, with a Capacity of being united with ſome other Matter beſide Fleſh and Blood, as not only the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Body promiſed us at the Reſurrection, but the Place of our Habitation and Abode do evidently declare. And that between Death and the Reſurrection, ſhe ſhould be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſtript and unbared of all Matter, is hard to conceive, eſpecially when both the Nature of the Thing it ſelf, and the Stories of Apparitions in all Ages ſo fairly invite us to think that an Aereal or Aethereal Body will naturally fall to her ſhare, ſo ſoon as ſhe hath quitted the Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. So that there is no fear of any ones being loſt, or that all Life is extinguiſhed upon the Death of the Body; but a higher Power, which has indeed been laid aſleep in this Earthly Body, takes its turn, and the Soul is ſo much the more happy, by how much larger that Sphere of Life is into which ſhe is awakened by her Diſunion from the Terreſtrial Body.</p>
            <p>To go out of this Body, is for the Soul to aſcend, to go forward, to diſpread herſelf, and to have larger Faculties; but to deſcend, is to go backward, and to pinion herſelf, and fall into the moſt inert and ſluggiſh Life of all. Hence the learned <hi>Origen</hi> doubted not to ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that our Terreſtrial Nativity is really the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Death: Becauſe when we come into theſe Bodies, our nobler Faculties are then contracted and laid aſleep, and we ſink down from a better and freer to a worſe and narrower State of Life.

Here it is that the Soul is denied the ſight of that Eternal Pulchritude, which ſhe once ſaw with open Face, but now converſes with it as it were in a Dream, and the Obſcurity of a Nocturnal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, beholding but a glimpſe of it through the Cranies of Mortality; partly becauſe the Place of her Abode, and the Condition of her Life mix'd with the various Inquina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Earth, diſtract her Attention from that lovely Spectacle. For that uniform Beauty deſcending from above, muſt needs appear leſs, and change its Nature, when fallen among the foul Embraces and Twinings of Terreſtrial Joys: Like a River emptying its Channel into the brackiſh Sea, retains a while its ſweet Waters; but when the rude Winds and Waves aſſault their weaker Force, they are ſoon ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, and loſe both their Name and Nature in the Boſom of their more potent Adverſary. Thus it is with us in our Earthly Bodies; but when we are ſet at liberty, and delivered from theſe Jails, we enter upon a State of a more enlarged Life, and new Scenes of Things preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our View, and our Souls begin to find their Wings to grow again, whereby they ſoar aloft in the undiſturbed Manſions of Bleſſedneſs, where their Faces are never turned from that Intellectual Sun that ſhines with uninterrupted Beams upon them.</p>
            <p>Think with your ſelf now, Sir, that if departed Souls know any thing that is done here below, and it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Placidia</hi> to give you a Viſit, whether ſhe would

            <p>I know it is a common Argument, and frequently made uſe of upon ſuch Occaſions as this, to tell you that ſhe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from all thoſe Evils a Terreſtrial Body is obnoxious to; yet hath it great Truth and Weight in the Conſideration of it. For though the Days of Man upon Earth be few, and his Life contracted into a narrower ſpace than in the firſt Ages of the World when Nature was in her youthful Gaiety, yet they are full of Miſery and Calamity, and every Act of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44762:6"/>
Life is divided into many Scenes of Sorrow. We begin our Days with weeping, and the firſt Tribute we pay to the Light of the Sun, is to preſent him with a Tear and watry Eyes, as a ſure Preſage of our future Miſery. And if we out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the Chances of Childhood, and arrive to the Exerciſe of our diſcriminative Faculties, and make our choice of that variety of Inſtances the World preſents unto us, we go from a leſs to a greater degree of Affliction. For whereas before we could only grieve and ſigh under a preſent Pain, now our Grief is redoubled by reflecting on it, and we are the more miſerable by knowing that we are ſo. Thoſe very Diſeaſes that carry a little Infant with quietneſs to its Grave, force us into effeminate Ejulations and Impatience; and all becauſe our Apprehenſions and Reflexive Acts are greater than a Childs. Should we view Man in his declining State, when his Sun is ſetting and leaving the <hi>Horizon</hi> of Time, and we ſhall find old Age like a teeming Womb, full of Miſeries and Sorrows; a rough and uneven Path, wherein Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a welcome Reſpite and breathing Place, to recover our Spirits wearied with the Troubles of this Life, and inables us to reſume our progreſs to Immortality. In a word, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding Cares, diſappointments of our Hopes and Expectations, Croſſes, and doleful Circumſtances, Sickneſſes and Diſeaſes, make up the ſumm of Humane Life. Beſides this, when a good Perſon reflects upon the Depravity and Wickedneſs of the World, the ſtench whereof is ready to choak him, he is ſenſibly pained, and cannot but teſtifie his inward Grief by his Tears. But now Death removes him from all the Objects of his Diſlike and Averſation, and the Grave puts an end to all Humane Miſeries: <hi>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and there the weary be at reſt; There the Priſoners reſt together, they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>hear not the Voice of the Oppreſſor.</hi> And as for Moral Evils, there is an end to them likewiſe: For holy Souls are out of the reach of the ſly Tempter, nor can the crooked Serpent wind himſelf again into the Celeſtial Paradiſe.</p>

            <p>Nor would I have you to forget <hi>Placidia,</hi> and caſt her Image quite out of you Mind, as the manner of too many is, who when they have interr'd the Bodies of their Friends, and the Solemnity is over, think themſelves no more concerned in them, than if they had never been: For both Nature and Religion allow us to remember them, with all that Eſteem and Honour that is due to ſuperior Beings, whom the Lord of the Univerſe has grac'd with ſignal Marks of his Favour in the Regions of Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>Whenever therefore you admit her into your Thoughts, let it not be as ſhe was in her earthly Tabernacle, with all thoſe Diſadvantages and Alterations that Death made in it, when he was pulling it down; but rather repreſent her to your ſelf in thoſe bright Robes in which ſhe converſes with bleſſed Spirits, where the external Shape faithfully anſwers the inward Pulchritude of the Soul, and the yielding Matter is framed according to the beautiful <hi>Idea</hi> preſented by the Mind to the <hi>Plaſtick</hi> Life.

and palpable a Demonſtration of the Souls future Felicity as can be deſired, in the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour? With what Tranſports of Joy ſhould we meet our approaching Fate, when we are leaving this Region of Malediction, wherein our Souls are entomb'd in our Bodies? And when we aſcend to thoſe Immortal Manſions, where our Joy is never interrupted by any Cloud of Sorrow, where Love is without any Diſſimulation or Luſt, and where all is Life and Happineſs for evermore? And truly it ſeems evident to me, that <hi>Placidia</hi> had ſome Prelibations of this glorious State, which vigorouſly poſſeſſed her Soul, even in the very laſt moment of her Life, when opening her Eyes that were more than half o'ercaſt and clouded with the Shadow of Death, and looking upon her mourning Relations, with a chearful Smile, ſhe took her laſt Farewel of them and all the World. When all other Powers and Faculties of the bodily Life were fallen aſleep, this ſhe left as the only Teſtimony then remaining of that exalted ſenſe ſhe had of thoſe Heavenly Pleaſures ſhe was going to enjoy. Here it was indeed that ſhe excell'd her ſelf, and here ſhow'd the Gallantry of her intemerated Youth, and how far true Vertue and Religion will prevail above all earthly Things.</p>
            <p>There is a certain Greatneſs in the mind of Man, which Chriſtianity came not to extinguiſh, but to confirm and advance, by better Arguments than the choiceſt <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philoſophy could ever furniſh us withal, whereby a Man is carried out in an even Calmneſs of Spirit, not only to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve great Things, but to a noble ſufferance, and a Will purely conformable to the Will of Heaven in the moſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous Accidents, and ſuch as the moſt nearly touch a Man's ſelf, under a full aſſurance that all Things are ordered by a benign and righteous Providence, which as it ſorts all Beings according to the previous Diſpoſitions of their Minds, ſo takes the moſt particular Care of vertuous Souls. And if a Perſon may (as there is no doubt of it) double the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Heaven in this Life, by the conſtant and ſincere Practice of Religion and Vertue; your poor <hi>Placidia</hi> went not away from hence, without a double Guardiance, it being

doubtful, whether Goodneſs were more her choice than inſpired into her, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Reward of all her Labours and Contentions, from a Judge as kind and merciful as juſt. Which of all Things in the World ought not only to allay your Grief, but adminiſter a mighty occaſion of rejoicing, in being under God the Author of the Life and Being of ſo happy a Creature that is now gone to the bleſſed Regions of Holy and Immortal Spirits.</p>
            <p>Indeed if there were an utter extinction and going out of Being when we die, or that our Souls ſlept with their Bodies in the cold Clods of the Earth, then I know not whether we ſhould have Tears enough left to bewail our Children, whom an unkind Fate bereaves us of in the Flower of their Years. But both theſe proceeding from dark Melancholy, and a too fond love of theſe earthly Bodies, can make no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon a truly Religious and Philoſophical Spirit, who would ſooner endure the tearing of his Limbs aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than ſuffer ſuch heavy and cold Conceits to entomb his Mind.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not go about to prove the Immortality of the Soul from Philoſophical Principles, ſince you know very well where it is treated of in that kind on purpoſe, but only affirm that the contrary overthrows the whole Deſign of Religion; which way of arguing I ſhall briefly touch upon, not knowing but this Letter may come into leſs skilful hands than your own. <hi>If in this Life only we have hope in Chriſt,</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>we are of all Men moſt miſerable:</hi> If all the <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19.</note> Advantages we reap from the Goſpel are terminated in this Life, and our hope of future Happineſs end with our few and evil days, we that are Chriſtians are the moſt unhappy Perſons, the moſt proper Objects of Compaſſion in the World. To what end or purpoſe came the Goſpel? Or was it the Deſign of that everlaſting Goodneſs, which is ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully diffuſed and ſpread over the whole Creation, to make our ſhort Life a continued Act of Calamity and Sorrow? Can Heaven's righteous Ruler take pleaſure in betraying
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44762:8"/>
the innocent Credulity of the moſt harmleſs Men in the World? Shall the wicked live by Rapine and Injuſtice, and freely enjoy whatever Pleaſure their Natures are capable of, and ſhall only Vertue and Righteouſneſs be the unhappy Objects of Miſery and Affliction? If this be the Order of that eternal Juſtice which rules and governs the World, ſure Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, and Equity are but idle Names, and 'tis our Fancies that have made the diſtinction between Good and Evil. How much more bleſſed are they who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard the ſound of the Goſpel, or having heard it, ſtopt their Ears againſt thoſe alluring Charms, than thoſe that have lived in a faithful Obedience to it, and waded even through a Sea of Blood to their long expected Joy, and are at laſt deprived of it? The <hi>Epicurean</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die;</hi> let us take our Portion of good things while we are here, and live jovially, for this is our Portion, and our Lot is this; were both noble and pleaſant, if this were true, that our Spirits vaniſhed like the fleeting Air when we depart this Life. But our Hopes are grounded upon a deep and firm Foundation; for if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is ſuch a Being as God in the World, any Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence preſiding over the Affairs of Mankind, his Veracity and Truth will ſecure our future State. For he having ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally declared to all Men by the Voice of Nature, but more fully by Chriſtianity, the Immortality and Perſonal Subſiſtence of the Soul after Death, it would lie as an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Blot upon this moſt precious Attribute, if there were really no ſuch thing to be expected. Nor is the Juſtice of God leſs concerned in this Affair, a great part of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a faithful Diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments; all which were utterly loſt, unleſs the ſouls of Men ſubſiſt after Death, and be capable of Pleaſure and Pain.</p>
            <p>And as for that extravagant Dream, that the Soul ſleeps with the Body in the Grave till the Day of the Reſurrection, I am bold to ſay, That Senſuality is the Patroneſs of this heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Opinion. The Nature of the Soul of Man is ſuch, as makes it capable of Moral Good and Evil; and for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, every Man fatally adjoyning himſelf either to Heaven or Hell in this Life, it will inevitably fall to his ſhare to be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44762:9"/>
or Miſerable when departed out of it: Which cannot be, except the Memory and Senſe of his paſt Actions return, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Separation from the Body: And that it does ſo, is not only a probable, but neceſſary Conſequence from the Nature of the Soul. Now the Pleaſure and Pain reſulting from Good and Evil Actions, will not ſuffer the Soul to fall into ſuch a Stupour and Lethargick Sleep. God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living; <hi>for all live unto him,</hi> ſaid our Lord. But if the Souls of Men fall into ſo permanent a Sleep, they are dead, or rather annihilated (for not to Be, and not to be conſcious of ones Being, are much one) and their Recuperation to Life, is to them as it were a new Creation, neither know they why they are either Rewarded or Puniſhed, becauſe Death and that Narcotick State which immediately follows it (according to this ſottiſh Fancy) waſhes away the Memory of all paſt Actions whatever. To this we may add the Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in their Celeſtial Robes to our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour at his Transfiguration upon <hi>Mount Tabor,</hi> when his Face ſhone like the Sun, and his Rayment became white as the Light, and thoſe two Divine Perſonages foretold the good Events of his Death, and ſpake words of comfort to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conſideration of his Inglorious Paſſion: Which is an evident proof that the Souls of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did not ſleep when they left their Bodies, but that they now live and act in the Felicities of Jeſus, to whom, in the days of his Fleſh, they brought Relief and Comfort. Nor can I ſee how the Soul of the Thief on the Croſs could be with our Saviour in Paradiſe, or if it were there, what advantage it could reap, if immediately upon its ſeparation from the Body, it fell into ſuch a deep ſleep as not to be awakened but by the ſound of the laſt Trumpet. And as little Reaſon can be given why the Apoſtles Affections ſhould be carry'd out in ſuch a longing deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt, if to be with Chriſt were to ſleep till the Day of Judgment, in the cold Sods of the Earth.</p>
            <p>But to paſs on to ſome other Conſiderations, one or other of which may perchance be as <hi>a Word ſpoken in Seaſon,</hi> and prove ſubſervient for the reviving a languiſhing and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit. Do we not ſee all Things in Nature haſten to

The hoary Winter cuts off all the Summer's Pride and Glory, and Trees and Herbs deſpoiled of their green and leavy Coverings lie as dead, till the return of the Sun, and the genital Heat of Nature, raiſe them to a new and freſh Life again. Are not Beaſts, and Fowls, and Fiſhes, and the whole Animal Kingdom, in a perpetual Mutation and Succeſſion? Nay, the Heavenly Bodies themſelves are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from Mortality and Corruption, as is evidently ſeen in the appearing of new Stars, unknown before, and the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den diſappearing of old ones, and in the Trajection of Comets thoſe vaſt and ominous Bodies through the Skirts of the Sun's <hi>Vortex</hi> above the Orb of <hi>Saturn.</hi> The Sun himſelf, the common <hi>Focus,</hi> that imparts Life and Heat to ſo many Worlds which keep their conſtant Circulations about him, yet ſeems to prognoſticate his own Death and Extinction, by thoſe <hi>Maculae</hi> or Spots carried around his Face. And can you think a tender Body of Fleſh and Blood, though <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> yet conſiſting of mortal Principles, ſhould not die and periſh? But though Death may prey upon, and conſume the Elements of our Terreſtrial Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet the Soul remains ſafe and entire; and when clothed upon with her Heavenly and Angelical Body, will be perfectly out of the reach of Fate, and ſecure in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that bright and glorious Life, which is juſtly ſaid to be eternal.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Placidia</hi> was taken away in the Flower of her Youth, and you are bereaved of the Comfort of your Old Age. <q>I acknowledge, indeed, that Children are one of the greateſt Temporal Bleſſings Men are capable of in this Life; and therefore the being deprived of them, is one of the greateſt Temporal Infelicities. They are ſo many Images of our ſelves, and by them we are in a ſort kept from the devouring Jaws of Silence and Forgetfulneſs, and have a kind of Immortality imparted to us in this World. In them is contained the ſtraiteſt and neareſt Bond of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and they are the greateſt Comfort and Support of our Old Age. All living Creatures ſeem to acknowledge ſomething of this Pleaſure and Sweetneſs in bringing up their Young Ones.</q> But what then? Is the loſs of them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44762:10"/>
an Evil never to be redreſt? Is it a Wound that is beyond all poſſibility of a Cure? To ſend a Child in a Voyage to the remoteſt part of the <hi>Indies,</hi> from whence perhaps he may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return, is carried off more lightly than to follow him to his Grave; when yet to my Apprehenſion there is no ſuch great difference, but what is made by a weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Imagination. For though we ſee not our departed Friends with our bodily Eyes, yet they, and we, and thoſe Pure and Majeſtick Beings, the Angels, under God the Supreme <hi>Monarch,</hi> make one Polity, Society, or Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that extends and reaches from Heaven to Earth; and the diſtance is no more, than that they, according to their ſeveral Ranks and Qualities, live above in the ſplendid and more Noble Buildings, and we in the Suburbs, the meaneſt and loweſt Places of the City of the Great King. <hi>In my Father's Houſe are many Manſions,</hi> ſays Chriſt. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſeems to intimate as much; <hi>But ye</hi>

               <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innumerable Company of Angels, to the General Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt-born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt Men made perfect.</hi> For what is it that makes a City or Society but this? 1. That there be ſome Head or Supreme. 2. That they be all governed by the ſame Laws. 3. That they all drive on the ſame common Deſign for the Publick Good. And ſuch is the Nature and Conſtitution of this Celeſtial Polity; foraſmuch as the Angels, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls, and good Men upon Earth, have all one Supreme Head and Governor, even Jeſus Chriſt, the Sovereign Lord of the whole Creation. And their Laws are exactly and perfectly the ſame, being nothing but the eternal Sanctions of Righteouſneſs, Truth, and Goodneſs; and hence we deſire a perfect Correſpondence with the Angelical Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern in our Obedience to the Will of God, that it may <hi>be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> And laſtly, they all unite and join in the carrying on, and promoting the ſame Great Intereſt and Deſign; namely, the Diffuſion and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Bleſſed Life and Nature of God to all capable Subjects. So that it is only our falſe Apprehenſions of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44762:10"/>
Things, that creates all the Evil and Affliction of our Minds. And if we would take Things by the right handle, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the various circumſtances of Life and Death, as they are in themſelves, and unmix'd with our vain Fancies of them, we might free our ſelves from a very great part of our Miſery and Trouble: As is excellently well repreſented by the Muſe of that incomparably learned Perſon, Dr. <hi>H. More,</hi> at the end of his Philoſophical Poems.</p>

Say now that your Daughter was taken away in her Youth, and the Prime of her Years; yet ought not this to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted any harm or detriment, but rather to be reckoned a Bleſſing, according to that common Proverb,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Nam quem tuetur, at<expan>
                     <am>

               <l>Juvenis Supremum Mortis intrat limitem.</l>
            </q>
            <p>To this Sence,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Whom God encircles with his Love,</l>
               <l>He takes in Youth to Joys above.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For Youth is commonly more intemerated and unſpotted, and free from thoſe Vices and Temptations that older Age is obnoxious to. The Soul is then more Divine, and its Affections more united with that eternal Pulchritude, that irradiates holy Minds, than when it is diſtracted with the Cares of the World, or ſunk into the Love of Riches, earthly Pleaſures, and the vain Affectation of Honours, the uſual Baits of elder Years. Beſides, you know not but it might be a merciful Proviſion of a benign Providence to her, not only to be delivered from the Snares and Temptations of an untoward World, but that ſhe might not participate of thoſe Miſeries and Calamities to which a longer continuance might have expos'd her. Hence (if we give Credit to the Poets) it was reckoned as a Bleſſing of the Gods to <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Achilles,</hi> that they were both taken away in the full ſtrength and vigour both of their Bodies and Minds. And happy doubtleſs are they, who neither conſtrained by the defects of Nature, and the Fatigues of old Age, nor yet broken with Miſeries, and weary of living; but part with this World, though in their juvenile Years, with a ſedate and compoſed Mind, devolving themſelves wholly upon that eternal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which aſſuredly acts and does all Things always for the beſt.</p>
            <p>And yet if we calculate Things aright, the Account of Life is not to be taken by the number of Years, but from the Time that has been ſpent in adorning and perfecting the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44762:11"/>
Mind in Virtue and Goodneſs. And a Perſon may truly be ſaid to have lived a great while in a few Years. <hi>Cardan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of one <hi>Similis,</hi> who ordered this to be engraven on his Tomb, <hi>Here lies</hi> Similis, <hi>who was a great many Years old, but had lived only ſeven;</hi> accounting that only Life which had been ſpent in Vertue; thus many Men die before they begin to live. For certainly it is the moſt miſerable thing in the World, to live to all others, and not to live at all to one's ſelf; that Life being not to be called ours, which is not ſome way or other laid out in the benefiting of the Mind. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſays that at the River <hi>Hypanis,</hi> there are a ſort of little Animals which live but one day, being born with the riſing Sun, and dying with his ſetting Beams. Upon which <hi>Tully</hi> thus diſcourſes, <hi>Confer noſtram longiſſimam aetatem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> do <note place="margin">

               <hi>but compare our longeſt Age with Eternity, and we ſhall be found almoſt in the ſame brevity with thoſe little Creatures.</hi> From whence he excellently inferrs, that therefore we ought to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look all theſe Fooleries, and place the whole ſumm of a good Life in the Strength and Greatneſs of our Minds, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and undervaluing of Humane Things, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of Vertue.</p>
            <p>Now as to that other part of being a comfort and ſupport to Old Age that is coming on, there is none that knew the Sweetneſs of <hi>Placidia</hi>'s Temper, and that tender affection ſhe bare to you, but will eaſily be ſatisfied that nothing which were in her Power ſhould have been wanting to you; yet how far that might extend, being utterly unknown through the Lubricities and Contingencies of Humane Life, had her Days been protracted, and ſhe had been only in capacity to have afforded Aſſiſtance either to your Infirmities or Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by her compaſſionate Tears and Prayers, this muſt needs have added conſiderably to a preſent Affliction. But he that conſiders that the <hi>very hairs of our Heads are all numbred;</hi> and that a Sparrow cloſes not its Wings on Earth, but the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eye of Heaven obſerves its Fall; and that an Almighty and Beneficent Providence interpoſes in all Humane Affairs, and paſſes through all things, clothing the Flowers of the Field with exquiſiteneſs and variety of Beauty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the Fowls of the Air, muſt conclude that no Man
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44762:12"/>
is neglected of Heaven's Care, but he that firſt falls ſhort in the Exerciſe of his Duty. And he that is bereaved of one Comfort, upon the making good uſe of ſuch a ſorrowful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, is commonly bleſſed with a double return of Kindneſs ſome other way.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Importunity of your Diſaſter calls more than ordinarily for aſſiſtance; and ſince I began with ſome Platonical Conſiderations, I ſhall conclude this Letter with ſomething from thence to our preſent purpoſe. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath theſe Words, <hi>Pleniſſimè autem Dominus docuit, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 63.</note> 
               <hi>Our Lord hath moſt plainly taught us, that Souls do not only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue after Death, but likewiſe that they remember the Actions and Omiſſions of their Life paſt.</hi> And in the following Chapter, he ſays, that <hi>they have a humane Figure or Shape whereby they may be known,</hi> as alſo that they <hi>remember the things here upon Earth.</hi> There is no doubt then, but <hi>Placidia</hi> ſtill bears a filial reſpect for you, and is ready to aſſiſt you by what ways ſhe can, that is, by her Prayers. For Memory being a radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Faculty of the Soul, remains entire even after her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Body: And the memory of all the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in this Life reviving in the next, her Goodneſs and Piety cannot make her forgetful of thoſe ſhe has left behind her here on Earth, but rather earneſtly deſirous they may partake of the ſame Felicity ſhe enjoys. For the having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the preſſure, uneaſineſs, and miſery, that attends our earthly State, will be a very powerful Inducement to aſſiſt thoſe that yet labour under the burden of it. And this perhaps may be one Reaſon of that officious Solicitouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Raphael</hi> (if there may be any ſtreſs laid upon that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryphal Book)</hi> for the Concerns of <hi>Tobit</hi> and his Son, who though called an Angel, yet was indeed the Soul of <hi>Azarias</hi> the Son of <hi>Ananias</hi> the Great, and of <hi>Tobit</hi>'s Brethren, as we find, <hi>Tobit</hi> Chap. 5. 12. And, to this purpoſe, <hi>Joſephus</hi> introduces <hi>Abraham</hi> telling his Son, whom he was juſt going to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that he ſhould be to him <gap reason="foreign">
