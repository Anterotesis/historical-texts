         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
INTRODUCTION
TO
A Person of HONOVR.</head>
            <p>ASSoon as a tedious Distemper
would give leave, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
you the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> taken at
your Command, upon the <hi>Melius
Inquirendum,</hi> which you sent me. To
deliver my Opinion freely, (as you
have Conjur'd me) The Author
seems to have very little of that
<hi>Tender Conscience,</hi> which he pleads
sor. If we may take our Measures
from him, who is a Judge beyond
exception, such as will strain at a
<hi>Gnat</hi> and swallow a <hi>Camel;</hi> scruple
<pb facs="tcp:104660:3"/>
at a Ceremony, and play the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
with deadly sin (<hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;</hi>)
who with the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Pharisees</hi> of old will make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to sacrifice the <hi>Fifth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,</hi>
to their own superstitious
Phansies; These are Men of no
Conscience. <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. 24. with <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
15.</hi> 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>This Author makes himself an
Advocate for the <hi>Dissenting Party;</hi>
and he manages their Cause with
as much artifice and advantage as
his Confidence, Wit, or Malice can
afford. He takes upon him all
shapes and insinuates himself by
<hi>Fables, Metaphors</hi> and <hi>Similitudes.</hi>
He is often Scurrilous, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
worse. He drolls, quibbles,
and makes sport for Men of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
(the Tribe into which he
seems to be adopted,) and this is
the <hi>farce</hi> of his Discourse, as if he
were not serious, or the Subject he
<pb facs="tcp:104660:3"/>
treats of not worth a sober
Thought. This begets a vehement
Suspicion; His design is not to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the Judicious, but to impose
upon the Weakness of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reader, and by tickling his
Imagination to delude his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>To follow him, step by step, is
no part of my concern; let the
<hi>Compassionate Enquirer</hi> (who trod
out the way for him) look to that,
if he thinks fit.</p>
            <p>But to make short work, He
hath reduced <hi>All,</hi> the <hi>Dissenters</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon, to <hi>Eleven</hi> Sections. And
(if this their Advocate understands
their Principles) their whole Cause
and Plea, being so concisely sum'd
up, and comprised within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of less than four Pages in <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">From p. 163, to 166.</note>,
I shall attentively consider it,
to give you and my self the better
satissaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104660:4"/>
And herein I shall neither Cant,
nor Rail, nor Rhetoricate; but with
such Arms and Weapons as the
Holy Scriptures, the light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the Writings of Learned
Men, especially those of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
Churches have provided. I
shall presently approach the <hi>Trenches</hi>
of these profest and implacable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
of this most <hi>Primitive</hi> and
excellent Church of <hi>England.</hi>

upon their Faith, tendered to
subscription, as Articles of Faith, which
are either false, or at best, they have not
yet been so happy as to discover the truth
of them. In Art. 20. They are required
to subscribe this Doctrine, <hi>The Church
hath power to decree Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;</hi>
which clause of the Article, as we
fear, it has been by some indirect means
shuffled into the Article, it not being found
in the Authentick Articles of <hi>Edward</hi> 6.

Word of God, that Children baptized,
and dying before the commission of Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sins, are undoubtedly saved.</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
the Protestant Churches, nor any
sound Reason, have yet given them any
tolerable satisfaction of the truth of the
Doctrine about the <hi>Opus operatum</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.
That Doctrine laid down in
the <hi>Catechism,</hi> That Children do <hi>perform
Faith and Repentance by their Sureties,</hi> is
also as great a stumbling to our Faith, and
we cannot get over it. How the <hi>Adult</hi>

               <item>They plead, That they are not satisfied in
the use of any <hi>Mystical Ceremonies</hi> in
God's Worship; and particularly they
judge <hi>the use of the Cross</hi> in Baptism to be
sinful. A Sacrament of <hi>Divine</hi> Institution,
according to the definition of the Church
in her <hi>Catechism,</hi> is <hi>an outward and visible
sign of an inward and invisible Grace, given
to us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means
whereby we receive the same, and a Pledge
to assure us thereof.</hi> Where we have,
1. The <hi>Matter</hi> of a Sacrament, <hi>An out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:104660:5"/>
and visible sign of an inward and
Spiritual Grace.</hi> 2. The <hi>Author</hi> of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Sacrament, <hi>Christ himself.</hi> 3. The
<hi>End</hi> of it, to be a <hi>means</hi> to convey the
thing signified, and a <hi>Pledge</hi> to assure us
of it. Hence it's evident, that it's simply
impossible that any Church should institute
a Divine Sacrament; because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give it a Causality to those Graces it is
instituted to signifie. Nevertheless it's
possible for Men to institute Humane Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
which shall have the <hi>Matter</hi> of
a Sacrament, that is, <hi>An outward visible
sign of an inward Spiritual Grace;</hi> and
they may pretend to ascribe an <hi>Effect</hi> to it
also, <hi>To stir up, to excite or increase Grace
and Devotion:</hi> And yet because it wants
the Right Efficient Cause, it's no <hi>lawful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
though it be an <hi>humane Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Such an Institution (<hi>say they</hi>) is <hi>the
Sign of the Cross. An outward visible sign
of an inward Spiritual Grace, ordained by
Men as a means to effect whatever Man
can work by his Ordinance.</hi> Here is the
matter without Divine Signature, which
is the thing they condemn it for. <hi>p.</hi> 49.</item>

               <item>They plead, That since <hi>Communion</hi> with
the Church is suspended and denied, but
upon such terms as take away Christian
<pb facs="tcp:104660:6"/>
Liberty in part, and by consequence leave
all the rest at Mercy; they dare not accept
of Communion upon those Terms. There
are some things, which in the General, God
has left free and indifferent, to do or not
do; yet at some times, and in some Cases it
may be my great sin if I should do some of
them; as when it would wound the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and destroy the Soul of a weak
Christian. If now I shall engage my self
to the Church, That I will never omit such
<hi>an Indifferent thing;</hi> and the Soul of that
weak Christian should call to me to omit it,
I have tied my hands by Engagements, I
cannot help him, though it would save his
or a Thousand Souls out of Hell, because I
have given away my freedom to the
Church. <hi>p.</hi> 60.</item>

their Souls in one Congregation, if
they may more hopefully secure them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
for that their Souls are their
greatest concernment in this World, and the
next. Now, <hi>say they,</hi> there's no question
but Men preach such as they print with
Publick Allowance; and therefore they
ought to provide better for their Souls
elsewhere. Especially they say, That the
Doctrine of Justification, is <hi>Articulus stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
<pb facs="tcp:104660:6"/>
vel cadentis Ecclesiae,</hi> an Article with
which the Church falls or stands. This
Article, <hi>say they,</hi> in the Parish where we
live, is quite demolish'd by the Doctrine of
<hi>Justification by Works:</hi> We are bound
therefore to provide for our safety and
depart; and when We are once out, We
will advise upon another Church, not
which is tolerable, but which is most eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
and in all things nearest the <hi>Word.

lies upon her to prove it, and to prove it

right, they are willing to go the safest Way,
and worship God according to his Word:
If the things disputed be lawful to be

<pb facs="tcp:104660:7"/>
lawful to let them alone. And they think
there's no great hazard in keeping to

Christ will send any to Hell, because they

                  <p>The Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are
not imposed under Oath, nor required to
be received with a like affection and piety as
the holy Scriptures are; nor to be believed
as Articles of Faith, further then they can
approve themselves to be contained in the
Holy Scriptures: For the <hi>Sixth</hi> of those
Articles declares thus; <q>
                        <hi>[Holy Scripture
containeth all things necessary to salvation,
so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor
may be proved thereby, is not to be required
of any man, that it should be believed as an
Article of the Faith, or be thought requisite
and necessary to salvation.</hi>

Here we have a promise of <hi>submission</hi> made
<hi>before God,</hi> (by a kind of <hi>implicit</hi> Faith and
blind Obedience) to the Decrees of a <hi>Synod</hi>
of <hi>Calvinists</hi> before the <hi>Convention</hi> of it:
And this is grounded upon a <hi>Divine</hi> persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
(else with what confidence can they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<hi>before God:</hi>) That God would <hi>preside</hi>
amongst them, and <hi>direct</hi> them into <hi>all</hi>
truth and equity. The Church of <hi>England</hi>
requires no such subjection,</p>
                  <p>As to the twentieth Article; They object
first, against the <hi>Substance,</hi> and secondly
against the <hi>Superfoetation</hi> of it since the

                  <p>1. <hi>That the Church hath power to decree
Rites and Ceremonies.</hi> This, <hi>they say,</hi> is false;
or at least a truth which hitherto they have
not been able to discover. This is a bold

But doth it not argue an affected blindness
in these <hi>Dissenters,</hi> that they <hi>will</hi> not <hi>see</hi> the

that they will not <hi>acknowledge</hi> it?
But</p>
                  <p>To clear the <hi>Article,</hi> it will not be amiss
to declare what we mean by <hi>Church,</hi> and
what is intended by <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
which we assert the Church hath <hi>power</hi> to

neither grow up into <hi>one</hi> body, nor perform
any <hi>publick</hi> Worship to Almighty God, without

                  <p>Hereupon<note n="*" place="margin">De dog. Rit. &amp; Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Eccl. Christ. in princ.</note> 
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> has very well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
That the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, as esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by Christ, and propagated by his

joined together, not onely in <hi>Opinions</hi> as the
<hi>Sects</hi> of the <hi>Philosophers:</hi> nor in <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi>
only, as the <hi>Pagans</hi> of old: nor in

Body) bound up together in all these <hi>three</hi>

                  <p>To this effect<note n="⸫" place="margin">Jac. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. Disp. privat. Thess. 56.</note> others have observed, that
there are <hi>two</hi> sorts of Laws prescribed to the
Church of God; some concern the very <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
life and substance of Christianity, and
the <hi>necessary</hi> Acts (and Duties) of Faith, Hope,
and Charity. And these are the <hi>primary,</hi>
the principal and fundamental Laws of
Christs Kingdoms; these are of Christs own
<hi>Institution</hi> and appointment; and for any
Church to pretend to a power herein is <hi>Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</hi>

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:104660:11"/>
In reference to <hi>these</hi> Laws and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the Church hath but the Office of an
<hi>Ark,</hi> to preserve and keep them; and of a
<hi>Pillar,</hi> to support and declare them to the
World.</p>
                  <p>Other Laws are <hi>secondary</hi> and <hi>suppletory,</hi>
having respect to the <hi>circumstances</hi> of those
<hi>principal</hi> Acts and Duties, and tending to
the more <hi>facile</hi> and <hi>commodious</hi> observation
of them. These Laws may be called <hi>positive</hi>
and <hi>inservient</hi> for that reason; and the
whole <hi>Legislative</hi> power of the Church
consists in making Laws of <hi>this</hi> inferiour
nature.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose <hi>Zanchy</hi> observes a <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi>

                  <p>But we meet with <hi>Complaints</hi> in many
Holy men and learned Authors, That the
Church of God hath been made a <hi>Theatre</hi> of
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. Martyr. ad 1 Cor. 4. m. p. 56. Luther ad Gal. 5. in p. 227.</note> many of which are <hi>unintelligible,</hi>
and some of them <hi>opposite</hi> to the Word of
God; and yet, in <hi>these,</hi> men place their
<hi>righteousness</hi> and <hi>holiness;</hi> and in <hi>these,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the whole Practice of their Piety. These
Ceremonies are made matters of <hi>Merit</hi> and
of <hi>Merchandice</hi> too; <hi>Remission of Sins</hi> and
other <hi>Spiritual Effects</hi> are attributed to them:
they are made so essentially <hi>necessary,</hi> as if
Christ could not <hi>save</hi> us, nor be <hi>served</hi> at all,
without them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grievances</hi> which have afflicted godly
minds upon this account do arise. 1. From
the <hi>number</hi> and multiplicity of these Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.

3. From the <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>value</hi> that
hath been put upon them. And lastly, From
the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>end</hi> that hath been assigned them.
And indeed they are not onely <hi>vain</hi> (as our

That we may not split upon this Rock,

                        <item>2. Decent.</item>

                  </p>

this objection lies not against the Church of

neglect of her substantial Worship. To such
we must say as our Saviour did to the

the Apostles rule of <hi>expediency</hi> was given
more especially upon this account. The
Jews and Gentiles respectively had their

continued. For the use and practice of them
had been apt to harden the Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
and make them more obstinate in their
several Professions; and to tempt Christian
Converts either to <hi>Judaize,</hi> or to think it
innocent enough to <hi>conform</hi> to the Custom
and Religion of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a <hi>Rite</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to eat
of things offered to their <hi>Idols</hi> in their <hi>Idols</hi>
Temple, and thereby to testifie their <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with such Idols. Now though the
Apostle did account an Idol <hi>nothing,</hi> and to <hi>eat</hi>
of things <hi>offered</hi> to Idols a matter of <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi>
yet he told them it was highly <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi>
for Christians to use <hi>those</hi> Rites; for
the <hi>Practice</hi> would tempt others to think
they did it in <hi>honour</hi> to the Idol, that they

but that the very <hi>Rite</hi> and <hi>Ceremony</hi>
might proclaim the <hi>Modesty</hi> of the one, and

St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not only receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

to see their temper, and observe
their wants, and what will be most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for their present Condition, before

that they took pains to <hi>search</hi> the Scriptures,
and had been instructed in them by Christ
himself,<note place="margin">Regner. à Mansvelt. <hi>Adversus Anonymum Theologo. Politicum.</hi> Cap. 14. in pr.</note> cannot be denied. 'Tis certain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
That after such instruction and search of
Scriptures, as wise men, they knew how to
use their Reason better than others of their
quality. Hereupon when they Taught,
(being endued with more than a vulgar
stock of Grace and Divine assistance) they
propounded, not only those Revelations
which they had received; but also whatever
they had attain'd to under the Discipline of
Christ, and by a continual search of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104660:19"/>

                  <p>But this I am sure of, Christ did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to leave his Church always <hi>exposed,</hi> and
like an <hi>Orphan;</hi> for he has promised her,
<hi>Thou shalt suck the breast of Kings</hi> (Isa. 60. 16.)
that is, (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) <hi>Kings shall minister unto thee.</hi>
And to the same purpose, (Isa. 49. 23.) <hi>Kings

                     <note place="margin">Ad Isa. 49. 23.</note> &amp;c. Whence we
may observe, saith he, That besides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Profession of the Faith, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of Princes something more: because
God gives them Power and Authority to
Protect the Church, and to advance God's
Glory.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> This indeed concerns all Men: but
for Kings, the greater their Power is, the
more they are obliged to lay out themselves
[for the Interest of the Church] and the
more carefully to regard it. <hi>Vnde Videmus,</hi>
saith He,<note place="margin">Idem ad cap. 60. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>quàm alieni sunt à regno Christi,</hi> &amp;c.
Hence we may see, how repugnant they are
to the Kingdom of Christ, who would take
away the Authority and Power of Kings [in
Church affairs] that they may transfer it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves.</p>
                  <p>But here we are to observe, that the
Power of Kings in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> matters, is
not <hi>Privative</hi> but <hi>Cumulative,</hi> not design'd,
or intended by Almighty God, to infringe
or weaken the Authority of the Church;
but to fortifie and assist it. To this purpose
the Professors of <hi>Leyden</hi> tell us,<note place="margin">Synopsis pur. Theol. Disput. 50. Thes. 40.</note> it is the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p>That the Church hath a Power to <hi>decree</hi>

                  <p>1. What things are <hi>needful</hi> or <hi>expedient</hi> to
be decreed, appointed and settled in the
Church to <hi>support</hi> her Government and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations,

otherwise Christ hath not been <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

for the <hi>well-ordering</hi> of his Church and

                  <p>But some <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi>
and <hi>needful</hi> to be decreed and settled
in the Church, to <hi>support</hi> her Government
and Administrations, and to <hi>promote</hi> God's
publick and solemn Worship. This has been
proved already, by Reason and Authority
in the former part of this Disquisition. I
shall add but one or two Authorities more;
the first shall be Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s, who delivers
himself fully in the point; <hi>Hoc primum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beamus,</hi>
saith He,<note place="margin">Calv. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. l. 4. c. 10. Sect. 27.</note> Let us lay down this for
a Rule, <q>That if in every Society of Men
we see some government necessary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the common Peace and Concord: if
in the performance of all Matters, some
<hi>rite</hi> or other is in force, which it concerns
the publick honesty, and humanity it self
not to reject: <hi>that</hi> is more especially to be
observed in the Churches of God, which
being best supported by the well-composed
Constitution of all things <hi>[therein admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred]</hi>
when they are without Concord,
they fall to nothing: wherefore if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the safety of the Church, we must
take care of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Injunction, that all
things <hi>be done decently and according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and appointment.</hi> But seeing there is
such diversity in mens manners, so great
variety in their Minds, such opposition in
their Wits and Judgments: No Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104660:22"/>
can be firm and stedfast, unless it be

                     </note> Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> has declared

<hi>Let all things be done decently and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

same <hi>Reverence</hi> as if it dropt from the Lips of
Christ himself, saith Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi> This is the
<hi>foundation</hi> upon which the whole Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Discipline is built,<note place="margin">Ad 1 Cor. 14. ult.</note> saith <hi>Hemmingius.</hi>
And from hence it is confirm'd, that the
Pious Constitutions of the Church are so far
sorth <hi>Divine,</hi> as they serve to <hi>Edification,</hi>
by their <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>good order.</hi> Whereupon

                  <p>As to the <hi>Superfaetation</hi> of this Article,
That it is not found in the <hi>Authentick Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; and so the
Terms of Communion have been <hi>enlarged</hi>
since the first times of the Reformation. To
this I answer,</p>
                  <p>1. That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the <hi>Cretians</hi>
might have made the like objection, as well
against St. <hi>Paul</hi> as against <hi>Titus;</hi> because all
things were not presently settled at the first
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104660:25"/>
plantation of the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. last.
<hi>Tit. 15.</hi> Much may be <hi>abolisht</hi> in an instant,
but such as pretend to <hi>Reformation,</hi> and yet
do nothing but <hi>pull down,</hi> they will never
<hi>edifie</hi> the Church, but most certainly deform
it. <hi>Rome</hi> we say, was not built in one day.
The Apostle left something unsettled till a
further consideration, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. last. And
when he departed from <hi>Crete,</hi> he left <hi>Titus</hi>
his <hi>Vicar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">V. <hi>Hierome</hi> &amp; <hi>Joan. Crocium</hi> in Tit. 1. 5.</note> saith <hi>Crocius,</hi> to supply what the
shortness of his stay would not allow him to
accomplish; and as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> observes, to
<hi>super-correct</hi> what he could not then bring to
perfection. <hi>Zanchy</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">In 4<hi rend="sup">m</hi> praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. m. p. 696. 2. f. Edit. Nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stad. Palat. 1597.</note> observes very well, That
it is the Duty of the <hi>Bishops</hi> to take care of
the whole Church, and whatsoever may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the welfare of it, whether it be in
point of life and manners, in the Ministery
of the Word and Sacraments, or in the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of Pennance, or in the wants of the
Poor, or in matters of Ceremonies; and to
give diligence, that whatsoever has been
<hi>constituted</hi> in such matters, either by the <hi>Lord</hi>
himself, or by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> or by the after-Church,
may be observed. But if there be
any thing that is <hi>not</hi> appointed. and yet may
concern the <hi>edification</hi> of the Church: Let
<hi>Laws</hi> be <hi>appointed</hi> concerning <hi>those</hi> things,
that they may be <hi>confirmed</hi> in the Name of
the whole Church, and by the Authority of
Pious Princes, and be <hi>observed</hi> of all, [respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
subject to their Jurisdiction.]</p>

2. I Answer, That according to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer-Book</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's
time, the Church injoyn'd the Priest at the
Consecration of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> to sign the
Elements with the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross;</hi> and so if
she did not <hi>declare</hi> her Power in her <hi>Articles,</hi>
yet she declared it sufficiently in her <hi>Practice;</hi>
In ordering the Priest to make the <hi>sign</hi> of the
<hi>Cross</hi> upon the <hi>Symbol,</hi> in the <hi>Patin</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi>
she did exercise her Power in <hi>decreeing</hi>
and <hi>practising</hi> that <hi>Rite;</hi> which has since been
taken away, (tho' it has proved of very little
consequence) to avoid <hi>Scandal;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
the Terms of Communion have
been somewhat <hi>contracted</hi> since those times,
and not <hi>inlarged,</hi> as is pretended. However
that Rule of St. <hi>Austin</hi> will certainly hold,<note place="margin">Epist. 118.</note>
                     <hi>His enim causis, id est, aut propter fidem, aut

                     <q>That it is certain from the Word of

From which Testimonies we shall draw an

saved.</q> But first let us consult
the holy Oracle.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture tells us, That <hi>Christ tasted
death for every man,</hi> (Hebr. 2. 9.) <hi>for Children.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104660:27"/>
(vers. 14.</hi>) And to what end did he do this?
<hi>to reconcile them,</hi> (vers. 17.) <hi>to sanctifie them,</hi>
(v. 11.) <hi>to free them from the bondage of the
Devil,</hi> (v. 14, 15.) <hi>and to bring them unto
glory.</hi> (v. 10.) Can Christ fail of his <hi>end</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>Obstacle</hi> in the Subject? Has he done
enough to save a drunken <hi>Noah,</hi> an incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Lot,</hi> an idolatrous <hi>Manasses,</hi> and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
<hi>Peter;</hi> and yet left a poor innocent
<hi>Babe</hi> without a <hi>Remedy?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis our Saviour's comfortable assertion,
with a gracious invitation thereupon (<hi>Mat.
19. 14.) Suffer little Children, and forbid
them not, to come unto me: for of such is the
Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> If these <hi>Dissenters</hi> be of

of <hi>Satan;</hi> They should in modesty keep
their faith to themselves, till they can find
a better proof than the <hi>Post-poning</hi> of <hi>Esau,</hi>
whose person notwithstanding Learned Men
do think was saved. In the Discourses of
our Saviour, <hi>little children</hi> are <hi>Candidates</hi>
for Heaven, and set forth as a <hi>pattern</hi> to such
as shall undoubtedly inherit it, (<hi>Mat. 18. 3.</hi>)
and he tells his Disciples, (<hi>v. 14.) It is not

the promise is unto you and to your children.
(<hi>Act. 2. 38, 39.) Whence I argue thus, such
as are</hi> admitted <hi>to the benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
(remission of sins, and the imputation of
Christ's righteousness) <hi>and do neither</hi> break
<hi>the Conditions, nor put a</hi> bar <hi>to the virtue

                     <note place="margin">V. Col. 2. 13, 14.</note> nor <hi>nail'd it to his

(<hi>Ezek. 18. 3, 14, 20. The Fathers have eaten

                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:104660:28"/>
Mediator, and <hi>defective</hi> in his Institutions.
For there is no other <hi>means</hi> appointed for
their Salvation besides <hi>Baptism;</hi> and if that
be not effectual to them to that end; then
either Christ is <hi>defective</hi> in his <hi>Priestly</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and has not made an <hi>expiation</hi> for their
Sins; or in his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office, and has

means of their Salvation; or else he is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in his <hi>Kingly</hi> Office, not a <hi>Compleat

sufficient for their Salvation: All which

                  <p>We are told, that touching the <hi>Opus ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum</hi>
of the Sacraments, they have, as yet,
received <hi>no tolerable Satisfaction;</hi> and we need
not wonder at this, if we consider how hard
a matter it is to please them in any thing.

as 'tis wrought in the Body, and why may
not these help us to apprehend what may be
done in the Soul? How was <hi>Naaman</hi> clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

<hi>wash seven times in Jordan:</hi> He did so, <hi>and
his flesh came again as the flesh of a little

was <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> and the means was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Prophet. Thus was the

Thus were the ten <hi>Lepers</hi> cleansed. (<hi>Luk. 17.

it makes all Pious <hi>Dispositions,</hi> all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

                     <note n="†" place="margin">Deter. 23. in fine.</note> has thus
determined, <hi>Sacramenta non esse nuda signa,
sed gratiae exhibitiva;</hi> 
                     <q>The Sacraments
are not naked signs, but they do exhibit
Grace; yet so, that this Grace is not
wrought in the Minds of men <hi>ex opere
operato Sacramentorum,</hi> but through the
Ordinance and Operation of God alone,
who in the right use of Sacraments, does
always perform, that which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another sort of <hi>School-men</hi> more
<hi>Orthodox</hi> in their sense of this Distinction,
and the <hi>Opus operatum</hi> of the Sacrament;
They say the Sacraments are a means to
<hi>confer</hi> Grace upon such Receivers as are
<hi>worthily</hi> prepared to receive them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when they say, the Sacrament confers
Grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> their meaning is not
that it confers Grace as it is a kind of <hi>natural
action,</hi> but as it has a <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> and
<hi>an infallible promise</hi> to that effect, so saith
<hi>Estius</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">In 4. Sent. d. 1. Sect. 5. Col. 2. litera F.</note> 
                     <q>And because <hi>That</hi> Promise is <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>
requiring a <hi>due preparation</hi> in the
<hi>Adult,</hi> it follows, nor from this <hi>Phrase</hi>
rightly understood, that according to the
opinion of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> the Sacraments are
effectual without any <hi>good Motion</hi> in the
Receiver.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:104660:30"/>
                     <q>A Sacrament is <hi>Causa conditionalis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">18 dist. 2. ar. 1. p. 67. Col. 3. p. princ. ad resp. ad 5<hi rend="sup">m</hi> In fine Artic.</note> says,
<hi>Argentina,</hi> a conditional cause; and all
the Power and <hi>causality</hi> of the Sacraments
in respect of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> is from <hi>Divine
Institution,</hi> and from <hi>the Covenant, which
God hath made with his Church.</hi> And
<hi>De natura Causae conditionalis est, quod non
observatâ Conditìone;</hi> 'tis the nature of a
<hi>conditional cause,</hi> that if the <hi>condition</hi> be
not perform'd, the <hi>effect</hi> does not follow:
but if the <hi>condition</hi> be perform'd, the <hi>effect</hi>
follows infallibly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In short then, <q>They say Grace may be
produced in the Soul <hi>two</hi> manner of ways,
either <hi>ex opere operantis;</hi> which is by the
elicite and <hi>acceptable</hi> Devotion of the
Church, and the work of the <hi>Ministery,</hi>
or the <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> disposition of <hi>him</hi>
that receives the Sacrament.<note place="margin">Labat The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol. Schol. Tom. 8. pag. 70. &amp; Petr. a S. <hi>Joseph</hi> Idea Theol. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. p. 41.</note> Or else it is
produced <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by virtue of the
Sacrament it self, as of Christ's <hi>institution,</hi>
and by the application of the external
work, by the Power whereof (according
to God's Ordinance and Promise) Grace is
given.</q> Now I suppose we may safely say,
That Grace is <hi>confer'd</hi> by the Sacrament of
Baptism <hi>both</hi> these ways.</p>
                  <p>1. As it is a part of God's Worship, <hi>in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere
Orationis,</hi> under the <hi>Genus</hi> of Prayer, so
it procures Grace, <hi>ex opere Operantis, Per
modum impetrationis,</hi> by way of <hi>impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:104660:30"/>
2. As it is a Sacrament of Christ's Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So it confers Grace, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi>
by way of <hi>Exhibition,</hi> conveying, through
the <hi>divine Benediction and Compact,</hi> that
Grace which it doth <hi>consign,</hi> and which Christ
hath <hi>promised</hi> to his Church.</p>
                  <p>But here <hi>two</hi> Rules are very useful and
necessary to be observed:</p>
                  <p>1. That in the <hi>operation</hi> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(as in all other of God's Ordinances)
<hi>The excellency of the Power is of God and not
of us.</hi> (2 Cor. 4. 7.) and who can deny the
effect when we have God's <hi>fiat</hi> for it?
when he said, <hi>Let there be light, there was
light;</hi> So it was at the Creation of the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
light; and so it is at the Creation of
<hi>internal</hi> light, when God is pleased to put
forth his Power to that effect. (<hi>2 Cor. 4. 6.</hi>)
And methinks, Those men should easily be
satisfied about the <hi>opus operatum</hi> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who are of <hi>opinion,</hi> that we are merely
<hi>passive</hi> in the work of our Regeneration; that
it is wrought <hi>in nobis sine nobis,</hi> wrought in us,
(but) without us, and that irresistibly.</p>
                  <p>The Second <hi>Rule</hi> is,<note place="margin">

in the <hi>Adult;</hi> for in <hi>such,</hi> to make

<hi>a fit and worthy disposition</hi> for the Sacrament.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note>

it's evident, that it's simply impossible that any
Church should institute a Divine Sacrament;
because they cannot give it a Causality to those

and indeed it's a very hard task to

that the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the
Church are not <hi>Divine</hi> Sacraments; which
she never did pretend a Power to institute.
They are unsatisfied at the use of <hi>Mystical
Ceremonies</hi> in God's Worship: But so was not
St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The Wife is subject to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
saith He, <hi>Ergo gerat insigne subjectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>

Assemblies; and we are taught that this is
to be observed in such <hi>Rites,</hi> that they be
suitable to <hi>admonish</hi> us of our Duty, <hi>ut Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniae

                  </p>
                  <p>But the great <hi>scandal</hi> they pretend to take,
is at the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism. <hi>But

                  <p>If we inquire after the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of this
<hi>Badge,</hi> we shall find it in the <hi>Banner</hi> of our
<hi>Militia</hi> from the time of the first <hi>Christian</hi>
Emperor. Church Story tells us, That
when <hi>Constantine</hi> had gathered an Army in
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> to repress the Tyrant
<hi>Maxentius,</hi> He was afraid of his <hi>Charms,</hi>
wherewith he was supposed to have van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
<hi>Severus</hi> (whom <hi>Gal. Maximinus</hi> had
sent against him formerly.) And as he stood
in doubt what to do, He cast his Eyes often
up to Heaven; and saw a brightness therein,
about Sun-set, in the likeness of a <hi>Cross,</hi> with
certain Stars of equal bigness, which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this <hi>Symbol</hi> (like an Inscription in Latin
Letters) <hi>In Hoc Vince,</hi> that is, <hi>In this shalt</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:104660:34"/>
thou <hi>overcome.</hi> After this Vision, His <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
was made in the similitude of a <hi>Cross,</hi>
and carried before him in his Wars; the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>Maxentius</hi> was Conquered and Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And to ascend higher, some think this
was the <hi>Cognizance</hi> of Christians from the
first Plantation of the Gospel, being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by the most ancient Writers of the
Church. <hi>Zanchy</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">De Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempt. p. 447. 1. fin. Nao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stad. Palat. 1597.</note> concludes from the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in <hi>Justin</hi>'s time, that the mingling Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with Wine in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> came from
Christ and his Apostles. The <hi>sign</hi> of the
<hi>Cross</hi> is a Ceremony of as long a standing;
wherefore the use of it, upon all occasions, in
all times, over all parts of the Church, is to
be ascribed to the Apostles; as a very Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
and Learned Man observeth<note n="†" place="margin">Epilog. l. 3. p. 342.</note>. And
St. <hi>Austin</hi> has given us a Rule that does assure

                     <hi>Quod Vniversa tenet ecclesia, nec à Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liis

                     <q>That which is held, (or practised)
by the Universal Church, and was never
appointed by any Council, but always held
and maintain'd, is most justly believed to
have been delivered (at first) by Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Authority. For such an <hi>Vniversal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
must have a <hi>Cause</hi> equally <hi>Vniversal.</hi>
                     </q>
The Apostle tells the <hi>Ephesians</hi> of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>seal'd</hi> to the day of Redemption, <hi>Eph. 4.
30.</hi> Whether the Church took occasion from
<hi>those</hi> words, to appoint that Ceremony to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104660:34"/>
be used in Baptizing, I am not able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:
But the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells us of a
man with an <hi>Ink-horn</hi> by his side, who was
commanded to set a <hi>Mark</hi> upon the <hi>foreheads</hi>
of such as did <hi>sigh and cry</hi> for the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that were done in <hi>Jerusalem. (Ezek.
9. 4.</hi>) Now says <hi>Deodati</hi> (that Learned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of <hi>Geneva</hi>) because the word <hi>Mark</hi> in
Hebrew is <hi>Thau,</hi> and that the same word is
the Name of the letter <hi>T.</hi> which letter in
ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters, is made in the
figure of a <hi>Cross;</hi> hence some Ancients
(saith he) have believed, That <hi>this</hi> Mark
was a <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> which figured Christ's
Blood, the only <hi>Mark</hi> of Salvation to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
If any Credit be to be given to this
suggestion, the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> upon the
<hi>forehead</hi> has been of longer use than is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
'Tis true, that Learned Professor
says, there is no <hi>certainty</hi> in it: but he does
not say 'twas <hi>superstitious</hi> to be done, or <hi>sinful</hi>
to believe it. Some <hi>Mark</hi> there was, and
'twas of some <hi>importance;</hi> and so is this <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi>
now in question.</p>
                  <p>We read (<hi>Jos. 22.</hi>) That the Children of
<hi>Reuben, Gad</hi> and <hi>Manasseh,</hi> built a great <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
upon the Borders of <hi>Jordan</hi> (for which
they had no <hi>Divine</hi> Warrant, nor did they
pretend to it.) Hereupon the Congregation
of <hi>Israel</hi> took offence, and leavyed War
against them. But before they entred into
any act of Hostility, they thought it reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104660:35"/>
to expostulate, &amp; debate the matter fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with them; which they managed in these
words: [<q>
                        <hi>What trespass is this, which ye have
committed against the God of Israel, to turn
away from following the Lord, in that you
have builded you an Altar, that ye might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
this day against the Lord?</hi> To this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
charge those <hi>Tribes</hi> return'd this Calm
and sober Answer. <hi>The Lord God of Gods,
He knoweth, and Israel, He shall know, if
it be in Rebellion, or in Transgression against
the Lord, that we have built us an Altar to
turn from following the Lord, if to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
thereon, save us not this day; (and)
let the Lord Himself require it: And if we
have not done it rather, for fear your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
should say unto our Children, in time to
come, Jordan is the border that divides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and you; ye have no part in the
Lord; no right or title to the benefits of his
holy Altar; Therefore we built this Altar,
not for burnt offering, nor for Sacrifice, but
to be a Witness between us and you, and our
generations after us, that we have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in the Lord as well as you, a right to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
his Altar, to perform our Service at
it, and receive the benefits thereof.</hi> And
they called the Altar (<hi>Ed,</hi>) a Witness; for
it shall be a <hi>witness</hi> between us, that the
Lord is <hi>our</hi> God as well as <hi>yours.</hi>
                     </q> By this
Story, we see, <hi>that</hi> Altar was erected as a
<hi>Monument,</hi> not for a <hi>Remedy</hi> of what <hi>was,</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104660:35"/>
but for a <hi>Caution</hi> against what <hi>might</hi> be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
And to apply this Matter of Fact to
our present purpose, was not the <hi>Cross</hi> the
<hi>Altar</hi> upon which our Blessed Lord offer'd
<note n="*" place="margin">Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Crucis cum vocat, eò quòd in illiûs arâ effusus est. <hi>Grynaeus ad Colo. p. 81.</hi>
                     </note> up Himself to God, as a <hi>Sacrifice of a sweet
smelling savour,</hi> to expiate our Sins, and
make an attonement for the World. Now
we know very well, there are a Generation
of Men that say of us (and will say't of our
Children after us) that we are <hi>Out-casts</hi> to the
Common-wealth of Israel, <hi>Schismaticks</hi> and
Separate from the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ, and the
<hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church; that
we are <hi>Enemies</hi> to the Cross of Christ, and
have no <hi>interest</hi> in his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> or <hi>right</hi>
to the <hi>benefits</hi> of his Death and Passion.
In answer to which objection or Cavil, we
can alleadge, that we have the <hi>Copy,</hi> the
<hi>Representation</hi> of that Altar (upon which
our B. Saviour suffered that shameful, that
painful, that accursed Death for us) the <hi>sign</hi>
of the <hi>Cross</hi> was made upon our <hi>Foreheads</hi>
(when we were dedicated to him at our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism):
not that we are <hi>drawn</hi> from our <hi>duty</hi>
and <hi>allegeance</hi> to God by it, or <hi>expect</hi> any
<hi>supernatural Grace</hi> or Virtue from it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to pay any manner of <hi>devotion</hi> to it:
but to assert our own <hi>priviledge,</hi> and <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to our Crucify'd Jesus, to be a <hi>Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi>
Protestation of our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>affiance</hi> in
him, a <hi>Memorial</hi> of the <hi>solemn</hi> Profession we

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104660:36"/>
our <hi>Ed,</hi> our <hi>Witness</hi> to this purpose; And,
as far as I am able to discern, no less com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in our practice, than that was in
those <hi>Tribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But these <hi>Dissenters</hi> tell us, <hi>'tis impossible

is <hi>no lawful,</hi> (which is but a begging of the

Now the question is, whether this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
be just, or no? The other day,

and a <hi>superstitious</hi> conceit will carry these
men! By their invention <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Chamber-window
is made a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> The <hi>opening</hi>
of it towards <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was the <hi>outward and
visible sign;</hi> The <hi>inward and spiritual Grace</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:104660:37"/>
was his <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>affiance</hi> in God, with his
<hi>Zeal</hi> for God's Holy Temple and Worship.
Yea, so unreasonable and <hi>extravagant</hi> is this
their Act of Condemnation, it will reach
all the most Pious accomplishments of Holy
Men; the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> the <hi>Whole Duty
of Man,</hi> the <hi>Saints everlasting Rest,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi>
of Mr. <hi>Calvin;</hi> I confess, I cannot
say so of those many Books which these <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi>
have written and sent abroad, to shake
the People, and unhinge the Government,
to foment Faction, and disturb the Peace of
Church and State. I cannot say it of such
(that they are outward and visible signs of
an inward and spiritual Grace): but of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> Book, I say, it will
fall under this their <hi>rash</hi> and unadvised Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
It is a <hi>Humane Sacrament;</hi> that
is, it has the <hi>matter</hi> of a Sacrament, which
is an <hi>outward and visible sign</hi> of <hi>an inward and
spiritual Grace;</hi> and the Author (whoever
he be) will hope for some <hi>good effect</hi> from it,
(else he is ill advised to make it Publick), <hi>to
excite, to stir up, to increase Grace and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>
by it, and whatever Man can work
by his Discourse, and Ordinance; and yet
(according to these <hi>Dissenters Notion</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>)
because it wants the <hi>efficient</hi> Cause
to make it a <hi>Divine Sacrament,</hi> it must be
<hi>unlawful,</hi> it must be <hi>sinful;</hi> for 'tis upon this
accompt, they do (here) judge the <hi>sign of the
Cross</hi> in Baptism, to be <hi>so,</hi> and so condemn it.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104660:38"/>
What he means by a <hi>Divine Signature,</hi> is
a matter of some question: if some <hi>institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>promise</hi> to annex <hi>Grace</hi> to it, we
understand it not; But if he understands
by <hi>Signature,</hi> some <hi>impression,</hi> that discovers
something of God's <hi>Attributes,</hi> we say with
the great Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 18. with 24.</note> That the <hi>Preaching of
the Cross</hi> sets forth <hi>the Power of God, and the
Wisdom of God.</hi> There is this <hi>Divine Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature</hi>
upon all Creatures: For <hi>the invisible
things of God from the Creation of the world
are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made,</hi> (Rom. 1. 20.) <hi>The
Heavens declare the glory of God; (Psal. 19.</hi>)
And every <hi>Rational</hi> Creature should <hi>Echo</hi> to
that Declaration, and say, <hi>When I consider
thy Heavens—Lord what is Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For a Sacrament <hi>properly</hi> so called, that is
a <hi>Divine Sacrament</hi> (in the sense of the
Church), That is a thing of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
For,</p>
                  <p>1. It must have <hi>Christ</hi> for its Author;
all Ordinances of <hi>Divine</hi> Worship design'd
to exhibit, to seal and convey <hi>supernatural</hi>
Grace are of his Institution; because <hi>Eorum
tantum est signum instituere, qui jus habent
promittendi signatum, &amp; potentiam appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi;</hi>
                     <q>He only has power to appoint the
sign who has right to promise, and power
to apply the thing signified.</q> In this we
are agreed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:104660:38"/>
2. As we are agreed in the Author, so
in the <hi>Matter</hi> of a Sacrament; <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est sacrae rei signum,</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin.</hi> A
Sacrament is the sign of a thing Sacred;
yet not every such sign (for then we should
multiply Sacraments beyond reason) but
such a Sacred thing as <hi>sanctifies</hi> the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
<hi>Sacramentum propriè est signum rei sacrae
in quantum est sanctificans;</hi> Properly a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is the sign of a thing Sacred, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is ordain'd to Sanctifie.</p>
                  <p>3. We are agreed in the <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>end;</hi>
that God by the Mediation of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
gives his Grace to such as are
<hi>worthily</hi> prepared for them, and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of them.</p>
                  <p>4. We are, I hope, agreed too, as to
the <hi>Constituents</hi> of a Sacrament. To the
making of a Sacrament, the <hi>word</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Consecration,</hi> the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
word, (<hi>Sermo operatorius,</hi> as St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
calls it,) <hi>Accedit verbum ad elementum
&amp; fit Sacramentum;</hi> the word apply'd to the
Element does make a Sacrament, saith
St. <hi>Austin.</hi> We acknowledge, saith <hi>Zanchy,</hi>
that a Sacrament is a <hi>visible</hi> sign: But of
what? of an <hi>invisible</hi> Grace. But whence
has it this (<hi>habitude</hi>) to be a sign of such
a thing?<note place="margin">De Relig. Christ Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. p. 253. f.</note> from the <hi>word</hi> of Christ's insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
saith <hi>Zanchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence 'tis evident, that the <hi>sign</hi> of
the <hi>Cross</hi> is far from the Nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104660:39"/>
in the <hi>proper</hi> Notion of the Church.
For,
<list>
                        <item>1. It has no <hi>office</hi> of <hi>Consecration</hi> to hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, no <hi>word</hi> of Prayer or <hi>Benediction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
upon it.</item>
                        <item>2. It has not <hi>Christ</hi> for its <hi>Author;</hi> we do
not find, we do not say He gave it <hi>institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to that effect.</item>
                        <item>3. It has no internal <hi>sanctifying</hi> Grace for
its Matter. And from hence it will unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
follow,</item>
                        <item>4. That it does not <hi>confer, convey,</hi> or
<hi>exhibit</hi> Grace, as the <hi>end</hi> of its appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the Resolution of <hi>Fran. Hallier</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Defens. Eccles. Hierarch. c. 2. Sect. 3. Pag. 85.</note> (a
sober and learned <hi>Sorbonist) Nullum signum
practicum gratiae habitualis, ex opere operato
eam Conferens, instituere potuit Ecclesia:</hi>
                     <q>The Church cannot institute any practical
sign of habitual Grace, that can confer,
that Grace, <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> because it is
in the Power of God <hi>alone</hi> to confer habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Grace upon us: Nor can the Church
of God appoint any sign to confer <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi>
helps and motions of Grace, <hi>ex
opere operato;</hi> because Actual Grace is no
less supernatural than habitual, and God
is equally the Author and Dispensor of
them both. And secondly, saith He, we
cannot understand how any spiritual or
supernatural effect should follow upon
the putting of any sign, unless we have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104660:39"/>
some Covenant or Divine Promise to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
us, that such effect is annext to such
a sign: but (saith he) we have no
Testimony either of Scriptures, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
or Fathers, to assure us of any such
Promise.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism
(wherein we are now particularly concern'd)
it has no peculiar reference to <hi>God,</hi> or the
sacred <hi>Rite</hi> of Baptism: but to the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
into which we receive the baptized, and
to the <hi>duty</hi> as to the <hi>end,</hi> unto which <hi>he</hi> is
consigned; that <hi>he should not be ashamed to
confess,</hi> &amp;c. This therefore is appointed to
assert our <hi>Privilege,</hi> and the <hi>duty</hi> incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon that account, So that in the <hi>use</hi>
of this <hi>Ceremony,</hi> there is no <hi>Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
presumed, no <hi>Consecration</hi> perform'd, no
<hi>Promise</hi> pretended, no <hi>Grace</hi> expected among
us. We cannot therefore be supposed to use
it as a <hi>Suppletory</hi> Sacrament; Nor (tho' of
very great <hi>Antiquity</hi>) was it ever design'd
to <hi>add</hi> any the least <hi>Melioration, Virtue,</hi> or
<hi>Efficacy,</hi> to our Holy Baptism: but used as
a Collateral Appendage and <hi>Contesseration</hi>
of our solemn Engagement: to notifie our
<hi>Relation</hi> to a Crucified Redeemer: to assert
our <hi>interest</hi> in the Merits of his Death and
Passion: to put us in <hi>mind</hi> of our Christian
Profession, and to <hi>excite</hi> us unto our Duty.
After this <hi>account,</hi> if the <hi>Offence</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi>
be not yet ceased, I shall add these fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104660:40"/>
Considerations for the Reader's satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>1. These <hi>Dissenters</hi> make use of these
words, <hi>Humane Sacraments, Symbolical Rites,
Mystical Ceremonies,</hi> out of design to make
a noise, to amuse and affright the <hi>scrupulous</hi>
and common Reader. The word <hi>Sacrament</hi>
is of a very large signification; An <hi>Oath</hi> is
call'd a Sacrament; so is the <hi>Creed</hi> by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">So is the Paschal Feast. Epist 119.</note>, and the whole <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> by
<hi>Tertullian;</hi> In the <hi>vulgar Latin, Marriage,</hi>
is a Sacrament, <hi>Eph. 5. 32.</hi> so is the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Christ (<hi>1 Tim. 3. 16.) Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s
Dream. (<hi>Dan. 2. 18, 30, 47.</hi>) The seven
<hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Candlesticks</hi> (Revel. 1. 20.) The
use of that word therefore (whatever these
<hi>Dissenters</hi> make of it) is no matter of offence
or objection in this case.</p>
                  <p>2. We may make a <hi>sanctified use</hi> of all
<hi>Creatures,</hi> of all <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> and of all
emergent <hi>Accidents:</hi> This cannot in Reason
be denyed; for by this holy usage of them,
we turn them into a <hi>Ladder;</hi> and by them
our minds ascend up to God. And such <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
and <hi>visible</hi> signs have an aptitude to
that effect. <hi>Signum est quod praeter speciem,
quam ingerit sensibus, facit aliquid aliud in
Cognitionem</hi> (alias <hi>Cogitationem) venire,</hi> saith
St. <hi>Austin.</hi> A sign is that which brings some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else into our thoughts and knowledge,<note place="margin">V. Labat de Sacram. p. 5. &amp; 6.</note>
besides that which it offers to our senses. And
such signs, whether they be <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:104660:40"/>
if the things suggested by them or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from them, be <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi>
it makes no matter of consequence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be called <hi>Mystical Ceremonies, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Rites,</hi> or <hi>Humane Sacraments;</hi> For
they are really nothing else but <hi>outward and
visible things</hi> applied to a <hi>spiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi>
use.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>such signs,</hi> or <hi>Humane Sacraments</hi> or
<hi>Mystical Ceremonies</hi> (call them what you
will) are, not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>laudable</hi> and
of good use, is easie to evince. What if the
sight of a <hi>Dial,</hi> puts me in mind, that my
life is <hi>as a shaddow that departeth?</hi> and if I
make the like reflection upon the striking of
the <hi>Clock;</hi> and thereupon break out into this
Ejaculation: <hi>[So teach us to number our days,
that we may apply our hearts unto Wisdom]</hi>
What sober Christian could blame me for it?
He was not an ill Man, who took occasion
from the <hi>Feast</hi> at which he was entertain'd,
to cry out, <hi>Blessed is he that shall eat bread
in the Kingdom of God;</hi> And our Saviour
took occasion from thence to discourse of
his great Gospel <hi>Supper.</hi> There may be
much <hi>Divinity,</hi> and much <hi>Moral Duty,</hi>
taught by <hi>Hieroglyphicks;</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
taught the <hi>Ninevites</hi> to put on <hi>Sack-cloath,</hi>
to publish their sorrow and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Jonah 3. 5.</hi> to the <hi>10th.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have need enough of such <hi>helps;</hi> and
God himself directs us to the use of them.

He commanded that the <hi>Censers</hi> of

be continued in use about the Worship of

(<hi>Numb. 16. 40.</hi>) <q>Hereupon Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
observes (as he had done before of God's
Mercies and wonderful works, so now of
his Judgments) <hi>Statim excidere ac deleri
ex cordibus hominum, nisi adminiculis quibus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
exerceantur in eorum Meditatione;</hi> that
they do soon slip out of the memory, and
are soon blotted out of the hearts of Men,
unless they have some <hi>helps</hi> for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
in the Meditation of them. And
(he says) This happens not only through
their <hi>ignorance,</hi> but through their <hi>neglect;</hi>
we should therefore be more attentive to
such helps of Memory as may keep us to
our Duty.</q> Another instance we have to
the same purpose (<hi>Numb. 57. 10.) And the
Lord said unto Moses, bring Aarons Rod again
before the Testimony, to be kept, for a token
against the Rebels; and thou shalt quite take
away their murmerings from me, that they die
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104660:41"/>
not;</hi> Upon which words, the same Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
takes notice, <q>That men are <hi>forgetful</hi>
and <hi>sluggish</hi> in considering the great Works
of God, and many times they do wickedly
Drown and Bury the Memory of them;
and therefore not without an Exprobation,
God Commands that <hi>Rod</hi> to be safely
kept as a sign of their Contumacy and
Rebellion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it will not be amiss to take notice,
that <hi>these</hi> Instances as well as that of the <hi>Altar</hi>
erected by those <hi>Tribes,</hi> are in reference to
<hi>Religion</hi> and God's <hi>Worship.</hi> All <hi>Rites</hi> and
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> appointed in the Church, and
about God's Worship, must be designed for
<hi>Order, Decency</hi> and <hi>Edification; Vt Retina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula
sint &amp; incitamenta Pietatis,</hi> that they
may be stays, helps, and incentives unto Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
says a Learned <hi>Lutheran</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Meisner.</note>. Such as are
idle, <hi>insignificant,</hi> and unprofitable would be
<hi>nugatory</hi> and ridiculous. But we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
remember, that whatever the Church
appoints, she does not pretend to <hi>add</hi> to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institutions; but to <hi>assist</hi> our Infirmities
in the use of them. It is not in her power
to <hi>meliorate</hi> an Ordinance of God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but to <hi>adorn</hi> the Solemnity to imprint
our <hi>duty</hi> and heighten our <hi>affections</hi> to it.
God's <hi>Sacraments</hi> cannot be made better in
their own Nature: But the <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Piety</hi> of the Receivers and Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
may be more or less <hi>intense</hi> and <hi>vigorous,</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:104660:42"/>
according to the impressions made upon their
Faculties: And he that is not sensible of the
<hi>force</hi> of words and <hi>visible</hi> signs to this effect, is
too <hi>stupid</hi> and bruitish to <hi>write</hi> himself a

                  <p>There is scarce any <hi>Object</hi> but may be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to our devotion, and serve us to some
<hi>spiritual</hi> and heavenly end and purpose; and
when there is none offer'd, we should study
and make occasions to be heavenly minded.
'Tis a good Observation of Mr. <hi>Arrowsmith,</hi>
in a Sermon before the House of <hi>Commons,</hi>
(on <hi>Revel. 12. 1, 2.</hi>)<note place="margin">Jan. 27. 1646.</note> That <hi>besides the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
there is a spiritual use to be made of all the
Creatures,</hi> (and I will add, of all the works of
<hi>Art,</hi> and of all <hi>occasional</hi> emergencies,) <hi>Man's
Soul</hi> (says he) <hi>is an Alembeck, in which, when
the Creatures are laid like so many herbs, if
there be any fire of Devotion within, many
sweet Meditations may be distilled. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
hearts are apt to make a sensual use of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things: but Spiritual hearts have an
Art of making Divine uses even of Natural
things, which</hi> (says he) <hi>we should all do well
to learn.</hi> And may we not set up our <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi>
in God's House? May we not <hi>extract</hi>
such <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Essences</hi> in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

to be devout and heavenly-minded
at all times, and shall we be prophane in
God's House? when we are about his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Service shall we be prophane
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104660:42"/>
then, for fear we should be accounted Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious?
God forbid. Let us always bear
in mind the Apostles Rule, and let our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
make it ours; <hi>Do all to the Glory of
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To help the truely</hi> weak <hi>and conscientious
over that, which these</hi> Dissenters <hi>have
made so great a</hi> stumbling block, <hi>I mean
the</hi> sign <hi>of the</hi> Cross; <hi>I shall conclude this</hi>
Section <hi>with a</hi> Meditation <hi>of that</hi> Polite
<hi>and</hi> Learned <hi>Prelate (Bishop</hi> Hall.) <hi>His
Subject is a</hi> Red Cross <hi>upon a Door, and
his Devotions run out thus,</hi> [Oh sign, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

and that a bloody one; both the

victorious; why should we tremble at it at
home? Oh God, there thou fightest for us,
Here against us; under that we have fought
for thee, but under this (because our sins have
fought against thee) we are fought against
by thy Judgments. Yet Lord, it is thy

Certainly there's more Devotion and
Piety in such Godly <hi>Meditations</hi> upon the
<hi>Cross,</hi> then in quarrelling at the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
use of it; And I am sure 'tis no <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi>
to use any thing for a help to
heavenly Meditation; but only then when I
treat it with affections and a regard,
above the true value of it; and court it
with Adoration. To conclude this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
If I be low of Stature, (as <hi>Zacheus</hi>

               <p>THey Plead, That since Communion with
the Church is suspended and denyed,
but upon such Terms as take away
Christian Liberty in part, and by Consequence
leaves all the rest at Mercy; They dare not
accept of Communion upon those Terms. There
are some things, which God has, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
lest free and indifferent, to do or not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104660:43"/>
do; yet at some times, and in some Cases,
it may be my great sin, if I should do some
of them; as when it would wound the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and destroy the Soul of a weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
If now I shall ingage my self to the
Church, that I will never omit such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
thing; and the Soul of that weak
Christian should call to me to omit it, I have
tyed my hands by ingagement, I cannot help
him, tho' it would save His or a Thousand
Souls out of Hell; because I have given away
my freedom to the Church.</p>

                  <head>The Answer.</head>
                  <p>Tho' the Church does <hi>restrain</hi> our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>part,</hi> yet the <hi>whole</hi> is not in danger;
because she does declare, That where there
is no Sin in the <hi>imposition,</hi> of things <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi>
(as to the <hi>nature</hi> of the things) yet
Authority may be <hi>excessive,</hi> as to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
and number of them. If the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi>
of the Church, as the <hi>Pharisees</hi>
of old, should lay <hi>heavy burdens</hi> upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens shoulders, and not so much as
<hi>touch</hi> them with one of their own Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
there might be some colour for this
Objection: But we know, <hi>They</hi> are the first,
the most eminent and punctual, in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of what is injoyn'd; and to think they
will ever <hi>incumber</hi> and <hi>overload</hi> themselves
with Ceremonies, is <hi>irrational.</hi> And God
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104660:44"/>
be thanked, we have a <hi>Prelacy</hi> so <hi>Moderate,</hi>
so <hi>Discreet</hi> and <hi>Learned,</hi> there's no ground
to fear it. This <hi>Author</hi> was convinced of
<hi>this;</hi> and therefore he sets up his <hi>Consequence</hi>
for a <hi>Bug-bear;</hi> and so perhaps when <hi>the sky
falls</hi> we may have a <hi>quarry</hi> for his jealousie.</p>
                  <p>The mean while we acknowledge that
Christ hath purchased a <hi>Liberty</hi> for His
Church: <hi>If the Son shall make you free, then
shall ye be free indeed, Joh. 8. 36.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is Liberty from a <hi>yoak of bondage:</hi>
A yoak that had a heavy <hi>burden</hi> annext to
it; From the bondage of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Vncleanness,</hi> with
all the <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Vanities,</hi> wherewith He
had inthrall'd the wicked world; from the
<hi>Captivity</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of Sin in our Members;
from the <hi>Curse</hi> of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, and from
the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, the <hi>fear</hi> of Death, and the
<hi>bondage</hi> of <hi>Corruption</hi> upon that account;
From the <hi>Obligation</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, of the
<hi>Levitical</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, with such
Humane <hi>Traditions</hi> as had taken their rise
from thence; And altho by <hi>Analogy</hi> some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
are wont to reduce unto this Head
such <hi>Ceremonies</hi> as become matter of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi>
in their use, or <hi>burdensom</hi> for their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
and number; yet this does not impeach
the Authority of the Church, in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such as shall be deemed meet to <hi>adorn</hi>
the Solemnity, and procure Reverence and
Devotion, in God's House and Worship.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104660:44"/>
'Twas the design of our Redeemer to make
us <hi>free</hi> from the <hi>bondage</hi> before mentioned;
but not to set us at liberty from a <hi>decent Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi>
from a <hi>Reverent gesture,</hi> or from any
<hi>innocent observance,</hi> which the Authority of
Prudent and Pious Governours shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
                  <p>For the liberty which Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
for us is consistent with <hi>Civil Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;</hi>
(1 Cor. 7. 21, 22.) <hi>Art thou called
being a Servant? care not for it. For he that
is called in the Lord being a Servant, is Christs
free-man.</hi> Therefore, when he saith (in the
next Verse) <hi>Be not ye the Servants of Men;</hi>
His meaning is, as <hi>Bruno</hi> hath very well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
it, <hi>it a quòd in vobis pereat servitus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti;</hi>
be not the Servants of Men, so as to

Christ and <hi>Belial;</hi> yet ye may <hi>Fear
God,</hi> and <hi>the King;</hi> ye may serve them both,
and ye serve the Lord in your duty to your
Relations. (<hi>Col. 3. 24.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Christ came not to <hi>dissolve</hi> the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
any Relations, but to tye their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Obligations faster, tho' with the silken
strings of Love and Charity. If we should
instance in all Relations, the matter of Fact
is evident.</p>
                  <p>1. Betwixt <hi>Masters and Servants,</hi> (Eph. 6.

                  <p>'Tis not probable, that He, whose Laws do

<hi>Dic Ecclesiae</hi>

resort in every difference. And the <hi>Sentence</hi>
of the Church like the <hi>Oath</hi> of God (for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the Truth) has put an end to all
strife. For 'tis God's solemn Promise to His
Church (<hi>Isa. 60. 12.) The Nation and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

                  </p>
                  <p>And here we must observe a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ, and
some <hi>Civil</hi> Societies. For these may have
their being first, and then frame their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
They are first <hi>free,</hi> and have all
Jurisdiction <hi>Originally</hi> in themselves, and
then they communicate the same to Kings or
Magistrates. But the Church did not make
it self, nor its own Government: but Christ,
who is Prince and Head, did first appoint
Rules and Orders, constitute Laws and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
by which his Church should be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
and then did call and assemble it;
and wherein he hath determin'd any thing,
we are obliged to look upon it as necessary
to the support and well-ordering of that
Society.</p>
                  <p>Whether such <hi>Orders</hi> were made by <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
or determined by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> (who
were immediately sent by him to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
makes no difference. For he spent For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
dayes with them after his Resurrection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
them about the Constitution and
Government of his Kingdom, (<hi>Act. 1. 2, 3.</hi>)
and after his Ascension, he sent down the
Holy Ghost, to establish and impower them;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104660:46"/>
that is, not only to make them <hi>Prudent,</hi> but
<hi>Infallible.</hi> Hereupon they did not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that they had the <hi>mind</hi> of Christ, (<hi>1 Cor.
2. 16. Gal. 1. 12.</hi>) but that they acted all <hi>in
his Name</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 16. 1 Cor. 5. 4. 2 Cor. 2. 10.</note>, that is, by his Power, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and Authority. From hence it will
undeniably follow, that such as come under
this <hi>Apostolical</hi> Government, (which is the
Government of Christ's <hi>Kingdom</hi>) have no
<hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> but what is restrain'd and
limitted by the Laws of that Government;
because that very <hi>Charter</hi> by which they
claim their <hi>Liberty</hi> had establish'd that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
before <hi>They</hi> were called to be
Christians, and admitted into that Society.
I say, <hi>This</hi> Authority and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
Government, being <hi>antecedent</hi> to the <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration</hi>
of all particular Churches, the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
of the <hi>Members</hi> (being <hi>Subjects</hi>) of
<hi>Those</hi> Churches, must needs (<hi>de jure</hi>) be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> which
are inacted and appointed by <hi>That</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Those</hi> Laws and Orders are, have been

tho' they did not addict themselves to such

the Apostle has given several instances,

4. When the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had cast off the
<hi>yoak</hi> of their <hi>Heathen</hi> Superstition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and embraced the <hi>Faith</hi> of Christ,
there were <hi>false</hi> Apostles, who made it their
business to reconcile them to the Law of
<hi>Moses;</hi> And did tempt them to adopt the
<hi>Foederal Rites</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yea, and of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> too, into their practice, with the
Profession of Christianity: This was plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
upon the account of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi>
and the pretence that <hi>these</hi> things were
now become <hi>indifferent;</hi> but the Apostle
observes the Practice, not only to be <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical</hi>
(and unwarrantable for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son):
but to be full of <hi>peril</hi> and <hi>hazard</hi>

<hi>Expediency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. These <hi>Laws</hi> and Rules as they were
<hi>Occasional,</hi> so they are <hi>General;</hi> and there
was some reason for it: The same <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>

and we see what is <hi>Veneration</hi> and
<hi>Decency</hi> in one part of the World, is not
accounted so in another. Hence we find
variety of <hi>Rites, Forms</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Churches; and those Churches are
not to be blam'd for it, keeping to the
<hi>General</hi> and <hi>Apostolick</hi> Rule. <hi>Absit ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,

1 Cor. 14. 36.) <q>Away with Ambition,
away with Obstinacy, away with Pride
and Contempt of others: and on the other
side take in Prudence, take in Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
take in a care of Edification; and
then in the variety of Rites and Customs
there is nothing to be reprehended.</q> The
Apostles Rule is <hi>general;</hi> and the Prudence
of Governours must deduce <hi>particulars</hi> (as
for <hi>decency,</hi> so for <hi>significancy</hi> and <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibleness</hi>)
as occasion serves, <hi>suitable</hi> to
the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of Times, Places, and
Persons.</p>
                  <p>3. We may observe also, That <hi>these</hi> Laws,
and Rules and Orders, being <hi>Apostolical,</hi> are,
as to the <hi>Original,</hi> the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>ground</hi> of them,
<hi>Divine,</hi> as if they came from the very <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
and <hi>Mouth</hi> of Christ himself: So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>They are the Commandments of the
Lord,</hi> (1 Cor. 14. 37.) The Reader may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon what was mentioned above, from
<hi>Calvin, Hemmingius, Dickson,</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi>
in Confirmation hereof. <hi>Calixtus</hi> glosses
thus upon the words, <hi>[Divinoe voluntati
Consentaneum esse.]</hi> Let him know that 'tis
consonant to the Divine Will, that all things
be performed, which the Apostle has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd,
for <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Edification.</hi> For <hi>that
good order be kept is a Divine Command.</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:104660:48"/>
But <hi>what</hi> order ought to be kept, <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi>
is to be collected from the diverse Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Persons, Times, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
Thus <hi>Calixtus.</hi> And <hi>Bullinger</hi> to
the like purpose;<note place="margin">Ad 1 Cor. 14. 37.</note> when the Apostle saith, <hi>If
any one seems to be a Prophet, let him know,
that what I write unto you are the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God;</hi> He does clearly confirm, that
<hi>all,</hi> which he had written of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and
the use of <hi>Tongues,</hi> and of <hi>Ecclesiastical Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi>
in general, <hi>non ex humana sed divina tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditione

                  <p>I shall add yet further, That the Apostle

never intended to <hi>subject</hi> Authority to
the designs of <hi>false Apostles,</hi> or the <hi>pretences</hi>
of the Spirit, or a tender Conscience. He

could not forget that <hi>decretory</hi> Sentence, <hi>He

sometimes very <hi>indulgent</hi> out of his great
Zeal to gain all that were or might be <hi>tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
but when he observed a <hi>Faction</hi> came
in as Spies to find out their <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi>
in order to intangle them in a new yoak of
Bondage, he opposed it with an inflexible
stoutness by his Apostolical Authority. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
when he saw others put a <hi>restraint</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the use of things <hi>indifferent,</hi> for fear of
Sin, or of offending God, or on pretence of
Religion, He severely checkt them as <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious,</hi>
Col. 2. 20. <hi>Touch not, tast not, handle
not.</hi> Whatever <hi>Faction</hi> was in <hi>vogue,</hi> he
ever interposed his Authòrity to quench it.
When <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> was invaded upon
the account of <hi>necessity,</hi> in order to <hi>Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Salvation;</hi> He commands them to
<hi>stand fast</hi> in their <hi>Christian Liberty;</hi> but then
lest they should grow <hi>high</hi> and insolent,
sleight the <hi>Examples</hi> of their worthy <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
and withstand the Laws of a <hi>just</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
He refers them to their <hi>spiritual
Guides,</hi> and injoyns them to follow their
Faith and Practice, (<hi>Hebr. 13. 7, 17.)
Phil. 4. 9.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is this all, He asserts his Authority at
a higher rate than this: He tells them <hi>he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104660:50"/>
has</hi> [Power enough] <hi>in a readiness to avenge
all disobedience;</hi> and to encounter such as were
<hi>puffed</hi> up against his Clemency; which
makes him put it to their Deliberation what
<hi>Method</hi> of Discipline He should use among
them: <hi>What will you? shall I come unto you
with a rod, or in love, or in the spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi>
(1 Cor. 4. last.) And if they will urge
him to it, if he must <hi>use</hi> the Rod, He tells
them he <hi>will not spare,</hi> He will <hi>use sharpness
according to the Power the Lord had given
him, to Edification, and not unto Destruction,</hi>
(2 Cor. 13. 10.) By excusing himself from
this severity, He makes his threatning the
more <hi>formidable,</hi> (saith <hi>Oecumenius</hi>) The
<hi>Power</hi> of inflicting Censures, he ascribes to
Christ; and tho' this Power may by <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
be destructive to the Flesh, yet it is
certainly design'd for the benefit of the
Church; <hi>Nam punire peccantes aedificatio
Ecclesiae est,</hi> the Punishment of Offenders, is
the Edification of the Church, while by the
Punishment of such, others are rendred more
stedfast and more <hi>approved,</hi> says the same
Author,<note place="margin">V. 2 Thes. 3. 65. 14.</note> when he made any <hi>Ordinances,</hi> he
did expect a due observation of them: <hi>Now,
I praise you, brethren, that you remember me
in all things, and keep the Traditions</hi> (or the
<hi>Ordinances) as I delivered them unto you.</hi>
(1 Cor. 11. 2.<note n="*" place="margin">V. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> 1 ad Cor. 11. 2.</note>.) And 'tis observed, These
<hi>Traditions</hi> were not <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> but <hi>Ritual,</hi>
and about things <hi>indifferent;</hi> nor yet were
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104660:50"/>
they <hi>Perpetual,</hi> but <hi>Temporary,</hi> (as <hi>Sclater</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sclater.</note>
notes) And when his <hi>Ordinances</hi> of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were neglected or despised, He could
express himself like a <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Thunder.</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
what he writes upon this Argument
(1 Cor. 14. 37, 38.) and he appeals to such
as pretended to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and to the <hi>gift</hi> of
Prophecy, <hi>If any man think himself to be a
Prophet, or Spiritual, let him acknowledge,
that the things which I write unto you, are
the Commandment of the Lord. But if any
man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</hi> The
Apostle does here anticipate the prejudice of
proud men, (saith <hi>Sclater</hi>) who had it in
their hearts to object thus; <hi>Seeing we are
spiritual, we are able enough surely to judge of
these things; so that you shall not need to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
your opinion.</hi> There were a sort of
high-minded men, who thought themselves
above the Apostles teaching; and the only
Wise men of all the Church, and therefore
they prefer'd themseves above all others;
and here the Apostle does repress their <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious
arrogance</hi> (saith <hi>Aretius.) Dickson</hi>
calls them <hi>Sciolists</hi> (for all their pretended
<hi>Gifts,</hi>) and tells us the Apostle does here <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn</hi>
their <hi>affected ignorance,</hi> and a Precept
being now given to the Governours of the
Church, that they should acknowledge these
Commands to be Divine, He remits these
<hi>ignorant Contemners</hi> of them, to the <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
of Discipline</hi> (that's the <hi>Phrase</hi> it seems
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104660:51"/>
among the <hi>Scotish Presbyterians</hi>) to be dealt
withal according to the Rule and Judgment
of the Apostle. In settling these <hi>Rules</hi> and
<hi>Orders,</hi> the Apostle seems to say, <hi>I have
done my duty; if any man will yet continue
obstinate, and will not understand his own,</hi>
Let him affect his ignorance at his own peril;
<hi>Nam spreta Authoritas Apostolica, Deum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
vindicem,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius;</hi> for when the
Apostolical Authority is despised, God is the
avenger of it. <hi>At<expan>

thus he casts a Bridle upon the Contentious,
who know not how to acquiesce, or make
an end of their disputing.</q> By all this it is
evident, That the Apostle never set up any
Christian Liberty against a just Authority;
never intended to subject Authority to the
designs of <hi>false Apostles</hi> or <hi>Pretenders</hi> to
the Spirit; what he hath delivered in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of <hi>weak Christians</hi> we shall consider

                  <p>In the mean while (and in order to <hi>that</hi>)
it may be worth our inquiry, why the great
Apostle should <hi>vary</hi> so much in his way of

and other Ceremonies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Synops. In Proleg. ad Roman.</note> it is observable,
he treats more <hi>mildly</hi> and <hi>gently</hi> in His Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

to their <hi>weakness</hi> at his first Writing,
which was not to be continued, when success

of the <hi>Synopsis</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Proleg. ad Roman.</note> thinks; but then the

<hi>Soto</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">In Ep. ad Rom. c. 14. 15. p. 379. 1.</note> is of Opinion, That the <hi>Mystery</hi> of
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Vision (which directed him to
converse with <hi>Cornelius</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles,
Act. 10. 10, &amp;c.</hi>) was not yet published to
the <hi>Romans,</hi> or at least that <hi>they</hi> did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the meaning of it; and thence he
Collects also, that the <hi>Council</hi> mentioned,
<hi>Act. 15.</hi> was not then assembled. In the

lay between <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> but in

and <hi>Faith,</hi> saith <hi>Ambianus,</hi>
                     <note n="⸫" place="margin">Argum. Ep. ad Rom.</note> The Apostle
was <hi>angry</hi> with the <hi>Galatians;</hi> because, tho'
they were very well instructed, yet they
were easily seduced. But he ought not to
be angry with the <hi>Romans,</hi> but to commend
their Faith, <hi>quia nulla virtutum videntes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signia

of St. <hi>Ambrose</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Presat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad Rom.</note>) because they had
embraced the Faith, tho' they had seen no
Miracles; and tho' they <hi>mistook</hi> the sense, it
was, because they had not yet been <hi>sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
instructed in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of Christ's Cross.

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Gal. 5.</note>
has observed. The <hi>Jewish</hi> Converts tho'
they embraced the Faith, yet they thought
themselves still obliged to <hi>Moses</hi> Law, to
<hi>abstain</hi> from certain <hi>Meats,</hi> and to <hi>observe</hi>
certain <hi>days</hi> according to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms:
On the other side, the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (and
such as were better instructed in the Truth
of the Gospel) they embraced the <hi>faith</hi> of
Christ, but would not be concern'd in those
<hi>Mosaical</hi> Observances, to which they had
never been addicted; Hereupon <hi>heats</hi> and
<hi>animosities</hi> did arise, which kindled into a
<hi>despising</hi> and <hi>condemning</hi> of one another. Now
in this Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> it was the great
Temper and Prudence of the Apostle to carry
an even hand betwixt the two contending

St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not yet been at <hi>Rome:</hi> And
altho' upon Information and Complaint from
some other Churches, He gave Orders (at a

Miscarriages; yet some other things he
thought fit to reserve till his own perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
presence should give him an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to inspect the Temper and Conditions of
the People, that he might be the better able
to settle such <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> as should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be most convenient. Thus he did in
the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> Many undecent

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104660:52"/>
autem quae ad aedificationem Ecclesiae perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,

St. <hi>Ambros.</hi> ad 1 Cor. 11. ult.) Other things
which concern'd the Edification of the
Church, He promised to set in order by his
presence. And thus de did touching the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some Points of Doctrine
he carefully stated; as <hi>Justification by Grace,
through the Faith, which is in Christ Jesus,</hi> &amp;c.
He Taught the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi>-Converts
likewise, how they should carry themselves
respectively to one another; That the strong
should not <hi>despise</hi> the <hi>weak,</hi> nor the <hi>weak
judge</hi> and condemn the strong. But these
were Directions for <hi>Common</hi> use among <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi>
Christians: but for Decrees and Orders
of <hi>publick use</hi> and practice, he gave out none
to this Church; because as yet, here was no
<hi>Jurisdiction</hi> settled, no <hi>Laws</hi> made, no <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi>
appointed to put them in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This <hi>Grotius</hi> Collects from <hi>Rom. 16.
4, 5,</hi> &amp; 17. <q>This makes me believe, that
there were then no Common Assemblies (of
Christians) saith he, or no <hi>Presbyterie</hi> at
<hi>Rome.</hi> Otherwise in stead of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>mark</hi> such as caused those <hi>Scandals,</hi>
or <hi>Schisms,</hi> He would have had them <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</hi>
For when the Church is
without such <hi>Government,</hi> single Persons
can do no more than avoid familiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with such as live not according
to the Rule of Christ.</q> Thus <hi>Grotius Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi>

seems to Collect no less from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
expostulation, <hi>Rom. 14. 4. Who art thou
that judgest another man's Servant?</hi> Cùm non
sis Pastor aut Dominus ejus, <hi>seeing thou art
neither his Pastour nor his Lord:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou hast no right to pass Sentence on
him. And as much is to be concluded from
the 22 Verse, <hi>Hast thou faith? have it to thy
self before God.</hi> Had there been a <hi>Bishop</hi>
settled there, it had been their Duty in any
Matter of Hesitation, to consult him, to
resolve their Doubts, and settle their Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
But as yet there was no such Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
hereupon he does advise them to be
sincere in their Profession, and to carry
themselves uprightly between God and their
own Conscience. <hi>Catharinus</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
saith thus; <q>Thou hast Faith; that is,
thou hast a clear knowledge of thy Liberty
<hi>in matters indifferent:</hi> But have this <hi>Faith</hi>
to thy self before God; that thou mayest
not hurt thy weak Brother. And this is
always to be the Practice in such things
as the <hi>Church</hi> does <hi>tolerate:</hi> They are
to be dissembled or concealed, and we
must yield to Infirmity, for a time, till
the matter comes to be made more clear.
But then <hi>we ought to dissemble or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal</hi>
(our persuasion) <hi>no longer, but freely
to declare, and boldly to follow what the
Church hath established:</hi>

21.</hi>) That they could not suddenly be <hi>weaned</hi>
from the Practice of them. And they were
a People so <hi>perverse, stubborn,</hi> and <hi>inflexible,</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:104660:54"/>
that St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself was <hi>pendulous</hi> and
knew not well how to handle them: yea,
tho' he had a <hi>Vision</hi> from Heaven to instruct
him in his Duty <hi>that</hi> way (<hi>Act. 10. 10.</hi>) yet
still he was sometimes afraid to <hi>own</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi>
of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and as his fear had
<hi>once</hi> betrayed him to <hi>disown</hi> Christ himself,
so in <hi>this</hi> Case it betray'd him to <hi>disown</hi> his
own <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi> Gal. 2. 11. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was <hi>pendulous</hi> too, and acted the <hi>same</hi> part
for some time upon the <hi>same</hi> account; for
one while, to <hi>comply</hi> with their <hi>Zeal</hi> for the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> He <hi>circumcised Timothy,</hi> (Act.
16. 5.) and <hi>purified</hi> himself with other <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi>
after the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Custom</hi> of the
Law, (<hi>Act. 21. 23.</hi>) But afterward he grew
more resolved (as he perceived the <hi>Jews</hi>
grew more obstinate and malicious) and
would neither yield to have <hi>Titus</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
nor endure <hi>Peter</hi>'s counterfeit <hi>compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
with the humour of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the
<hi>prejudice</hi> of the Gospel, <hi>Gal. 2, 3. 11.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when certain of the <hi>Sect</hi> of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
would needs <hi>intail</hi> Salvation upon <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>
and the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> (Act. 15. 1, 5.)
'twas high time to consult the <hi>Apostles</hi> and
<hi>Elders</hi> about this matter; lest the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
in general should be discouraged from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
the Gospel, and such as had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it already should be tempted to <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi>
from the Profession of it. The <hi>Council</hi>
Convened at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to decide this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104660:54"/>
determines in this <hi>Decree,</hi> That
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should <hi>abstain from meats offered
to Idols, and from blood, and from things stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
and from fornication,</hi> (Vers. 29.)</p>
                  <p>Here is a restraint put upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
in favour of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and they restrain'd
them in one practice which was amongst
them, as a <hi>Foederal Rite</hi> of their Religion,
<hi>eating in their Idols Temples, and of such
meats as had been offer'd unto Idols;</hi> These
things of themselves were <hi>indifferent,</hi> (as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4. and
<hi>Chap. 10, 25, 27.</hi> And among these they
reckon <hi>Fornication;</hi> because (tho' <hi>forbidden</hi>
by the <hi>Moral</hi> Law) it was lookt upon, as a
thing <hi>indifferent</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to a <hi>Coalition</hi> of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
into <hi>one</hi> Communion, they would have the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> so far to conform to the <hi>Jews</hi> in their
daily and familiar Conversation, as to abstain
from (such things as the <hi>Jews</hi> did most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor)
<hi>the eating of things offer'd to Idols,
from blood, and from things strangled;</hi> These
were not necessary <hi>simply</hi> and in <hi>strict</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but <hi>indifferent;</hi> yet being so highly <hi>expedient</hi>
to the Edification and Unity of the
Church, they were pass'd into the <hi>Decree</hi>
as <hi>necessary</hi> things, <hi>Act. 15. 28.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here was nothing determin'd as to the
Point of <hi>Circumcision;</hi> yet in this very <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi>
it was tacitly imply'd, That after the
Death of Christ, neither <hi>Circumcision,</hi> nor
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104660:55"/>
the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Law, were
<hi>necessary</hi> either to the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>obtaining</hi> of Faith or Salvation.
And yet to <hi>such Jews</hi> as became <hi>Christians,</hi>
and lived in <hi>Palestine,</hi> they concluded the
observation thereof <hi>so far forth</hi> necessary,
till the <hi>Destruction of the Temple,</hi> that they
might not seem to have lost their <hi>reverence</hi>
for God's Commands, and by that means
so <hi>alienate</hi> the minds of their Countreymen
both from themselves, and from Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                  <p>To decide the Case concerning the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law,</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> does distinguish <hi>three</hi>
Periods of Times. The <hi>first,</hi> before Christ's
<hi>Passion,</hi> wherein those Precepts were <hi>alive,</hi>
in <hi>vigour</hi> and of great <hi>obligation.</hi> The <hi>second</hi>
time was from the <hi>passion</hi> of Christ to the
<hi>sufficient Promulgation</hi> of the Gospel, wherein
those Precepts were <hi>dead,</hi> and did neither
<hi>bind</hi> nor <hi>profit</hi> any body, yet they were not
<hi>deadly:</hi> but <hi>tolerated</hi> and <hi>exposed</hi> to <hi>view</hi>
as a <hi>Herse</hi> lay'd in <hi>state,</hi> till they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an <hi>honourable Burial,</hi> in the <hi>rubbish</hi> of
the Temple. But when men began to pay
an <hi>awful Reverence</hi> to this deceased <hi>Body</hi> of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and to put their <hi>trust</hi> in it for <hi>Grace</hi>
and <hi>Salvation;</hi> then the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
of this Law became <hi>deadly,</hi> and began
to stink, as false <hi>signs</hi> of a thing <hi>to come,</hi>
which really was already <hi>past;</hi> and then
<hi>this</hi> Law was utterly <hi>exploded</hi> as an <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:104660:55"/>
and an object of <hi>Superstition.</hi> To this
observation of <hi>times</hi> by the Apostles, I shall
add but one thing more: There was a <hi>time</hi>
when the Apostle thought fit to tell the
<hi>Philippians,</hi> that in <hi>some Cases,</hi> they might
(then) expect a clearer <hi>Revelation, Phil. 3. 15.</hi>
But we being so well <hi>assured,</hi> that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture is <hi>Consigned</hi> to the
Church, He will be in great danger of
<hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> who now expects a <hi>further</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
                  <p>2. As the Apostles did observe <hi>times,</hi> so
they did determine <hi>things.</hi> What things
were determined by that <hi>Council,</hi> (Act. 15.)
(for a <hi>temporary</hi> observation among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>)
you have seen already: But the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
question,</hi> that about <hi>Circumcision,</hi> was left
undecided. At this the <hi>false Apostles</hi> and
<hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Pharisees</hi> took advantage. That
<hi>Gentiles</hi> might be admitted into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
they did not deny, but would have
<hi>Them</hi> made <hi>Proselytes</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Circumcision</hi> was the <hi>foederal Rite:</hi> This
Sacrament therefore they must receive for
their <hi>initiation,</hi> else they could not be saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(as <hi>Act. 15. 15.</hi>) This makes the Apostle
write so sharply against <hi>Circumcision</hi> (which
in effect did imply an <hi>obligation</hi> to observe
the <hi>whole</hi> Law, <hi>Gal. 5.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In short, <hi>Those</hi> Converts, whether brought
into the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104660:56"/>
Case was this: The <hi>Jewish</hi> part of them had
been Educated under the <hi>Discipline</hi> of <hi>Moses;</hi>
The <hi>false Apostles</hi> told them they were yet
under the <hi>bond</hi> of that Dispensation, and
some were so simple and <hi>weak</hi> as to believe
them. Hereupon they had still an eye to
those Jewish <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> even in
the <hi>use</hi> of Christ's own <hi>Institutions.</hi> They
did <hi>Judaize</hi> in the Matter of Circumcision,
and <hi>Paschatize</hi> in the Use of the Lord's <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
wherein they had a greater <hi>veneration</hi>
and respect for their old <hi>Passover</hi> than for
Christ's <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and for this reason<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot.</hi> Ad 1 Cor. 11. 29.</note> the
Apostle taxeth them, That in the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, They did <hi>not discern the Lord's
Body.</hi> By this means the Apostle tells them
they did <hi>renounce</hi> their part in Christ, and
were <hi>faln from Grace,</hi> (Gal. 5. 2, 4.) And
he says, as ill things of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For by
the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of their Religion,
and particularly by their <hi>Feasts</hi> in the <hi>Idols</hi>
Temple, they held a <hi>Communion</hi> with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.
Now to see such as had taken upon
them the Profession of Christianity, play
the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in addicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the <hi>Institutions, Rites,</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
of <hi>that</hi> Religion and Worship, which
<hi>those Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles respectively</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
and practise, This was such a <hi>Scandal</hi>
to the Conscientious and weak Disciples, the
Apostle could not dissemble the resentment
of it; but tells them plainly, They did <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:104660:56"/>
Christ in it, they <hi>were faln from Grace,</hi>
and were in <hi>Communion</hi> with Devils<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 3. 4. 1 Cor. 10. 20, 21.</note>, and
Christ should <hi>profit</hi> them nothing; and the
Scandal they gave hereby might harden <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,</hi>
and betray <hi>weak</hi> Christians to fall
into the same state of Condemnation<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 9, 10, 11, 12.</note>.
Hereupon they came to a determination, and
did actually <hi>restrain</hi> the <hi>use</hi> of Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in <hi>these</hi> things.</p>
                  <p>3. They did <hi>distinguish</hi> of Persons: among
Christians, they found some that were <hi>weak,</hi>
and some that were <hi>strong:</hi> The <hi>strong</hi> were
those that were <hi>sound in the Faith;</hi> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
understood the <hi>extent</hi> of Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>use</hi> of things <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:</hi>
they could <hi>forbear</hi> or <hi>use</hi> them as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
served, without hesitation or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness:
<hi>They were offended at nothing;</hi> The
<hi>weak</hi> were such as had the Faith <hi>newly</hi> plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them: They were <hi>Novices</hi> in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and their Faith being yet <hi>tender,</hi> was
apt to be <hi>shaken</hi> by ill <hi>Documents</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</hi>
'Tis an Observation of St. <hi>Hìerom</hi>
(on <hi>Mat. 18. 6.) Quòd qui scandalizatur, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulus
est: Majores enim scandala non recipiunt:</hi>

                  <p>From <hi>This</hi> distinction of Persons, some
things are observable.</p>
                  <p>1. That this <hi>weakness</hi> proceeds from <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
1 Cor. 8. 7. <hi>Howbeit there is not in
every man that knowledge. Then</hi> when the
Church was an <hi>Infant,</hi> certain of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

he saith, <hi>That Commandement</hi> (Rom. 14. 22.)
<hi>was given by</hi> Paul <hi>for those times, when men
were not fully persuaded of the use of God's
Creatures, as Meats, Drinks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but to these

be applied to us for this Reason.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>there</hi> gives Directions to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
the differences betwixt <hi>private</hi>
persons: But among us the contest is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>Private Dissenters</hi> from her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Now when from an <hi>indifferent</hi> action,
or the omission of it, <hi>one</hi> of two Evils will
necessarily follow, right Reason dictates,
that I must so act or omit acting, that I may
avoid the greater evil. But certainly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under <hi>her</hi> Jurisdiction, 'tis a greater evil
to offend the <hi>Church</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 18. 17.</note> than any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or persons, who are but <hi>Members</hi> of it.
And, as when the competition is betwixt
<hi>them,</hi> I must obey God, rather than Man:
So when the Competition is between the

Church, and private persons, Common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will soon determine, which is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd.
The right stands presumptively for
the Governing Party, who are in Possession
of their Authority; and I am certainly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
in Law and Conscience to adhere and

that other <hi>Rule</hi> of the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 6. 10.
Let us do good unto all men, especially to them,
who are of the houshold of Faith.</hi> If I cannot

                  <p>I would fain know also of these <hi>Dissenters,</hi>

If they be <hi>strong</hi> in the Faith, then they are
so well instructed in the Nature of <hi>Christian

be <hi>offended</hi> at the use or forbearance of such
things: If they be <hi>weak,</hi> that weakness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from <hi>ignorance',</hi> and a <hi>proneness</hi> to <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi>

1. I must not omit a <hi>Duty</hi> to avoid Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal;
for that were to <hi>do evil</hi> that good may
come, which the Apostle says is damnable,
(<hi>Rom. 3. 8.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Nor 2. Can I properly be said to <hi>give</hi>
Scandal by performing that which is my
duty <hi>antecedently</hi> to that Scandal; for then
my duty should be my sin: and I should be
under a necessity of sinning, whether I
do my duty, or do it not; which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Spiritual</hi> things which are <hi>necessary</hi> to
Salvation<note n="*" place="margin">

to Salvation, <hi>Rom. 13. 5. Hebr. 13. 7. 17.</hi>
I <hi>give</hi> no Offence in doing my bounden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
But He that <hi>takes</hi> offence at it, He does

<hi>doubts</hi> of the <hi>Authority</hi> that Commands the
duty; yet if I be well persuaded of it, I
must govern my self not by <hi>His,</hi> but

<hi>Rom. 14. 5.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It may be objected further, That the
Apostle would have us do (as he says he
did himself) <hi>Please all men:</hi> But we should
remember there is a <hi>restraint</hi> put upon the
duty: we must only please them for their
<hi>good,</hi> that is, their <hi>Spiritual</hi> profit, <hi>that they
may be saved,</hi> Rom. 15. 2. with 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 33.

The Apostle requires Christians <hi>to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

Rom. 14. 19.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 1. 'Tis some comfort that in this

                  <p>The Apostle therefore does not enjoyn the

more tender in the point, as appears, not
only by his</hi> general advice, <hi>but also by his</hi>
personal resolution. It is good, <hi>saith he,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
or is made weak, <hi>Rom. 14. 21. and
1 Cor. 8. 13.</hi> If meat make my brother to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
I will eat no flesh while the world
standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, That many <hi>Expositors</hi>
do restrain the words of the Apostle, to such
Wine and Flesh as had been <hi>offer'd</hi> up in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to Heathen-<hi>Idols;</hi> and so the sense is
clear and easie; and I know no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
but would observe the Rule, if there
were occasion for it. For, as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>
noteth upon (<hi>1 Cor. 8. 13.</hi>) <q>a measure is to
be observed in those things which the Law
allows us. <hi>Vxorem certè licet habere: sed
si fornicata fuerit, abjicienda est: ita &amp; Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
licet edere, sed si idolis Oblata fuerit,

                     </q> It is lawful to have a Wife;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104660:64"/>
but if she commits Fornication, she is to be
put away: so we may <hi>eat</hi> flesh; but if it be
offer'd up to <hi>Idols,</hi> it is to be refused: Thus
St. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> But this concerns not us at all;
For we have no such flesh sold in our Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
no such wine in our Taverns, no such
<hi>Heathen Feasts,</hi> no such <hi>Idols</hi> (God be thank'd)
among us. But, I answer,</p>
                  <p>2. The Apostle writes (especially to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi>) as an <hi>Orator,</hi> by way of <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole</hi>
&amp; <hi>exaggeration</hi>

may learn from St. <hi>Austin;</hi> For (as he hath

<hi>both;</hi> for <hi>both</hi> are scrupulous, and <hi>both</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively

To eat and not to eat; to esteem
a day, and not to esteem it; These
are perfect Contradictions; and 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for any Charity, for the Charity of an
Apostle, to reconcile his Practice to <hi>both</hi> their
Scruples. St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself (at last) found
this <hi>insuperable</hi> difficulty by Experience, upon
the <hi>congress</hi> of the <hi>Jew,</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts.
Therefore instead of a charitable and pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<hi>expedient</hi> (which in this Case was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to find out) He <hi>withstood</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> to
<hi>the face,</hi> and with great integrity and stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
asserted the <hi>truth</hi> of the Gospel; and
the <hi>extent</hi> of Christian Liberty. (<hi>Gal. 2.</hi>) And
herein He left us (His own Practice) an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
to maintain our <hi>privilege;</hi> and not
to govern our selves by the timorous <hi>squeam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness,</hi>
or pretended <hi>scruples</hi> of <hi>superstitious</hi>
men (which may be contradictory and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less)
but by the solid <hi>Rules</hi> of Truth, and the
Prudent <hi>Resolutions</hi> of Pious Governours.</p>
                  <p>7. It may be further alleadged, that the
Apostle would not have us make use of our
Christian <hi>Liberty</hi> against <hi>Charity, (Rom. 14.
15.</hi>) 'Tis very true Charity should <hi>direct</hi>
and <hi>moderate</hi> our Christian Liberty, that our
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104660:65"/>
mutual content may not be disturbed by the
abuse of that Liberty: but rather, that we
may Worship and glorifie our God with <hi>una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.</hi>
Charity is a great <hi>Mistress</hi> within
her own <hi>Jurisdiction;</hi> and when <hi>positive</hi> Laws
may be superseded, the Law of <hi>Charity</hi> will
oblige us. But must the Church spend all
her stock of <hi>Charity</hi> upon these <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
while they have no love, no respect at all for
the Church? In reference to a private Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
there is <hi>Debitum Charitatis,</hi> a debt of
Charity: but in reference to my Governours
there is<note n="†" place="margin">

                     <hi>Debitum necessitatis,</hi> (in respect of

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir. pa. 348.</note>.
The Apostle tells us, That <hi>love</hi> is the
<hi>fulfilling of the Law;</hi> and certainly, if it be
an <hi>Ordinate</hi> love, when it looks upon the
<hi>Second</hi> Table, it will begin with the Practice
of the <hi>Fifth</hi> Commandment. And it ought
to be considered, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks with
reference to <hi>Authority,</hi> when he gives that
injunction (<hi>1 Pet. 2. 16.) As free, and not
using your Liberty as a cloak of maliciousness,
but as the Servants of God.</hi> My Liberty is
like my <hi>cloak</hi> in this, that I may <hi>lay it down,</hi>
or put it <hi>on,</hi> as occasion shall require. And
it shews very little respect to my Superiours,
if I will not lay aside my <hi>cloak</hi> to take an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
walk with them into the <hi>House</hi> of
God. And if, notwithstanding our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Liberty, (<hi>Gal. 5. 13, 14.</hi>) the <hi>Law of
love</hi> does oblige us <hi>to serve</hi> all Men, sure it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104660:66"/>
can never allow us to <hi>dispise</hi> our Governours,

                     <hi>Rom. 15. 3. 5.</hi> For never could any Man be

would have us to be so too, (when the Party
is to be treated with tenderness) we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from the <hi>severity</hi> of his Sentence upon

for all that great Compassion, which he had

His Divine Wisdom was pleased to make

In short, when <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> is set up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Order, Decorum and common honesty,</hi>
'tis set up against <hi>Authority,</hi> (1 Cor. 14. last.)
when it is set up against the <hi>common Methods</hi>
of <hi>Edification</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> 'tis set up against
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104660:68"/>
                     <hi>Charity;</hi> (Rom. 14. 19.) when 'tis set up
against <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Sobriety;</hi> 'tis made
an <hi>occasion to the flesh,</hi> (Gal. 5. 13.) when it
is made use of to <hi>palliate</hi> the designs of <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious</hi>
and <hi>ambitious</hi> men, 'tis used as a <hi>cloak</hi>
of <hi>malitiousness.</hi> In all these Cases there is
<hi>Apostolical</hi> Authority to <hi>restrain</hi> our Liberty.
And in Matters of Religion, what Liberty
can we justly claim, more than what Christ
hath obtain'd, and his Grace conferr'd upon
us? A Liberty <hi>to serve God acceptably</hi> (in all
instances of the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Table) <hi>with
reverence and Godly fear?</hi> Hebr. 12. 28. To
this purpose Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">In 1 Pet. 2. 16.</note> observes, That
St. <hi>Peter</hi> pronounceth them <hi>free</hi> who are the
Servants of God, <hi>Vnde colligere promptum est,
hanc esse finem libertatis nostrae, ut promptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

Neque enim aliud est quam manumissio à peccato.
Atqui peccato dominium tollitur, ut se in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectionem

                     <q>From
whence, saith He, 'tis easie to Collect, that
the end of our Liberty is, that we may
be the more prompt and ready for God's
Service; and obey him with the greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.
Nor is this Liberty any thing
else, but a <hi>Manumission</hi> from Sin. And the
<hi>Dominion</hi> is taken from Sin, that men may
render themselves up to the <hi>Subjection</hi> of
Righteousness.</q> Thus <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. I must tell my weak Brother, that
Christ hath establisht a <hi>Church,</hi> and placed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104660:68"/>
me under <hi>Governours,</hi> and given <hi>them</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to <hi>restrain</hi> and <hi>determine</hi> the use of my
Liberty, according to their Christian <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
by such <hi>Rules,</hi> and to such <hi>ends</hi> and
purposes as he himself has prescribed. And
tho' he has left some things <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
in the <hi>general,</hi> yet it will certainly be
my great Sin to do them <hi>unseasonably,</hi> as
when I <hi>despise</hi> Authority, <hi>break good Order,</hi>
and destroy the <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of the
Church; for this will be an <hi>affront</hi> to Christ
himself, who establisht such a Constitution (in
his Church) long before I came into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of it; and hath said, <hi>He that heareth
you heareth me; and he that despiseth you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth
me: And every Soul, which will not
hear that Prophet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 3. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>shall be destroyed from
among the People.</hi> Hereupon I take it for
granted, that I am justified in my Obedience
to the Voice of the Church by the <hi>Concession</hi>
of this <hi>Author,</hi> (which hath been mentioned
already somewhere in the <hi>Margent</hi> of these
Papers) <hi>For</hi> (saith He) <hi>if my Brother will
be offended at what God has made my</hi> duty,
<hi>there's no Remedy, but that he lay aside his</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
offence, <hi>and not that I lay aside my</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
duty. <hi>Mel. Inquir.</hi> page 348. which Rule,
(if well apply'd) will (very near) determine
the whole Case betwixt us.</p>
                  <p>I may add for the further information of
such a <hi>Brother.</hi> That God expects, a <hi>solemn
Publick</hi> Worship should be <hi>settled</hi> in his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104660:69"/>
Church, and <hi>religiously perform'd</hi> to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Glory. That there can be no <hi>such,</hi>
unless the <hi>use</hi> of our Liberty be <hi>retrench't;</hi>
for otherwise how shall we come to an <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
for <hi>Time, Place, Forme, Gesture, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>
and all such other <hi>circumstances</hi> as are
to be determined? God hath therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> and establisht Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Governours to this effect: That
<hi>This</hi> Government and Authority is <hi>Divine</hi>
and <hi>Sacred,</hi> and not to be controul'd but by
a Warrant and Commission from some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that is <hi>Higher.</hi> That we must come
to an <hi>agreement</hi> about <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
and solemnize God's <hi>Publick</hi> Worship,
our <hi>Author</hi> is very positive<note n="*" place="margin">V. p. 273. &amp; 275, 276. of <hi>Melius Inquiren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi>
                     </note>. <hi>For this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
(saith He) <hi>is so straitly bound upon the
Consciences of all Churches, that tho' none should
determine for them, nay tho' All should deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
against them, yet are they under its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and must come to an issue about it,</hi> (but
by what means is unintelligible, if there be
<hi>none</hi> to determine for them, nay, if <hi>All</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
against them, yet to an Issue, and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
about it, come they must) <hi>unless</hi> (saith
He) <hi>they will draw the guilt of the neglect of
worshipping God upon their Souls, with that
wrath, which is due to so great contempt of the
Divine Law.</hi> Thus our <hi>Melius Inquirendum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, I will tell this Brother, I cannot
go to Church and be at home at the same
time; no more than I can make both parts
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104660:69"/>
of a Contradiction true: Wherefore that I
may not continue pendulous, and be ever in
suspense, and so make no use at all of my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
I must determine my self one way or
other. But if the Church, which I take to
be wiser than my self, shall in some instances
(as she sees occasion) determine for me, I will
dutifully submit my self to her Authority.
And he walks very uncharitably, who takes
upon him to censure my Practice, or judge
my Conscience for so doing.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ferus</hi> ad Rom. 14.</note> For I know it
is not this carnal liberty of the flesh (to do or
not to do) that makes me a Christian; But
Righteousness and Peace, Humility, and other
Virtues of Religion. And upon a full exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Particulars, I am very well satisfied
that the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in use among
us, are not <hi>introductive</hi> to any <hi>false</hi> Religion
or Worship; but rather a <hi>Bar</hi> against it,
(even against that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
(and by no man else) it is most suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to favour.) They gratifie neither the
Opinion of the <hi>Jew,</hi> nor of the <hi>Gentile;</hi> They
lead neither to Idolatry, nor Superstition;
They are not ridiculous for any levity that is
in them; nor burdensome for their number;
and in short, they are not sinful; because
against no Law; for Sin is the Transgression
of a Law; and where no Law is, there is no
Transgression.</p>
                  <p>3. 'Tis the supposition of our Author, <hi>that
this Liberty must hold</hi> in utram<expan>

hence I infer, that our Christian Liberty is
more infringed by the <hi>Dogmatical Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the <hi>Dissenting</hi> Teachers, than by the
<hi>Prudent</hi> and <hi>Regular Impositions</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Governours. For besides <hi>their</hi> want of

free under him that will not let me <hi>kneel</hi> (for

so he does likewise against the <hi>superstitious

for these <hi>Negatives,</hi> (and have little besides

saith <hi>D. Dickson</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Rom. 14. 22.</note>; Liberty of Conscience
consists no less in the use of things, than in

than in the use of them. But till

whether the <hi>aversion</hi> he has to the

of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Modesty</hi> in Himself; or from
want of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
or from want of a due <hi>examination</hi> of
the <hi>nature, ends,</hi> and <hi>usefulness</hi> of the things
establish't; or from want of <hi>Candour</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity</hi>
in putting a fair construction on

                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:104660:71"/>
For the very same <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
which we have in the Church of <hi>England</hi>
are in use in all the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches with
<hi>many</hi> others. And although the Churches
under <hi>Calvin</hi>'s denomination have not <hi>all</hi>
that are practised amongst us, yet none are
more <hi>strict</hi> than <hi>they</hi> in the Observation of
such as they have establisht.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Obedience</hi> to Authority is certainly
the <hi>duty</hi> of God's Servants: St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it
<hi>well-doing (1 Pet. 2. 13, 15, 16.</hi>) and makes
it as well a branch of God's <hi>Will,</hi> as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of our Christian <hi>Liberty.</hi> For, as Mr.
<hi>Perkin</hi>'s (on <hi>Gal. 4. 28.</hi>) has very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
<hi>This is perfect Liberty, when man's
will is conformable to the Will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor does any Church think her Liberty
<hi>impeach't</hi> by such <hi>Impositions.</hi> For the use and
<hi>excellency</hi> of my Christian Liberty lyes in
this, that it teaches me to be just and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
without <hi>constraint;</hi> and so 'tis no <hi>burden</hi>
to me. I can comply with the Commands
of my Superiors, and carry my Liberty along
with me. And all the while I hold to the
generous Resolution of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 6.
12. All things are lawful for me: but I will not
be brought under the Power of any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Knowing the <hi>Dominion</hi> I have over such
<hi>indifferent</hi> things, I will gratifie my <hi>weak</hi>
Brother as far as I am able, <hi>treat</hi> and <hi>instruct</hi>
him with all <hi>ingenuity</hi> and freedom in the use
of <hi>them.</hi> And if my Superiours shall think
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104660:72"/>
fit to <hi>retrench</hi> the Practice of my freedom in
some particular Instances, (that the world
may see I am not under the sullen Spirit of
<hi>fear</hi> and <hi>bondage,</hi> but acted by a <hi>free</hi> Gospel-Spirit,
<hi>the Spirit of Power, of Love, and of
a sound mind,</hi>) I will conform my self to their
Commands with so much ease, cheerfulness,
and satisfaction, that it shall not look like a
<hi>force</hi> or restraint upon me, but as an <hi>exercise</hi>
of my Liberty, being very well assured for
<hi>whose</hi> sake, and upon what <hi>account</hi> and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
I do it. And,</p>
                  <p>6. When I consider, that things <hi>indifferent</hi>
may be <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> used (as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and every Man's Experience can tell
him) I cannot but think my self happy in the
Churches appointment; for when she has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
my choice by her <hi>Injunctions,</hi> (to
<hi>stand</hi> or <hi>kneel</hi> for example) if I perform it
with <hi>alacrity</hi> and <hi>reverence,</hi> (as I should do)
I find a <hi>satisfaction</hi> in my <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi>
and I am the more obliged to my
Superiours for the <hi>good use</hi> of my Liberty,
which I might have used amiss; and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that which was but <hi>indifferent</hi> of its own
Nature, to become of good advantage to me
by her Authority. And yet such is my <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
freedom even in the use of these things,
that while I practice them, I am not at a <hi>loss</hi>
either for my <hi>liberty</hi> or my <hi>duty.</hi> I am not
in <hi>bondage</hi> either to <hi>fear</hi> a Curse, or to <hi>hope</hi> for
Merit, or to seek for <hi>ease</hi> of Conscience, or
<hi>Salvation</hi> in them.</p>

made so: and that I do not slander them, you

as to say, they <hi>think,</hi> they <hi>doubt,</hi> or <hi>scruple:</hi>
but positively and definitively they tell us,
They <hi>judge it sinful:</hi> but by what express
Law, or clear Deduction, they can never make
us understand. They menage the Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their <hi>Proselytes</hi> betwixt so much <hi>awe</hi>
and <hi>boldness,</hi> that they can make them either
take the <hi>hedge,</hi> or start at a <hi>shadow.</hi> They <hi>tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle</hi>
them with a <hi>conceit</hi> of Liberty, while they
<hi>inthrall</hi> them to their own <hi>Dictates,</hi> and put
upon their <hi>Necks</hi> a yoak of their <hi>own</hi> making;
much heavier, than that of their Governours,
which they attempt so strenuously to shake
off. And when they are charged with such
unwarrantable Practices to the <hi>Scandal</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the <hi>disturbance</hi> of the Publick
Peace, where do they take <hi>Sanctuary</hi> but in
the Temple of a <hi>Tender</hi> Conscience?</p>
                  <p>Conscience, I confess, is a <hi>Centurion</hi> of great
Command; but yet 'tis under another Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and must be <hi>accountable</hi> for her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104660:75"/>
Nor is her <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Privilege</hi> so great
as is imagined. For the whole Nature and
force of <hi>Conscience</hi> is exprest in a <hi>Practical Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism,</hi>
which consists of <hi>three</hi> Propositions
according to the <hi>three</hi> Offices of Conscience.
For instance; <hi>He that will not obey the Church,
is to be treated as a Publican and a Heathen:</hi>
This is the <hi>Major</hi> Proposition, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
express Revelation. But <hi>thou do'st not
obey the Church:</hi> This is the <hi>Minor</hi> Proposition,
produced and attested by the Conscience.
Therefore <hi>Thou art to be treated as a Publican
and a Heathen.</hi> This is the <hi>Third</hi> Proposition
or <hi>Conclusion</hi> inferr'd from the other Two.</p>
                  <p>By this instance we see Conscience hath a
<hi>threefold</hi> Office. 1. To <hi>Dictate</hi> and declare
the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Law. This is call'd <hi>Synteresis.</hi>
The Second is to <hi>Record</hi> and declare Matters
of <hi>Fact;</hi> and this is call'd <hi>Syneidesis.</hi> The Third
is to give <hi>Sentence</hi> according to the merits or
demerits of the <hi>Cause,</hi> and so to determine
the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Person; and this is called
<hi>Crisis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is all the Power that Conscience hath;
And 'tis clear that Conscience hath no Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>any</hi> of these Offices. Not in the <hi>First:</hi>
not a Liberty to <hi>call evil Good,</hi> or <hi>Good evil:</hi>
not a Liberty to <hi>dictate</hi> or declare what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man please to be the sence or letter of the
Law; for then it should have a Liberty to
<hi>erre</hi> and to <hi>deceive,</hi> by <hi>imposing</hi> that for a
<hi>Rule</hi> of Law, which is not so. For Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104660:76"/>
(in this Notion, that is, the <hi>Synteresis</hi>)
is obliged to take direction from the <hi>Light of
Reason,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations</hi> of God's Will,
and from <hi>Humane Laws</hi> consonant thereto
(for <hi>such</hi> Laws made by persons <hi>set over us</hi> in
God's stead, must be obeyed <hi>for the Lord's
sake:</hi>) if the Conscience directs <hi>otherwise,</hi> it
is <hi>erroneous,</hi> and leads to Sin, and binds over
to Damnation, till it be corrected, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
conformable to its Rule.</p>
                  <p>Nor has the Conscience any Liberty in the
<hi>Second</hi> Office, in <hi>reporting</hi> Matters of <hi>Fact;</hi>
for then it should have Liberty to <hi>misinform</hi>
or <hi>tell</hi> a <hi>lie,</hi> in representing Matters of <hi>Fact</hi>
otherwise than they are. Nor has Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
any Liberty in the <hi>Third</hi> Office, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
the <hi>Case;</hi> for then it should have
Liberty to be an <hi>unjust judge,</hi> to absolve or
Condemn; that is, to <hi>pass Sentence</hi> contrary
to the <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Verdict.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true an <hi>evil</hi> Conscience may, <hi>now,</hi>
make use of many <hi>shifts, tergiverses,</hi> and <hi>eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi>
but at the <hi>Grand Assize,</hi> (or time of
Judgment) God will beat it off from all its
<hi>Subterfuges,</hi> and <hi>starting holes,</hi> He will <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie</hi>
and <hi>refine</hi> it, and make it a <hi>faithful Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan</hi>
to him in <hi>that</hi> exercise of his Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
For then the <hi>Synteresis,</hi> (call'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>the inward man</hi>) shall fully <hi>consent</hi> to
the Law of God, that it is <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Just,</hi>
and <hi>Good.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> And for the <hi>breach</hi> of that Law
(which is Matter of Fact) it will be a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104660:76"/>
witnesses.</hi> And in the issue of the <hi>Trial,</hi> it
will <hi>subscribe</hi> to the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the Judge, in
a due acknowledgment of his <hi>Justice,</hi> saying
with the Angel out of the Altar, <hi>Even so
Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 16. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>God, Almighty, true and just are thy
judgments.</hi> Thus it will be at that <hi>great Day.</hi>
And <hi>now,</hi> all the Liberty that a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
has, or can pretend to, is a <hi>freedom</hi>
from the <hi>Power</hi> of Satan, and the <hi>Law</hi> of Sin,
from the <hi>rigour</hi> and <hi>yoak</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> his Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to do our <hi>duty</hi> to God and Man, (to
<hi>work</hi> or <hi>forbear</hi> working) without <hi>hesitation</hi>
or <hi>scruple,</hi> according to the <hi>Injunctions</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions</hi>
of the Gospel; The <hi>measures</hi> whereof
we have already given some account of, (if I
be not much mistaken) to a reasonable Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>Here, if it be a <hi>digression,</hi> it is very pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
to take notice of a sort of <hi>busie</hi> men,
who seem to carry on a <hi>subtil Project</hi> (and
there are more than one o' foot) under this
<hi>disguise</hi> (of Liberty of Conscience.)</p>
                  <p>They make love to <hi>natural Religion,</hi> choose
her for their <hi>Mistress,</hi> and cry up her <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
to so great a height, as if Christ and
his Apostles came out of her <hi>School,</hi> and the
<hi>Moral</hi> of the Gospel were to be taken from the
<hi>Philosophy</hi> of the Heathens.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I know very well, we may borrow</hi> Jewels
of the Egyptians, <hi>provided we do not turn
them into</hi> Idols, <hi>or value them above the</hi>
Gospel-Pearl, <hi>which is truely</hi> Orient. <hi>For
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104660:77"/>
the Apostle tells us of the Heathens, that</hi> when
they knew God, they did not glorifie him as God.
That professing themselves to be wise, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
fools; <hi>for</hi> their foolish heart was darkned,
and they changed the Glory of the uncorruptible
God,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> not only <hi>into</hi> an Image made like to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
man, <hi>but also</hi> to birds and four-footed
beasts, and creeping things; and worshipped and
served the Creature more than the Creator: <hi>In
their</hi> Theology, <hi>which was that</hi> wisdom <hi>which
had God for the</hi> object<note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Lights.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.</note>, <hi>They</hi> knew not <hi>God;
and generally their</hi> Morals <hi>were as</hi> Corrupt <hi>as
their</hi> Divinity<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 1. 26 to 32. And Eph. 4. 18, 19.</note>. <hi>Hence the Apostle saith,</hi>
After that in the wisdom of God, the world by
wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the
foolishness of preaching to save them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 21.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet this <hi>Natural Religion</hi> is laid down with
much <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>embellished</hi> with great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
as an immoveable <hi>foundation</hi> for
<hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> And this Liberty of
Conscience is, by several <hi>Engineers,</hi> set up
to <hi>supplant</hi> the present Church of <hi>England.</hi>
And this done, <hi>the Great Mysteries of our
Faith,</hi> and <hi>the Institutions of the Gospel</hi> will
with little difficulty, be <hi>depretiated</hi> at the
first, and at last utterly <hi>evacuated</hi> and <hi>explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
Then the <hi>Socinian System,</hi> or <hi>Model of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>
will pass for <hi>Currant;</hi> and <hi>That</hi> by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Wits, will easily (by degrees) be reconcil'd
to the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> And what will the issue be
but this? Men, at the long run, will be at a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104660:77"/>
loss for their Religion. They will see the <hi>Holy
Sacraments</hi> laid aside, if not trampled under
foot, as obsolete or Temporary Institutions:
the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the Blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> accounted
a vain Speculation of doting <hi>Schoolmen:</hi> the
<hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Eternal Son of God, an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible</hi>
and unaccountable thing, and
an <hi>Omnipotent</hi> Redeemer, with his <hi>satisfaction</hi>
and pretious <hi>merits,</hi> but an useless imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And in fine what will all this amount
to? Pious and Sober persons will in time, not
only be <hi>awakened,</hi> but <hi>offended</hi> at it; and will
think themselves highly concern'd also to
search, (tho' it be among the much <hi>Rubbish</hi> of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) to find out the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christianity.</hi> This I confess will be the
furthest way about; but it will advance the
<hi>Jesuits</hi> design as certainly, as if it were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish't
by a shorter Method. Which would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well become the wisdom of our Governors
to take into their most serious consideration.</p>
                  <p>But to return, Our great <hi>Patrons</hi> of Liberty,
are wont to rely much upon that charge of
the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 5. 1. Stand fast in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
wherewith Christ hath made us free, and
be not intangled again with the</hi> (or in a) <hi>yoak
of bondage.</hi> But what is that <hi>Liberty</hi> he writes
of? He is writing unto Gentiles. And the
<hi>Gentile</hi> world, (<hi>the creature</hi>) which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
mentions, <hi>Rom. 8. 21.</hi> was to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from <hi>the bondage of Corruption,</hi> à jugo
&amp; servitute corruptionis Peccaminosae, <hi>from
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104660:78"/>

The <hi>Commands</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the <hi>Civil

(Mat. 18. 17.) And that we may not

the Apostle speaks of the <hi>Governours</hi> of the

we have Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Suffrage, who thus sums

1. That of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law. 2. That of
<hi>Satan</hi>'s Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Satan</hi>'s yoak, is a yoak of <hi>Tyranny:</hi> for
He <hi>is the Prince of the Power of the air, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that worketh in the children of disobedience,
Eph. 2. 2.</hi> This yoak is made up of the <hi>Pomps

and Idolatry</hi> (with all the unclean and
filthy practices which did attend them) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Devil had <hi>inthrall'd</hi> the <hi>Heathen
world.</hi> These <hi>Galathians,</hi> for a long time, had
had their <hi>Necks</hi> under <hi>this</hi> yoak: but were
now set at <hi>liberty</hi> by the light of the Gospel;
yet were there a sort of <hi>false Apostles,</hi> who
for their own ease &amp; advantage, made it their
business to <hi>entangle</hi> them in <hi>another</hi> yoak,
which they had not been <hi>accustom'd</hi> to, the
yoak of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi>
and therefore he saith, <hi>be not entangled again

saith <hi>G. Calixtus:</hi> 
                     <q>This word <hi>[Again]</hi> does
not signifie the same kind of bondage, but
simply and generally an <hi>iterated,</hi> or repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Ceremonies, as you had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

from one <hi>heavy</hi> yoak, be not <hi>intangled</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
be not <hi>insnared</hi> and <hi>inthrall'd,</hi> so as to
seek your <hi>ease,</hi> your <hi>pardon,</hi> your <hi>salvation,</hi> in
another, which is of no more <hi>validity to that</hi>
effect, than the former, which Christ hath
therefore equally freed you from: But what
is all this to the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the
Church of <hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that will undertake, from the Doctrine of
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to impeach the Practice of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> in commanding the <hi>observance</hi> of <hi>Rites</hi> and
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and thereby <hi>restraining</hi> the use of our
<hi>Christian Liberty</hi> in things <hi>indifferent,</hi> must make
good these two Propositions.</p>
                  <p>1. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> has set up <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> above
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church; For in all things
wherein the Church hath not <hi>interposed</hi> her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to <hi>determine</hi> our Practice, we have the use of
our <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> as <hi>much</hi> and as <hi>fully</hi> as we can
desire. But that St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath set up <hi>Christian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:104660:80"/>
above the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church can never be
made good as long as the Epistles to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
to <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus</hi> are <hi>extant</hi> &amp; held <hi>Canonical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. He must prove, That, in the <hi>use</hi> of those <hi>Rites</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which the <hi>Dissenters</hi> impugn, we do
<hi>renounce our Christianity,</hi> &amp; <hi>are faln from Grace,</hi> That
(therein) <hi>wé have fellowship with Devils,</hi> and that
<hi>Christ shall profit us nothing,</hi> but we must <hi>eternally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in our practice:</hi> For <hi>those</hi> things which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
inveighs against, He <hi>forbids</hi> upon <hi>this</hi> account,
as is most evident from all those Texts of Scripture;
wherein he does <hi>professedly</hi> and <hi>peremptorily</hi> handle
this Matter<note n="*" place="margin">Col. 2. 8, 18. Gal. 4. 11. c. 5. 2, 4. 1 Cor. 10. 20, 21. Rom. 14. 15, 20.</note>. But I do challenge the Prudence and
Justice as well as the <hi>Charity</hi> of him who dares say,
if you wear a <hi>Surplice,</hi> if you <hi>sign</hi> with the <hi>Cross,</hi> if
ye <hi>kneel</hi> at the Sacrament, ye <hi>renounce</hi> your <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and are <hi>faln</hi> from Grace; ye have <hi>fellowship</hi>
with Devils, and Christ shall <hi>profit</hi> you nothing, but
ye must <hi>eternally perish</hi> in that Practice.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this <hi>Section,</hi> I must put the <hi>Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Brethren</hi> in mind, That the <hi>charge</hi> or <hi>injunction</hi>
they <hi>insist</hi> upon (Gal. 5. 1.) was not written against
the <hi>Church,</hi> but against a <hi>Superstitious Faction,</hi> which
opposed <hi>Apostolical Authority.</hi> And if they look
upon the <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> as a <hi>yoak of bondage,</hi> then, by a <hi>Parity of Reason,</hi>
They are highly concern'd in the <hi>charge</hi> upon that
account. For they do <hi>oppose</hi> that very <hi>Authority</hi> by
which Christ hath (once) <hi>made them free</hi> from that
<hi>yoak.</hi> Which <hi>Authority</hi> doth still, with the like <hi>Zeal</hi>
and <hi>Courage,</hi> call upon them also, <hi>to stand fast in that
Liberty:</hi> But if they will continue to give the <hi>Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi>
of that Church advantage, by their unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<hi>Separations,</hi> to creep into their <hi>Conventicles,</hi>
and make <hi>Proselytes</hi> with them, (which I can see no
way to be avoided, but by their <hi>Cordial</hi> return to
the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) the <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>
and <hi>burden</hi> must lye at their <hi>doors,</hi> if we be
again <hi>entangled.</hi>

                  <p>But in <hi>Justification,</hi> we find <hi>several</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
concerned: There is something attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to <hi>God:</hi> Something to <hi>Christ,</hi> and
something to <hi>Man</hi> himself.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>God is lookt upon as the</hi> Author <hi>and</hi>
Efficient, <hi>for</hi> who can forgive sins but
God only? I have blotted out, as a
thick Cloud, thy transgressions, Isai. 44.
22. <hi>and</hi> Rom. 8. 33. Who shall lay any thing
to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that
jnstifieth.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>There is something attributed to</hi> Christ.
<hi>We are to look upon him,</hi> as the Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cause <hi>and</hi> Procurer <hi>of it. He is said
therefore</hi> to have loved us <hi>&amp;</hi> to have wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us from our sins in his own Blood.
(Apoc. 1. 5.) <hi>for</hi> by him we have received the
Atonement, (Rom. 5. 11.) <hi>and</hi> for his sake
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104660:83"/>
God hath forgiven us. (Ephesians 4.
ult.)</p>
                  <p>3. There is something attributed unto
<hi>Man:</hi> He is the <hi>subject</hi> of this great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and some <hi>qualification</hi> is required in
him towards his own justification. <hi>Christ
is set forth to be a Propitiation,</hi> (but it is)
<hi>through faith in his Blood:</hi> tho we are said
also to be <hi>justified freely by God's grace.</hi> See
<hi>Rom. 3. 24, 25.</hi> And <hi>with the heart man
believeth unto righteousness (Rom. 10. 10.)
and to the saving of his Soul. (Heb. 10.
ult.</hi>) 'Tis out of controversy, on all sides,
that <hi>Believers</hi> are justified <hi>freely</hi> through
God's mercy, and that Believers are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<hi>for the Merits of Jesus Christ.</hi> All
the matter of Question amongst sober men
is this, <hi>Whether in our justification, Faith
be our own Act, whether considered as our
Act,</hi> and <hi>as a lively Act, and fruitful of
good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As we own no other <hi>Author</hi> of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
but God, no other <hi>Merits</hi> but
Christ, so likewise do we acknowledge no
other <hi>Condition</hi> but <hi>Faith.</hi> But that is not
a <hi>dead</hi> Faith, for St. <hi>James</hi> tells us flatly,
that's <hi>unprofitable. (Jam. 2.</hi>) This Faith
must be an <hi>Evangelical Faith,</hi> which
though the Holy Ghost, maks a <hi>Change;</hi>
not only in our <hi>Relations,</hi> but in our <hi>Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
in our Hearts and Practice. (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.
9.) He that pretends to remission of sin
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104660:84"/>
                     <hi>before</hi> repentance, may with as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
pretend to a <hi>Pardon</hi> (as some do) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is <hi>guilty.</hi> We must not confound
the <hi>Condition</hi> with the <hi>Cause</hi> either <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>
or <hi>Meritorious.</hi> The <hi>presence</hi> of some
disposition may be requisite as a <hi>qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in the person to be justified, and yet
have no <hi>efficiency</hi> into his justification. I
think it is agreed among all Men <hi>learned</hi>
and <hi>sober</hi> minded, That 'tis a <hi>lively</hi> Faith,
which is the <hi>Condition</hi> of our Justification.
And if we be agreed in <hi>this,</hi> to wrangle
about Notions, <hi>Quae &amp; Quâ,</hi> is not of so
great importance as to study <hi>to be quiet,</hi>
and to follow the things which make for
peace, and the things whereby we may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify
one another.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true St. <hi>Paul</hi> (in the matter of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication)
does exclude <hi>the works of the
Law. (Rom. 3. 28.</hi>) But there are <hi>works
of Faith. (1 Thes. 1. 3.</hi>) Are <hi>they</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
too? <hi>By what Law?</hi> The Apostle
prays, That the <hi>work of Faith may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.
2 Thes. 1. 11.</hi> To say we, are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the <hi>efficiency</hi> of <hi>these</hi> works of Faith,
That's against God's <hi>Prerogative:</hi> To say
we are justified by the <hi>merit</hi> of them, that
is against Christ's <hi>Mediation:</hi> But will
you deny the <hi>Presence</hi> and <hi>Concomitancy</hi>
of them, to <hi>attend,</hi> to <hi>evidence</hi> and to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test</hi>
our justification? If it be Faith <hi>only,</hi>
yet it is not Faith <hi>alone;</hi> of all qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104660:84"/>
(which the Gospel requires) <hi>Faith</hi>
must have the respect of <hi>Soveraign;</hi> but it
stands not with her Enemies to be <hi>solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith therefore may be considered in a
<hi>double</hi> Capacity. (1.) <hi>Receptivè,</hi> as she
has the Office of a <hi>Receiver.</hi> (2.) <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditivè,</hi>

<hi>Capacity,</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> in Christ is the most

<hi>Hope,</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> or of any other <hi>Virtue.</hi>
The People ask (<hi>John. 6. 28.) What shall
we do, that we might work the work of
God?</hi> Our blessed Saviour Answers: <hi>This
is the work of God,</hi> (the work <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
by God (<hi>1 John 3. 23.</hi>) but to be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>
by you) <hi>That ye believe on him
whom he hath sent.</hi> 'Tis Mans Duty at
God's Command, and by his Assistance.</p>
                  <p>2. Take Faith <hi>Redditivè</hi> in the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of a <hi>Dispenser</hi> so it is much more a

St. <hi>James</hi> gives us a double instance or
example of Justification by works, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>Rahab;</hi> and concludes with a kind
of demonstration, thereupon, <hi>ye see then
how that by works a man is justified, and
not by Faith only. (Jam. 2. 21.</hi> to the end.)
We must not therefore deny the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>every</hi> sense; For it is more modest to
throw that <hi>Epistle</hi> quite out of the <hi>Canon</hi>
as <hi>Luther</hi> did, then to question the truth of
this Doctrine in it. But does not St. <hi>Paul</hi>
contradict St. <hi>James?</hi> No, in no wise.
For <hi>in Christ Jesus</hi> (he tells us) <hi>neither
Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision,</hi>
(and these two divided the
whole World) <hi>but Faith which worketh
by love,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">St. <hi>Paul</hi> does there discourse expresly of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. see Gal. 5. 4, 5. 6. Ad Rom. 10. 10. p. 453.</note> (<hi>Gal. 5. 6.</hi>) if nothing but Faith,

                  <p>But there are very Learned men, who

of) these <hi>Dissenters;</hi> who overthrowing
the <hi>remission of sins,</hi> do utterly <hi>demolish</hi>
(as our Author words it) the <hi>Article of
Justification,</hi> as well by <hi>Faith as by Works,</hi>
and the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>New obedience.</hi> For
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104660:86"/>
if the <hi>satisfaction</hi> and <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
were suffered and made <hi>in our stead,</hi> and

all our sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and free us from <hi>all guilt</hi>
as well of <hi>Omission</hi> as of <hi>Commission.</hi> And
upon this account being made, not only <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
(as free from all <hi>Commissions</hi>) but
also <hi>actually just,</hi> (as <hi>omitting</hi> no part of
our bounden duty) we have no <hi>need</hi> of
<hi>Pardon</hi> or <hi>Remission;</hi> because here remains
no sin to be remitted. And then we have
Christ's <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Merits</hi> for a <hi>surplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,</hi>
and consequently have no need of
<hi>Repentance</hi> or <hi>New obedience;</hi> but a fair
title to eternal life, upon Christ's account
without them. So that this <hi>Authors</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
turns clearly upon themselves. For
they who take away the <hi>necessity</hi> of remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

But these <hi>Dissenters</hi> (or a <hi>Sect</hi>

Here Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>shall vouch for me, and
I will instance in the great</hi> Article <hi>of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.
He charges (not a small par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
with</hi> misunderstanding of the nature
and use of Christ's Death and Obedience,<note place="margin">Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dr. <hi>Lewis Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Epistle Dedicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note>
(<hi>as he says</hi>) <q>thinking that <hi>Christ obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or satisfied by suffering, or both, as in
our persons, so that the Law takes it to
all ends and uses, as done by us our selves
as when a man payeth his debt by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate:</hi>
This opinion (<hi>saith he</hi>) if I
understand it, blots out Law and Gospel
at one dash. <hi>And he adds a little after,
That</hi> from that Doctrine <hi>this</hi> opinion <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
That,</hi> we are justified before we
believe, nay before we sin, nay before we
are born, nay that it is an immanent Act
in God, (and therefore eternal) and
that Infidels are justified as Infidels. <hi>And
a little after he says,</hi> The beginning of
these mens misery is usually pride of their
supposed graces, <hi>This leads them first to
a seperation from</hi> their Brethren, <hi>and</hi>
contempt of their Guides <hi>next to</hi> Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistry,
<hi>and at last they turn</hi> Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

to Mr.</hi> Baxter,<note place="margin">This was printed 1654.</note>

[When men will so horribly abuse thSe on of
God, as to make him a friend to sin, who

Lawless and Licentious life, which was
shed to demonstrate God's hatred of sin, and
to purge the Souls of men from its power

he concludes</hi>) if God bears no longer, but
do appear against them, from Heaven, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
them, and deliver them up to
Satan the Spirit of Delusion. <hi>It appears
by the</hi> Confutation <hi>of that</hi> Physician, <hi>that
Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>thought, Dr.</hi> Lewis Moulin,
<hi>had taken too strong a</hi> Dose <hi>of that perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
Doctrine.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>And he tells us further,
that my Lord</hi> Brooks <hi>made this the</hi> Basis
<hi>of all their Vanity, Pride and Insolence.</hi>
They have the Spirit, and so know more
than all the Learned, Pious, Godly men in
the World. They have the Spirit they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sin, they cannot err.—Adultery
is but an Act of the Flesh, but they are all
Spirit and no Flesh.—In this case,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104660:90"/>
if they be Traitors heady, highminded, &amp;c.
Who will wonder? What may they not be
carried up to by the imagination of the
Spirit? <hi>That Lord (as Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>cites
him) goes on with their</hi> Character <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes:</hi>
How can these (<hi>things</hi>) be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Arminians, Socinians, <hi>or our</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates?</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Dissenters</hi> should resolve the

<hi>Appeal</hi> to the word, to the word let them
go: That word tells us of <hi>Prelates,</hi> and
refers us to their <hi>Authority,</hi> and sets forth
their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> for our <hi>Pattern.

the Church can prove her Power from

                  <head>The Answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </head>
                  <p>1. That <hi>Power,</hi> which the Church had
from the <hi>Apostles</hi> she had from <hi>Christ;</hi> for
the Apostles (as was proved above) had
the <hi>mind</hi> of Christ; if they did not deliver
what they had <hi>received,</hi> they were <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful;</hi>
And if they were unfaithful in
<hi>this,</hi> they might be unfaithful in <hi>all the
rest;</hi> and so our whole <hi>Christianity</hi> will be
call'd in question.</p>
                  <p>2. The Church hath not only made her
<hi>Claim</hi> to a <hi>Power,</hi> but has bin in <hi>actual</hi>
Possession of it for more than 1600. years
without interruption. That <hi>Plea</hi> is enough,
for her to keep possession; and many <hi>Rules</hi>
of Law will Justify her in it, (1.) <hi>Melior
est conditio possidentis,</hi> He that is in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
has the best Title, <hi>and</hi> (2.) <hi>Cum Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium

Jura sunt obscura, favendum est Reo:</hi>
When the Rights of the Parties Litigant

are to favour the <hi>Defendant;</hi> that is; the
<hi>Party,</hi> whom the <hi>Actor</hi> or <hi>Accuser</hi> desires
and labours to thrust out of Possession, or
lay a <hi>Guilt</hi> upon. And the Law says fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>in dubio favendum est Superiori impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranti;</hi>
in <hi>doubtful Cases</hi> we are to favour
the Commands of our <hi>Superiors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Church is not <hi>Bonae Fidei Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor,</hi>
and comes not <hi>honestly</hi> by her <hi>Title</hi>
and <hi>Possession</hi> of this Power, cannot by the
<hi>Rules</hi> of Law or Equity be determined by
the <hi>Melius Inquirendum</hi> of an <hi>Adversary.</hi>
The <hi>Actor, Aggressor</hi> or <hi>Plaintiff</hi> must
bring his <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Ejectment</hi> to try the
Title; and (if these <hi>Dissenters</hi> have not
yet been sufficiently <hi>bafled</hi> in this <hi>attempt</hi>)
let them at last offer us <hi>substantial</hi> Proofs
to this effect, and I dare promise them (we
shall not follow the example of this <hi>Author</hi>)
we will not be <hi>scurrilous,</hi> not <hi>droll</hi> or <hi>quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
upon him, about a <hi>substantial</hi> proof of
<hi>circumstantial</hi> matters.</p>
                  <p>3. This <hi>Power</hi> is not pretended to be
such a <hi>plenitude</hi> of Power as <hi>they</hi> claim in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not a Power to all
<hi>intents</hi> and <hi>purposes:</hi> No, not a Power to
make any <hi>new Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
any <hi>new Sacraments,</hi> or <hi>parts</hi> of
<hi>Divine Worship:</hi> But only to make <hi>Orders</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:104660:91"/>
touching <hi>Circumstances, Rites</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
in the publick <hi>performance</hi> of <hi>God's
service,</hi> and the <hi>Administration</hi> of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi>
amongst the Members of the
Church.</p>
                  <p>To me it is incredible that Almighty
God should appoint an <hi>Order</hi> of men to be
the <hi>Guides</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> of Souls and the <hi>Stewards of
his Divine Mysteries,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> to
bring them to Eternal bliss; and yet not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
them with <hi>sufficient Power</hi> for the
<hi>due</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> Administration of that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
'Tis the great charge laid upon Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<hi>to feed the flock of Christ, (Act. 20.
28.</hi>) And, in <hi>Scripture-sense,</hi> this is to be
done not only, by <hi>Preaching</hi> the Gospel,
but also by <hi>wholsome Laws and Discipline.</hi>
Some <hi>means</hi> they must have to accomplish
this <hi>end,</hi> which can be no other then a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative</hi>
Power. And this is evident from
<hi>Matt. 16. 19. What ever ye bind on Earth,
&amp;c.</hi> Which is understood not only of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,</hi>
but of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
<hi>Censures.</hi>

                        <hi>Vide</hi> Mat. 18. 17.</note> And in those words of
the <hi>Synod, Act. 15. 28. It seemed good to the
Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no other
burden than these necessary things.</hi> Hence
it is manifest that the Apostles imposed a
<hi>Law</hi> upon <hi>Believers,</hi> which they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to observe; else, they would never
have called <hi>those</hi> things <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
And why did our blessed Lord esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104660:92"/>
                     <hi>Superiority</hi> and <hi>Subordination</hi> in his
Church, some Persons to <hi>Govern,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to <hi>Obey;</hi> but to keep <hi>good Order</hi> and
prevent <hi>Confusion;</hi> and this is no less need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in <hi>ours,</hi> then it was in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times;
This <hi>Power</hi> therefore is to be continued
in the Church to the Worlds end. <hi>Matthew

                  </p>
                  <p>For a full and clear <hi>Demonstration</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
These several particulars have been
proved in some other Papers.</p>
                  <p>1. That Christ and his Apostles intended

<hi>in Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That the Apostles at their first preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

did <hi>afterwards</hi> require.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Apostles expected such a
<hi>settlement</hi> should be made, by such as were
<hi>entrusted</hi> with the Government of the
Church.</p>
                  <p>4. That they gave certain <hi>general Rules</hi>
or <hi>Canons</hi> to direct the Governours of the
Church in making such establishmenrs.</p>
                  <p>5. That they left it to the <hi>Judgment and
prudence</hi> of Church-Governours to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the <hi>particulars</hi> to be established in
such cases.</p>
                  <p>Now let us lay these Principles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

1. That the <hi>solemn Worship</hi> and <hi>Service</hi>
of God cannot be performed without <hi>some</hi>
Rites and Ceremonies,<note n="*" place="margin">Without some Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies it is not possible to keep any Order, or quiet Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in the Church.

                  </p>
                  <p>2. That <hi>these</hi> Rites and Ceremonies are
to be observed according to the Rules of
<hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 3. That <hi>these</hi> Rules are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
and determined by such as are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested</hi>
with Authority to that effect;
From hence it will follow unavoidably, that
all <hi>Subjects</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of the Church
are obliged to <hi>obey</hi> such <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishments.</hi>
For <hi>'tis</hi> most certain, where

are injoyned to obey; else the <hi>Power</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Superiors</hi> were <hi>Nugatory,</hi> and given
to no effect.</p>
                  <p>Whereas they mention <hi>[New Terms of

my self is somewhat <hi>scandalous:</hi> I am no
lover of <hi>Innovations</hi> in <hi>Religion;</hi> tho the
<hi>Addition</hi> of <hi>Collects</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer,
upon <hi>emergent</hi> occasions is both frequent
and very usefull; and <hi>alterations</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
too, when the change is of <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
and does not argue <hi>Levity,</hi> or give
<hi>scandal.</hi> As to <hi>[Terms of Communion,]</hi>
the expression may be <hi>equivocal.</hi> For my
part I would have nothing establisht in the
Church of God, but what has, at least,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104660:93"/>
                     <hi>general Rules</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> in Holy

it. And this has been very carefully
observed in all the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
establisht in this Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For any man to imagine, that <hi>these</hi>
things make a <hi>new worship,</hi> is a very great
mistake. Any thing added to <hi>Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi>

that they teach, <hi>Vnamquamque Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam

of any Conference or Synods, in reference
to its own Government and Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

                     <q>That is, this <hi>Sect</hi> is pernicious both to
Church and Common-wealth; it opens
a gap to all absurd and mad inventions
whatsoever; it takes away all the ways

should be given to that opinion, there
would be as many Religions, as there are

we see that the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> do
not agree with the <hi>Independents</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
about the <hi>Terms of Communion.</hi> But
in truth if the business be sifted to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

the <hi>Power</hi> it self; (For these <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>

which they propose:) but, really, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, What <hi>hands</hi> shall menage this
Power. The <hi>Laws</hi> of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> have placed
the Power in <hi>few</hi> hands, to make the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

Wo be to them by whom this <hi>scandal</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!
I pray, from <hi>whence</hi> come these
<hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Fightings</hi> amongst us? The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
silenced them, and setled <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
to establish Peace. Some men are
of <hi>restless</hi> Spirits and can never study to be

menaged by <hi>Pen</hi> or otherwise, have
been commenced and carried on (against
this Church of <hi>England</hi>) by the <hi>Jesuits</hi>
and <hi>Dissenters.</hi> And upon what account
this is done (as to our <hi>Dissenting Brethren</hi>)
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has told us long ago in these
words,<note place="margin">In his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Preface to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of Dr. <hi>L. Moulin.</hi>

'tis fit therefore, we should take some pains
to learn the <hi>safest</hi> way. But <hi>self-conceit</hi>
and the <hi>private Spirit</hi> are the worst Guides
in the World. He that is <hi>wise in his own
eyes</hi> is very apt to put <hi>darkness for light,</hi>
and <hi>light for darkness (Isai. 5. 20.</hi>) The
Holy Ghost has observ'd this to our hands,
and adviseth us therefore <hi>not to lean to our
own understanding:</hi> For (as that devout
man said) <hi>He that is his own Scholar has
a Fool to his Master.</hi> The neerer the

                  <p>The Worship of God is <hi>twofold.</hi> 1. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Internam sinio, quam Mens &amp; affectus habent: externam, quae ab il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis for as octenditur actu aliquo externo. Jos. Mede de Sanct. Relat. in <hi>Levit. 19. 30. Op p. 401.</hi>
                     </note> which consists of the <hi>internal</hi>
actions of a pious Soul, for example, the
act of <hi>Faith,</hi> is to <hi>believe,</hi> the act of hope,
is to <hi>hope,</hi> the act of Charity, <hi>to love God
and our Neighbour,</hi> with other <hi>internal</hi>
exercises of Piety. 2. There is an <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
worship of God, and that consists in
the <hi>external exercises</hi> of <hi>Piety;</hi> and these
are of <hi>two</hi> sorts. Some are of themselves
<hi>good,</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to God, and <hi>necessary</hi> to
Salvation: Such are <hi>Confession</hi> of our Lord
and Saviour, (the <hi>external</hi> works of
Faith,) <hi>Beneficence,</hi> or doing good to our
Neighbour, (the <hi>external</hi> work of Charity)
<hi>These</hi> are such <hi>effects</hi> of Piety that Piety
it self cannot be without them; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they are more properly called works
of <hi>Piety,</hi> and no less pleasing to God than
the <hi>internal</hi> works themselves.</p>
                  <p>There are other <hi>external</hi> exercises of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
which are conversant in, external
<hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of God's <hi>institution,</hi>
and opposed to the <hi>inventions,</hi> Exercises
and Offices of mans devising: Such are <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi>
and <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> which are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104660:100"/>
not for their <hi>own</hi> sakes, but to be
<hi>inservient</hi> to internal Piety, to bring that
to <hi>light</hi> and <hi>protest</hi> it, to <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it,</hi> to God's glory, the good of our
Neighbour and the salvation of our own
Souls. <hi>Piety is the Soul of all our worship;</hi>
without which the Observation of these
<hi>external</hi> Rites and Ceremonies are but as a
<hi>dead</hi> Carcass<note n="†" place="margin">Isai. 1. 11. to the 16.</note> which God will reject as a
thing of an ill <hi>savour.</hi> In this worship of
God 'tis doubtless the Duty of the Church
to give <hi>direction,</hi> and call upon us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it: But this worship is of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and <hi>imposition,</hi> not the Churches.
If the Rites and Ceremonies <hi>imposed</hi> by
this Church be <hi>part</hi> of <hi>worship:</hi> How
came they to be so? It must be either by
<hi>Divine Institution,</hi> (which we are so far
from <hi>pretending</hi> to, that we do stedfastly
deny it,) or else, by <hi>humane estimation:</hi> If
we did <hi>value</hi> them at so high a rate, this
must appear. 1. Either by the <hi>necessity</hi> we
lav upon them. Or, 2. By the <hi>Merit</hi> and
<hi>Efficacy</hi> we ascribe to them. Or, 3. By
the <hi>preference</hi> we give them.</p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises</hi> indeed
set such a <hi>value</hi> upon their <hi>Traditions,</hi>
(which had no competent Authority to
establish them, but were wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to Divine Authority) that they
prefer'd them so far before God's Law, as
to have force enough to rescinde it, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104660:100"/>
make it of none effect. (<hi>Matt. 15. 6.</hi>) But
for <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> establisht among
us, the Church has declar'd, that (upon,
just causes) <hi>they may be altered and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and therefore are not to be esteemed
equal with God's Law.</hi> *</p>
                  <p>2. That we should place any <hi>Merit</hi> in
the use of them cannot well be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">Preface of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies before the Book of Com. Prayer.</note>
when we allow no such to the very
<hi>best</hi> works we can perform at God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
And when Authority has <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd</hi>
or <hi>restrain'd</hi> the <hi>use</hi> of them, so
that (upon such a supposition) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>necessary,</hi> according to such <hi>restraint</hi>
or <hi>injunction:</hi> Yet they remain indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
still in their own <hi>nature:</hi> and do not
<hi>immediately</hi> bind mens Consciences, as if
they were <hi>immediate</hi> parts of God's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or of <hi>absolute</hi> necessity to salvation,
for which the Church has tyed our Faith
strictly to the <hi>holy writ;</hi> and to nothing
else. Artic. 20. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>They say, <hi>none can Create parts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
but God, nor will God accept of any,
but of such as are of his own Creating:</hi>
Here we have two things, which call for
our consideration. 1. The <hi>Creation</hi> of
worship. And 2. The <hi>acceptableness,</hi> of
such performances as have not that <hi>stamp</hi>
of God's Creation on them.</p>
                  <p>1. By <hi>Creation</hi> of worship (or the <hi>parts</hi>
of it) we suppose he means the <hi>erection</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:104660:101"/>
and <hi>dictating</hi> of it; which may be done
either by <hi>natural suggestion,</hi> or by <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and positive institution.</hi> And then
we must distinguish betwixt <hi>erection</hi> (as
I may call it) and <hi>direction; betwixt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
suggestion</hi> (by which we understand the
dictate or <hi>impression</hi> of the Law of <hi>nature</hi>)
and <hi>occasional Application:</hi> betwixt <hi>general
institution</hi>) and <hi>particular determination.</hi>
The <hi>erection,</hi> (whether by <hi>natural sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>
or <hi>general institution,</hi>) may be from
the <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of God; and yet the
<hi>direction</hi> as to <hi>occasional Application</hi> and
<hi>particular determination,</hi> may be referr'd
to the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Church.
this will appear in some <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Rites</hi> of
<hi>external</hi> Worship. <hi>Nonnullas (Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias)
diotat ipsa natura;</hi> Nature her self
does dictate some sort of Ceremonies, for
example, to <hi>kneel</hi> down when we pray,
to <hi>smite</hi> the breast, to <hi>lift up</hi> the eyes and
hands to Heaven; which are therefore
<hi>common</hi> to the Heathen with all Sects, saith

                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:104660:101"/>

<hi>occasional</hi> Application of them to God's
service is left to the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of

of Christ, is a <hi>Rite,</hi> or an <hi>Act</hi> of God's
<hi>external</hi> worship; (for there was never
any <hi>Nation</hi> that did believe a God, but
would also declare that he was to be <hi>own'd</hi>
and acknowledged.) But whether this
<hi>confession</hi> and acknowledgment should be
made <hi>viva voce,</hi> by word of mouth, or
by <hi>subscription,</hi> or by some <hi>Symbolical

it. Thus much touching the <hi>Creating</hi> of
worship (as our Author calls it) with such

2. The <hi>Acceptableness</hi> thereof follows:
Some things are <hi>acceptable</hi> to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they
are <hi>suggested</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which
is <hi>from</hi> God; and therefore cannot but be
very <hi>pleasing</hi> to him: Some things are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
as they are <hi>inservient</hi> to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of <hi>internal</hi> Piety; and so <hi>Alms</hi> and
<hi>Beneficence</hi> are <hi>well pleasing</hi> to him. (<hi>Heb.
13. 16.</hi>) And some things he is pleased
with, because they are <hi>inservient</hi> to the
<hi>solemnity</hi> of publick worship and <hi>Ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
to it: Such was the holy <hi>Temple</hi> with the
<hi>musical</hi> Instruments, and all the <hi>magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi>
of it; <hi>The Lord loveth the Gates of
Sion, Psal. 87. 2.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Adiaphorae actionis possunt Deo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi>

<q>from the worship of God properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</q>
God may therefore <hi>accept</hi> what he
does not particularly, or directly <hi>injoyn.</hi>
In the <hi>free-will Offerings</hi> under the Law,

which nevertheless was <hi>acceptable</hi> to him.
And what shall we say of <hi>David</hi>'s purpose
to <hi>build</hi> the Temple (which resolution he

others) <hi>Jure Prophètico;</hi>

their intendments, as <hi>David</hi> was in that

There were many of this kind saith

Church, beget <hi>disputes,</hi> and, as it often
happens, of disputes and <hi>Schismes.</hi> So
that <hi>these</hi> Rites are like the <hi>Leades</hi> in a

                     <hi>saith, that</hi> Christ commanded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing

Or 3. The <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> may
take their <hi>rise</hi> from the <hi>Devotion</hi> of Pious
Persons; as the Practice of the <hi>Publican</hi>

13.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. As they have not the same <hi>Author,</hi>
so they have not the same <hi>End:</hi> The end
of <hi>Divine</hi> institutions is <hi>internal Grace</hi> and
<hi>Sanctification:</hi> This is said to be the end
of Christ's <hi>Dispensation</hi> to his Church.
<hi>That he might Sanctify and cleanse it with
the washing of Water, by the word. Eph.
5. 26.</hi> But the end of these <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
Rites &amp; Ceremonies is not to confer Grace,
but <hi>to preserve good Order and Decorum,
to procure reverence, and</hi> (as <hi>objects</hi> fit
for that purpose) <hi>to help Devotion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. They have not the same <hi>necessity;</hi>
For as touching <hi>Divine</hi> things, an <hi>absolute
necessity</hi> is laid upon us to observe them;
and it may be a <hi>double</hi> necessity, <hi>Praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
&amp; Medii,</hi> not only because they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>command,</hi> but also because they may
be <hi>means</hi> without which salvation is not to
be had: But for <hi>Ecclesiastical Rites,</hi> the
necessity is not <hi>absolute;</hi> they may be
<hi>changed,</hi> they may be abolished, and we
may be saved without them; and that they
do not stand upon equal ground, the
Church professeth in her Articles; and this
is clear upon an other account.</p>

For, Lastly, There is a great difference in
their <hi>Obligation. Divine</hi> Commands
and Institutions do <hi>bind</hi> the Conscience, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi>
and <hi>of themselves,</hi> under <hi>peril</hi>
of Eternal Death: <hi>Ecclesiastical Rites</hi> doe
not so: And where there is no <hi>breach of
Charity,</hi> and that is, where there is no
<hi>contempt</hi> of Authority, or <hi>Scandal</hi> to our
Neighbour, the <hi>Omission</hi> does not wound
the Conscience, nor incur the guilt of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sin, as the Reverend and Learned <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>

                  <p>But to <hi>mollify</hi> the Objection and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
they say (at last,) if these Rites

Divine,</hi> yet, <hi>at least, they stand
as high as man can lift them.</hi> But by their

too: for they stand not so <hi>high,</hi> as
they are set up in the Church of <hi>Rome.
Aquam sale conspersam populis benedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,

the People, that all who are sprinkled
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:104660:107"/>

They attribute <hi>Spiritual effects</hi> to their
Ceremonies: not only a power to <hi>cure</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
to <hi>expel</hi> and <hi>drive away</hi> the Devil:
but to procure <hi>Grace,</hi> to remit <hi>venial</hi> sins,
to <hi>Sanctify</hi> their Persons. And they use
<hi>Spiritual</hi> Acts of <hi>Consecration</hi> and solemn
<hi>Benedictions</hi> to <hi>Hallow</hi> them to these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
Do the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> stand thus <hi>high?</hi> For
shame, in cool blood, they will not say it.
I suppose therefore, the meaning is only
this, That they stand as <hi>high</hi> as of <hi>due
right</hi> and <hi>lawfully</hi> we can lift them. If
this be their meaning, (tho there may be
a malitious insinuation, that we do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then we ought, yet) really, to
do what, <hi>of due right</hi> and <hi>lawfully,</hi> we
may do, is no sin in us: but 'tis sin in them
to break <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>seperate</hi> from us
upon that account. Here we may observe
the <hi>method</hi> and <hi>progress</hi> of <hi>Discord;</hi> First,
they <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>pretend</hi> a fault: then
they take the confidence <hi>Calumniari forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
to make the Calumny as <hi>black</hi> as may
be, and to <hi>stick</hi> it upon us with as great an
<hi>Odium</hi> as they can; and when they have
shewn their spite, they <hi>mince</hi> the matter;
they were <hi>mistaken</hi> in their exaggeration;
we have done nothing but our <hi>Duty,</hi> or at
least what is <hi>warrantable,</hi> in exalting
God's <hi>solemn</hi> worship and service, by <hi>lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:104660:108"/>
up</hi> the <hi>Appendages</hi> thereof to their <hi>due</hi>
and <hi>decent</hi> station.</p>
                  <p>For other <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches do lift up
their <hi>establisht Rites</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> as
<hi>high</hi> as we; and this is evident from the
<hi>severity</hi> they design and inflict upon such
as are <hi>refractory</hi> to the use and practice of
them. When such <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> about
them,<note place="margin">See above out of the <hi>Calvinists</hi> Book of Discipline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 5. de. Consisto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riis Act. 31.</note> are established, the Church does
not account the Observation of them so
<hi>mean</hi> and <hi>vile,</hi> as to be violated through
<hi>contempt</hi> and with the <hi>scandal</hi> of others:
but such <hi>transgressors</hi> she looks upon as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent</hi>
and <hi>disorderly</hi> walkers, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
her Authority, to <hi>note,</hi> to <hi>admonish,</hi>
to <hi>reprove</hi> and <hi>rebuke</hi> them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
by all wholsom means to reduce

of the Church (when it may be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of great <hi>Learning</hi> and an <hi>acute</hi> Judgment.
And does not Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> say the same? I

For, when matters are left at random, <hi>Quot

is not so destructive as that of <hi>Judgments.</hi>

will not have his Devotion up and drest till
at least <hi>Eleven.</hi> One again will be for the
<hi>Barn,</hi> another for the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> And
although this <hi>Gentleman</hi> tells us of a
Church that will and must certainly <hi>agree</hi>
about such things, though all determine to
the contrary (as was observed above) yet I
have not been so happy as to converse in

2. <hi>Natural Circumstances</hi> are not Rites

upon that account: but as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of improvement in a <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi>

according to <hi>Order,</hi> and to <hi>Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi>

several portions of it, to be the <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>

he saith, <hi>Levit. 19. 30.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">V. <hi>Jos. Medes</hi> Concio ad Cler. in Levit. 19. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye shall keep my
Sabbaths and reverence my Sanctuary, I
am the Lord.</hi> And here I must repeat,
That <hi>Order</hi> requires the <hi>same</hi> time, the
<hi>same</hi> place, the <hi>same</hi> gesture; and <hi>Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
requires, that the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Vsages</hi> (in
God's worship) be <hi>honest, grave, solemn,</hi>
suitable to the <hi>Majesty</hi> we adore, and the
<hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> worship; which we pay
to him.</p>
                  <p>3. We say <hi>New Rites</hi> do not make a
<hi>New Duty,</hi> not <hi>alter</hi> God's Law, or <hi>change</hi>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:104660:110"/>
his Worship, as was noted out of <hi>Zanchy.</hi>
'Tis the same Duty still, whether perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at 9. or the <hi>12th.</hi> hour in a Church or
Chappel, Cathedral or a Parish Church, in a
Cloak or Cassok, Gown or Surplice, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Kneeling. And because<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Author
is so good at illustrations, I will make bold,
for once, to borrow a familiar instance from
him;<note place="margin">P. 280.</note> Suppose a Law promulgated by the
Legislator: <q>
                        <hi>That every Subject shall
sweep his door once a week with a Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som:</hi>
Now to sweep my Door with a
Beesom of <hi>Birch</hi> or <hi>Broom,</hi> cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be any <hi>Addition</hi> to that Law (or,
say I, the setting up of a <hi>New Duty</hi>)
because 'tis <hi>necessarily required</hi> to the
putting of the Law in practice, that I do
it with the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are both comprehended <hi>virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
in the Law by way of <hi>disjunction,</hi>
that is either with <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> or <hi>some
other.</hi> Again to sweep my Door on the
Third day of the week, and at the ninth
hour of the day, can be no addition to the
Law, because I am commanded to do it,
upon <hi>some day in the week, and at some
hour of the day,</hi> and the Law not having
defined the precise day and hour, supposes
it indifferent to the Lawgiver which I
choose, but one or other I must choose,
unless I will obstinately disobey the Law.</q>
We shall make use of this <hi>illustration</hi> thus:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:104660:110"/>
God makes a Law that we shall give him
<hi>external worship:</hi> Now to worship him
by <hi>Bowing, Kneeling,</hi> or <hi>Prostration,</hi>
cannot possibly be any <hi>addition</hi> to that
Law, because 'tis <hi>necessarily required</hi> to
the putting of the Law in practice, that
I do it with the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are (all three) comprehended
<hi>virtually</hi> in the Law by way of <hi>disjunction,</hi>
that is, either after <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> or the <hi>other</hi>
manner. Again God commands me to
<hi>confess</hi> the Faith of Christ Crucified, and
<hi>profess</hi> my self a Christian: Now to make
this Confession or Profession by <hi>word of
mouth,</hi> or by the <hi>subscription</hi> of my hand,
or by some <hi>Symbolical sign</hi> or <hi>significant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi>
cannot possibly be any addition to
that Law, because 'tis <hi>necessarily required</hi>
to the putting of the Law in practice, that
I do it, either the <hi>one</hi> way or the <hi>other;</hi> and
therefore they are all comprehended <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi>
in the Law by way of <hi>disjunction;</hi>
that is, I must do it either <hi>this</hi> way, or
<hi>that</hi> or <hi>the other.</hi> And the Law not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
defined the <hi>precise</hi> way, supposes it
<hi>indifferent</hi> to the Lawgiver, which I chuse;
but <hi>one</hi> or <hi>other</hi> I must chuse (unless the
<hi>Church</hi> has chosen for me) or else I am
an obstinate Transgressor.</p>
                  <p>4. It is no derogation to the perfection
of Scripture <hi>as a Rule,</hi> that the <hi>Singulars,</hi>
or <hi>Particular</hi> instances of Worship are not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:104660:111"/>
specified in it.<note place="margin">p. 264.</note> 
                     <q>For (as our Author well
observes) 'tis always supposed, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one in his private or more publick
capacity be able to <hi>use</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> the
Rule. As the Square, or Rule of the
<hi>Architect,</hi> however exact in it self, yet
presupposes him to have <hi>eyes</hi> to <hi>see,</hi> and
<hi>Brains</hi> to <hi>apply</hi> it to his work; so the
Scripture <hi>as a Law</hi> teaches Duty, and
whatever of well-pleasing Obedience we
can perform to God, yet supposes us at
least to be <hi>Rational Creatures,</hi> that can
apply <hi>that Law</hi> to our own particular
Actions, whence these two things must
necessarily follow.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <q>That it was not only <hi>needless</hi> but
impossible, that the Scripture should enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate
or determine upon the <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Natural Circumstances,</hi> of <hi>general
Time, Place, Person, When, Where,
Who</hi> should worship God, every day,
hour, minute to the End of the World:
for so the whole World would not have
afforded sufficient stowage for Rubricks,
<hi>nor have been able to contain the Volumns
that must have been written:</hi> for as the
End and use of a Rule is not to teach the
Artificer, <hi>when</hi> he shall begin to work,
but <hi>how</hi> he may do it like a workman,
whenever he begins; so neither was the
Scripture design'd for a <hi>Clock</hi> to tell us at
<hi>what hour</hi> of the day we should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104660:111"/>
the publick Service of God, but
that whenever we begin or end, we man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it <hi>according to this Rule.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <q>That when the Scripture hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
us all <hi>the Parts of worship,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
the <hi>Administrators</hi> of worship,
given Rules how to <hi>seperate them to that
Office,</hi> and laid down general Rules for
the regulating those natural Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which could not particularly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd,
as that they be done <hi>to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
decently,</hi> and <hi>in Order;</hi> And has
withal commanded us to attend to this
Rule, and no other, (<hi>which is true Sano
sensu</hi>) it has then discharged the <hi>Office of
of a Rule,</hi> and, <hi>as a Rule,</hi> is <hi>compleat</hi>
and <hi>perfect.</hi>
                     </q> Thus our Author has <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitectonically</hi>
erected his <hi>Hypothesis:</hi> but
the <hi>singulars</hi> are not yet determined: And
what must be done for them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jus Naturae docet esse Deum, ip sique red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum

tum internum, tum externum,</hi> says our
<hi>Synopsis:</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Dan. 6. 10.</note> The Law of Nature teaches
there is a God, and that we ought to render
him his due, that is, both External and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
worship. And the Learned
<hi>Zanchy</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">De Religione Observ. in Cap. 15. Aphoris. 4. m. p. 237.</note> resolves, <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia

                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Unde alii a Carendo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducunt, q. Ceremonia; non potest enim Religio exerceri illis destituta &amp; Carens. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> That the substance of
the Ceremonial Law is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
<hi>Natural</hi> Religion does
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:104660:112"/>
Dictate something, and where there is <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
and a <hi>parity</hi> of Reason, and a due <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy</hi>
for it, we may take some directions
from the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, as the very Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and Judicious <hi>Sanderson</hi> observes. Our
blessed Saviour reteined many Ceremonies
and Usances of that Carnal Commandment,
as <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> and both the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
And from whence did the Apostle
take the hint, to injoyn the Women to
wear a <hi>Vail,</hi> and <hi>keep silence</hi> in the Church,
but from the Custom among the <hi>Jews?</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> on 1 Cor. 11. 25. &amp; cap. 14. 35.</note>
And how does he establish <hi>Maintenance</hi> for
the <hi>Evangelical Ministry</hi> but upon <hi>this</hi>
bottom. 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 18. 1 Cor. 9. 13, 14.
Sanciens Leges Vet. Test. Conformes,</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
Law conformable to those of the
Old Testament, saith <hi>Theophylact.</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">In 1 Ad Cor. 9. 13, 14.</note> And
perhaps this <hi>Analogy</hi> may be a fair ground
for the strict observation of the <hi>Lord's day,</hi>
of <hi>Fasts</hi> and <hi>Festivals;</hi> provided they do
not typically respect things <hi>to come</hi> (as
those of the Law did,) but reflect upon
what is <hi>past,</hi> and fix us upon <hi>present</hi> Duty.
The Apostle did not always pretend to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration</hi>
in such matters, but used Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Prudence (yet not without a divine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance)
and made <hi>Inferences</hi> out of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals;</hi>
yet strictly observing such <hi>general</hi>
Rules, he concludes, that the <hi>Particulars</hi>
were <hi>the Commandments of God. 1 Cor. 14.

                     <hi>The Learned</hi> Mede<note n="*" place="margin">In Levit. 19. 30. conc. ad Clerum vide.</note> 
                     <hi>observes, That it

of the same kind.</hi> Quaedam &amp; sunt &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur
in Scripturis, (<hi>saith Dr.</hi> Sclater
<hi>out of</hi> Nazianzen) quaedam verò sunt in

Rules are laid down by that learned Dr.
First,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Where <hi>Generals</hi> are delivered, there
are all <hi>Particulars</hi> comprised in those Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
intentionally delivered; because
Generals comprehend their Particulars.</p>
                  <p>2. Where <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Causes</hi> are
delivered, their <hi>effects</hi> are also intended:
as being <hi>virtually</hi> conteined in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p>3. Where one <hi>equal</hi> is taught, all of <hi>like</hi>
reason is taught, <hi>quia Parium Par ratio:</hi>
and where is <hi>Par ratio,</hi> there is <hi>Par lex:</hi>
Where is <hi>like</hi> Reason there is <hi>like</hi> Law. So
take Contents of Scripture (saith he) no
instance of any Point of necessary, or but
convenient Faith and Practice, can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but what is delivered in the written
word. Thus Dr. <hi>Sclater,</hi> on 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 15.
p. 199.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, <hi>The Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is exceeding broad.</hi> And very
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:104660:113"/>
Learned <hi>Protestants</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Conf. Remon. c. 23. §. 8.</note> think all matters of
<hi>Decency</hi> impli'd in that of <hi>Rom. 12. 17.</hi>
and the Apostles expression <hi>Phil. 4. 8.</hi> is of
a very great latitude, <hi>Whatsoever things
are true, whatsoever things are honest,
—if there be any virtue, if there be
any praise:</hi> These with the other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
there enumerated will extend a great
way: And the Learned <hi>A. Rivet</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adver. in Consult. de oper. supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. m. p. 242.</note> makes
good use of that Text against <hi>works of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogation;</hi>
nor is it less valid or useful
against <hi>Will-worship. Omnia quaecunque
homines possunt ex gratia Dei, Deo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentur:</hi>
All that ever men can do by the
Grace of God, is due to God, according to
that exhortation; and consequently they
are (in the General) injoyn'd by God.
At least, (as <hi>Luther</hi> hath observed, from
the Apostle ad <hi>Gal. 5. 13.</hi>) They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law of Charity: <hi>Quaecunque Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonialiter
&amp; humaniter statuuntur—Pro
Charitate servanda sunt propter
eos, cum quibus vivendum est nobis, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec
ipsi easdem servari a nobis exigunt,</hi>

                        <hi>Luther</hi> ad Galat. 5. m. p. 226, 227</note> 
                     <hi>ne
pax Solvatur in Schismata &amp; Seditiones:</hi>
                     <q>What things soever are appointed by
way of Ceremony<note n="‖" place="margin">This I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> and Civility;<note n="⸫" place="margin">This to humane Societiy.</note>
are to be observed out of <hi>Charity,</hi> for
<hi>their</hi> sakes, with whom we live, so long
as they require us to observe them, lest
Peace should break loose into Schismes
and Seditions. And a little after he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:104660:113"/>
that there is no Law, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in Charity. <hi>Nam sine omni
dubio, si tu quicquam statuisses,</hi> &amp;c. For
without all doubt, (saith he) if thou
shouldest injoyn any thing, thou would'st
be obeyed: therefore thou art obliged
by the Law of Nature and Charity to
perform the same to another, especially
to God and his <hi>Vice-gerents:</hi> provided
you do not place Salvation in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of men: but only consider that you
are bound to serve others in Charity.</q>
Hereupon <hi>Calvin</hi> (Argument. in Ep. ad
<hi>Romanos</hi> in fine) observing a sort of men,
who thought their <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> could
not stand without a <hi>disturbance</hi> of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Powers,</hi> he resolves the case thus, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
ne quid videretur imponere Ecclesiae
Paulus praeter Officia Charitatis: hanc
quoque obedientiam sub charitate contineri
indicat:</hi> 
                     <q>Lest St. <hi>Paul</hi> should seem to
impose any thing upon the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Offices of Charity: He declares
(<hi>viz. Rom. 13. 8.</hi>) that this obedience
(to the higher Powers) is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Charity.</q> Those <hi>Impositions</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which these <hi>Dissenters</hi> quarrel at, are
commanded in <hi>General,</hi> and (not being
against any command of God,) if there
were no more in the Case, yet they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a <hi>General Rule,</hi> because done <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Order.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:104660:114"/>
5. It is to be noted, That <hi>external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
is a <hi>Duty</hi> of Religion; and of great
necessity.</p>
                  <p>It is the Observation of the Author of
our <hi>Synopsis,</hi> upon <hi>Josuah 22. 25. Ita est
Mortalium ingenium, ut Adminiculis opus
habeant, quibus mentes erigant in Coelum:</hi>
                     <q>Such is the disposition of Mortal Men;
that they stand in need of helps to raise
their Minds to Heaven. Whereupon it
often comes to pass, <hi>Vt ubi Cultus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus
negligitur,</hi> that where God's out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Worship is neglected,</q> 
                     <hi>Ibi animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
quoque Religio sensim Tabescit &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitur;</hi>
                     <q>there the (internal) Religion
also of the Soul flaggs, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
dwindles away to nothing.</q> 
                     <hi>Rectè
igitur</hi> (as that Author goes on) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they made a very good inference, that
if the <hi>Ritual Worship</hi> were obstructed or
hindred, the <hi>Spiritual Worship,</hi> that I
may so call the <hi>inward Piety</hi> of the Mind
will decay and depart with it. And the
Learned <hi>Grotius</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Mat. 24. 11.</note> hath very well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that to make <hi>external Worship</hi> but a
matter <hi>indifferent,</hi> is the way to make the
<hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Constancy</hi> of Christians to
<hi>languish;</hi> and nothing is more destructive
to Christianity then to bring in <hi>Conciliating
expedients,</hi> to mingle the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with others, whether <hi>approved,</hi> or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>tolerated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:104660:114"/>
6. We must consider, That when there
are many ways of <hi>external</hi> Worship to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
our <hi>inward</hi> Piety, (which cannot all
be performed at once) God has left it to
the Wisdom of his Church (In <hi>Publick</hi>
Administrations) to <hi>determine</hi> which we
should observe. And for the proof of this,
I'le go no further than one of our own <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
Learned and Zealous and very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in his Generation:<note place="margin">B. 2. C. 6. q. 3. p. 67.</note> 'Tis Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>
in his <hi>Cases of Conscience,</hi> concerning the
<hi>Gesture</hi> to be used in <hi>Prayer;</hi> wherein
he lays down these <hi>Three</hi> Rules (he speaks
of <hi>Publick</hi> Prayer.)</p>
                  <p>1. <q>When <hi>Publick</hi> Prayer is made in the
Congregation, our Gesture must always
be comely,</q> modest and decent.</p>
                  <p>2. <q>All Gesture used publickly, must
serve as much as may be, to express the
inward humility of the heart, without
Hypocrisy. Now these kinds are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
(saith he) some concern the whole
Body, as the bowing thereof, the casting
of it down upon the Ground. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
concern the Parts of the Body, as
lifting up of the Head, the Eyes, the
Hands, bowing the Knees, &amp;c. Touching
these the Scripture hath not bound us to
any <hi>particulars.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <q>(Therefore) we must (saith he)
in publick Prayer, content our selves to
follow the laudable fashion, and <hi>Custom</hi> of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:104660:115"/>
that <hi>particular</hi> Church, where we are.
For to decline from <hi>Customs</hi> of particular
Churches, in such Cases, often causeth
<hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Dissentions.</hi>
                     </q> And what he
says, upon the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians</hi> to
the same purpose is worthy to be noted,
and <hi>seasonable</hi> for our Christian Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The use of the Law among the <hi>Jews</hi>
(saith he) was to shut them up into the
Unity of one Faith and Religion. For
this Cause they had but one Temple, one
Mercy-seat, one Highpriest, &amp;c. Hence
it follows (saith that Holy man) that in
a Godly and Christian Common-wealth,
when true Religion is established, there
may be no Tolleration of any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For that, which is the End of <hi>God's</hi>
Laws, must also be the end of all good
Laws, in all Common-wealths and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</q>
namely to shut up the People into

                  <p>
                     <q>The Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> (saith he) is
called <hi>a Fountain Sealed, a Garden en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed,
Cant. 4. 13.) a Vineyard hedged
in (Isai. 5. 5. Psal. 80. 13.</hi>) And here
(<hi>viz. Gal. 3. ver. 23, 24, 25.</hi>) we see
what is the Hedge or Wall of this Garden,
or Vineyard: namely the Regiment or
Policy of <hi>Moses</hi> by a Threefold kind of
Law. This admonisheth us (saith he)
to respect, and with care to observe good
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:104660:115"/>
Laws: because they are as it were Hedges
and Fences of all good Societies: and the
breaking of them is the pulling down of
our Fence:</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> from
which principles of his, good God! How
much are these times degenerated? and
let all the World judge, who honours the
Reformation most, they who professedly
violate, or they who zealously maintain
the Laws and legal establishment of it.</p>
                  <p>7. We may add, That the Church hath
this Power, not only in <hi>Sacred Rites,</hi> and
Acts of <hi>external Worship,</hi> but also, in such
as are <hi>civilly decent;</hi> and such is the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<hi>Vail,</hi> which I look upon not as a
thing properly <hi>Religious or Sacred, but</hi>
only as a <hi>decent Habit,</hi> according to <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
common estimation</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of
<hi>Nature,</hi> especially in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
<note n="*" place="margin">See 1. Pet. 3. 3.</note> whereupon <hi>Bullinger</hi>

his Commentary upon that head thus, <hi>Haec
verò de Habitu Ecclesiae ingredientium
dicta sufficiant:</hi> 
                     <q>This shall suffice to
have spoken touching the Habit of such
as approach the Church of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, now, one of the Apostles Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
(when he is giving <hi>Orders</hi> to establish
<hi>Decency</hi> in publick Assemblies) being in
the matter of <hi>Habit;</hi> methinks this should
be warrant enough (as a <hi>General</hi> Rule)
for the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>Surpliss</hi> by <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
Ministers in the <hi>Publick</hi> Offices and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations</hi>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:104660:116"/>
of the Church. For to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate
<hi>naked</hi> is against <hi>Natural</hi> Decency,
and so dishonest: to Officiate in a <hi>Fools</hi>
Coat (or some <hi>singular</hi> Habit taken for it)
is <hi>ridiculous</hi> and scandalous. And such as
are peculiarly <hi>seperated</hi> to the Service of
the most High God, why should not they
be <hi>distinguisht</hi> by <hi>special</hi> Habits, (in the
publick and solemn Administration of their
Sacred Offices) as well as <hi>Civil Judges,
Mayors,</hi> and other <hi>Publick</hi> Officers?
Does this make any <hi>alteration</hi> in the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of Religious Worship? <hi>Quòd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teres

under the <hi>General</hi> Rule of <hi>Decency,</hi> and
consequently <hi>as such,</hi> under the <hi>command</hi>
of God, according to the Observation of
<hi>Hemmingius (In 1.</hi> ad <hi>Cor. 14. 37.) Sunt

for it. <hi>Adoration in general</hi> (saith
he) <hi>is outward Worship, signifying and
testifying the inward Worship of the heart.
More especially by it we must conceive the
bowing of the Head and Knee; the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and prostrating of the Body; the lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of the Hands, Eyes, and such like.</hi>
And a little after, <hi>Adoration that is due to
God the Creator, must not be social (for
we are not God's Mates and Companions)
but only Religious.</hi> And that this Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Religious Worship is due to God, and
to God only, he proves thus. <hi>The Devil
when he tempted our Saviour, desired no
more of him but the pròstrating of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
But Christ denies it and</hi> Answers,
<hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and</hi>
him only <hi>shalt thou serve. Matt. 4. 10.</hi>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:104660:117"/>
This is a <hi>Part</hi> of God's Worship, but of
whose <hi>Creating?</hi> Not of the Churches,
but of God's; the Church does not <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi>
and <hi>Originally</hi> injoyn it, but rather
exhorts to it, (<hi>Psal. 95. 6.) O come let us
worship and fall down, and Kneel before

be whether the <hi>Appointment</hi> of the use of
it at the <hi>Sacrament</hi> be convenient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kneeling</hi> doubtless is a Gesture, which

is grounded upon the words of our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

<hi>and of this express mention is made</hi>

unto Righteousness: and with the

Non Solum fidem &amp; interiorem affectum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirit
Deus; sed &amp; externam Confessionem
&amp; liberam ejus professionem, saith our <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopsis:</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">In Dan. 6. v. 10.</note> God requires not only Faith and

Colunt: sed quod intus in animo gerunt,

Worship God ought not to be mute: but
by</hi> Words <hi>and</hi> Deeds <hi>to testify their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Piety. Whence it follows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. This Profession may be made by
<hi>Symbolical</hi> signs or <hi>real</hi> tokens. <hi>Caeremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae
ad Dei Cultum, institutae Pars quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
sunt nostrae Confessionis,</hi> saith <hi>Calvin</hi>
(on <hi>Rom. 14. 22.</hi>) This I doubt not will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be granted of such <hi>Rites</hi> as are under
<hi>particular Command</hi> and of <hi>Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi>
as <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi>
But we can produce other Instances for
which there is no such <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to be alledged. What was the true
meaning of that <hi>Altar,</hi> forementioned?
The <hi>building</hi> of it gave offence to the <hi>Ten</hi>
Tribes, as if it had been a <hi>Monument</hi> of
<hi>Superstition</hi> or <hi>Idolatry:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ad Josu. 22. 26.</note> but, as <hi>Calvin</hi>
observes, <hi>Congeriem Lapidum erigere tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaei
Loco, vel in testimonium Miraculi,
vel in memoriam insignis Dei gratiae, nus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
lex prohibuit:</hi> To erect a heap of
Stones as a <hi>Trophy,</hi> in Testimony of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
or in <hi>memory</hi> of some <hi>special favour</hi>
of God, this was <hi>never</hi> forbidden by the
Law: otherwise both <hi>Joshuah,</hi> and many
holy <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> after him, had
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104660:119"/>
defiled themselves with <hi>Profane novelties:</hi>
But those words <hi>[ver. 26, 27.] Let us
build an Altar, that it may be a Witness,
that we may do the service of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him with our Burnt Offerings:</hi> Which
words make it plain, that they intended
that <hi>Pattern</hi> of the Altar, (<hi>Jos. 22. 28.</hi>)
to be a <hi>Recognition</hi> of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> a
<hi>Real Protestation</hi> of their Relation to him,
and of their sincere Devotion to his solemn
Worship. And that the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi>
in the Christian Church was introduced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the like account is affirm'd by our <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopsis</hi>
upon that very <hi>Text:</hi> The words
are these, <hi>Sic Ecclesia nobis ante oculos po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
Crucis Christi figuram:</hi> thus the Church
sets the sign or figure of Christ's Cross be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes, not to invite us to <hi>Worship</hi> it,
but to <hi>put us in mind</hi> of that true and salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Cross, the Passion and Death of Christ,
which wrought our Atonement and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                  <p>But we have a more pregnant instance
than this to our purpose. We read (<hi>Dan.
6. 10.</hi>) when Prayer to Almighty God
was interdicted, <hi>Daniel</hi> went into his
House, and <hi>opening his Windows</hi> towards
<hi>Jerusalem, He Kneeled down and Prayed.</hi>
The <hi>opening</hi> of his Windows was an
open <hi>Protestation</hi> of his Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
For why did he open them? Not
to let in Heaven, or to let out his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104660:120"/>
but to <hi>give light</hi> to his Profession and
Practice. <hi>Hic erat Confessionis casus,</hi> saith
our <hi>Synopsis,</hi> Here was a Case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:
and so saith <hi>Lyserus,</hi> in his <hi>Aulâ
Persicâ,</hi> p. 57, &amp;c. <hi>Fidem suam egregiâ
Confessione testatur,</hi> saith <hi>Oecolampadius</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ad <hi>Dan. 6. 11.</hi>
                     </note>;
He testifies his Faith by an egregious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
He enters into his house, but he
does not shut himself up for fear; for if he
had done so, he would have shut his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows:
but he set them open on purpose,
that such as watcht to betray him, might
have the <hi>clearer prospect</hi> of his Faith and
Piety. <hi>Notandum est,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Ad <hi>Dan. 6. 10.</hi>
                     </note>;
It is to be noted, that 'twas not the <hi>inward</hi>
Worship of God that was here in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the <hi>outward Profession</hi> of it.
When he saw his Faith was put upon the
<hi>trial,</hi> and an experiment to be made of
his Constancy, he would not so much as
dissemble or counterfeit a forgetfulness of
his Religion and Piety.</p>
                  <p>And no doubt the holy Prophet <hi>opened</hi>
his Windows, that by this <hi>help</hi> (saith he)
he might consult his own <hi>Infirmity,</hi> and
stir up himself to a greater <hi>Liveliness</hi> of
Faith and <hi>ardour</hi> of devotion. And from
hence we should learn, saith Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi>
when we are sensible or jealous of our
own <hi>infirmity</hi> or <hi>coldness,</hi> to collect all the
<hi>helps</hi> and advantages we can to <hi>awaken</hi>

This was the Prophets design when
he <hi>opened</hi> his Windows towards <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
Hoc etiam symbolo;</hi> He had also a
mind to let his Family see, by this <hi>Symbol,</hi>
(or <hi>Mystical Ceremony</hi>) the <hi>Constancy</hi> of
his Faith, and his <hi>stedfast hope</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
Redemption. This is the sense and
Judgment of Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where we cannot but observe, that the
Holy Prophet, out of the <hi>fervent</hi> zeal of
an inward Piety, made use of a <hi>Symbolical
sign,</hi> before the Princes of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to
<hi>protest</hi> the truth and sincerity of his Faith
and Worship. And also here was no <hi>special
Command,</hi> or <hi>divine Institution</hi> for the
Practice; yet it gain'd an <hi>approbation</hi> from
Heaven, and such as was attested and <hi>seal'd</hi>
by a Miraculous deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Now, that the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> among
the <hi>Ancients,</hi> was a <hi>Real protestation</hi> of
their Faith, and like <hi>Daniel</hi>'s opening of
his <hi>Windows,</hi> to let <hi>others</hi> see what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
he profest, we have the attestation
of no less man that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>

it. This <hi>twofold</hi> use of the Cross Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>

upon our Foreheads.</p>
                  <p>By these, and a multitude of other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,
which might be produced, 'tis
evident that the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
been lookt upon as a <hi>Real Confession</hi>
of the Faith of Christ crucified, and a
<hi>symbolical Protestation</hi> of it; so that we
may sum up our Discourse in short after this
manner:</p>
                  <p>Confession is an Act of <hi>external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
under a <hi>General</hi> command of Christ,
which does bind <hi>Semper,</hi> though not <hi>Ad
semper;</hi> and consequently the Duty is <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies</hi>
lawful, though not <hi>alwaies</hi> (in
prudence) practicable. (2) That a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Command comprehends all <hi>particular</hi>
Instances. (3) That the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi>
is one Instance of Confession, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the Authority and Practice of
the Church. From which premisses it will
unavoidably follow, that we are under an
obligation to observe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And indeed there is sometimes</hi> a necessity
<hi>for it; for a confession by</hi> word of mouth,
<hi>or by</hi> subscription, <hi>is neither practicable
nor possible, at all</hi> Times, <hi>by all</hi> Persons,
<hi>in all</hi> Places. <hi>Some have their Tongues</hi>
cut out, <hi>some are</hi> mute <hi>and</hi> speechless, <hi>some
are among</hi> Barbarians, <hi>who understand
not their Language. Some other way
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104660:122"/>
therefore is to be pitcht upon; and what
should</hi> that <hi>be, rather then what may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
be concluded from such intimations
of Holy Writ as these:</hi> Looking at Jesus,
who endured the Cross, despising the shame:
(<hi>And</hi>) I have determined to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but Christ and him crucified; (<hi>and</hi>)
God forbid that I should glory save in the
Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ: (<hi>and</hi>) If
any man will be my Disciple, let him deny
himself, take up his Cross and follow
me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From which expressions, granting a</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Confession of the Faith, or a</hi> Symbolical
<hi>Protestation of it, to be requisite, what
could be more convenient, than that which
hath been in use (as far as we are able to
collect) from the first establishment of
Christianity.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epilogue lib. 3. cap. 29. p. 342.</note> 
                     <hi>And, as that very Learned
and Judicious</hi> Divine, <hi>hath determined;</hi>
There are, certainly, many occasions for a
Christian to have recourse to God for his
Grace, upon Protestation of his Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
(which is the condition upon which
all Grace of God becomes due) when there
is neither time nor opportunity to recollect
his mind unto a formal address by praying
unto God: All which this Ceremony (<hi>the
Sign of the Cross</hi>) fitly signifieth.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude this with a matter of
<hi>Fact;</hi> The <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Behaviour</hi> of a
Member of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church at the time
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:104660:123"/>
of his <hi>Martyrdom</hi> (a few years since) sent
to me by a very Worthy, Learned, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Person, (who was upon the place
at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>One thing (saith he) I cannot but take
notice of, that all the way this deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Creature was hurried backwards and
forwards to the <hi>Cady</hi> and the <hi>Kaima
Cam,</hi> and afterwards to execution; when
either he could not speak through <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of body, or else could not be <hi>heard</hi>
among the thronging Multitude: He, in
a manner continually made the <hi>Sign of
the Cross</hi> upon his <hi>Breast,</hi> to testifie to
the World by this <hi>dumb Rhetorick,</hi> his
undaunted resolution of <hi>being</hi> and <hi>dying</hi>
a <hi>true Christian.</hi> I confess it made me
with great pleasure reflect upon that
ancient <hi>Rite</hi> used by our Church in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
I mean the <hi>sign of the Cross.</hi>
                     </q> It may
be, that to men who never lived abroad
amongst <hi>Vnbelievers,</hi> nor considered
the state of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, in
which <hi>this</hi> Practice first prevailed, it may
seem a very useless and empty Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to make this <hi>Sign</hi> upon an <hi>Infants</hi>
Forehead at his reception into Christ's
Flock; much more for a man in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
to do it upon his own <hi>Breast:</hi> but
for my own part I shall rather for ever
esteem it as an <hi>Vniversal Character</hi> of a
<hi>Christian,</hi> forasmuch as it is sufficient to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:104660:123"/>
signifie throughout the <hi>whole</hi> World (when
no other Language is mutually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood)
that the Person so sign'd is <hi>own'd,</hi>
or <hi>owns himself</hi> to be a Member of Christ's
<hi>Mystical</hi> Body.<note place="margin">See <hi>Tertul</hi> de <hi>Cornu Militis,</hi> cap. 3.</note> And therefore many of
the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians were <hi>branded</hi>
with a Cross, and the <hi>Walls</hi> of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Castles, and Houses (as we see
some yet remaining <hi>in many places</hi> to this
very day) bore this <hi>Mark</hi> upon them,
only as a note of <hi>distinction</hi> at first, though
the <hi>Superstition</hi> indeed of succeeding Ages
much altered the <hi>Original</hi> intent of it.
The <hi>Christian</hi> Slaves and other miserable
and <hi>indigent</hi> Believers, who up and down
the Streets <hi>beg</hi> our Charity, when all <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>
is <hi>insignificant,</hi> or perhaps their
<hi>Tongues are cut out,</hi> will declare their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to us by <hi>this</hi> only sign. And we
have several times travelled abroad in
<hi>Turkish</hi> habits, and happening into a
<hi>Christian</hi> Village, we have found the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at first very fearful and <hi>averse</hi> from
giving us any entertainment; but assuring
them by <hi>this sign,</hi> that we were of <hi>their
own Belief,</hi> we have been <hi>immediately</hi>
admitted and kindly treated. And without
any further Instances, I have found this
<hi>outward</hi> token alone in <hi>these</hi> Countries
to be a sufficient <hi>Shibboleth</hi> to distinguish
a <hi>Christian</hi> from an <hi>Infidel.</hi> Now though
perhaps in your Parts of <hi>Christendom</hi> a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104660:124"/>
Christian of <hi>riper</hi> years, may never have a
<hi>real</hi> occasion of making profession of his
Faith by <hi>this Outward Character;</hi> yet I
think our <hi>Church</hi> doth extreamly well in
retaining so much as she doth of this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
Custome, I mean in <hi>Crossing,</hi> at least
the Persons that are <hi>Newly</hi> baptized; since
the words which she useth in that <hi>Office</hi>
sufficiently expound the meaning of the
<hi>first Institutors</hi> of this <hi>Ceremony;</hi> to wit,
it signifies, that as they should manfully
maintain the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> fight
against <hi>Sin</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> and all <hi>Pomps</hi>
and <hi>Vanities,</hi> under the <hi>inward Banner</hi> of
a stedfast and lively Faith in Christ, so they

ignorant of the liberty of the Gospel, and
<hi>Superstitious.</hi> And though Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>

sadly torment themselves, while they

4. I would ask this Question; Do these
<hi>Dissenters</hi> value those <hi>Homilies,</hi> or do
they not? If they trust our <hi>Reformers</hi>

to believe them, that there is no such <hi>peril</hi>
of Superstition in those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which
the Church then enjoyned and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>practised;</hi> for, I hope their <hi>insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
should not be more prevalent to keep
them from <hi>Superstition,</hi> than their constant
<hi>practice</hi> to keep them in <hi>Obedience,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

as safe a <hi>Convoy</hi> too, in his own conceit:
Yet St. <hi>Jude</hi> was of another Judgment;
and we know he fell into the <hi>Pit</hi> at last.
And 'tis somewhat an unlucky expression,
<hi>[To go astray into the right way,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jud. <hi>v.</hi> 13. Cajetan. ib.</note>] For we

(and so they are in the <hi>right</hi> way:)
But they have <hi>Erratick</hi> Motions of their

own; and to <hi>these</hi> were those <hi>false-teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>

from the common Practice of the

tells us, there is a sad <hi>reserve</hi> of vengeance

                  <p>2. They say, <hi>they have read over all

prepared to receive the truth, and Patient
of convictions? <hi>Lavater</hi> (as was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

that would write and publish <hi>Answers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had well considered or so much as
read the Discourses, they did oppose. And
one would think that some of these <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
dealt so by their Adversaries; for they
call their Arguments <hi>weak,</hi> many times,
when they cannot answer them: and their
Reasons <hi>Futilous</hi> when they find them

that Learned and Judicious <hi>Prince.</hi> And
whatever <hi>Partial</hi> men may think, the

that our present <hi>Dissenters</hi> (after all their
great pains and study) have made very
little <hi>accession</hi> of advantage to their <hi>Cause</hi>
by Argument and sound Reason, whatever
may accrew to it, by Noise, Tumult, and

                  <p>3. For <hi>Rayling</hi> 'tis so much our Authors

                  <p>4. This Author seems to be very kind in

And 'tis a quality so <hi>ornamental</hi>
and <hi>useful,</hi> I shall not wish them to part
with it, but to make use of it still (to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

(by which we are not to understand
any ingenuous <hi>Retraction</hi> upon second
thoughts and better information) 'tis a
<hi>new</hi> Observation of this Authors, never
before collected out of their Writings. 'Tis
true, we have read of <hi>Richard</hi> against
<hi>Baxter</hi> (in 80 <hi>Pages,</hi>) but never of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>

                  <p>5. But the main <hi>Quaere</hi> will be, How
these <hi>Dissenters</hi> come to be <hi>hardened</hi> in
their Errour; for (tho he calls it a <hi>Going
astray into the right way</hi>) there is no less
truth in this his <hi>Drollery,</hi> than in their
<hi>Conviction,</hi> who are mentioned <hi>Wisd. 5. 6.
They have erred from the way of Truth;</hi>
and how so? <hi>Malunt perversis Vocibus

to be restored to the Peace of the Church.
Let <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity;</hi> let the best

<q>yet so, that the <hi>exercise</hi> of that <hi>Right</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore that Learned and Ingenious
S. P. in</hi> The Case of the Church of <hi>England
(p. 264, 265.) hath very well observed,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:104660:134"/>
That the</hi> Bottom <hi>we build upon is this,</hi>
                     <q>That the Church own'd by the Law of
<hi>England,</hi> is the very same that was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht
by the Law of Christ. For unless
we suppose, that the Church was Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
settled by our Saviour with Divine
Authority, we deny his Supremacy over
his own Church; and unless we suppose
that the Supream Government of the
Kingdom has power to abet and ratifie
our Saviours establishment by Civil
Laws, we deny his Majesties Supremacy
over his Christian Subjects; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both together must be taken into the
right State and Constitution of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are some <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
whose <hi>Original</hi> cannot be trac'd out, having
bin in use in the Church of God, at <hi>all times
and places:</hi> These are supposed with great
Reason to have been derived from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
themselves; for such an <hi>Vniversal</hi>
practice could not be introduced but by a
<hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Vniversal</hi> Authority, as an
<hi>Vniversal effect</hi> must have a Cause of no
<hi>less</hi> efficacy to produce it. Now for any
<hi>Particular</hi> Church to attempt a <hi>Change</hi> of
<hi>such</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, is as if a
<hi>Quarter Sessions</hi> in a private <hi>Corporation,</hi>
should take upon them to <hi>dissolve</hi> or <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule</hi>
what has been regularly done and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in a <hi>Full Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>

3. We should consider, whether there
be any <hi>need</hi> of such <hi>Reformation</hi> as they
endeavour? There are some <hi>Rites</hi> and
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which no <hi>Person,</hi> no <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
Church should presume to alter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Vniformity</hi> of the
<hi>Catholick</hi> Church is preserved hereby; and
if we will possess our selves to continue in
her <hi>Communion,</hi> we must observe <hi>them</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of our <hi>Conformity</hi> to her
practice. But other <hi>particular</hi> Rites and
Ceremonies are left to the prudence of
<hi>Particular</hi> Churches, to exercise <hi>their</hi>
Power and <hi>Liberty,</hi> with respect to the
<hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of the People. But,</p>
                  <p>That there is no <hi>Necessity</hi> of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Publick <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> hath been made good
against Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> by the Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend,
Learned and Judicious Doctor
<hi>Pearson,</hi> now Lord Bishop of <hi>Chester.</hi> And
that there is no <hi>Need</hi> of <hi>such</hi> a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Publick 1. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 2. <hi>Worship,</hi>
3. <hi>Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> 4. <hi>Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>

hath been proved by <hi>H. S.</hi> D. D. 1660.</p>
                  <p>But we shall not take it for <hi>granted,</hi>
(tho we know no <hi>Answer</hi> returned to
<hi>these,</hi> and several other Learned Men, who
have wrote in Justification of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> to that effect,) but give our
proof for it; <hi>That Church which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:104660:135"/>
Reform'd and establisht,</hi> according to
the Word, <hi>as far as a state of</hi> Frailty <hi>and</hi>
Humane Prudence <hi>will admit;</hi> That
Church hath no <hi>need</hi> of further <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
But such is the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would not be mistaken; For I know
there ought to be a <hi>proficiency</hi> in <hi>Grace</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 18.</note>
and Holiness, and the practice of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Vertues, till we arrive at such a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
of Perfection as this <hi>Mortal</hi> condition
is capable of. But for a further Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or of <hi>Laws</hi>
and <hi>Canons,</hi> (if what are already enacted
were duly inforced and executed) we have
no <hi>need</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is duly observed by that Worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
even now mentioned,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Case of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> p. 268.</note> 
                     <hi>That</hi> if every
defect from <hi>Christs</hi> Institution should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
the Rights of a Christian Church,
there never was, as we may find by the
Apostles account of the Churches in their
times, nor ever will be such a thing as a
Church in the World. For in this life it
is not to be expected that any thing should
be absolutely perfect, the very nature of
Christianity supposes Imperfection, and
accepts of Integrity; and as long as with
sincere Affections men adhere to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Church, they are within the
Promise of the Grace of God.</p>

That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
up to those <hi>Principles,</hi> who can

After a faithful account given of the free
use of things indifferent, such as will not
submit to a just Authority, nothing is to
be done in their favour; but as Persons
persisting in their purpose, out of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
or Stubborness, out of a love of
Contention, or some other Mental distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
they are sharply to be reproved.</p>

had of the Weak in order to their Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
but to such as are obstinately Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
maliciously Treacherous, or
falsé Brethren, there ought not to be the
least yielding. <hi>His Reasons are these,</hi>
Lest hereby we should confirm the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious

no less than <hi>Seven</hi> Arguments to the same
purpose, which I shall collect as briefly as
is possible.</p>
                  <p>1. <q>The first is drawn from <hi>the Nature
of things Indifferent;</hi> which is such as
that they may be freely used, or freely
disused or abrogated; but when the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use,
abrogation or practice is obtruded as
of <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Coaction,</hi> the nature of
such <hi>Indifferent</hi> things is violated.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:104660:137"/>
2. <q>
                        <hi>From the Nature of Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
This is a valuable Treasure, and
of Christs own purchasing: but 'tis en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd
by a double Invasion. 1. When
things not commanded by God's Word,
are imposed as absolutely necessary to be
observed. 2. When things not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by God's Word, are restrain'd as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be practised. There is <hi>Errour</hi> and
<hi>Superstition</hi> on either side, and <hi>Christian
Liberty</hi> is equally betrayed in them both;
which Authority therefore should neither
abet, nor tolerate.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <q>
                        <hi>From the Duty of true Christians.</hi>
An ingenuous Profession of the Gospel;
to assert the whole Truth thereof, with
the Priviledges which accrue to us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
especially when assaulted and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
and such is our <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi>
with the free use, or disuse of things <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi>
(not determined by Authority,
whose Power the <hi>Gospel</hi> has established.)
This is a <hi>Christians</hi> Duty; A flat denial
whereof is against that <hi>Profession</hi> which
Christ requires (<hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 33.) and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
it is unwarrantable, and we ought
to avoid the <hi>appearance</hi> of it, (as one of
the <hi>unfruitful works of darkness</hi>) that
we betray not our Profession.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <q>
                        <hi>From the general Command touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lawful use of Ceremonies and
things Indifferent:</hi> Wherein three things
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:104660:138"/>
are to be observed, <hi>Order, Decency,</hi> and
<hi>Edification.</hi> Good <hi>Order</hi> is not kept in
tumultuous Alterations: All <hi>Change</hi> is
dangerous in Church and State. No
man can foresee what disturbance will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
upon an inconsiderate variation of
<hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>inoffensive Ceremonies,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in a time when such <hi>Christian
Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Publick Authority</hi>
ought to be own'd and preserved invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable.
What Doubts may arise upon such
a <hi>Change,</hi> and what Confusion may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, who will take upon him to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Is not the Confusion great, when things
Indifferent are exposed for <hi>Necessary,</hi> and
things Absolutely necessary accounted but
<hi>Indifferent?</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Can it be inservient either to <hi>Order</hi> or
<hi>Decency,</hi> when there is no degree of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi>
and <hi>Subordination</hi> among the
<hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church? No distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Habits</hi> between the <hi>Laity</hi> and the
<hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> observed?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Who can think the Church is Edified,
where all <hi>Genuflexion,</hi> all <hi>Reverence,</hi> all
evidences of a <hi>Devout mind</hi> are out of
practice? When all the <hi>Proper Lessons,</hi>
that should inculcate the Great Mysteries,
which are to be represented for our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
our Devotion and Gratitude, on
the <hi>Festivals</hi> of the <hi>Nativity,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:104660:138"/>
and <hi>Pentecost, &amp;c.</hi> are abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated;
and perhaps the History of <hi>Lot</hi>'s
Incest, and the like, things most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
for such <hi>Sacred</hi> Solemnities,
shall be surrogated and read in their
stead?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <q>A <hi>Fifth Argument</hi> is drawn <hi>Ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodo,</hi>
from the great <hi>Incommodious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of it. As the general Command re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
in matters of Indifferency, that
<hi>all things be done to edification:</hi> so the
Law of Charity forbids us to do any
thing that may either <hi>offend the Weak</hi> in
the practice of their Conformity, or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Adversaries</hi> in their Errour;
the Example of the Great Apostle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
us signal Instances to these pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
The Mischiefs of such a <hi>Scandal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
are sufficiently collected from the <hi>Woe</hi>
our Saviour has denounced against the
Authors of them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 6,. 7. And
the Mischiefs of such a <hi>Confirmation</hi> of
obstinate <hi>Dissenters,</hi> are too evident
(saith he) by Experience: The <hi>Peace of
the Church</hi> is not hereby obtained, but
the <hi>safety</hi> thereof much endangered;
for the <hi>Adversaries</hi> do not acquiesce in
such <hi>Concessions;</hi> but take occasion from
thence to proceed in defending their <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi>
and disturbing the <hi>Church;</hi> an
Example whereof has given us a late Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
in the Dukedom of <hi>Anhalt.</hi>
                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:104660:139"/>
If they can obtain to have things <hi>abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,</hi>
because they are pleased to load
them with the reproach of <hi>Superstition</hi>
and <hi>Sinfulness,</hi> they cannot with a fairer
occasion to traduce other Matters, and
by this specious Argument of <hi>yielding</hi> in
such Cases, among the weaker and worse
sort of Men, to render <hi>Them</hi> suspected
in their Principles, <hi>whom</hi> they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merily
treated with all respect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
as the <hi>Ministers</hi> of God: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
such as are not well <hi>Confirmed,</hi> will
be apt to <hi>fall away,</hi> and others will be
offended at their defection; and so the
Church (saith he) will not be <hi>edified,</hi> but
<hi>destroyed;</hi> the Course of the <hi>Gospel</hi> not
<hi>promoted,</hi> but <hi>hindred;</hi> and at last <hi>Truth</hi>
it self not <hi>asserted,</hi> but <hi>weakened</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <q>A <hi>Sixth Argument</hi> he draws from
<hi>The Practice of the Primitive Church.
Circumcision</hi> being then but a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
(as he observes) St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rule of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Liberty,</hi> did sometime practice it;
but when <hi>false Brethren</hi> did fraudulently
intrude, to spy out and betray the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
of the Church, and attempted to
impose it as a matter of <hi>Necessity;</hi> St.
<hi>Paul</hi> did absolutely reject it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:104660:139"/>
                     <hi>Simile ergo, &amp;c.</hi> In like manner the
Rites and Ceremonies used in the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
Churches are <hi>Adiaphora,</hi> things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
neither commanded nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
either by any <hi>Divine Law,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition;</hi>
God leaving them as a middle
sort of things, which the Church may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>freely</hi> use or not use at her pleasure.
<q>Now (<hi>saith he</hi>) seeing the <hi>Calvinists</hi>
would put a <hi>necessary</hi> abstention and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
upon us as to the use of these
things, 'tis out of all question, they
would (<hi>in effect</hi>) betray our Liberty.
Wherefore such as are faithful <hi>Asserters</hi>
of the <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> ought not to
yield to <hi>them</hi> in the least; that (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their duty) the Truth and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> may be preserved
inviolable from all bondage and dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
Such as do otherwise, by a tame
and cowardly <hi>Cession,</hi> do betray our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
give <hi>scandal</hi> to the weak, and offer
a manifest <hi>violence</hi> to <hi>Apostolical</hi> Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <q>His last Argument is drawn from
the <hi>insufficiency</hi> and <hi>weakness</hi> of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
Reasons to make good their
pretensions; which he does clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
as will appear to any man that
shall take the pains to examine the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
it self, to which I remit the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:104660:140"/>
I have studied to be concise in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment
of his Arguments, which he
concludes thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That the <hi>Calvinists</hi> may obtain what
they desire, 'tis necessary that they urge
their <hi>abrogation</hi> upon an <hi>honest</hi> Title;
and prove by evident Reasons, that the
<hi>Rites</hi> received in <hi>our</hi> Churches are not
purged from the <hi>Superstitions</hi> and <hi>abuses</hi>
of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> but serve to <hi>nourish</hi>
them. Which, since they never did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
because <hi>Experience</hi> is a clear E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to the <hi>contrary;</hi> therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Liberty</hi> purchased for us,
<hi>saith he,</hi> we do retain these <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
which are <hi>indifferent</hi> in themselves, and
no where <hi>forbidden</hi> by the Word of God.
And that the <hi>Nature of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
may <hi>remain entire, Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
safe,</hi> and <hi>the Truth unshaken;</hi> we
are resolved not to yield, no not so much
as for <hi>one moment,</hi> to the <hi>intemperance</hi> of
our Adversaries, who under a pretence of
<hi>Zeal</hi> do nothing in matters of Religion,
but with <hi>tumult</hi> and an immoderate <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</hi>
                     </q>
Thus the Learned <hi>Meisner,</hi> on
behalf of the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I cannot omit another pregnant
Evidence of their <hi>strictness</hi> in adhering to
their establishment, which we find in an
<hi>Extract</hi> out of the <hi>National Synod,</hi> held

                  <p>The <hi>Note</hi> in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible (at 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

deprived <hi>Rotarius,</hi> one of their
Ministers, and thrust him out of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and (which is more) they hunted him
by their Letters out of a Town not far

               <head>Reverend, Godly, and worthy Sirs, our
Dear Brethren and Companions in
the work of the Lord.</head>
               <p>IF proportionably to the grief, we have
conceived at your Letters, (wherein
you have expressed the most sad face of
your Affaires,) we had but as much Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
either by our Consolations to asswage
your sorrows, or by our Counsels to ease.
your Burthens, or by any our Co-operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to help your Extremity, we should
think our selves very happy in so well cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responding
with your Honourable, and
most loving <hi>Compellation</hi> of us; and right
glad we should be thus to requite you with
our best and effectual good Offices. But
alass, as the scantness of our Capacity in
this kind, so the ignorance of the more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
causes</hi> of so many miseries, and
chiefly <hi>the perplex and dangerous Nature
of the matters now in Agitation among
you:</hi> All these put together, strike us quite
dumb: we are as men wholly at a stand,
able only (in a kind of silent Astonishment
or holy horrour) to admire, and to adore
<hi>that finger of God,</hi> which is now listed up
over you all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104660:144"/>
But since, being by you so lovingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to it, we must needs at last break off
our silence, we are reduced to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<hi>suspense both</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> and of <hi>pens,</hi>
what to say first or last, or indeed what to
say at all.</p>
               <p>And now in the end, after long delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
lest, as <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, we should
transgress by precipitate or unseasonable
discourse: Behold our Hearts and Mouths
top-full of the Senses and Expressions of
our hearty Commisseration, our Eyes
running down with Tears of Compassion,
our Breasts even swol'n up with Sighs and
Groans at your Calamities. These are
they, God is our Witness, that fill up the
greatest part of our private Prayers, of our
publick Devotions, Fastings and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
In all which we are resolved to give
the Father of mercies no rest, untill your
Tranquility being once more Ordained in
Heaven, God do extend peace upon Earth
unto you all like a River, and the fulness
of his blessing, like an overflowing
stream.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our</hi> Affaires, yea, the <hi>general interest</hi>
of all the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches are so close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>involved</hi> in yours, and so mutually <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending</hi>
thereon, That <hi>your safety once</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
assures <hi>us all</hi> of our <hi>own</hi> good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.
Therefore especially during this
grevious Tempest, which may seem to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104660:145"/>
bring about again the heavy time of the
saints great <hi>primitive</hi> tribulation, we are, in
a manner compelled with trembling Hearts
and Lips, to pour out our Lamentations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ears of our most gratious and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father, no longer now only prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to <hi>contend by Fire,</hi> as he once reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in a <hi>Vision</hi> to his Prophet <hi>Amos.</hi> 7. 4, 5.
but already for a long time <hi>really</hi> contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Fire indeed: And how then can we
forbear from crying out, <hi>O Lord forgive,
cease we beseech thee, by whom shall</hi> Jacob
<hi>arise for he is</hi> small, <hi>and round about all
in Flame, by the Fire of thy burning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</hi>
From this our own <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi>
untoucht as yet by Divine Miracle,
We have beheld this furious <hi>Conflagration</hi>
spreading it self all over; We have seen
the <hi>Grisoen-Italian</hi> Churches utterly defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
the Gospel in <hi>Bohemia</hi> its ancient seat,

The <hi>French Church</hi> as deprived of
all humane supports, and refuges, like so
many poor little <hi>Callow</hi> Birds alive indeed,

swallow'd up with an unexpected deluge of

That in the <hi>self-same pitched Field, one

on both sides, to shed the Blood of those,
that for the Major-part had hitherto by
so many clear Demonstrations, in the whole

loyalty towards their Country,</hi> approved
themselves such <hi>faithful</hi> and true Brethren

and even at the last gasp for help.</p>
               <p>What marvaile then, if these your cruel

even to a variety the Judgments and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
too of <hi>Christendom?</hi> Neither do
we our selves deny but that <hi>for a while</hi> we
did somewhat <hi>stagger at,</hi> and as it were
<hi>fluctuate</hi> about it; yet that <hi>demur</hi> of ours
did neither proceed from <hi>prejudice</hi> against;
nor from <hi>partiality</hi> towards either side, as
not being called upon by either, neither
publickly nor privately, till now of late in
your reference unto us, which we do reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as no small piece of honour, since in

down</hi> either party, both being of such
<hi>extraordinary quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have conteined our selves within the
bounds of a conscionable Judgment, and
<hi>impartial</hi> Charity, towards both parties,
for indeed ye are both Brethren; We have
neither way exceeded the compass of our
own measure, but still kept a meane, as
rejoycing on the one hand at those good
things which we did hear were entertained
with the general applause of all good men;
So on the other hand, we could not but
behold with grief those other <hi>sinister passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
that in themselves did carry a more <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
appearance:</hi> we were overjoyed at the<note n="*" place="margin">Without Battel or Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note>
Issue of the <hi>Scottish</hi> troubles, that seemed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104660:147"/>
at first to presage a Combustion not unlike
this of yours, and yet far sooner quenched;
for as by God's own admirable handi-work
(so by the <hi>never-enough-magnified Piety
and Wisdom of your most gratious King,</hi>
and by the Concord of that wary Nation)
that fire was in time put out, ere ever it
did burst into a more open flame. At the
first Report of these your own <hi>Commotions,</hi>
our minds were possessed with a good hope
that all past Offences might with the same
promptitude and facility be forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
and all matters composed: So that
what Actions or Counsels should appear
amiss, might by the Benignity <hi>of the best
of Princes be</hi> easily redressed, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth</hi>
without <hi>noise</hi> or <hi>bloodshed</hi> be kept <hi>in due
order:</hi> In pursuance of all which, we
could not but admire the happy and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
beginnings of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and
the <hi>more than Fatherly affections of</hi> his
his most gratious Majesty, evidenced by his
<hi>enacting those</hi> Laws, from which <hi>for the
time to come,</hi> there was <hi>a clear hope</hi> of a
<hi>Government full of Equity,</hi> and <hi>freed
from all Corruption:</hi> An example not so
<hi>rare,</hi> as indeed <hi>singular</hi> in this our <hi>wild</hi>
Generation, so <hi>fertile</hi> of violent Powers
and Princes. But all these our goodly hopes
were soon <hi>blasted</hi> by <hi>that raging storm and
tempest of popular Tumults among you, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104660:147"/>
did force away both your most gratious
Prince from his Parliament, as also a
great part of the Parliament from it self,</hi>
since which we have heard indeed of many
attempts and enterprizes, many propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and projects, but all of them come to
nothing, nothing is yet brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
nothing is yet rightly settled or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished.</p>
               <p>The Business of the Church might seem
the <hi>chief object of</hi> your care and solicitude:
If it had been handled and debated at
<hi>times,</hi> and with <hi>minds calme and quiet,</hi>
had the opposite Judgments been <hi>compared
and impartially weighed</hi> one with another
such <hi>an orderly course</hi> might <hi>happily have
purchased a lasting peace to your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and also rendred unto your Church
that most desired <hi>Primitive face of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical
times,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Such was Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy in it's first Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal vigour of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the which as at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> this very man did both acknowledge unto Bishop <hi>Carleton,</hi> to be the best form of Church Government, and also did heartily wish for it in his own Church; so doth he sufficiently commend the happy effects of it above page 5. in that full passage on his containing the superlative praises of the former flourishing Estate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as before these troubles it stood under Episc<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

contrary the Event hath fallen out! For
the minds of both sides being averse from,

this very matter hath proved the <hi>Rock of
Offence</hi> by exasperating the wound and
tearing it wider and wider by <hi>distracting
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104660:148"/>
more and more asunder</hi> the hearts of each
party distempered enough already through
former <hi>partiality</hi> and <hi>discord of</hi> affections.
Nay, if the report be true, these Church-distractions
have <hi>opened a wide gap to</hi> so
many <hi>boysterous and private spirits,</hi> which
we hear have assumed to themselves the
most <hi>mischievous Title</hi> of <hi>Independants,</hi>
than which <hi>Destructive Sect</hi> nothing could
more <hi>undermine,</hi> yea, <hi>quite overturn</hi> the
very <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>Besides all that, we have been extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grieved at this, That <hi>The Spirit of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi>
hath so plentifully <hi>sown</hi> among you
his <hi>pernicious Tares of Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi>
that they have not only fructified, but
even overgrown all manner of <hi>mutual
Trust,</hi> in despight of so many <hi>Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
sealed and bound up with most
grievous Imprecations.</hi> But the very top
and height of all our sorrows on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfs,
hath been this, That all that <hi>cursed
fuel</hi> thus heaped on, is now at last <hi>kindled
into a bloody War,</hi> lengthned on both sides,
by a Multiplication of deadly feudes; so
that during such an Universal Combustion,
what ever mens bare words, and never so
frequent protestations otherwise may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
yet the <hi>Royal Honour, Power</hi> and
<hi>Dignity</hi> cannot <hi>but fall into utter contempt:</hi>
And on the contrary <hi>the licentiousness of
the most Audacious and Lawless</hi> cannot
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104660:148"/>
but <hi>gather strength and out-grow the other:</hi>
and then, consequently <hi>Piety must needs
decay, mutual Love and Charity must ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
vanish away,</hi> and <hi>instead thereof a
kind of Savage disposition,</hi> yea <hi>Brutish
rage must needs at last invade the minds
and manners of the men of this Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
who in process of time will no longer
look upon the <hi>Old Original Causes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the War,</hi> but rather upon the <hi>new mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
injuries freshly done, or received in
the very progress or prosecution of the</hi>
War between two parties divided far more
by <hi>an odious difference of reproachful
names,</hi> as it were, <hi>infamous brands</hi> fixed
upon each other, then <hi>really by the cause
it self,</hi> it had been far more easy unto us,
and all good men else, to deliver our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon your cause; had the Major part
of either side <hi>differed</hi> from the other either
in the more <hi>Essential points</hi> of Religion, or
else dissented about <hi>the Fundamental Laws</hi>
of the <hi>Common-Wealth;</hi> or had either party

evils, which in other Kingdoms
may seem almost unavoidable: All these
Considerations put together, have moved
us for a long while seriously to <hi>deliberate</hi>
and advise what might be at last, the best
expedient lest to procure an honest and sure
peace among you. Indeed we have been
much <hi>scandalized,</hi> that all the <hi>Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of several <hi>Kingdoms and Provinces in
League with you,</hi> have been tryed and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all <hi>in vain:</hi> Howbeit it came into our
mind to propound this one <hi>Medium</hi> more,
whether now at last there be yet any hope
to obtain from the King's most <hi>gracious</hi>
Majesty, and from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that
of both sides <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Persons may be
chosen of <hi>unquestioned Trust,</hi> and fame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
beyond all suspition, to whom this
great business may be committed; Namely,
That comparing the <hi>chief points</hi> now in
controversy, they may <hi>chalck</hi> out some
good way towards an <hi>holy peace.</hi> But first
these men must by God's good Spirit, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
be dispossessed of all factious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that so they may become sit <hi>Vmpires</hi>
and <hi>Trustees</hi> of the <hi>Publick peace,</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Ambassadours of Reconciliation</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:104660:149"/>
between both parties, and also able and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
too, by all their speeches, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and sacred obtestations, to <hi>charm</hi> the
hearts that on both sides are so <hi>obdurate</hi> in
<hi>War</hi> and <hi>Bloodshed.</hi> This were the ready
way, by this interposing the <hi>Sacred Censer</hi>
in the very midst of these <hi>publick flames</hi>
to quench all the <hi>heart-burnings:</hi> for who
knows whether at the devout Prayers and
holy Groans of <hi>Persons Sacred,</hi> thus <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi>
at the <hi>footstool</hi> of the Heavenly grace,
the <hi>Divine</hi> Power and Glory may not
<hi>break out once more,</hi> and shew forth it self
by moving the hearts of <hi>both parties</hi> to
lay down all hatred, and publick enmities.
The only way to procure such sound Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of both sides, and to purchase again
the pretious blessing of a general Peace, is
especially when all humane helps fail, to
call in the <hi>Divine assistance,</hi> which no man
did ever try in vain. By these good means
that may be brought to pass (what cannot
be hoped for from Civil-War, however the
success prove) that by a voluntary incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of minds, the wound shall be so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
closed up, as that Love and Charity may
in time perfectly be recovered.</p>
               <p>The good opinion which you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of us may suffer us to offer these
Considerations unto you, It might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty
in us to prescribe, or to advise you
any further: But no Law of modesty can
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104660:150"/>
ever forbid us to wish, and to vow, and to
beseech God for you, yea to appeal unto
God, and to adjure you All in his name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O then above all, take a speedy and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
care for a sure and sound Peace; what
ever it be</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">What would this <hi>Peace-maker</hi> have said if he had seen or heard of so many Royal Reiterated offers of Peace wherewith the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign hath and still doth woo his <hi>stif-necked Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?</hi> Certainly, the more peaceable side hath always amongst good men had the reputation of the better side.</note>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have put me upon a fresh task,
and I must obey you. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
Vnion</hi> among Protestants, (to tell
you my Opinion,) is a thing most desirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and of the highest Consequence, if
possible to be accomplished. But if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
an Union of all Protestants in General,
we must consider the Circumstances under
which they ly.</p>
            <p>1. Some of them are under such <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>
and awe, to <hi>Popish</hi> Princes, 'tis not
safe for them to come into any Debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Means and Methods of it. Where
it may be done with freedom and safety, it
may be Prudent and Advisable to Consult
the most Eminent Divines as well of the
<hi>Lutheran</hi> as the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Churches.
And the Concurrent Judgment of such (if
to be obtain'd) might Contribute more to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104660:152"/>
the satisfaction of the truely <hi>Conscientious,</hi>
in Uniting the Protestant Interest, than
the gratifying of every <hi>Sect,</hi> hand over
head, within our selves. But I confess 'tis
almost out of doubt, that the <hi>Sects</hi> (which
swarm among us) of <hi>Anabaptists, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
Antinomians, Ranters, Quakers,
Fift-Monarchists,</hi> and (which comprehends
them all) <hi>Independents,</hi> would never pass
the Muster with such Divines, for any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick establishment
or protection. And can any
wise man think fit we should loose or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
our Character and Esteem abroad, the
honour of the most prudent and Regular
Reformation, to gratify such Sectaries as
would certainly be exploded among all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
of any Creditable Denomination?</p>
            <p>2. Besides, being a Maxim and Rule
generally received among them, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular Church hath power within it
self, to frame Canons and Constitutions;
and to settle Rites and Ceremonies, for
the exercise of Religion and Discipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
their own Members, they may very
well think it impertinent for them to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
or to be call'd upon for their Advise
and Judgment in this matter.</p>
            <p>3. Besides, it is to be considered, that
we stand all ready upon the same bottom
with other Protestant Churches, only we
are better built, (as they know very well)
both for Strength and Beauty; in so much,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104660:152"/>
as that Noble and Learned Pastor of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi>
calls the Church of <hi>England the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senal
of the Protestant Profession, the</hi>
Crown and Glory of all the Church of that
Denomination.</p>
            <p>Can there be any reason or good Policy
to cut of the locks of this Spouse of Christ,
and Ecclipse her Glory? To pull down the
Pallisadoes and demolish the Fortifications
of such a Fabrick? To rob her of her Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Antiquity and Primitive Lustre?
And all this upon no other account, than
to gratify a restless and uneasy sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by falling under the same reproach
with themselves, of being addicted to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but Lightness, Change, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties.</p>
            <p>4. But we are to consider further, That
the Laws are the Bond of Union, the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
and Ligaments of all Bodies Politick;
and where these are had in Veneration, and
observed with due respect, that People are
as well United as Humane Policy can aim
at. Such as will not submit to such pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and wholesome Constitutions, do vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
shut themselves out of the <hi>Lines</hi>
of Communication. And when the <hi>door</hi>
is open if they will not enter in to joyn with
us, they must stand expos'd upon their
own Leggs, and expect no defence from
us, whose Communion they do causelesly
desert. But to think the <hi>Walls</hi> of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104660:153"/>
are presently to be broken down to let in
this <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse, (as a great <hi>Prelate</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Bp. <hi>Lany.</hi>
               </note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
himself at <hi>Court</hi>) is an attempt like
to be <hi>fatal,</hi> and a certain way to bring in
ruine.</p>
            <p>5. That some should be obliged to obey
the Laws and shew Conformity, and others
be dispensed with, cannot stand with Equity.
<hi>Aequalitas prima pars aequitatis,</hi> saith <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,
Equalitie</hi> is the first and chiefest part
of Equite.</p>
            <p>We are taught also by a dear experience
that such a dispensation will breed division:
for a division in Laws makes<note n="†" place="margin">Oliver Ormerod. Puritano-Papismus. <hi>p.</hi> 29.</note> division in
Kingdoms, a choosing of sides and a must<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering
into Parties, whence strife infallibly,
with Envy, Emulations, Contentions, and
a Worldr of other mischiefs do arise. And
as Division in Laws causes division in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
so those divisions cause the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and overthrow of such Kingdoms. For
'tis Gospel that a Kingdom divided against
it self cannot stand. Satans Kingdom thus
divided would come to desolation; how
then can a Kingdom of Flesh and Blood, a
Kingdom of Mortal Men subject to impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
passions, subsist under Agony and
conflict of divisions?</p>
            <p>If there were no such danger likely to
ensue upon a <hi>Toleration</hi> or <hi>Connivance;</hi>
yet it cannot stand with <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
that one People, within the same
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104660:153"/>
Land, and under the same Government,
(and especially <hi>Monarchical</hi>) should be
under divers Laws. 'Tis like an <hi>Oracle</hi> in
<hi>Curtius,</hi> Ejusdem Juris esse debent, qui
sub eodem Rege Victuri sunt; <hi>Such as are
under the Government of one and the same
King</hi> (within the same Land and Nation)
<hi>should be under one and the same Law,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
as to publick Administrations.</p>
            <p>6. But the prevailing Argument is, The
Hellish Plots, the Implacable Malice, and
the Secret Combinations of the Popish par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to destroy us; the consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is thought sufficient to induce us to take
into Union and Association with us, all sorts
of Dissenters, that have but Mettle and
Edge enough to encounter and oppose the
Chuch of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But has the matter been duly weighed in
an equal Ballance? Or has not the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
apprehension of a present attempt from
the one party so far transported us, as to
make us forget the like (tho perhaps a
little more remote) danger which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
us from the other? Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
(in her time) thought it a measuring cast
which of the two Factions was the more
pernitious to the Rights of the Crown, and
the establisht Government. She knew
the Principles of these <hi>Dissenters,</hi> as well
as those of the <hi>Popish Priests and Jesuites;</hi>
she observed their practices also and the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104660:154"/>
Methods they took;<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Isaac Walton</hi> in the life of <hi>Hooker.</hi>
               </note> that, altho they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
with tender and meek <hi>Petitions,</hi> yet
they proceeded to <hi>Admonitions;</hi> nay, to
sharp and <hi>Satyrical Remonstrances;</hi> and at

<hi>Computed</hi> who was, and who was not, for
their <hi>Cause,</hi> they supposed themselves cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of so great a Party that they durst, and
began to threaten, first the Bishops, then
the Queen and Parliament.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the <hi>Queen</hi> having a strict Eye
and Check upon them, in a Parliament held
the <hi>28th.</hi> of her Reign, Commanded Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
<hi>Puckering,</hi> (who was then <hi>Her</hi>
Mouth, as well as the Speaker of the House
of <hi>Commons</hi>) to declare her <hi>Majesties</hi> sense,
and to caution her Subjects against them;
which was done in these expressions.</p>
            <p>And especially you are Commanded by

whilst (in the giddiness of their Spirits,)
they labour and strive to advance a new

which is as well grounded for

guided for the Discipline, as any Realm

by any of these new fangled Refiners. And
as the present Case standeth, it may be
doubted, whether they, or the <hi>Jesuites</hi> do
offer more danger, or be more speedily to
be repressed. For albeit the <hi>Jesuites</hi> do
impoyson the hearts of her Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
under a pretence of Conscience, to
withdraw them from obedience due to her
Majesty; yet do they the same but closely;
and only in privy Corners. But these men
do both publish in their printed Books, and
teach in all their Conventicles sundry Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
not only dangerous to the well set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Estate, and Policy of this Realm, by
putting a Pyke, between the Clergy and the
Laity, but also much derogatory to her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majesty and her Crown, as well by
the diminution of her antient and lawful
Revenues, and by denying her Highnesses
Prerogative and Supremacy, as by offering
peril to her Majesties safety in her own
Kingdom. In all which things, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in many other points, they pretend to
be at War with the <hi>Popish-Jesuites;</hi> yet by
this Seperation of themselves from the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of their fellow Subjects, and by aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Sacred Authority and Majesty of
their Prince, they do but joyn and concur
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104660:155"/>
with the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> in opening the door, and
preparing the way to the <hi>Spanish Invasion,</hi>
that is threatned against the Realm. <hi>This
was the sense of that Great</hi> Queen <hi>and her
Great</hi> Council. <hi>And hereupon such Laws
were</hi> Inacted, <hi>as were designed to strike e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
at</hi> both Factions.</p>
            <p>Now upon the premisses the <hi>Quere</hi> will
be, whether such as attempt to violate and
dissolve those Laws which she made to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Church and Kingdom as then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
do Cordially affect the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
she had, and the Government she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised.</p>
            <p>In all reason such as pretend so great a
veneration for her Name, should defer
some thing to her Judgment, and yield
something to her Wisdom and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>But if she were now alive might she not
find just cause to expostulate with Subjects,
as our Saviour did some time with his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples?
<hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and

me Renownd and Glorious, a Queen of

have no Reverence for the Authority
which I was invested with. For have you
not the same Crown, the same Sword, and

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104660:155"/>
the same Religion, which was publickly
profest, maintained and honoured in my
Reign?</p>
            <p>For where's the difference? No alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no addition has been made but for the
advantage of the Nation and the Protestant
Cause in general, yet what Elogies are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of her daies? and how is the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion cry'd up for the flourishing
condition of it under her Government?
<hi>The Protestant Religion</hi> (says <hi>Vox populi</hi>)
in which <hi>they</hi> and their <hi>Fathers</hi> have been
<hi>so many years bred, and under which they
have seen so many happy Days, freed from
the tyranny and oppressive Yoke of the</hi> Pope,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the Reason we cannot live by
the same Laws, and perform the like Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
as our Forefathers did? After such
<hi>Elogies</hi> of that <hi>Queens</hi> times, and such
acclamations after her, is it not a wonder
to see men act so Counter to her Laws and
Government? And is it not clear that the
Change is solely in our selves? That our
hearts are not frought with the like Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as theirs was, and that we do not govern
our selves by the same Principles of Duty
and honour as they did?</p>
            <p>For shame let every man lay his hand
upon his heart, and consult his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and be awakned to some degree of
temper and sobriety; for 'tis as clear as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104660:156"/>
the Sun at noon day, that the change is not
in the Constitution of the Government, but
in the Principles of our Loyalty and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the King and Church. For,</p>
            <p>Have we <hi>Popish Plots</hi> now among us?
So they had in the days of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
Are there <hi>attempts</hi> upon the <hi>life</hi>
of our dread Soveraign? So there were
likewise upon the life of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
Have we designes on foot to extinguish the
<hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, to <hi>Subvert</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and introduce the <hi>Popish</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and Usurpation over us? The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same things were in agitation in the
days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did the <hi>Queen</hi> and her <hi>Council</hi> therefore
bend all there force against those <hi>Popish</hi>

of the other Factions? No;<note n="*" place="margin">If the People in an Island are alarm'd that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion is design'd, and that only at one Port, and they become so foolish as for the guard of that, to neglect and expose all other, they do but make the easier way, for their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to land and overcome.</note> They know

<hi>Conforming</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> and

done without the least Provocation given

Where the Author rells us,</hi> That which
afforded them (<hi>the</hi> Dissenters <hi>of those
times</hi>) no little advantage, was that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
<hi>Gunpowder-Plot</hi> (in the <hi>3d. of King</hi>
James) being hatch'd by those fiery-Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
men of the <hi>Romish</hi> perswasion, whom
the bloody minded <hi>Jesuites</hi> had influenc'd
for that most wicked Practice. For, after
this, to terrifie the People with the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> their Sermons were little less
then Declamations against the <hi>Papist;</hi> aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby to represent them formidable &amp;
odious; insinuating to the World, that all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104660:157"/>
the fear of danger was from those of that
Religion; whilst <hi>they themselves,</hi> in the
mean time, did insensibly poyson the People
with such other unsound Doctrines, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
at length the Fountain of this late
unparallel'd <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which terminated
in the <hi>execrable Murther</hi> of our late Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
King: and would have put an end to
this famous and long flourishing <hi>Monarchy,</hi>
had not Allmighty God of his great Mercy
miraculously prevented it. <hi>And to shew
that this sort of men are</hi> not given to
change.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Author of the</hi> Seasonable address
to both Houses <hi>takes notice of the like</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<hi>of this present</hi> Plot,<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> We have
(<hi>saith he</hi>) been continually allarm'd with
Libels against the Government; at last a
discovery is made of a <hi>Popish</hi> contrivance,
sifted as far as possible by the King in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
and after (<hi>that</hi>) earnestly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to the Parliaments further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
This is pursued, but some
men laying hold on this, (<hi>occasion</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
to drive it on to further purposes; and
under pretence of defending the King's
Person, and expelling Popery, (<hi>to</hi>) set
up <hi>Presbytery</hi> and pull down the <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:104660:158"/>
That these <hi>Dissenters</hi> are of an humour
not to <hi>Vnite</hi> with the Church in the time
of Plots and troubles, but to improve the
advantage to carry on their own designes, by
making the breach wider; hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by <hi>Cambden</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Annals <hi>Engl.</hi> l. 3. p. 290.</note> in the Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and upon the very Juncture
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Invasion; <hi>For</hi> (saith the
Historian) <hi>Schismatical Impiety waxeth
allways insolent when any Wars be
stirring, nor ever did shameless or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Impudence, and outragious Malice
more insolently beard the</hi> Ecclesiastical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy;
(<hi>than at that time.</hi>)</p>
            <p>And this is our proof of the first Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
That these <hi>Dissenters,</hi> do improve
<hi>Popish Plots</hi> to their own <hi>ends,</hi> of unhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Government, to get the Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their own hands.</p>
            <p>2. That they do espouse and maintain
the same <hi>Principles</hi> with the <hi>Jesuites</hi> is no
less-evident. They deny the King's <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi>
and <hi>Headship</hi> (under Christ)
over the Church, or Churches within his
Dominions: They deny his Power of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
Councils and Church Assemblies, of
his <hi>presideing</hi> over them, <hi>Moderating,
Judging,</hi> and <hi>Determining</hi> in them; they
grant him no <hi>Legeslative</hi> Power in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>Ecclesiastical:</hi> They make him but a
<hi>Cypher</hi> as to the <hi>Constitution</hi> of their <hi>Rules</hi>
and <hi>Orders;</hi> and a Servant only, (to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104660:158"/>
themselves) in the <hi>Execution</hi> of what
they <hi>prescribe.</hi> To this purpose, and in
<hi>Confutation</hi> of their Doctrine, <hi>Oliver Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merod</hi>
of <hi>Emmanuel</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
wrote a Book, 1605. Intituled, <hi>The Pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
of a Puritan,</hi> to which he has annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Discovery of <hi>Puritan-Papisme.</hi> And
after him <hi>David Owen</hi> wrote another
(1610.) which he stiles, <hi>Herod and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Reconciled,</hi> or, <hi>The Concord of Papist
and Puritan,</hi> for the <hi>Coertion, Deposition,</hi>
and <hi>Killing</hi> of Kings. <hi>To the Dutiful
Subject,</hi> in his Epistle, he observes, that
<hi>The Puritan-Church-Policy,</hi> and the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitical
Society</hi> began together: The one
in <hi>Geneva,</hi> 1536. and the other in <hi>Rome,
1537.</hi> and the last Chapter of his Book,
contains, <hi>the General Consent of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi>
Puritans <hi>and</hi> Jesuites, <hi>against Kings,
from the year 1536. until the year, 1602.
out of the most Authentick Authors.</hi> I
shall refer the Reader to the Book it self;
which if it be out of Print, does very well
deserve a new Impression.</p>
            <p>3. My Third Proof of this <hi>Assertion</hi>
may be found in a late Book, being, <hi>A
short view of our late Troubles:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
any man (that desires a full and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
account of those affairs,) may please
to Consult the <hi>Parallel</hi> in the Second
Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:104660:159"/>
Lastly, We do affirm, That these <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi>
and such as so eagerly abet them,
doe carry on that very design, which
they pretend to abhor with so great a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
in the <hi>Jesuites.</hi> And in order to
the proof of this, let me take leave to
propound a question, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether to
abolish those Decent <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Customes,</hi>
which were generally in use in the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
and <hi>purest</hi> Ages of the Church, and
to grant a <hi>Toleration</hi> of all Religions; or,
to allow <hi>Conventicles</hi> for the free and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worship of <hi>Protestant-Dissenters</hi>
(as they will needs call themselves) be
not an Argument of great <hi>Levity,</hi> a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> a <hi>Scandal</hi> to
our <hi>own</hi> and <hi>forreign</hi> Churches, and a
means as well to betray our own professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as to gratify the Common Enemy,
by Complying with such Methods as they
have from time to time, contrived and
practised, for the Subversion of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> which through Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
hath been so happily <hi>Reform'd</hi>
and setled, and so long preserv'd and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd,
to the envy of some, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of others of our Neighbours?</p>
            <p>The Reason of this Quere is,</p>
            <p>1. Because it is the practice of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Party</hi> to promote <hi>Change</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi>
among us; and then to disparage
our Religion upon the account of <hi>Novelty.</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:104660:159"/>
And by that Argument many times they
prevail to make <hi>Proselites,</hi> and to
draw men from the Communion of our
Church.</p>
            <p>2. Because they have made it their
great business to purchase a <hi>Toleration;</hi>
and to this effect, they have used all the
Arts of <hi>Bribery</hi> and Crafty Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>3. Because it is a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> and
clearly evident, that their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
creep into <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
make use of such Meeting to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Nation.</p>
            <p>For all which we have sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and that solemnly deposed upon
the <hi>Corporal</hi> Oaths of the King's <hi>Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
            </p>

would very soon come into England;</hi>
and, upon his demanding a Reason for
it; he was pleased to give him these
two.</p>
            <p>1. That they did not doubt but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a Toleration of Religions, by
which they should bring it in without
noise.</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Gentry</hi> which went abroad
did observe the <hi>Novely</hi> of their own
Religion, and the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of <hi>theirs,</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104660:160"/>
the advantages that were to be had by
it.<note place="margin">Ib. pag. 32.</note>

            <p>A Second Witness is Mr. <hi>Jenison,</hi> who
deposeth thus, <hi>That</hi> Ireland <hi>and</hi> Jenison
<hi>did Declare, That for the Destruction of
the Protestant Religion</hi> (he means that
establisht in the Church of <hi>England) they
hop't to procure a</hi> Toleration; <hi>And the
way was</hi> (they said) <hi>by procuring a Sum
of Money to bribe the</hi> Parliament. But
suppose the Parliament will not be brib'd?
Why? It is the same thing in effect,
whether we be <hi>brib'd</hi> by <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jol'd</hi>
by <hi>Dissenters,</hi> who have imbib'd
their infusions; whether we take <hi>Money,</hi>
or be <hi>insnar'd</hi> by insinuation; if we deny
a <hi>Toleration,</hi> yet if we set open a <hi>Door</hi>
to <hi>Conventicles,</hi> we give them as fair an
opportunity to do their business, as if a
<hi>Toleration</hi> were granted.</p>

in the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> in
which was continued their plotting and
Contriving a Rebellion in <hi>Scotland</hi> of
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> against the <hi>Episcopal</hi>

had imploy'd one <hi>Mathew Wright</hi> and

to go and preach, under the notion of

them, they had now a fair opportunity
to vindicate their <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi>
and that it could be done by no other

the King was so addicted to his pleasure,

that he would, and could take but little

            <p>What then? Would they have us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with them against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the practices of the Jesuites? With
all our hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:104660:163"/>
But we must remember the Jesuites
have two Heads of Doctrine, both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to the Principles of Christianity,
wherein we utterly dissent from them. The
first in reference to God's Worship and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
the second in reference to the King,
his Crown and Government. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the whole: let them do so likewise;
else let them be lookt upon as <hi>Parcel-Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites;</hi>
for such they are, unless they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
not only such Doctrines as lead to
<hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry:</hi> but such also
as lead to <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion.</hi> Let
them say the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and let
them say the same (as the Apostle does,
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 4.) of every <hi>Adversary,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Deodati, <hi>Sclater. Dicson</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place.</note> that
resists the Lord's Annointed, that opposeth
and exalteth himself above <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>Potentates</hi> to whom the name of God is
attributed. In which sense, we doubt not
to say with St. <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 2. 18.</note> that <hi>even now are
there many Antichrists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let them renounce those <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitical</hi>
Principles, which were Condemn'd
for Treason in the <hi>Spencers</hi>

               </note> let them renounce,</p>
            <p>1. That damnable Doctrine, of taking
up Arms by the Kings <hi>Authority,</hi> to fight
against his <hi>Person.</hi> Which as is very well
observed by a worthy person, * was hatcht
under the <hi>Romish</hi> Territories, and made use
of in the <hi>Holy League</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:104660:164"/>
2. That we may seize the Kings <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,</hi>
stop his <hi>Customes,</hi> deny him all due
supplies to support and preserve the honour
and Peace of his Crown and Kingdoms, (as
they did in 42.) and bring him into neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
that we may reform his mind, and
gain our own ends of him <hi>Per Asperte,</hi> as
Lawyer's phrase it, that is, by rigour or
constreint.</p>
            <p>3. That if his Majesty will not repeal
Laws and take off the wheels of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and model it to our humour, we
may enter into <hi>Leagues</hi> and <hi>Associations</hi>
without his consent, and Govern <hi>in aid of
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>Jesuitical</hi> Doctrines, and we
desire they may joyn with us in a hearty
Renunciation of them. Let them also
protest, they will never attempt, what the
<hi>Jesuites</hi> are presumed to have plotted and
contrived, the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> the
<hi>Ruine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> with the <hi>Subversion</hi>
of the establisht <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi>
(For ther's little hopes of a hearty Union
till men come to so much ingenuity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
as to acknowledge how far they
have gon astray, and declare their Change
with a stedfast Resolution to return into
the right way.) Let them therefore <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
to the Laws establisht, and joyn with us
in the performance of God's <hi>Publick</hi> and
<hi>Solemn</hi> Worship. Let them <hi>Subscribe</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:104660:164"/>
and preach the <hi>Homilies</hi> against <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
and declare (as we do) in the midst of
their respective Congregations, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
<hi>Assent</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> to them. This
will secure the King's <hi>Person,</hi> the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
Religion, and the Government esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
And (whatever becomes of the
<hi>Protestants</hi> abroad for want of supplies to
enable the King to interpose on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half)
it will certainly <hi>Vnite</hi> us at home in
one Communion to the Emulation of our
Friends, the Terrour of our Enemies, and
our own lasting Peace and Happiness.
Which God grant we may be so wise as to
discern and establish.</p>
