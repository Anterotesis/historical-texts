            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat your Petitioners have faithfully ſerved your Honours with the expence of their deareſt blood and eſtates, from the very beginning of the late rroubles, in oppoſing the late King and his Party, and eſpecially Sir <hi>John Stowel,</hi> and his bloody Adherents, who was the firſt that drew blood from your friends in the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That your Petitioners, (beſides the plunder and loſſe of their eſtates, by the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi> and his Party,) have received ſuch woundes and maimes in their bodies, that they are diſabled to labour in their lawful Callings; And your Petitioner <hi>Caddy</hi> hath loſt three Sons in your ſervice, (who were as the ſtaffe of his age,) and himſelfe caſt into a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Goale at <hi>Ilcheſter,</hi> where he was fourteen moneths together laid in irons, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Command of Sir <hi>John Stowel,</hi> for no other cauſe but his faithfulneſſe to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And your Petitioner <hi>Ward</hi> for the ſame cauſe, had his Noſe and one of his fingers cut off, and one of his eyes cut out, with twenty ſix wounds at the ſame time, by Sir <hi>John Stowels</hi> own eruel hand, and that in cold blood, your ſaid Petitioner <hi>Ward</hi> being unarmed, and all this without any provocation from your Petitioners.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners are by this meanes utterly undone; and whereas heretofore they were (by the bleſſing of God,) able to relieve others, they are now like to periſh for want of food, with their Wives and Children.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners in Order to their relief, ſix yeares ſince brought their ſeveral Actions againſt Sir <hi>John Stowel,</hi> wherein they obtained Judgements, namely your Petitioner <hi>Caddy</hi> for 212 li. and your Petitioner <hi>Ward</hi> for 107 li. 10 s.</p>
            <p>That theſe judgements have been ſo farre from being a remedy, that they have proved a great increaſe of their miſery, in reſpect they can get no benefit thereby, and have ſpent as much money in their journeyes and attendance, as the ſaid judgements amount unto.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners, yet further to increaſe their miſery, have been lately ſummoned by Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi> from their countrey, (ſevenſcore miles from <hi>London,</hi>) to appear and anſwer his Petition before the Honourable Commiſſioners for Articles, in relation to their ſaid judgements, where he hath cauſed your Petitioners to attend for the ſpace of eight weeks laſt paſt, their Wives and Children like to ſtarve at home in the mean time, your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners no way able to relieve them; They petitioned the Honourable Commiſſioners for Articles, and are only permitted into their countrey, till further order of Summons from the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi> as may appear by the Copy of the ſaid Order hereunto annexed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Petitioners therefore in this their great extremity, do humbly addreſſe themſelves to your Honours, as their laſt Refuge; And do humbly beſeech you (amidſt your many weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,) ſo farre to caſt your gracious eye on this their ſad and juſt complaint, that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief may be afforded them by your means, that they with their poor Wives and Children may not utterly periſh, and be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
