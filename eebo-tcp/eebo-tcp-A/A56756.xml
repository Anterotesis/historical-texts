            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have a Friend at <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Son is
under your Care for the Cure of his
Melancholly: I am glad he is under
the Management of ſo Experienced a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.
I hear you have Blooded him ſeveral
times, and ſhaved his Head, and Bliſtered
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44429:3"/>
him, and given him many Purges, which I
believe are very proper: I beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
an Admirable Specifick in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
and that is the <hi>Banella's</hi> which come
to us from the <hi>Indies,</hi> a Tincture, Spirit and
Extract drawn out of them are of excellent
Uſe in this young Man's Caſe.</p>
            <p>They have been often tryed, and found
ſerviceable, when other Means and Methods
have failed: They wonderfully chear the
Heart, and relieve the Animal Spirits, when
oppreſs'd with Hypocondriacal Fumes from
the Spleen. They refine the Blood, and
clear the Brain, and diſperſe Melancholly
Winds and black Humours, which if let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
would end in diſtraction.</p>
            <p>A Miniſter about Fifty Years of Age, a
Grave, Serious and Devout Man, who fell
into profound Melancholly, occaſion'd by
hard Study and deep thoughts about the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
part of Scripture, relating unto the
future State of the Church. He could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
whole Nights wherein he had not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44429:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſlept, and whole Weeks wherein he had not
Dined: He had been let Blood ſeveral times
in the Jugular Veins with a Lancet, and in the
Hemorroide Veins with Leaches; his Head
ſhaved, and Anointed with Cephalick Oyls;
he had been Vomitted and Purged very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and taken Mineral Waters, but all in
vain; at length I gave him the <hi>Banella</hi> Mixture
in Whey for one Month, and he is perfectly
Recover'd, and Preaches very judiciouſly and
vigorouſly, to the great Satisfaction of his
Auditory.</p>
            <p>A young Gentlewoman who had a very
great Reſpect for a Perſon whom her Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had no good Opinion of, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to Diſoblige her Friends, and yet deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to comply with her own Inclinations,
ſhe fell into great Melancholly, and that
ſower'd her Blood, and cauſed Obſtructions,
and altered the whole Habit of the Body,
and brought her into a Conſumptive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Condition: Much Advice was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for her, and many Methods preſcribed
by Learned Phyſitians, at length ſhe was told
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44429:4"/>
of this Specifick Mixture, and took it
three Months together in Spaw-Waters, and
ſometimes in Purging Waters, and ſhe is now
in a good State of Health of Body, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
great Tranquility of Mind.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman of a tender Mind and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Diſpoſition, upon the Breach of a Vow
and Scruples of Conſcience, was attended
with great Melancholly, which at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
into a Maniacal Diſtemper of the
Brain, wherein the Spiritous Parts of the
Nervous Juice being debaſed, and the Saline
parts exalted, and brought to a Fluor, which
which being mixed with Sulpherous Particles,
derived from feculent Blood, at length produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
delirous Phantaſms and depraved Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
which perverted his Underſtanding,
and qualified him for <hi>Bedlam</hi> every Full
Moon; and indeed which made him the
more ſubject to Relapſes into his Diſtemper,
was its being ſomewhat Hereditary on the
Mothers ſide; yet notwithſtanding this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
returns, and great Rage and Diſorder
of the Animal Spirits, this Perſon was Cured
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44429:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the uſe of the Mixture, and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
cloathed in his right Mind, to the
Praiſe of the Omnipotent Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>An Ancient Gentlewoman, whoſe Husband
fell into a Decay in his Eſtate, was much
diſappointed thereby, and hereby her Mind
much diſturbed, which totter'd her Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
which at ſome certain times put
her upon very unſeemly extravagant Actions
and Diſcourſes, very diſagreeable unto her
former Pious ane Prudent Behaviour, to the
great Grief of her Children, and other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Much Adviſe was taken, and all to
no purpoſe; at length I reſolved to give
her the Specifick Mixture of the Spirit, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and Extract drawn out of the <hi>Banellas</hi>
Bean; for its ſhape it reſembles a <hi>French</hi>
Bean, and contains a Seed as that doth, and
was much uſed in Chocolate, but being dear,
is frequently left out of late, as the Makers
of it tell us. I gave this Gentlewoman Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Noon and Night 30 Drops of this Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at a time, ſhe took it in ſmall Beer ſix
Months, and thro' God's Mercy it brought
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44429:5"/>
her to the free Exerciſe of her Reaſon. I
could give many more Examples if it were
needfull.</p>
