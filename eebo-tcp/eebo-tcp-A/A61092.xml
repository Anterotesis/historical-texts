            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The piety, excellent learning and moderation of the Author, in all his expressions, will prevail much with those that are truly wise and sober, and if your protection shall concur to defend both them and my poor studies, I shall hope to give you farther account hereafter in other works of great moment.

Among all other his singular deserts and works, there is none more illustrious, then his piety towards God, testified both in his holy course of life, and especially by his learned and godly Treatises, of the <hi>Rights and Respect due to Churches.</hi> Wherein he hath so accuratly proved, what is due to God, and to be rendred unto him, both for the time of his worship, and also for the means and places, wherein his worship is to be performed, that no true Christian, who embraceth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, but must acknowledge willingly his singular deserts and piety: His great knowledge in the Common Law of our Kingdome, and all other Laws whatsoever, divine or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, ancient or modern, Civill or Canonicall,</p>

laws and authorities, after he had first founded and setled his opinion upon the divine Law of God. Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his piety, learning, and moderation in all his expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, there wanted not a perverse spirit to oppose and scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble something against him, whereof hee tooke notice, and added a censure in his learned work the Glossary; and also among other his papers of this argument, he hath left a sufficient apology and justification of his former Treatise, which, is here published for satisfaction to all that be truly pious and well-affected sons of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For his larger work of Tithes, which he prepared long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, it is also here added, though in some few places imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and might have been better polished by his own hand, if he had engaged himself upon it, and desisted from his greater works so much desired by many eminently learned both at home and abroad: yet rather then suffer the losse of such a testimony of his piety to God, and good affection to uphold the setled maintenance of Gods House and Ministers, to <hi>whom double honour is due,</hi> as the Apostle saith, it is<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> thought fit to publish it, as he left it, imperfect in some passages, and defective of such ornaments and arguments, as he could have added further, out of his store and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: though what he hath here delivered is so compleat, as doth fully discover the ability of his judgement; and that these reasons and illustrations produced by him could hardly have proceeded from any other. Author, being agreeable to his expressions, style, and arguments delivered in his other writings. And at this instant it seems very necessary, in regard the humour and displeasure of many in the world, is now obstinately bent to beat down, root up, overthrow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, whatsoever the piety and wisdome of our forefathers built and contributed in the Primitive times of their faith and conversion to Christianity, as if all they did, were Popish
<pb facs="tcp:62279:4"/>
and superstitious, fit to be rooted up: and as if themselves had a Commission as large as the great Prophet had from God, <hi>and were set over the Nations and Kingdomes, to root out, and pull down, to destroy and to throw down, to build and to plant,</hi> Jer. 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>But if men will rest satisfied, either with proof from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority, there wants not enough here to guide their consciences: or with humane Laws and Statutes confirmed, and fully enacted by many Parliaments, whereby they are now become ancient and fundamentall, as well as any other Laws, together with the constant course and practice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a thousand years in our Common-wealth, there wants not here the testimony of all our ancient Monuments, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, Deeds, and Charters of our Kingdome, Princes, and Noble men, which this learned Knight hath more fully and compleatly published in order of time, and in their originall Saxon-language, in his first Tome of our English Laws and Councels, for the first five hundred years before the Conquest, being his last work before his death. Whereunto when the second Tome (which he hath also finished) shall be added for the next 500. years after the Conquest, together with his learned Commentary upon all difficult and ancient rites and customes; there will be abundant proof from all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, and the authority of our Common Law, together with the practice of our Kingdome, in severall ages, that no man can raise a doubt or exception, that shall not receive satisfaction fully and clearly. As for the Laws of Israel, and the Heathens also in imitation of Gods own people, the Decrees and Canons of generall Councels, in succeeding times, here is also such abundant testimony produced, that no judicious Reader can refuse to yeeld his vote thereto, and approbation for continuance.</p>
                  <p>There is another noble and religious Knight of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

Sir <hi>James Sempil,</hi> who hath so accurately laboured in this argument, and proved the divine right of Tithes from the holy Scriptures, insisting thereupon onely, and no other humane Authorities, or Antiquities, further then he finds the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to play upon the Text, <hi>pro or contra, (as himself saith in his Preface)</hi> that much satisfaction may be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his pious endeavours; having therein cleared some Texts of Scripture from sinister interpretations, and exactly considered the first Institution and Laws for Tithes, delivered by God himself both in the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>If both these godly and learned witnesses of the truth will not serve the turn to convince the judgement of some ill-affected, they being both raised up by God out of both Nations, like to <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> among the people, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily<note place="margin">Numb. 11. 26.</note> to prophecy, and defend the truth, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and inspired doubtlesse by God himself, (besides those that belong to the Tabernacle) to uphold and maintain his own cause against the adversaries of his Church; yet they may well stop the mouths of worldlings and Mammonists from clamour and inveighing, and perswade them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce upon the known and fundamentall Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: which areas ancient and fundamentall as any other, or rather more, because they concern especially the upholding and maintenance of the worship of God, then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more necessary or fundamentall: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pious and good King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, doth begin his Laws with the recitall and confirmation of the Ecclesiasticall Lawes, and particularly of Tithes, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessions, and Liberties thereof: <hi>A legibus igitur sanctae<note place="margin">Ll ad confess. in Prooem.</note> matris Ecclesiae sumentes exordium, quoniam per eam Rex &amp; regnum solidum habent subsistendi fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, leges, libertates, &amp; pacem ipsius concionati sunt.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:62279:5"/>
Because thereby the King and Kingdome have their solid foundation for subsistence, therefore the laws, liberties, and peace thereof are first proclaimed and established.</p>
                  <p>And thus begins also <hi>Magna Charta,—Nos intuitu Dei, pro salute animae nostrae, ad exaltationem sanctae Ecclesiae, &amp;c.</hi> and so also many other Statutes successively, <hi>pour le common profit de Saint Esglise &amp; del Realm,<note place="margin">Westminst. 1.</note> &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>God did foretell and promise by the Prophet Esay, cap. 49. 23. that he would raise up in the Church of the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, Kings and Queens to be nursing fathers, and nursing mothers to his Church; that is, saith <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the Text, <hi>Magni Reges ac principes non solùm Christi jugum subierunt, sed etiam facultates suas contulerunt, ad erigendam &amp; fovendam Christi Ecclesiam, ita ut se patronos &amp; tutores ejus praestarent.</hi> Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should give much Lands, Revenues, and great mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the worship of God, and his Ministers, attending thereon, which promise God abundantly performed by many

                     <hi>Selden</hi> in his History. Now when Churches are built, and grants of lands, tithes, and oblations are freely given by great Kings, confirmed by severall Acts of Parliament, oftentimes renued and reiterated, as by the great Charter thirty times confirmed, and many other Statutes since, as also by the Text and body of the Common Law, which doth affirm Tithes to be due <hi>Jure divino:</hi> as is asserted by that ever honourable Judge and Oracle of Law, the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in the second part of his Reports, <hi>Dismes sont choses spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituels,<note place="margin">L'Evesque de winchester case, fol. 45.</note> &amp; due, de jure divino.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being thus setled and confirmed, and thereby becomming fundamentall Laws of the Kingdome, they may, and ought to be enjoyed peaceably, without grudging, or repining, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation or spoil, without casting an evill eye upon Gods allowance, and <hi>because he hath given the floure of wheat to make bread for his Sanctuary:</hi> whereof God himself giveth charge in the last vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> contained in<note place="margin">Ezek. 45, &amp;c.</note> the last four chapters, where he appointeth a third part of the land to be set forth for his Temple, Priests, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, besides the portions for the Prince, and for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which vision for performance concerneth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, and was never fulfilled in the Jewish State, as this Author and many others doe shew: and there God doth especially forbid alienation, selling or exchanging of his Temples portion, as being most holy unto the Lord, <hi>Ezek. 48. 14.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It concerns us therefore that live in these times of the Christian Church, when we see the ancient prophesie fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Kings and Princes, in giving much to the Church, to preserve Gods portion entire without alienation, spoil, or violence. The Primitive times of the Church, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour sheweth, ch. 6. as had not been since the very Creation: times wherein God opened the windows of persecution, and
<pb facs="tcp:62279:7"/>
rained bloud upon his Church, as hee did water upon the world in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> during the ten grievous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions in the first 300. years after Christ, so that no man must expect then to finde setled Lawes for Tithes, Lands, or maintenance of the Clergy, when the Emperors and Magistrates were Heathens persecuting the Church, and made many furious edicts for rasing and ruinating of Churches, which had been built by Christians in some times of intermission, as appears by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> when hee comes to the times of <hi>Dioclesian.</hi> Every good Christian, and almost every Clergy-man, lost his life for religion; no man did care or expect for preferment, maintenance, or dignity, save onely the crown of martyrdome, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands did obtain: <hi>The Church, saith this Author,<note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> did all that while expose the dugs of her piety unto others, but did live her self on thistles and thorns, in great want oftentimes, necessity, and professed pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Now those men that would reform all according to the pattern of the Primitive Church, and the Apostolicall times, do not consider, that the Clergy must be reduced again to the same condition of poverty, want, and misery, as formerly they were, if the pious and charitable gifts, and donations of Kings and Nobles, in the ages next succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the persecutions, should be taken away, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient patrimony of Tithes abated, or subverted by the worldly and covetous practices of them that esteem gaine to be godlinesse. The kytes of Satan (as this Author tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them) have already pulled away many a plume from the Church in severall ages, yet thanks be to God, there be some feathers left to keep her from shame and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if the sacrilegious humour of the times prevail not against her. And there is the more reason to hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that we may enjoy our portion and tithes quietly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:62279:7"/>
we have so much lesse then the old Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites received from the people: for they had severall tithes and oblations for themselves, for the feasts and for the poor, wherein they did share in a far greater proportion then is now required by the Clergy of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>The learned <hi>Scaliger, Selden,</hi> and many others do prove apparently by instance of particulars, that the Israelites did pay out of their increase of corn much more then a tenth, even almost a fifth part for severall tithes and duties then commanded to them.

Laws divine and humane, it must be the actions and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Saviour Christ himself, who plainly discovered his zeal against sacriledge and prophaning of holy things and places, more then against any other sin. For when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to execute his Propheticall office, and reproved all kind of sins among the people, yet he preceeded to punish not any save onely sacriledge, which is very remarkable. He refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be Judge in dividing the inheritance between the two brethren, and he would give no sentence against the woman taken in adultery: but in case of sacriledge himself made the whip, himself punisheth the offenders, himself over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the mony tables, and driveth out the prophaners out of the Temple, with their sheep and their oxen, not suffering the innocent doves to remain, though all these were for sacrifice, and but in the outward Court-yard of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> such was his zeal as himself refused not to be the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, the Judge, and the executioner; and this not only once but twice, at the first in the beginning of his Ministery, recited by S. <hi>John, c. 2. 14.</hi> and at the last neer the conclusion thereof, Mat. 21. 11. <hi>Jesus quàm ad sacra emendanda bis conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuo signo testatum hoc fecit, templum velut sacrorum sedem purgando circa initium, &amp; circa clausulam sui muneris, ut in quo inceperat in eo se desinere ostenderet.</hi> Grotius in Johan. 2. 14.

of sight to him that was born blind; that the voice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was heard at <hi>Jordan;</hi> or that at his transfiguration in the Mount he shewed forth his glory: but I rather think, the greatest wonder that ever Christ did, was, that he being but one single man, and all that time in a contemptible conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so vile, that shortly after they crucified him, should be able with a whip to drive out of the Temple such a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men, officers, buyers and sellers, and overthrow their tables, seats, and receipts, (the Scribes also beholding it, and seeing their own profit to be overthrown thereby) and doe such a strange thing, as a whole Army of men could not have done it at another time. But his principal end being to cleanse and purge his Temple and House of Prayer, from prophanation, sacriledge, and abuses, it plainly sheweth us, how odious a sin it is, to be guilty of the like abuses: and what punishment men must expect in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time to follow upon the like offence, though now he doth forbear such miraculous proceedings in these latter days; when we are directed to search the Scriptures so plainly published to us, and to take admonition from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer examples, which are recorded for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
                  <p>Some are of opinion lately, that so the Clergy may have a competent maintenance, whether it be by stipend, or any way else, it is sufficient provision for them: and because divers have published their opinion this way, here shall be something in answer to them.

But the uncertainty of stipends, collections, or payments in money is so great, as would in processe of time bring ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great losses and inconveniences, both upon the people in payments, and upon the Clergy; for the change and variations of the standard for money is so great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain in all ages, (as this learned Author sheweth in his Glossary <hi>in voce, Esterlingus &amp; Libra</hi>——) that if an hundred pound according to these times, should be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a stipend to a Minister yearly, it may be as much in value as 300 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb facs="tcp:62279:12"/>Besides the impossibility to provide a sure and setled means in every Parish to pay a certain stipend in money quarterly to the Minister, there can be no caution, provision, or security given or established for payment of money; for wee see by daily experience that all bonds, conveyances, and securities doe fail often, whatsoever the devise bee for secure payment. No way is comparable to Gods own way of giving year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the tenth part in kinde, of every increasing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medity, and all lawfull profits, as they arise and grow due at severall seasons of the year. As for stipends and pensions, because they have been lately invented in some forain Churches, in times of war, great troubles and distractions; I will mention only one mischief, which is already published in print; and that is, that the best learned are oftentimes neglected, and put to hard shifts, as in the Low-Countries <hi>John Drusius</hi> lately a very painfull and learned man, well known for his singular works: He complains in an Epistle to <hi>Joseph Scaliger</hi> before his Commentary on the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that hee was in want of things necessary; and elsewhere prayeth unto God to stir up the hearts of the great ones to help him: May heaven and earth take notice (saith one thereof) how miserable the condition of the learned is, when tithes the fixed honourary of the Priesthood by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right, are usurped by the Laicks, and reward is measured not by true worth, or by the measure of the Sanctuary, which was full, running over and double to the common and prophane measures; but by the ignorant estimate of niggardly Mechanicks and their underagents. Many more such complaints might be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged out of <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Calvin,</hi> and others, which I will now forbear: one great reason be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:62279:13"/>
that their Churches for most part are still under great persecution, miserable wars, pitifully wasted, being never almost quietly composed, nor setled by Kings and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ours hath been; for the Emperour and many great Kings and Princes continue Papists, and great adversaries to Reformation: whereby <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> have most sharply suffered, and lost many thousand Churches and Ministers, since the the blazing Comet 1618. the people being relapsed and inforced to Popery for want of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: which makes the reverend and learned <hi>Deodatus,</hi> Professor at <hi>Geneva,</hi> magnifie the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the most eminent of all the reformed Churches in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome styling it, <hi>Florentissima Anglia, Ocellus ille Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiarum, peculium Christi singulare, perfugium affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum, imbellium Armamentarium, inopum prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuarium, spei melioris vexillum,—splendidae Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni caulae,</hi>—and much more he addeth, speaking of our condition before these troubles.</p>

                     <hi>Ellen Goulston</hi> Relict of <hi>Theodore Goulston</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Physick, a very learned man, being possessed of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Parsonage of <hi>Bardwell</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> did first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the King leave to annexe the same to the Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and to make it presentative, and having formerly the donation of the Vicarage, she gave them both thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed freely to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon:</hi> expressing many godly reasons in a pious letter of her grant, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb facs="tcp:62279:14"/>
the glory of God to her power, and give the world some testimony, that she had not been a fruitlesse observer of those who taught her that knowledge, without its fruit, and that love of Christ, without love to his Church was but an empty mask of an empty faith.</p>
                  <p>Thus with devout prayers for a blessing from God upon those which should be chosen Rectors there, she commended the deeds and conveyances of the Parsenage for ever to the Colledge. And this way doth justly seem the best manner of restitution, it being a double benefit to the Church both in providing carefully for the Parish, and selecting out of the Vniversities able and worthy Divines in due time and manner without any corruption, which the Colledges are carefull to avoid; and therefore that course was followed by Sir <hi>Ralph Hare</hi> already mentioned, by the prudent advise of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman:</hi> which course if it had been observed by them who lately were imployed in purchasing of Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations, they had freed themselves from sinister suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by devesting themselves wholly of any profits reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to their disposing, and might have much advanced the glory of God by diligent preaching, within the campasse of few years: and many would have been perswaded easily to become contributers and benefactors to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>Divers Colledges in <hi>Oxon:</hi> having been anciently pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of Impropriations, have of late years taken a course to reserve a good portion of the tithe corn, from their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, thereby to increase the Vicars maintenance: so that the best learned Divines are willing to accept the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and yet the Colledge is not diminished in rents, but loseth onely some part of their fine, when the tenants come to renue their Leases.</p>
                  <p>Certain Bishops also have done the like; as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Morton,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:62279:15"/>
whiles he was Bishop of <hi>Lichfield</hi> did abate a good part of his fine to encrease the portion of the Minister in the Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Pitchley</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> belonging to his Bishoprick: and so did his successor D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Wright,</hi> for the Vicarage of <hi>Torcester</hi> also in the same shire: which was very piously done, considering what great Lands and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were taken away from that Bishoprick among others, and some Impropriations given in lieu of them.</p>
                  <p>Besides, this present Parliament hath taken singular care to augment the maintenance of many poor Vicarages, and other small Livings: wherein they have proceeded carefully, and have made many additions to severall poor benefices, for the better inabling of the incumbent Ministers to be faithfull and diligent in their callings.</p>
                  <p>And while Sir <hi>Hen. Sp.</hi> lived, there came some unto him almost every Terme at <hi>London</hi> to consult with him, how they might legally restore and dispose of their Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations to the benefit of the Church: to whom he gave advice, as he was best able, according to their particular cases and inquiries, and there wanted not others, that than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him for his book, promising that they would never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase any such appropriate Parsonages to augment their estates. Whereby it appears how effectually the consciences of many men were moved with his moderate and pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions: and himself was much confirmed in his opinion of the right of Tithes, which moved him to consign his works of this argument, besides others, to my care, with direction to publish them, as is also expressed in his last Will and Testament.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon I hold my self obliged in conscience and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, and to the memory of this excellent Knight, to whom I was infinitely obliged for his instructions, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and favours, which I enjoyed in the course of my
<pb facs="tcp:62279:15"/>
studies, many years frequenting his house and company: not to conceal these works any longer from the publique view, but to publish them to the benefit of the Church, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, now especially when prophanenesse hath so licentiously overflowed, and the covetous wretches and Mammonists of this world, have begun to withdraw and deny their Tithes, muttering that they are Popish and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious, and therfore to be rooted out, as their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is: wherein yet the Parliament hath honourably discovered their zeal and care by their censure and check upon the Petition against Tithes exhibited in <hi>May 1646.</hi> and by their Ordinance providing for the true payment of all tithes, rights, and dues to the Church, as more fully appears therein.</p>
                  <p>Wherein they have followed the moderne and ancient Lawes, as that expression of the Act of Parliament, <hi>27 Hen. 8. cap. 20. That whereas numbers of ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed persons, having no respect of their duty to Almighty God, but against right and good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did withhold their Tithes due to God, and holy Church:</hi> as in that Statute is more at large expressed. So in the 12. Tables, <hi>Sacrum sacrove commendatum qui dempserit rapseritve, parricida esto.</hi> It being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sacriledge by all Laws to take away such things as have been formerly given to God: for so they were given expresly to God: as <hi>Magna Charta</hi> saith: <hi>Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Deo</hi>—we have given to God, for us and our heirs, &amp;c. So <hi>Charles</hi> the great: <hi>We know that the goods of the Church are the sacred indowments of God. To the Lord our God we offer and dedicate whatsoever wee deliver to his Church.</hi> Cap. Car. lib. 6. So <hi>Tully</hi> anciently: <hi>Communi jure gentium</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:62279:16"/>
                     <hi>sancitum est ut ne mortales, quod Deorum immortalium cultui consecratum est usucapere possint. So Calvin, Sacrum Deo non sine insigni in eum injuria ad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanos usus applicatur.</hi> Instit. li. 3. cap. 7. § 1.</p>
                  <p>Tithes therefore being consecrated unto God, ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be preserved in these days, in regard the Church enjoyeth not the tithe of the tenth, which formerly it had, and hath also to this day among the Papists, who doe not take away from the Church, but are ready to restore, as they have done in many Countries.</p>

                  <p>It is a rule in Philosophy, that <hi>Beneficium requirit officium.</hi> And we are taught by the law of nature, that he which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth a benefit oweth to his benefactor, Honour, Faith, and Service, according to the proportion of the benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Vpon this rule was the ancient law not onely of England, but of other Nations also, grounded, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled every man that had Lands, or tenements of the gift of another to hold them of his Donor, and to doe him feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:62279:20"/>
and service for them, (that is, to faithfull unto him, and to yeeld him some kind of vassallage) though no such matter were once mentioned betweene them; Yea at this day, if the King give Lands to any man without expressing a tenure, the Donee shall not only hold them of him, but he shall hold them by the greatest and heaviest service, viz. Knights service <hi>in Capite.</hi> But God knowing the heart of man, and seeing that man was like those husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Gospell, which having the possession of the Vineyard, forgot their Lord of whom they received it; he thought not fit in wisdome to leave the rights and servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces due unto him in respect of this his seignory and dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the mutable construction of Law and Reason: but hath expresly declared in his written word in what sort man shall enjoy and hold these his infinite benefits. Therefore since our owne reason hath taught us, that we owe no lesse unto our earthly benefactors then <hi>Homage, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi> &amp; some honorary and <hi>subsidiary rent</hi> for the Lands and tenements we receive of them; much more effectually must the same reason teach us, that we owe a farre larger proportion of all these unto God, of whom besides our essence and creation we have received such innumerable blessings.</p>

This<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be short, is the sum of all religion. Therefore whilst <hi>David</hi> with admirable strains of divine meditations flieth through the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of all the glorious works of God, and of our duty
<pb facs="tcp:62279:20"/>
to him in respect thereof, he breaketh out in every passage of his Psalmes with variety of acclamations and invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to stirre us up to glorify God, not only inwardly by the spirit, but outwardly also, in, and by, and with all worldly things and meanes whatsoever. And not knowing how or where to containe himselfe in this his passion of most blessed zeale, he runneth at last, as he were wild with it, and closeth up his Psalter, with Psalme upon Psalme, six or seven together, one upon the neck of another, onely to quicken and inforce our sluggish disposition to a worke of so great consequence and necessity.</p>
                  <p>It almost carrieth me from my purpose; but to returne to my selfe, let us see in what way we must glorify God with these externall things that we have thus received from him, and that is, as before we have shewed, in the same steppes that the rules and maximes of his owne law have prescribed. viz.</p>
                  <p>First, that we shall doe unto him <hi>Homage,</hi> that is, true<note place="margin">1.</note> and faithfull service. For it is written; <hi>Him onely shalt thou serve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we shall be faithfull unto him, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth<note place="margin">2.</note> true tenents, that is, not to adhere to his enemies, the world, the flesh, and the devill, as conspiring with them, or suffering them to subtract, or encroach upon any part of that, which belongeth to God our Lord para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that we shall pay duely unto him, all rights, and<note place="margin">3.</note> duties, that belong unto his Seignory: for it is written, <hi>Give unto God that that is Gods.</hi> And againe; <hi>Give the Lord the honour due unto his name, &amp;c. Psal.</hi> 29. 1.</p>
                  <p>For all which we must be accomptants at the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: and there lies a speciall writ of <hi>Praecipe</hi> in that case; <hi>Redde rationem villicationis tuae,</hi> Give an accompt how
<pb facs="tcp:62279:21"/>
thou hast carried thy selfe in this thy businesse, that is, this his service committed to thee.</p>
                  <p>But omitting to handle the first and second of these great Reservations, I have undertaken the last, viz. <hi>de reddendis Dei Deo,</hi> of ren dring that unto God that is Gods. And in this I humbly beseech his blessed hand to be with me, and guide me, for whose onely sake and honour I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to leave the shore I crept by in my former booke, and now as with full sailes to launch forth into the deepe, upon so dangerous and uncertaine adventure.</p>

                     <p>THat that is to be rendred unto God for his honour, out of temporall things granted by him unto man, are by his word declared to be some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar portions of the same things.</p>
                     <p>The things granted unto man be of three sorts, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, the place allotted to him for his habitation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the benefits and blessings assigned to him for his sustenance. Out of every of these, God must have his honorary part, as by way of reservation and retribution, in right of his seignory. Let us then see what those parts are, and how they grow due unto him.</p>
                     <p>Touching the first, which is the Time of our life: he hath out thereof reserved to himselfe, the seaventh part; for it is written, <hi>six dayes shalt thou labour, and doe all that thou hast to doe, but the seaventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi> What other time soever we imploy privately and particularly in his worship, this must generally be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and kept both by our selves and our very cattle, for if <hi>every creature groane with us, Rom.</hi> 8. 22. it is also just, that they rejoyce with us sometime. But though God be much wronged in this kind, as well as in other his rights, yet since it is confessed of all parts to be due unto him, by the expresse Canon of his word, I will not medle with it any farther: only I desire that the abusing of it were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punished, or at least in such sort as the Lawes have appointed.</p>

                        <hi>CAP. II.</hi> The second kind of tribute that we are to render unto God, <hi>i.</hi> a portion of our Land.</head>
                     <p>THe second thing that God hath given unto man is a place for his residence, and that is the earth in generall, and to every nation and family a part thereof in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>The earth hath he given to the children of men: Psal.</hi> 115. 16. But as he reserved a portion of the time of our life for the celebration of his honour, so hath he also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a portion out of the place of our residence. For in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. he commandeth the children of Israel, and in them all the nations of the world, that when they come to inhabite the land he giveth them, they must divide it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts, one for the people, another for the King, but the first for God himselfe. God must have <hi>Enetiam partem,</hi> as the Lawyers terme it, the part of the eldest, or first borne; for the tribe of the <hi>Levi</hi> (that is, his Priests and Ministers) are called to be the first borne of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>Therefore he saith, <hi>When ye shall divide the Land for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> ye <hi>shall offer an oblation to the Lord, an holy portion of the Land. Ezek.</hi> 45. And by and by he declareth how it shall be imployed, one part to the building of the house of God, and the other part for the Priests and Ministers to dwell on. And this is no Leviticall precept, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Law of nature; and in performance of the duty that he was tyed unto by this Law, <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was poore, and had not wherewithall to build God an house, yet he sanctified a portion of ground, (when God had blessed him) to that purpose, by erecting a stone and pouring oyle on the head thereof, calling the place <hi>Bethel,</hi>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62279:22"/>
that is, the house of God, and vowing to build it, when God should blesse and make him able to doe it: <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 22. which as <hi>Josephus</hi> testifieth, <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. he afterwards performed. And as God commanded the whole Nation of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in generall, that in laying out the chiefe City, they should first assigne a place unto God for his Temple &amp; Priests: So likewise he commanded every Tribe thereof in particular, that after they had their portion in the division of the Land, they should likewise out of the same assigne unto the Levites Cities to dwell in, with a circuite, or suburbs of a thousand cubits round about to keepe their cattell in. <hi>Command the children of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions Cities to dwell in: yee shall also give unto the Levites the suburbs of the Cities round about: so they shall have the Cities to dwell in, and the suburbs shall be for their cattell, and for their substance, and for their beasts: And the suburbs of the City, which ye shall give unto the Levites from the wall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shall be a thousand cubits round about.</hi> Numb. 35. 2, 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>In execution of this Commandement every Tribe of Israel allotted certaine Cities to the Levites, out of their portion, according to the quantity thereof: as appeareth, <hi>Jos.</hi> 21. 41. The whole Land of promise according as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierom</hi> layeth it out in his Epistle to <hi>Dardanus, Tom.</hi> 3. 68. containeth in length from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Bersabe</hi> scarce 160. miles, and in breadth from <hi>Joppa</hi> to <hi>Bethlem</hi> 46. miles. A small portion of ground for a Kingdome so famous; and so small indeed, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierom</hi> there saith, that he is ashamed to tell the breadth of it, lest it should give occasion to the heathen to blaspheme, or deride it: yet out of this small territory (not so much as the principality of Wales with the Marches) fourty eight walled Cities (more then are in all England, as I take it) were assigned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62279:23"/>
onely for their Clergy to dwell upon: their maintenance, and revenues being otherwise provided generally through the whole Kingdome by Tithes, oblations, and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions of their brethren. So that it is apparent both by the Law of God, and Nature, that God must have one por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lands to build him an house on, that is, his Churches, and another portion thereof for the habitation of his Levites, that is, his Ministers.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>CAP. III.</hi> That the portion of Land assigned to God must be sufficient for the habitation of the Minister.</head>
                     <p>THough the portion of Land, thus to be rendred to God for his Ministers, be not certaine, yet is it thus farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that it must be answerable to the necessity of the service, and to the number of the Levites; that is, there must be Churches sufficient for the congregations; and habitations sufficient for the Ministers and their families to dwell upon, with pasture convenient for their dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall cattell. They must not be pulled from God with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care, and therefore their maintenance is appointed to arise by other meanes then by tilling the Earth; but their habitation as befitteth students, and men of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative life must be under their owne command, and solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But what, should the portion of the fruites of the earth assigned them for their maintenance be certaine, as namely the tenth part; and not the portion of Land also al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for their habitation? I answer, that as the people encrease, so also the fruite of the earth encreaseth with them, by their industry and labour; and therefore as the Levites encrease in number, so doe the rest of the Tribes; and by reason thereof there is a greater encrease of Tithe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62279:23"/>
toward the maintenance of the Levite: for the labour of ten men yeeldeth more profit then the labour of five. But when the Levites were inclosed within walls, and confined with immutable bounds, this circuite in reason could not alwaies be sufficient for them; And therefore being so increased as their Cities might not containe them, they must of necessity have new places of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provided for them. For in such cases God gave a generall rule to the people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 19. <hi>Beware that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest in the Land.</hi> And the people of the Jewes in this necessity did not forsake the Levites, for before the transmigration to <hi>Babylon,</hi> (which was about 840. yeares after) the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Cities (as appeareth, 1 <hi>Chron. cap.</hi> 6. and <hi>cap.</hi> 9. 1. were growne to be about sixty eight, <hi>viz.</hi> twenty more then were appointed by <hi>Josua.</hi> They might not enlarge the bounds prescribed to their Cities, but they might encrease the number of the Cities, as the number of the Levites encreased, and necessity required. The reason is, they might not adde house to house, and field to field, lest growing great in earthly possessions they should forget God, who had otherwise provided for them, then by manuring the earth; but if they wanted ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, they might then seeke for new Cities, and the care of the people was to provide them for them. One Levite might not have more then sufficient for his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but if the Cities appointed were not sufficient to yeeld an habitation for every Levite, then might they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe new Cities to that purpose.</p>

                        <hi>CAP. IV.</hi> That Christ released not the portion due to God out of our Lands.</head>
                     <p>THe possession of Lands is <hi>ex jure humano,</hi> but the earth is the Lords <hi>ex jure divino.</hi> Therefore when he granted the earth to the children of men, and reserved a portion thereof for his service and Ministers, this part thus reserved is in him and his Ministers <hi>ex jure divino.</hi> In this right Christ calleth the Temple the house of God, and saith also, <hi>My house shall be an house of prayer.</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>Despise ye the house of God?</hi> So that,<note place="margin">1 Crr. 11. 22.</note> doubtlesse, God must have houses for his service in all places where we inhabite. But Christ had not <hi>whereon to lay his head, Mat.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 18. therefore the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters must have no houses provided for them: for the disciple is not above his master. Christ indeed had not whereon to lay his head: for he came to his owne, and his owne received him not. But doth this prove that Ministers should neither have nests in the ayre like birds, nor holes in the ground like foxes? Did not he that made the Vineyard in the Gospell, build a tower in it for them that dressed it? So likewise must the Ministers that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Vineyard of the Church, have their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in it. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> appointed it so, when he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to render a portion unto them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, <hi>of all the good things, Gal.</hi> 5. 6. How have they a part in all, if they want it, in the chiefest of all, that is, in our habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? Againe he commandeth that they should be <hi>Hospitales,</hi> Goodhouskeepers; how should they be so, if they have no houses to keep? <hi>John Baptist</hi> lived in the wildernesse; it is true, and he was commended for it.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62279:24"/>
Christ did not so, though he frequented the fields, yet in that he gave no Commandement that his disciples should follow him; for he appointed them to remaine in other mens houses. What? that they should goe so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journe where they listed? The Commandement hath nothing to the contrary; but the meaning is thereby apparent, they must have habitations provided for them, or else, <hi>shake off the dust of your feet against them, Mat.</hi> 10. 14. as much as to say, <hi>let</hi> them be accursed. So then our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath not repealed the Law of providing for the Levites, unto his Ministers: He could not give them Cities to possesse, for his kingdome was not of this world. But he appointed them to such places, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should choose among the children of the Gospell. Doeth this differ from the Commandement of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Cities for the Levites? Doubtles, no: for as the Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians say, <hi>Conveniunt in eodemtertio.</hi> They agree in this, that the Ministers must have habitations provided for them, as well in the Gospell, as the Levites had under the Law. Oh, but they must have no inheritance among their brethren, <hi>for the Lord is their portion. Numb.</hi> 18. 24. It is true, the Lord hath communicated with them his owne portion, <hi>viz.</hi> his tithes and his offerings, as he did with the Levites; therefore as the Levites had no share in the division of the Land, so our Ministers must have no share with us in tilling the Land, &amp; matters of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, for they are called from secular cares to spirituall contemplation; but after the Israelites had their shares in the Land they yeelded portions to the Levites for their convenient residence, and so must wee for our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. And so still the conclusion is, they must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for. Which, to shut up the matter, is invincibly ratified by our Saviour himselfe, who in sending forth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62279:25"/>
his disciples would not suffer them to take the least im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of sustenance with them, because he would put them absolutely upon the care and charge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, alledging a Maxime of the morall Law for warranty thereof, that <hi>the labourer is worthy of his hire.</hi> Mat. 10. 10. <hi>And therefore into whose house soever yow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, stay there.</hi> Mat. 10. 11.</p>

                     <p>It being agreed that some part by the Law of Nature is due unto God out of all the time of our life, and the goods that we possesse, it is now to be examined how far this Law of nature or reason may lead us to the discovery of that part or portion. For which purpose we must for a while lay aside Canonicall Divinity, I mean the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and suppose our selves to live in the ages before the Law was given, that is, in the time of nature. And then let us propose this question to the Sages of that world, and see what answer we are like to receive from them. And first touching this question, What portion of our time or goods were sittest for God.</p>
                     <p>It is like they would have considered the matter in this manner. That God hath not any need either of our time, or goods, and that therefore he requireth them not <hi>in tanto,</hi> that is, to have so much, and no lesse. But on our parts it is our duty to yeeld unto him as much <hi>in quanto</hi> as we can conveniently for beare over and besides our necessary maintenance. So that as <hi>Bracton</hi> saith of <hi>Hyde,</hi> that tenants are to yeeld unto their Lords, it must be <hi>honorarium Domino,</hi> and not <hi>grave tenenti,</hi> so much as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62279:25"/>
the Lord may be honoured by it, and the tenant not oppressed; wherein if a second, third, or fourth part be too much, so a twentieth or thirtieth seem also too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. As God therefore desireth but an honourary part, not a pressory: so reason should direct us to give him that part, wherein his own nature with the respects aforesaid is most properly expressed; for the maxime, or axiome which our Saviour alledged, <hi>Date Deo quae Dei sunt,</hi> give unto God the things that are Gods, is grounded on the Morall law originally; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examining among numbers which of them are most proper, and resembling the nature of God, we shall finde that <hi>seven</hi> and <hi>ten</hi> above all other perform this mystery, and that therefore they are most especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be chosen thereunto; therefore God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world following the light of nature, chused the seventh part of the age thereof, as <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> in his Book <hi>De fabricatione mundi, pag.</hi> 36. hath with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and profound observations declared.</p>
                     <p>And because it may be demanded hereupon, why he should not by the same reason have the seventh part of our goods also; I answer, that as touching the time of our life, he giveth that unto us of his own bounty, meerly without any industry on our part: so that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we sleep, or wake, labour, or play, the allowance thereof that he maketh unto us, runneth on of its own accord; and therefore we owe him the greater retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out thereof, as having it without labour or charge. But as for the fruits of the earth we have them partly by our own labour, though chiefly by his bounty; and therefore he therein requireth his part, as it were with deduction or allowance of our charges, seeking another number be fitting the same.</p>

                        <hi>CAP. VI.</hi> Concerning the Revenue and maintenance of the Church in her infancy, first in Christs time, then in the Apostles, by a communion of all things, and submitting all to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; as in the Churches of <hi>Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> How the Clergy had their allowance given them, weekly, or monethly, <hi>per sportulas,</hi> in bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. <hi>De jure sportularum,</hi> concerning those baskets and the manner of them.

The piety and charity of the Clergy in spending their goods and means.</head>
                     <p>VVHilest the Church was in her foundation, shee had no other maintenance, then the poor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate purse of our Saviour, supported onely by the almes and contribution of his poor Disciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; for as himself had no house to live in, so had<note place="margin">Joh. 12. 6.</note> he no rents to live on: being therefore often in want, he was constrained sometimes to use the power of his Godhead to supply the necessities of his Manhood, and to call the fish of the sea to aid him with money mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 27. while the beasts of the Land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held their devotion from him unnaturally; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it was that his Godhead blessed his Manhood withall, he divided it, as appeareth in the Gospel of Saint <hi>John,</hi> 13. 29. into two parts; one for the suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his family, the other for relief of the poor. Touching the part assigned to his family, it was not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, nor superfluous, no not at the great feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> when others were so sumptuous, and profuse, his rule
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62279:27"/>
was then, to buy the things they had need of. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the provision of his house at other times, we have twice an Inventory taken of it, once in <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 17. where it was found to be but five loaves and two fishes; yea, barly loaves: another time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 34. but seven<note place="margin">Mar. 6. 38. Luk. 9. 13. Joh. 6. 9.</note> loaves and a few little fishes, for himself and his whole houshold; twelve Apostles in ordinary, besides some servants, and a multitude of Disciples hanging upon him extraordinarily. All the beasts of the forest were his, and so were the cattell upon a thousand hils, yet read we not that he once killed so much as a Calfe, for the provision of his family: for flesh could not be had but for money, and money going always low with him, he used such kinde of victuals especially, as might always be supplyed unto him by the industry of his Disciples from the common storehouse of nature, the sea, without being beholding or burdensome to any man.</p>
                     <p>In this frugality lived our Saviour touching his houshold expence, that there might be the greater rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net for the poor: and from this modell of the Church in his poor family, was the great frame of the Universall Church first devised, as well for raising, as disposing of her Revenues; the means of raising them, from the oblations and devotion of the people: the manner of employment of them, for the necessity onely of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and poor.

Their alms and part assigned to them in necessity, they dispersed fully and faithfully, not onely to the poor of their own Town, City, or Countrey, but wheresoever through the world the members of Christ had need.</p>
                     <p>And so carefull they were in employing these things to the highest benefit and honour of the church, that <hi>Paul</hi> chused rather to live in want, and earn his suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with his fingers, then to diminish this blessed portion, by taking his due share out of it. Yea, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing that the Apostles gave so precisely in charge one unto the other, was in every passage, <hi>that they should remember the poor, Gal.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 36. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 3. as the bowels of Christ, the darlings of the Church, and those whom God especially had chosen to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdome, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                     <p>With this mortar (I mean this blessed theologicall work of charity, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> so highly extolleth above

all other) did our Saviour lay the first stones in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Church, and with it (to hold uniformity) did the Apostles build the second course, commending the pattern to be for ever after pursued throughout all ages: for whatsoever is built without it, is like stones laid without mortar, which cannot therefore couple to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and grow into an holy Temple in the Lord, as is required, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 21.</p>

                     <p>And that it was not thus in <hi>Rome</hi> onely, but in <hi>Africa</hi> and other Churches, it appeareth plainly by <hi>Tertullian in Apologet. cap.</hi> 39. where upbraiding the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with the piety and devotion of Christians, he saith, <hi>Etiam si quid arcae genus est, &amp;c.</hi> whatsoever we have in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of our Churches is not raised by taxation, as though we put men to ransome their Religion; but every man that will, once a moneth, or when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himself, bestoweth what he things good, and not without he listeth; for no man is compelled, but left freely to his own discretion. That which is given, is accounted as <hi>Depositum pietatis,</hi> the pledge of devotion; for it is not bestowed in banqueting, quaffing, or glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, but in nourishing and burying the poor, and upon children destitute both of parents and maintenance, aged and feeble persons, men wracked by sea, and such as are damned to the metall mines, banished into Islands, or cast into prison, professing the true God, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith.</p>

                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62279:29"/>I might thus passe over the first 300. years of the Church, but I desire to make it more apparent how the Clergy of those times lived as well for conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for maintenance. The times (to tell the truth) were such as had not been from the very creation: Times wherein God opened the windows of persecution, and rained bloud upon his Church, as he did water upon the world in the days of <hi>Noah;</hi> and as in the planting of the Law, he scourged the enemies of his people with ten famous plagues, so now in the founding of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel he tried his children with ten grievous persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by reason whereof the Clergy then aspired so generally to the crown of martyrdome, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared their bodies to this sacrifice by the austerest rules of conversation that they could devise, contemning all worldly pleasure, all curiosity of meat, drinke, apparel, sustenance and necessities, wasting their flesh with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence, fasting, thin cloathing, going sometimes bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, denying all things to every sense, that it particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly delighted in, applying themselves wholly to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Preaching, to support and enlarge the Gospel; and to be short, to doe the work of Gods Vineyard faithfully in all things and laboriously, as appeareth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly in <hi>Eusebius, Nicephorus, Socrates, Ruffinus,</hi> and other ancient Ecclesiasticall Authors. These are they of whom the world was not worthy, these gained every man his ten talents, and sit now in the first seats of heaven, next unto the throne of the Lamb.</p>
                     <p>Touching their maintenance, the means thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise chiefly (as appeareth by <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian,</hi> and others) out of the oblations of the people, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, first-fruits, tithes, &amp;c. which being continually offered at the Altar, or brought into the treasury of the

Church, were one while employed in common to the diet and necessities of the brethren and Clergy, but at length distributed by portions, first, weekly, as it seemeth by a decree of <hi>Pius</hi> the first, Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the year of our Lord, 158. after monthly, as appeareth by an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of <hi>Cyprian ad clerum, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epist.</hi> 5. to every Priest particularly.

                     <p>Touching Lands, though the Churches at this time had little, yet were they not altogether without any, as appeareth partly by that which <hi>Eusebius</hi> reporteth of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> that under <hi>Aurelian</hi> the Emperour (<hi>i. e.</hi> about the yeare 274.) he wrongfully invaded an house belonging to the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi> But more amply by the edict of <hi>Licinius,</hi> and <hi>Constantine,</hi> where it<note place="margin">Apud Euseb. l. 10. ca. 5.</note> is expresly commanded that all Lands and places which belonged to the Christians, as well for their publique use, as in their private possession, that had been taken from them in the persecution of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> should be restored to them. <hi>Platina</hi> saith, that <hi>Vrbane</hi> Bishop of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62279:31"/>
                        <hi>Rome, anno</hi> 227. first instituted, that the Church might receive Lands and possessions offered by the faithfull, and then sheweth to what end she might enjoy them, namely, that the Revenues thereof should be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by portions to every man, and that no man should have them to his particular benefit. <hi>Vrbane</hi> himself in the Decretall Epistle attributed unto him, affirmeth this usage to be more ancient, saying also, that the Bishops within their Diocese, and other faithfull persons (ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by them) both did and ought to distribute these Revenues in manner before mentioned; adding further that they were called the oblations of the faithfull, for that they were offered unto God, and that they ought not to be otherwise employed then to Ecclesiasticall uses, the relief of Christian brethren, living together in common, and of the poor people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that they are the vows of the faithfull, the price of sin, the patrimony of the poor, and delivered over unto the Lord for the performance of this work.

Ministers and poor children, in his 31.

to provide for themselves: to bee short, there is great wisdome required in him that would well dispose the Revenues of the Church, and that by being a faithfull and discreet disposer hee may become an happy man. Thus far <hi>Origen;</hi> to which purpose <hi>Cyprian</hi> also in his Epistle to <hi>Eucratius, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 10. sheweth that the Church maintained many poor, and that her own diet was <hi>frugalioribus &amp; innocentibus cibis,</hi> sparing and plain, and all her expence, <hi>sumptibus parcioribus quidem sed sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutaribus,</hi> full of frugality, but sufficient for health.</p>
                     <p>The persons by whom this distribution of Church goods was made, were chiefly the Bishops (as appeareth by the former Epistle of <hi>Vrbane</hi>) and Deacons appointed under them as in the times of the Apostles, <hi>Acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in their Acts teach us, that the Deacons are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Tables of Ecclesiasticall moneys, (or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues) &amp;c. and again after,—<hi>unusquisque diaconorum.</hi> Every one of the Deacons which gather wealth to themselves by defrauding the poor, let them now so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this Scripture, that they gather no more, lest the Lord commeth upon them, and overthrow the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of their distribution.</p>
                     <p>Thus much touching the use of Church goods in the first age of the Church, or first 300. yeers of Christ:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62279:33"/>
whereby it plainly appeareth, that no Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son enjoyed any thing belonging to the Church to his own benefit; but that the Church-men had out of the Revenues and goods of the Church, so much onely as sufficed for their necessary maintenance in meat, drink, cloth, and such like: the surplusage being faithfully employed to the relief of the poor, the needy, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, persons banished for Religion, or imprisoned, Captives, and Christians any way distressed. So that the Church exposing all this while the dugs of her pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto others, did live her self on thistles, and thorns, that is, in want, necessity, and professed poverty.</p>
                     <p>When the flood of persecution had prevailed as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years against the Church in the time of the Gospel, as that of waters did days against the wicked in the time of <hi>Noah;</hi> and that <hi>Constantine</hi> like the Dove of the Ark had brought the olive branch of peace unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: the Church then began to smell the sweet savour of rest, and changing presently her disposition with her fortune, changed also the very policy of her government: before in poverty, now in riches; before a servant, now a Mistresse; before a Captive, now a Conquerour. For the noble <hi>Constantine</hi> being miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously converted to the faith, did not onely free her from persecution, but setled her also in the very bosome of peace, raised her to honours, endowed her with pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, established her with immunities; and to be short, poured upon her the fulnesse of his regall munificence. Insomuch, that many prudent Fathers foreseeing then another evill likely to proceed from hence; as namely, that her plenty might make her wanton, and forgetfull of her duty, began now to dispute whether it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for her to accept lands and Temporalties, or not:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62279:33"/>
Some alledged that the examples of our Saviour and his Apostles bound them to contemn the world, and to live in a strict and Stoick kind of poverty. Others conceived that course to be but temporall, and like a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall diet prescribed by Physitians to their patients in sicknesse onely, not in health: affirming the time to be now come, when it pleased God to crown the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering of his Church, with the blessings promised in the tenth of <hi>Mark, v.</hi> 29. 31. <hi>That since they had forsaken house, and brethren, and sisters, and father, and mother, and wife, and children, and lands for Christs sake and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; they should receive an hundred fold now at this present, with their persecutions, and in the world to come eternall life.</hi> I will not argue this point, but letting passe the School-men, will rest my self upon the determination of many ancient Councels, Fathers, and Doctors of the Church, who with one consent conclude affirmatively, that the Church may hold them.</p>
                     <p>And I think their opinion to be of God, for that it hath prevailed these 1500. years against all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thereof, though the Kytes of Satan have pulled many a plume from it.</p>
                     <p>To return to <hi>Constantine;</hi> though he and others by his example did abundantly enrich the Church, yet did not the Church-men take these riches to the benefit of themselves, and their families, but employed them as before to workes of charity. Yea, <hi>Silvester</hi> himselfe, though the sea of these things flowed into his bosome, and were at his pleasure, yet took he as sparingly of them, as if he had been but a little pitcher, suffering the whole streams thereof to run abundantly amongst the children of the church, and poor people, as did also the other Fathers, Priests, and Clergy of that time, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62279:34"/>
reckoned not otherwise of riches then as dung, which being spread and scattered in the fields of God, might make them the more fertile. For the resolution then was (as in the age before) that no Church-man might take Lands to his private use, nor the Church her self otherwise then for works of charity, and the necessary sustenance of her Ministers, not to make stocks or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for them in earth, whose inheritance was in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that had God himself fortheir portion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Prosper</hi> a godly Father of that time, whose authority<note place="margin">Lib. 21. de vita Contemplativa.</note> is often used in the Councel of <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> disputing the point, concludeth it thus; If every Minister of the Church have not a Living, the Church doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide one for him in this world, but helpeth him with things necessary, that he may receive the reward of his labour in the world to come, resting in this life upon the promise of our Saviour. To which purpose he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the place in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. What is it to live of the Gospel, but that the labourer should receive his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries from the place wherein he laboureth? And a little before him, <hi>Hierome</hi> also in his Book <hi>De vita Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach. Cler. instituenda</hi>—saith, If I be the Lords part and<note place="margin">Epist. ad Nepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianum.</note> the lot of his inheritance, not having a part amongst the rest of the Tribes; but as a Levite and Priest doe live of tithes, and serving at the Altar, am sustained by the offerings of the Altar: having victuals and cloathing, I will be contented herewith, and being otherwise na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, will follow the naked crosse. So in his Book <hi>De Co. virginitatis,</hi> having reproved the curiosity of some Clerks of that time, he saith also, <hi>Habentes victum &amp; vestitum his contenti sumus:</hi> for as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Esay</hi> 1. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>In officio clericatus lucrum non pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum, sed acquiritur animarum.</hi> In the function of a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62279:34"/>
Clegy-man the gain of mony is not to be sought, but the gain of souls.</p>
                     <p>All these are but particular opinions of some We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Fathers: hear now therefore the determination of the Eastern church assembled in the Councell of <hi>Antioch, Anno</hi> 340. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>Episcopus Ecclesiasticarum rerum habeat potestatem, ad dispensandum erga omnes qui indigent, cum summa reverentia, &amp; timore Dei; participet autem &amp; ipse, quibus indiget, tam in suis, quàm in fratrum qui ab eo suscipiuntur, necessariis usibus, profuturis, ita ut in nullo qualibet occasione fraudentur, juxta sanctum Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolum sic dicentem, Habentes victum &amp; tegumentum his contenti sumus.

Si autem &amp; aliter accusetur Episcopus, aut Presbyteri, qui cum ipso sunt, quòd ea quae pertinent ad ecclesiam, vel ex agris, vel ex alia qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet Ecclesiastica facultate sibimet usurpent, ita ut ex hoc af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sligantur quidem pauperes, criminationi verò, &amp; blasphemiis tam sermo praedicationis, quàm hi qui dispensant, taliter exponantur, &amp; hos oportet corrigi, sancta Synodo, id quod condecet, approbante.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prosper</hi> proceedeth further, and will not suffer that a Minister able to live of himself should participate any thing of Church goods. <hi>Nec illi qui sua possidentes, &amp;c.</hi> For saith he, <hi>They which have of their own, and yet desire to have somewhat given them of that whereon the poor should live, doe not receive it without great sinne. The holy Ghost speaking of Clerks (or Clergy-men) saith,</hi> They eat
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62279:35"/>
the sins of my people. <hi>But as they which have nothing of their own, receive the food they have need of, and not the sins: so they which have of their own receive not the food (which they abound with) but the sins of other men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore though the Councell of <hi>Antioch, An.</hi> 340. <hi>Can.</hi> 25. ordained that the Bishops might distribute the Church goods, yet would it not suffer them to take any portion thereof to the use of themselves, or of the Priests and brethren that lived with them, unlesse necessity did justly require it, using the words of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>habentes victum &amp; tegumentum his contenti su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> having food and raiment let us be therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. And decreed further, that if the Bishops should not be satisfied, but did employ any goods of the Church, to their kindred, brethren, or children, they should answer it at the next Synod. So likewise tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Priests, as the words subsequent imply: and as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles Statius</hi> expoundeth it, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. for the Priests at that time had nothing but by the assignment of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: and if the Bishops themselves might take no more then onely for their necessity, we may easily judge what the inferiour Clergy might doe.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Gregory</hi> looking upon 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 7, 8. where it is said, <hi>You ought to follow us, we take no bread of any man for nought; and that he which will not work, should not eat:</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth these to the Clergy, and concludeth that though such kind of Ministers have never so much need, yet they must not participate the food of their function or Church Revenues; for saith he, <hi>Pensemus cujus damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis sit, &amp;c.</hi> let us think with our selves how great damnation it is to receive the reward of labour without labour. Behold, we (the Clergy) live of the oblations of the faithfull; but what? doe we labour to get the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62279:35"/>
goods and cattell of the faithfull? doe we take those things for our wages which the faithfull have offered for the redemption of their sins; and doe we not ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly labour as we ought to doe, against those sins, by industry of prayer and preaching?</p>

                     <p>Many Kings and Princes also were so pious and carefull, that the full tenth should be paid, that they made severall lawes to pay a ninth part, that so they might bee sure to pay more rather then lesse then a tenth: <hi>Ex propensiori in Deum animo ultra decimas, nonas dabant pii:</hi> As this Authour proveth by very many laws alledged in his learned Glossary, which shall be produced in due place and time: and <hi>cap.</hi> 11. here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing prudently observeth: How many things in the beginning both of the Law and Gospel, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and omitted for the present, and reformed afterward: for when the Law was given, the wheels thereof could not presently fall into their course; and so likewise in the New Testament, the Apostles themselves are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to many necessities, and to suffer many things which were reformed afterwards.</p>
                     <p>To which discourse I leave the Reader, who may thence receive satisfaction, why laws and canons for Tithes and maintenance were not made in the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges so exactly and carefully as afterwards they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted both by Temporall and Ecclesiasticall powers.</p>
                     <p>But as others also observe for succeeding times; Churches and Tithes were both miserably overthrown and lost in most of these Western parts of the Empire, by the Invasion of the barbarous people, <hi>Hunnes, Goths,</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62279:36"/>
                        <hi>Vandals,</hi> upon the Christian world, who first invading <hi>Italy</hi> under the Emperour <hi>Justinian,</hi> did miserably spoil and harrow the Countrey, persecuted the Clergy, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down Churches, robbed Bishops, and Colledges, overthrew schools of learning, and committed all sorts of wickednesse: and afterwards they set their face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>France,</hi> where to oppose them <hi>Charles Martell</hi> would not encounter, unlesse the inferiour Clergy would yeeld up their Tithes into his hands to pay his Armies and Soldiers: for which sacriledge hee is infamous in the publick Histories to this day, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally because he did not restore the Tithes to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, according to his solemn promise, after God had blessed him with good successe, killing many thousands in one great battail. This fact of <hi>Martell</hi> was done about the year 660. Chr. and no redresse of it till the Councel of <hi>Lateran,</hi> neer five hundred years after, <hi>Anno</hi> 1189. under <hi>Alexander</hi> the third; and this was the first vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that ever Tithes suffered in the Christian world, after they left the Land of <hi>Jewry</hi> and came to inhabite among Christians. But by that foot of <hi>Charles Martell</hi> it appears, that the Clergy in his time did hold and receive Tithes, and doubtlesse by vertue of laws and canons made in former times, (witnesse the Councell of <hi>Mascon, Anno</hi> 586.) and not so late as about the year 800. which some doe pretend. For that Councell of <hi>Mascon, Can.</hi> 5. doth affirm, and take them as due by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and laws of ancient times, and also by the Word of God, and that they were paid by the whole multitude of Christians. So the words of the Canon are expresly. <hi>Leges divinae consulentes sacerdotibus ac ministris ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum pro haereditaria portione omni populo praeceperunt decimas fructuum suorum,—quas leges Christianorum</hi>

                     <p>Here is no small testimony as well of ancient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in paying of them, as of great opinion, for their being due; saith M. <hi>Selden, ca.</hi> 5. § 5. and so <hi>Spelman, ca.</hi> 18. <hi>infra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So also the phrase used in the fourth Councell of <hi>Arles. Vt Ecclesiae antiquitus constitutae nec decimis, nec ulla possessione priventur;</hi> and other Provincials of that time, and Laws of <hi>Charlemain</hi> agree with it, saith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Selden;</hi> and those phrases must needs refer back to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times. So <hi>Boniface</hi> an Englishman, Bishop of <hi>Ments,</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Cuthbert</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury (Spelman Concil. p.</hi> 241.) speaketh of some negligent and unworthy Ministers that did receive Tithes and profits, but did not carefully perform their duties: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears that Tithes were then paid, though some unworthy men received them. And though the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall right be due to God himself, yet because hee hath assigned over his right to the Priests in the old Law, and now to the Ministers of the Gospel, therefore they are to be paid to the Priest or Minister; for hee is the Steward of Gods house, and in this point no man must respect what condition he is of: for the debt is due to his Master, not to himself; so that whether he be good or bad, what condition soever he be of, hee standeth or falleth to his own Master, as <hi>Spelman</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Levites</hi> that belonged to this service in generall were 8580. men, between the age of 30. and 50. years, and the chiefest occasion of their service was upon the removing of the host: for better ordering whereof, it was divided amongst them into three parts.</p>

                     <p>First, the <hi>Kohathites</hi> were 2750. men, and their office<note place="margin">1.</note> was about the Sanctuary, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 36. or Holiest of all, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 4. under the government of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Priest, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 32. to bear the Ark of the testimony, and all the instruments of the Sanctuary. The covering vail, (which divided the Sanctuary and the Holiest of all) the Table of shew-bread, the dishes, the incense, the incese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cups, the goblets, and coverings to cover it with, and the bread that shall be thereon continually, <hi>v.</hi> 7. the<note place="margin">Num. 4.</note> Candlestick, with the Lamps, Snuffers, Snuffe-dishes, and the oyl Vessels thereunto belonging, <hi>v.</hi> 9. the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Altar for incense, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and the instruments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

they minister in the Sanctuary, <hi>v.</hi> 12. The Altar (of burnt-offering) with the instruments thereof which they occupy about it, <hi>viz.</hi> the censers, the flesh-hooks, and the basons, (even) all the instruments of the Altar, <hi>v.</hi> 14. But these being the holiest things, were to bee taken down and trussed up by the Priests, some of them in blew silk, some in scarlet, some in purple cloth, all in badgers skins, and the barres and carriages to be put to them by the Priests, as is prescribed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. and then the <hi>Cohathites</hi> came and bare them away, but touch them they might not lest they die, <hi>v.</hi> 15. nor see them when they were folded up, <hi>v.</hi> 20. and <hi>Aaron</hi> was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point what part every man should bear, <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gershomites</hi> were 2630. men, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 40. under<note place="margin">2.</note> the hand of <hi>Ithamar</hi> the Priest, the other sonne of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi> Their office was to bear the curtains of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and the Tabernacle of the congregation, his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and the covering of badgers skins, that is on high upon it, and the vail of the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, <hi>v.</hi> 25. the curtain also of the Court which is neer the Tabernacle and neer the Altar round about, with their cords and all the instruments for their service, and all that is made for them, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>Aaron</hi> to appoint every man his charge, <hi>v.</hi> 27. and watch, <hi>v.</hi> 28.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Merarites</hi> were 3200. men, <hi>v.</hi> 44. under <hi>Ithamar</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3.</note> also, and they had in charge the boards of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle<note place="margin">Exod. 26. 15.</note> with the barres thereof, and his pillars, and his sock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, <hi>v.</hi> 31.

                     <p>This was the office and charge of the <hi>Levites</hi> as they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62279:38"/>
were simply <hi>Levites,</hi> and not Priests also: and for their service in this kind, were they judged worthy of the Tithes of all <hi>Israel.</hi> But when <hi>Solomon</hi> had builded the Temple and there setled the Ark, the Altars, and all the holy implements, this businesse of theirs was meerly at an end: for those holy things were now no more to be carried up and down. <hi>David</hi> therefore foreseeing it, transposed the <hi>Levites</hi> to new offices; before they were <hi>Levites</hi> of the Tabernacle; now he maketh some of them <hi>Levites</hi> of the Temple, and other Provinciall <hi>Levites:</hi> according to which is the speech that <hi>Josiah</hi> useth to the <hi>Levites: Put the holy Ark in the house which</hi> Solomon <hi>the son of</hi> David <hi>King of</hi> Israel <hi>did build;</hi> it shall be no more a burden upon your shoulders; serve now the Lord your God, and his people <hi>Israel,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 3.</p>
                     <q>§ 1. Of the <hi>Levites</hi> of the Temple.</q>
                     <p>The <hi>Levites</hi> of the Temple were those that served about the Temple, and were (as I say) instituted by <hi>David,</hi> but inducted by <hi>Solomon. Davids</hi> bloudy hands might not build the Temple of peace, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 8. he prepared the treasure and stuffe for the building, the men and the manner for the order of the service, (<hi>ib. v.</hi> 14. <hi>c. seq.</hi>) but <hi>Solomon</hi> performed the work. The <hi>Levites</hi> of the Temple were of two sorts, one <hi>Levites</hi> and Priests, the other <hi>Levites</hi> onely: In the function of the Priests, he changed little save the place of their service, not the manner; before they served in the Sanctuary of the Tabernacle, now he removeth them to the Sanctuary of the Temple.</p>
                     <p>But to avoid confusion (because the posterity of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was by this time (that is, in 600. years) exceedingly multiplyed) he divided the Priests into 24. ranks or courses, according to the names of their families, as you

                     <p>The other <hi>Levites</hi> of the Temple; that is, those that were simply <hi>Levites</hi> and not Priests; namely, such as descended not of the line of <hi>Aaron,</hi> he divided into 3. parts: one to be singers; another to be porters, and take the charge of the gates of the Temple; the third to be keepers of the Treasury.</p>
                     <p>The singers to be divided as the Priests, into 24. ranks or courses; The porters into 5. parts, one part to every of the 4. gates of the Temple, and the fifth to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppim, i. e.</hi> the Councell-house.</p>
                     <p>Their Treasury was generally committed to one as the chief, but under him, to 2. sorts of other officers, one to keep the Treasures of the house of the Lord, (that is, that were given to the maintenance of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) <hi>v.</hi> 22. and the other to keep the dedicate things, <hi>v.</hi> 26 &amp; 28.

                     <p>The Provinciall <hi>Levites</hi> are those whom he severed from the Temple, and placed abroad in the Country to be rulers over the people, both in matters pertaining to God, and the affairs of the King, that is, spiritually and temporally; some to be Judges, some to be other Officers in the Common-wealth: 1700. of them he set on the West-side of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and 2700. on the East-side, chief Fathers, and all worthy men, <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 30. &amp; 32. <hi>Josephus</hi> counteth the <hi>Levites</hi> of this kinde with<note place="margin">Iudices autem populi &amp; scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas eorum 6000. <hi>Antiq.</hi> l. 7. c. 15. p. 389.</note> their Scribes, as he calleth them, to be 6000. whereby it appeareth that the sect of the Scribes belonged to the Judges.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> made a new form of the service of the <hi>Levites,</hi> far differing from the first: yet the Tithes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the first, remained over to the second sort: and those that medled not with the Temple and holy things, namely, the Provinciall <hi>Levites,</hi> had their part in the Tithe as well as the Templar <hi>Levites;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the alteration of the service, whereto they were first ordained, took not away the wages allotted to them: so the second alteration of their service, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this of the Gospel, ought not to take from the <hi>Levites</hi> thereof, our Ministers, the Tithe before paid to the two former kind of <hi>Levites;</hi> I mean them of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and of the Temple. The Templar <hi>Levites</hi> were delivered from bearing the burden of the Tabernacle, and yet had the Tithes; therefore the <hi>Levites</hi> of the Gospel must have their Tithes, though they be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from bearing the burden of the Law, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thereof.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62279:40"/>
grounded upon the Text, and is very materiall to be observed for many purposes. At first whiles the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Levites</hi> and Priests was not very great, they all attended at the Tabernacle at <hi>Shilo,</hi> first, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: But when the Temple was built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and that Tribe greatly encreased, they attended by cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, (which was before designed by <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and then it fell out but one week in an half yeer to each to attend at the Temple: for the Priests being divided into 24. courses, and so likewise the <hi>Levites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 24. no course could come oftner about, then once in 24. months, or a week in every half year, which indeed was their usage, as <hi>Josephus</hi> sheweth; and so <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Salianus,</hi> with other accurate Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                     <p>Now the whole Tribe being so mightily encreased in <hi>Davids</hi> time, as that there were 38. thousand <hi>Levites</hi> besides the Priests, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 3. <hi>Magnus sanè numerus pro isto populo, ut facilè intelligas multos ornatui magis serviisse quàm necessitati:</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> there saith.</p>
                     <p>Therefore God employed them for many uses more then to attend at the Temple: some were designed for other employments in the Common-wealth, and they applied other studies, as being the chief men for nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and dignity, and also for learning and knowledge in that Common-wealth.</p>

the knowledge of Gods law, or learning in any kinde could bee gained: The administration of law and justice throughout the kingdome depended on them principally; <hi>for God made his covenant with</hi> Levi <hi>of life and peace.

                        <hi>CAP. IX.</hi> When our Saviour commanded that the Disciples should take nothing with them, but live on the charges of the faithfull; this bound not the Disciples perpetually.</head>
                     <p>VVHen our Saviour prescribed his Disciples to take nothing with them, but to live at the charge of them into whose houses they entred; this was a law to bind the faithfull to provide for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, but not to bind the Minister to live so, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; for though at this time he commanded them to take no scrip with them, (that is, no necessaries) yet after he saith; <hi>But now he that hath a scrip let him take it, Luke</hi> 22. 36. So likewise he willed them to salute no man, yet it was not his meaning, that afterwards they should be so uncourteous. If this had been a legall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to the Disciples, then might they not vary from it, nor live in any other sort without sinne. But <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> left this course of maintenance and lived upon the labour of their hands, therefore this was no binding commandement, but as a Charter of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and power granted to the Disciples. They might both use and exact it, if they would, or they might <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere de jure,</hi> and leave it if they listed. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. largely handleth this point, and concludeth it to the purpose we alledge: <hi>So</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Lord ordained that they who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel,</hi> v. 14. <hi>But I</hi> (quoth he) <hi>have used none of these things,</hi>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:62279:43"/>
                        <hi>neither write I these things, that it should (thus) be done unto me,</hi> v. 15. By which words, saith S. <hi>Austin,</hi> it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that our Lord commanded not in such sort, as they<note place="margin">Tom. 4. 99.</note> which preached the Gospel, might not live otherwise then by that that was ministred unto them by them to whom they preached it: for then (saith he) the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle did against this commandement, that got his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with the labour of his hands, lest he should be chargeable to any. But our Lord (saith he) gave them power to doe it (if they would) that thereby they might know that these things were due unto them. And again, a little after he addeth these words; therefore when the Apostle saith, <hi>That our Lord so ordained, but for his part he used it not,</hi> he sheweth manifestly, that power was given them to use it, (if they would) but no necessity imposed of doing it, (if they would not.)</p>
                     <p>And from this distinction is the reconcilement drawn of these two places in Scripture, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise seem contrary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 10. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 3. say both, that our Lord commanded that the Disciples should not take, no not a staffe with them: but <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 8. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth it, <hi>Nothing save a staffe onely.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>

                     <p>And in that our Saviour left these things to the choice of the Disciples and Ministers, he made them Lords and free-men, for necessity imposeth bondage; Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> shewed not onely their freedome in not using that that lay in their power, but the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62279:44"/>
of their mind also that would depend upon no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and hereby we must not judge them to have no right to tithes, because they omitted them also.</p>

                     <p>The Priests onely might eat the shew-bread, yet <hi>David</hi> and his followers did eat it also upon necessity.</p>
                     <p>On the other side, things commanded were omitted<note place="margin">2.</note> for a time; for when the Law was given, the wheeles

thereof could not presently fall into their course. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision it self was not used during all the 40. years travell in the wildernesse, and happily had never been revived, if God had not commanded <hi>Joshua</hi> to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the children of <hi>Israel</hi> the second time, <hi>Jos.</hi> 5. 2. Yea, the great ceremonies of sacrifices and oblations slept all that while, the people offered to Idols, and <hi>Aaron</hi> with them, but from the first sacrifice that <hi>Aaron</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, at the entring into the wildernesse, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not one Altar breathed unto the Lord in 40. years, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 26.

But I must not conceal that <hi>Moses</hi> omitteth the History of 36. years travail in the wildernesse, reporting onely the punishment of him that gathered sticks on the Sabbath day, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 32. and therefore in that time whether it were kept or not, we can conclude nothing: but it is plain that before <hi>Ezekias</hi> his days it was so utterly lost, that when he came to renue it, it seemed meerly a new thing, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. and all this time also, was both the Temple forlorn and shut up, and all the holy rites almost extinguished till he renued them, <hi>ib.</hi>

                     <p>Some things also that were never commanded were brought into the old Law afterward, and well accepted, as the act of fasting, and the habit thereof, sackcloth and ashes.</p>
                     <p>The brazen Serpent was set up by Gods own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 6. yet when the people burnt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to it, <hi>Ezekias</hi> brake it in pieces, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. without any commandement.</p>

                     <p>Thus the Apostles applied themselves to the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the time, the place, and the persons: thus <hi>Paul</hi> becommeth a <hi>Proteus,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> to the <hi>Iews,</hi> a <hi>Gentile</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> weak to the weak, all to all, and all this to gain all them to Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 22.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, many things required to the<note place="margin">2.</note> establishing of the Church, must needs be omitted; the main matters they uphold unto death, but the seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and remote dependances they refer to opportunity: therefore they by and by pressed no man with keeping the Lords day, and though themselves began by little and little to sanctifie it with breaking of bread, and preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. yet the first mention of it is above 22. years after the Passion of Christ in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. and I suppose it to be begun about that time, because I finde that till that time the Apostles used the <hi>Iudaicall</hi> Sabbath, but never after, through all the New Testament; and the reason why they then used it was, for that the greatest Assemblies being on that day in the Temple and Synagogues of the <hi>Iews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted thither, there they preached the Gospel, there
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62279:46"/>
they taught the people, as if themselves had celebrated that Sabbath. And as it was long ere they brought in the Lords day, so in matters more remote and outward, matters belonging to the body, they were lesse curious; therefore though they laboured hard in the Lords Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, yet they required no wages of any man. And though <hi>Paul</hi> prescribed that Bishops should be good housekeepers, yet few or none of them were owners of houses, but rather as fugitives to escape persecution, or as pilgrims to preach the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>If the law that was given in a solitary place, to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">3.</note> sequestred from all other, and at union amongst themselves, and having no publique nor potent adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to hinder the course thereof; if they I say, could not preserve it in the originall integrity, much more of necessity must the establishment of the Gospel be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached and turned out of the course thereof, it rising in the midst of the enemies, in the flame of persecution, and with the opposition of the greatest Potentates in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Region. It must therefore have the greater need of sundry Reformations: some of the first lineaments must be wiped out, some altered, &amp; some as occasion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved must be added or amended; the <hi>Iudaicall</hi> ceremonies that for many years together were permitted in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle time of the Church, must be taken away: <hi>Paul</hi> that then suffered them, now suppresseth them, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5. and the holy Ghost throughout all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> beateth them down for ever.</p>
                     <p>Thus as old branches be cut off, so some new be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed; the Lords day, the Feasts of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sontide,</hi> not spoken of in the beginning, are brought in at length. Deacons are ordained presently after Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 2. but no Bishops in 20. years after, nor were
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62279:46"/>
they then particularly ascribed every one to his limit, but many together over one City, as at <hi>Ephesus, Act.</hi> 20. 28. So women at first were admitted to be Deacons,<note place="margin">Conc.

Christ commanded his Disciples that they should not goe from house to house, but <hi>Paul</hi> saith, I have taught you openly, and from house to house, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, all could not be suddainly done, nor compendiously written, that belonged to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, therefore the Apostles left much to the wisedome of the Church, under this generall Commission, <hi>Let all be done in order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. a few words, but of great extent, like that of the Dictators at <hi>Rome,</hi> which being but two words, <hi>providere reipub:</hi> gave them authority over every thing.</p>

                     <p>When the Kingdome was rent from <hi>Saul</hi> and given to <hi>David, David</hi> by and by sought not the Crown, but life and liberty: so the Priesthood being rent from <hi>Levi</hi> and given to the Church, the Church by and by required not her earthly duties, but as <hi>David</hi> did life to grow up, and liberty to spread abroad; for love (saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) seeketh not her own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. and should then the mother of all love (the Church) be curious herein, especially when her necessities were otherwise so abundantly supplied?</p>

But why did he not use them, since they were due unto him? his reason is, that we (as though he spake in the name of all the Apostles) should not hinder the Gospel of Christ, <hi>ibid. v.</hi> 12. But why should the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that was due unto him hinder the Gospel? because the malicious backbiters would thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that he rather preached it for gain, then of zeal, and so abased his authority in the Gospel, <hi>ib.</hi> 18. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by this course of taking nothing for his pains, hee made it, as he saith, free, <hi>ibid.</hi> and stopped their mouths.

                     <p>Some then will say, this is like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> to sell the grace of the holy Ghost.

And though sometimes there may be found amongst them, such as <hi>Judas</hi> among the twelve Apostles, and in all ages some unworthy of that sacred calling, they being subject to humane frailties, yet tithes are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, because they are due originally to God, who assigned them over to the <hi>Levites</hi> in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for he saith, <hi>I have given them to them,</hi> Num. 18. 24. <hi>the tithes of the children of</hi> Israel <hi>I have given to the</hi> Levites; and in the new Testament to the Ministers of the Gospel, <hi>for they that preach the Gospel, must live of the Gospel;</hi> they are therefore to be paid to the Priest, or Minister, for he is the steward of Gods house, and in this point we are not to respect what condition he is of, for the debt is due to his Master, not to himself: so that whether he be good or bad, what condition soever he be of, he standeth or falleth to his own Master.</p>

Yet the truth is, that the letter <hi>X</hi> thus used for the name of Christ, is no Latine letter, but borrowed from the Greek, where it signifieth <hi>Ch,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it represents not onely the name, but the Crosse of Christ, in which the Latin letter <hi>X,</hi> as the number and character of ten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath also much hieroglyphicall signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To come to the <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> figures that expresse it, which are the figure of 1, and the cyphero, 1 signifieth the same that <hi>Alpha</hi> doth in Greek, that is, one. The cypher o, presenteth to us, <hi>Omega,</hi> for <hi>Omega</hi> is no more but great <hi>O,</hi> and in ancient time was noted onely by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or cypher, and in effect still is: so that 10. in figures expresseth A and Ω. As A is the first letter in the Greek Alphabet, and Ω the last: so in the Alphabet of <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metique,</hi> the figure of 1, is the first, and the cypher o, is the last; therefore in like respect the figures of this number of 10. signifieth the first and the last, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the end. But as the cypher o, in this respect signifieth the end, so we must mark that it is a circle, and hath no end. Being therefore joyned to the figure of 1, which signifieth the beginning, it sheweth unto us,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62279:54"/>
that the beginning is without end, &amp; the end it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning or end, both infinite &amp; without any limit. The first character in the figure of 10, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. begetteth al numbers (for it is <hi>semen numeroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Doubtlesse he is well pleased with this tenth part, for when he threatned the destruction of the Land by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> he concludeth, yet there shall be a tenth part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining as to replenish it again, and as holy seed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 13. he will save his own part.

                     <p>And this observation amongst the Ancients hath been so notorious and remarkable, that they commonly used the word tenth in Latine, <hi>decimus, decumanus &amp; decimanus,</hi> to expresse the greatest things; therefore in the division of their fields, they called the greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>decumanum limitem;</hi> the greatest or chief gate in their Camp, <hi>decumanam portam;</hi> the greatest shields, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumana scuta;</hi> and so likewise, <hi>decumanos fluctus,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumanaova, decumanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acipenserem:</hi> &amp; upon the like reason<note place="margin">Cic. in Verrem.</note> they used the word <hi>decimare, &amp; exdecimare,</hi> for to choose and cull out the choice and principall things, as <hi>Perrot</hi> reporteth. And because in the procreation of men, and many other living creatures, the number of 10. is most happy and effectuall, as the tenth month in some, and the tenth week in others; the <hi>Romanes</hi> admired the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vertues of this number so superstitiously, as they canonized it among their gods by the name of <hi>Decu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Tertullian, Gellius,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62279:56"/>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> paid tithes, and therein bound all whosoever bee of their posterity to doe it. Even <hi>Levi</hi> himself, who after received tithes of his brethren, was bound thereby, and paid them in the loins of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> (as it is said in the 7. <hi>Heb.</hi>) 400. years before he was born, and we also as <hi>Abrahams</hi> children. For if the <hi>Levites</hi> themselves, that (as the mean Lord, to use the Lawyers tearm) received tithes of their brethren, were not freed from paying them over to the Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, God Almighty, how much more are all wee bound of what sort and condition soever to pay them likewise? But some happily will ask, if the <hi>Levites</hi> paid tithes? yea, they did pay the tenth part of their living to God, as well as their brethren, as before wee have touched it in speaking of the heave-offering, and as it is manifest in the 18. of <hi>Numbers, v.</hi> 26. <hi>Speak unto the</hi> Levites (saith God to <hi>Moses) and say unto them, when ye shall take of the children of</hi> Israel <hi>the tithes which I have given you, of them, for your inheritance, then shall you take</hi> (elevationem) <hi>an heave-offering of the same for the Lord, even the tenth part of the tithe:</hi> which in the next verse save one, they are commanded to deliver to <hi>Aaron,</hi> Gods generall Vicar in spirituall function. And in the 10. of <hi>Nehem.</hi> it is further said, <hi>The Priest the sonne of</hi> Aaron <hi>shall bee with the</hi> Levites, <hi>when the</hi> Levites <hi>take tithes, and the</hi> Levites <hi>shall bring up the tenth part of the tithes unto the house of our God, unto the chambers of the treasure house.</hi> So then the <hi>Levites</hi> themselves paid tithes, and by their example the Clergy of our time must doe it likewise; but the question will be then, to whom? First, let us see what became of these tithes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount, thus laid up in the treasury. We must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the Treasury of the Temple was not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62279:57"/>
for that purpose, but for the guests and offerings also whatsoever dedicated and given to God: and I find that of this Treasury there were 3. sorts: <hi>Mesack,</hi> where the munificent gifts of Kings and Princes were laid up: <hi>Corban,</hi> where those of the Priests: and <hi>Gazophylacium,</hi> whereinto the people and all passengers brought their offerings, and into which the poor widow, as it seemeth, cast her two mites. I find not any particular limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these Treasuries, but the common end of them all was to be employed upon things necessary for the house and service of God, and for relief of the poor, and of orphans, widows, and strangers. <hi>Josephus</hi> expoundeth<note place="margin">Antiq. Iud. l. 4. ca. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Corban,</hi> for the very gift it self offered by them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated themselves to God, as the <hi>Nazaraei,</hi> and sheweth that the Priests disposed it to the needy. And to these ends must our Clergy give and pay over their owne Tithes unto God, first, in repairing and maintaining the house and service of God, as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 4. then in alms and charitable devotion to the poor: for the poor are Gods Publicans, and by him appointed to gather and collect this rent or custome due to him, and to carry it into his Treasury of heaven, as the Porters thereof, there to be laid up for our use and benefit in the world to come. <hi>Decima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deo in pauperibus vel in ecclesiis donet,</hi> saith<note place="margin">De rectitud.

And more then so, for even those things that are gotten by labour and travell; for therein we have our part of his mercy and blessing, as well as in his other gifts &amp; bounty. And the words in <hi>Nehe.</hi> [in all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties]<note place="margin">Nehem. 10. 37.</note> seem to extend to the handy-crafts-men, for Citizens commonly occupy not fields, or husbandry, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper unto the Villages &amp; Country people: So that if Citizens should not yeeld the tithe of their travel, most of them should yeeld nothing at al, <hi>and no man must appear before the Lord empty, Exod.</hi> 23. 15. for he hath shewed<note place="margin">Deut. 16. 16.</note> mercy upon all, and he will have some acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all. This upholdeth the custome of many places of <hi>England,</hi> where the very servants pay a tithe out of their wages, some deduction being made for appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell: and by like reason I think, that those that have Annuities and fees, as Officers and such like, ought to yeeld a tithe thereof; for out of those the King hath his Subsidies and tenths, and by like, yea better reason should God have his portion: <hi>Of all that thou shalt give me,</hi> saith <hi>Jacob, will I give the tenth unto thee;</hi> and in the Gospel, the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> though braggingly, yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the use of the righteous of that time, saith, <hi>I give tithe of all that I possesse;</hi> as it seemeth, even of his goods, and dead commodities, as of the fruits of the earth. For I suppose that the Ancients paid tithes in two sorts, some <hi>ex praecepto,</hi> others, <hi>ex arbitrio,</hi> or <hi>placito;</hi> some by commandement of the Law, others out of their<note place="margin">The tenth of bullocks and sheep, and all that goeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rod commanded, Lev. 32.</note> free-will and benevolence.

young, as I conceive, and not now again to bee tithed, when they were grown to their full ages. So in the 10. of <hi>Nehe.</hi> 37. they brought first-fruits of their dough, yet no doubt, their dough was tithed before in the corn it was made of: therefore I take these tithes to be tithes <hi>ad placitum,</hi> in the election of the party, whether he will give them or not; but if he doe allot them to God, he is tyed like <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> to perform them faithfully, for they then become due <hi>ex praecepto;</hi> for he that voweth unto the Lord, is commanded not to break his promise, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 3.

                     <p>But some are of opinion, that the Church it selfe is no longer holy, then while the service of God is in hand therein: as the Mount and the Bush were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger holy then while God was there: and by that reason a Church and an Ale-house are of like san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, for a man may preach in an Ale-house, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Sacraments in an Ale-house, and occasion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth necessarily require it: And what is their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereof? why, their reason is, that consecration of places, and of the implements belonging to the service of God were <hi>Leviticall</hi> ceremonies, and therefore end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law. These men reason, as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law there had been no rules of Gods honour: and as though the <hi>Morall</hi> Law, and the Law of nature taught us nothing therein: Doth not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self leave the precepts of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of the Law of nature, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. when he saith, <hi>will any man spoil his goddesse?</hi> as if he should say, that the Law of nature hath sanctified those things that are offered unto God, and therefore will any man violate the Law of nature? Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reason also in the same sort, when he saith, Despise ye the Church of God? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22. If I should apply the places of Scripture that are spoken of the great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Temple, it would be said, that that were <hi>Leviticall:</hi> but the office of the Temple was <hi>Morall,</hi> as well as <hi>Leviticall,</hi> and therefore though these be ended, yet the other, the <hi>Morall</hi> remaineth.</p>
                     <p>When Christ had cast the oxen &amp; doves that were for the <hi>Leviticall</hi> service out of the Temple, yet he said, that it was an house of Prayer, as figurating that after the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies

                        <hi>CAP. XIX.</hi> That the Tradition of ancient Fathers and Councels is not lightly to be regarded.</head>
                     <p>IT appeareth by divers ancient Fathers and Councels, that Tithes were paid long before their times in the Primitive Church, and were unto the age of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, though little memory thereof remaineth in the Authors of those times. And shall we not beleeve the Fathers received such instruction from their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Doth not God bid us ask after the days of old, and the years of so many generations, saying, <hi>Ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thine elders, and they will tell thee?</hi> Deut. 32. 7. If we shall not beleeve them, why should we ask them? and why did the children of <hi>Israel</hi> complain, that their Fathers heard not the words of the book of the Law, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 13. but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62279:61"/>
because they therefore could not report it to them their children?</p>
                     <p>Shall we think nothing to be done, but what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? doth not the Evangelist tell us, that if all were written that Christ did, he supposed the world could not contain the books, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 25? are not many acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of elder time alledged in latter Scriptures, and yet no testimony of them in the former? it is said, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 26. 18. that <hi>Samuel, Abner,</hi> and <hi>Joab,</hi> dedicated many things unto God, yet their story reporteth no such matter. <hi>Solomon</hi> is noted, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. to have kept a famous Passeover: yet is there not a word of it in the history of his time. Fasting was brought into the Church before Christ, and the use also of building of Synagogues, but it appeareth not when, or how. <hi>Paul</hi> alledgeth, that our Saviour said, It is better to give, then to take, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 35. yet no Evangelist doth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it. <hi>Jude</hi> saith, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>that</hi> Michael <hi>and the Devil strove for the body of</hi> Moses, yet the Old Testament noteth no such thing; how then came they by these instructions? Surely by books that are perished, or by inspiration, or by relation of others: and doubtlesse the ancient Fathers came to the knowledge of many things by all these ways. First, by books that be perished, for it is manifest by <hi>Eusebius, Jerome, Gennadius,</hi> and others, that the ancient Fathers saw many thousands, which are not now extant. If by inspiration, the holy Ghost, that was sent down upon the Apostles, and passed from one to another, returned not by and by to heaven, but remained actually amongst the Fathers of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church; and therefore what they generally taught is carefully to be kept. But if they received these things by Tradition, the very Tradition of those first
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62279:62"/>
ages of the Church are much to be received; for all that time, no doubt, infinite speeches and actions of Christ and the Apostles (whereof many were collected by <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> and <hi>Papias,</hi> as <hi>Jerome</hi> reporteth, but now lost) were then fresh in the mouths of every man, as not onely the Fathers of that time doe abundantly testifie, but our own experience also induceth us to conceive; for doe not we our selves hear and beleeve many things to be done in the time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. that never yet were written, nor like to be?</p>

                     <p>THe Canons attributed to the Apostles, come first in rank to be mentioned, yet I will not insist upon them. Neither doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (as they are now published) maintain them to be the children of those Fathers. Yet can it not be denyed that the first 35. of them are very ancient and neer the time of the Apostles; for <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius Exigu.</hi> that lived within 400. yeares of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, translated them out of Greek as received long before in the Eastern Church.</p>
                     <p>The fifth of those Canons ordaineth, that all other fruit should be sent as first-fruit (and tithe) home to the house of the Bishop and Priests, and not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon the Altar; adding further, that it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that the Bishops and Priests did divide it to the Deacons, and the rest of the Clerks. And though the Greek copy in this place, calleth not these fruits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Priests, and the Deacons, save offerings, tithes, and first-fruits; therefore the old Translation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons out of <hi>Zonaras,</hi> expresseth it tithe and first-fruits. And this fashion here received of sending these things to the house of the Bishop, and his dividing of them among the Priests and Deacons, sheweth the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of this Canon; for it appeareth, that the first usage was so, and that the Ministers had <hi>menstruam spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulam,</hi> every month a basket of the offerings and tithes for their maintenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereupon they were called <hi>Clerici sportulantes, i.</hi> basket Clerks.</p>

They are therefore to be given unto God, that being better pleased with this devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he may give more liberally the things we have need of.

                     <p>VVE have said in our definition, that they be due unto God: now we are to shew by what right, and to prove it. First, therefore, I divide Tithes into two sorts, Morall, and Leviticall; Morall, are those which were due to God before the Law given in the time of nature. Leviticall, are those nine parts assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himself, (upon giving the Law) unto the <hi>Levites</hi> for their maintenance, the tenth part being still reserved to himself, and retained in his own hands. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tithes were paid by man unto God, <hi>absque praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> without any commandement; Leviticall tithes were paid by the <hi>Israelites</hi> unto the <hi>Levites,</hi> as transacted and set over by God unto them <hi>pro tempore</hi> for the time being, and that by an expresse Canon of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law. To speak in the phrase of Lawyers, and to make a case of it; God is originally seised of tithes to his own use, <hi>in dominico suo, ut de feodo,</hi> in his own demesne, as of fee-simple, or as I may say, <hi>Jure Coronae,</hi> and being so seised by his Charter dated, year after the Flood, he granted them over to the <hi>Levites,</hi> and the issue male of their body law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten, to hold of himself in <hi>Frank-Almoigne,</hi> by the service of his Altar and Tabernacle, rendring yearly unto him the tenth part thereof: So that the <hi>Levites</hi> are meerly Tenants in tail, the reversion expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant to the Donor, and consequently their issue fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the consideration and services being extinct and determined, the thing granted is to revert to the

particularly wee shall shew by and by. Touching the fruit, it was the portion that God reserved from <hi>Adam</hi> when he gave him all the rest; and that portion also that justly and properly belongeth to God, knowledge. And therefore this part particularly was assigned by God unto his Priests, as the sacred keepers of this his sacred Treasure, and therefore no other man might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade this his right and inheritance, Knowledge (saith <hi>Malachi</hi>) belongeth to the Priest. Touching place, what should be assigned to the chiefest, but the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest? and what is the best and chiefest, but the midst? for <hi>medium</hi>—and therefore the place here where Gods portion is assigned him, is the midst of the Garden; and therefore into this place doth <hi>Adam</hi> flye as into Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and to the horns of the Altar, when he had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for it is said, that <hi>Adam</hi> hid himself in the midst of the Garden: So <hi>Calvin,</hi> which is, the trees in the midst of the Garden.</p>

                     <p>LEt us take a view of the state of Religion before the Law, and from thence unto the calling of the <hi>Levites</hi> to the service of the Tabernacle. The time before the Law was the kingdome of sin and of death, having no means propounded whereby to escape, but what the light and law of nature taught unto men, who finding themselves fallen from the favour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by invocation and beating of the heavens, with continuall odours and savours to seek for mercy at Gods hand, and by sacrificing of bullocks and brute beasts to ransome themselves as far as they might from his heavy displeasure. Therefore in those times though every man might offer oblations and sacrifices that would, yet because the order thereof might bee the more certain and reverent, both the children of God, and the Heathen also, ordained to themselves particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons of greatest worth, wisdome, and sanctity, which they called their Priests to take care of these things, to see them performed in such manner as might make them most acceptable to God. Hereby grew the reputation of Priesthood to be above all dignities, that in those days the Kings themselves in all Nations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it as the greatest and immediate honour under God himself. Yet because necessity required so great a number of Priests for the service of God, as there could not be had Kings enough for that purpose, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other inferiour persons were also called to that excellent function; yet such as in one respect or other were still the noblest that were to be found. Therefore
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62279:70"/>
even in that time (I mean before the Law was given) God promiseth the <hi>Israelites</hi> that if they will hear his voice indeed, and keep his covenant, they shall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be his chiefest treasure upon earth, but they shall be unto him also a kingdome of Priests, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>Of these kingly Priests, two are mentioned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture before the Law; <hi>Melchisedek</hi> Priest and King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and <hi>Revel</hi> or <hi>Jethro,</hi> Prince and Priest of <hi>Midian.</hi>

                     <p>Touching these Priests we finde no mention either how they were called to their function, or how they were maintained in it; neither of them that executed that place after the Law was given till the calling of the <hi>Levites,</hi> which though it were a short time, as not above a year and some months, yet must they have some maintenance and means to live on even during that time. The Priests of <hi>Aegypt</hi> had not onely lands for their maintenance, but they also had a certain part appointed them by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to live upon; and though it appeareth not by the Scripture what this part was, yet it is plain, that it was such, and so bountifull, as when all the other <hi>Egyptians</hi> sold their land to <hi>Joseph</hi> for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to save their lives in the famine, they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon this part and kept their lands.</p>
                     <p>The children of God (no doubt) came not behinde the Heathen in devotion, and consequently not in their bounty to their Priests; therefore though we have no authority to demonstrate unto us the particular means wherein they were provided for, before the Law, yet

we may very probably conceive it to be much after the manner of the Heathen Priests of that time, for that the Priests and children of God being then scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered amongst the Heathen, as <hi>Melchisedek</hi> among the <hi>Canaanites, Jethro</hi> amongst the <hi>Midianites,</hi> could use no rites nor ceremonies in the worship of the true God, but the Heathen would have the same in the service of their gods: insomuch as nothing is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scripture concerning the same before the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Institutions, but it is particularly found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles</hi> first, touching both their Priests and manner of sanctifying of them, as also touching their offerings, altars, and sacrifices, and the manner of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting at the sacrifice of thanksgiving used by <hi>Jethro, Exod.</hi> 18. 12.</p>
                     <p>I infer therefore, that seeing the Heathen took their originall manner of holy rites from the children of God, that therefore what originall rites the Heathen had in their service of their religion, that the same were in use also among the children of God, though they be not mentioned in the Scripture: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that insomuch as the Heathen universally paid Tithes and first-fruits unto their Gods and Priests, that therefore the children of God did so likewise from the beginning to the true God. And to this agreeth <hi>Hugo Cardinalis,</hi> saying, It is thought that <hi>Adam</hi> taught his sons to offer first-fruits and tenths unto God: so that the children of God borrowed it not from the Heathen, or the Heathen from them, but both the one and the other from the law of nature; for as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, God therefore by <hi>Moses</hi> followed not the fashion of the <hi>Gentiles: Non ergo Deus per Mosem Gentilium for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam sequutus est; sed ipsa naturalis ratio hoc habet, ut</hi>

                     <p>And as the examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirm it to be done by them, so doubtlesse was it also done by other of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> even before the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Institutions, and even then holden and taken to be a duty belonging unto God, as plainly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by Gods own mouth in 22. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. when hee saith, and that before the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Institutions: <hi>Thine abundance and thy liquor shalt thou not keep back:</hi> which all Interpreters agree to be spoken of the Tithe and first-fruits of corn, oyl, and wine, and therefore <hi>Jerome</hi> doubted not so to translate it, <hi>viz. Thy tithes and first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits shalt thou not keep back:</hi> wherein the word keep back, <hi>non tardabis,</hi> is very materially to be considered, as evidently shewing, that it was a custome of old to pay these tithes unto the Lord, and therefore that he now required them not as a new thing, but as due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by an ancient usage. That the word <hi>non tardabis,</hi> thou shalt not keep back, or delay, implieth a thing formerly due, very reason telleth us, and the use of it in other parts of Scripture doth confirm it, for the very same word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In the same sense it is said, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>non tardat Dominus promissa,</hi> the Lord is not slack in performing his promise, that is, not slacke, or holding that back which in his honour and justice he hath tied himself to pay or perform; the blessing he promised, which by his promise is made a debt.</p>

And it is very likely that <hi>Melchisedek</hi> himself had borne the office of a Priest many hundred years before he met <hi>Abraham,</hi> though the Scripture doth not mention him till the meeting; for if it be lawfull to enquire of that the holy Ghost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth not, many great Divines are of opinion, that he was <hi>Sem</hi> the son of <hi>Noah;</hi> (whom the <hi>Salemites</hi> had made their King) and it may well be, for it appeareth in <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. that <hi>Sem</hi> lived 600. years, whereof 502. after the Floud, and of them 209. in the life of <hi>Abraham:</hi> So that to those of that new world that <hi>Abraham</hi> lived in, (I mean after the Floud) he might well seem without father or mother, or any beginning, being born almost 100. years before the Floud, and to have been a Priest for ever. And then in like consequence he might have received tithes of divers other before he thus met <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> for that use was common long before among the Heathen, and likely it is, that the Heathen rather learned it of the children of God, then that the children of God should learn it of them, as <hi>Hemmingius</hi> would have it, who saith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave these tithes of his own accord, following therein (without all doubt) the manner of Conquerors, which were wont to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecrate the tithe of the spoil unto their gods, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it upon their Priests.

But with the precepts of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> and <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Laws divers rules of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> Law are also mingled: as the Laws against Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Userers, Oppressors, &amp;c. the Laws that command<note place="margin">Not to reap every corner of our field, nor to gather our fruit clean: not to keep the pledge that belongeth to the person of our brother.</note> us to lend to our brother without interest, and to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Sabbath; for though the Institution of the Sabbath be changed, yet the spirituall observation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, and that not onely in the manner of sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, but as touching the time also, even the seventh day. Notwithstanding I find not, that the Apostles commanded us to change it, but because they did change it, we take their practice to be as a Law unto us: yet though they changed the time, they altered not the number, that is, the seventh day. I will then reason that God hath as good right to our goods of the world, as to the days of our life: and that a part of them belong unto him, as well as the other. And the action of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> may as well be a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to us for the one, (in what proportion we are to render them) as that of the Apostles in the other; for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62279:79"/>
both of them were out of the Law, the one after it, the other before it: And why may not the limitation of the day appointed to the Lord for his Sabbath be altered and changed, as well as the portion appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for the tenth? You will say, the seventh day was not due to him by the law of nature, for then <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Fathers should have kept it before the Law given, but it held the fittest analogy to that naturall duty, that we owe to the service of God; and therefore when that portion of time was once particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly chosen by God for his service, by reason himself had commanded it under the Law, the Apostles, after the Law was abolished, retained it in the Gospel: And so since the number of the tenth was both given to God before the Law, and required by him in the time of the Law, being also most consonant to all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, great reason it is to hold it in the age of the Gospel. Yet with this difference, that in the old Law the Sabbath was the last part of the seven days, and in the Gospel it is the first, because our Saviour rose from the dead the first day of the week, and not the seventh.</p>
                     <p>God is our Lord, and we owe him both rent and service: our service is appointed to bee due every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, our rent to be the tenth part of our encrease. He dealeth not like the hard Landlords, that will have their rent though their Tenants bee losers by their Land, but he requireth nothing save out of their gain, and but the tenth part thereof onely. These two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of rendring him the seventh day of our life, and the tenth part of our goods, are a plain demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, of our spirituall and temporall duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Spiritually, in keeping the Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and temporally, in payment of tithes, that is, in providing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62279:79"/>
for his Ministry, and them in necessity; the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the image of our faith, the other of our works: for seven is the number of spirituall sanctification, ten the number of legall justification. Therefore to pay all the nine parts was nothing, if we failed in the tenth; for the tenth is the number of perfection, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired above all other as the type of legall justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as our faith is nothing without works, so neither is the Sabbath without tithes: for they that minister to us the spirituall blessings of the Sabbath, must receive from us the temporall gratuities of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

As far then as Tithe is due by one of these, so far likewise it is due by all the rest: and consequently the reasons that prove it in the one, doe in like manner prove it in all the other.

                        <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> supposing that these losses and dysa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters were sent unto them of God, betooke themselves to all manner supplication and devotion; and for so much as they supposed <hi>Hercules</hi> especially to be angry with them, who was chiefly worshipped at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> from whence origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they were extracted, they sent exceeding great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents and rich gifts thither. Being thence descended they were accustomed in former times to send unto <hi>Tyre</hi> the tenth for <hi>Hercules,</hi> of all their Revenues and encrease, any way renuing, issuing or growing; but becomming in processe of time very wealthy, and having exceeding great commings in, they sent very seldome their Tithe, and that but small and refuse, unto <hi>Tyre,</hi> in neglect and disregard of the Deity. But upon this great losse, comming home to themselves, and repenting of their irreligion, they became mindfull of the Gods, all that were worshipped at <hi>Tyre,</hi> and sent unto them the tenth.</p>
                        <p>Altogether as we use to serve God. <hi>Phryx plagis.</hi> Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el when God smote them, then they repented, returned, and honoured him: but when he turned his hand, they turned their hearts. So the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being plagued first, returned unto their former custome, (an ancient custome beyond the memory of man, and yearly, not sometime) and gave willingly in abundance their tenth part of all their commings in: not so much but of their children they gave the tenth, for they used to sacrifice them unto <hi>Saturn,</hi> as <hi>Israel</hi> did in the Valley of <hi>Hinnom.</hi> Old Father <hi>Ennius</hi> remembreth this custome, <hi>Poeni sos folitei sont sacrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re puellos:</hi> which custome seeing it remained unto <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
                           <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62279:87"/>
                           <hi>Caesars</hi> time, it is not likely they disused the other tenths.</p>
                        <p>In like manner <hi>Gelo</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> having van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in a most memorable bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and slaine of them in the field an hundred and fifty thousand men, the greatest blow for massacre of men, that they at any time received in any battel: <hi>Gelo</hi> having atchieved this, he reserved severall and apart the best and principall of the spoils (which cannot well be denied to be a tenth) meaning to adorn and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Temple at <hi>Syracuse:</hi> of the remains he reserved another portion (<hi>without all doubt in quantity another tenth</hi>) which he dedicated in the principall Churches of <hi>Himera;</hi> the residue, after God had been served, he parted among his soldiers and confederates.</p>
                        <p>Thus it appeareth what the custome of Tithing was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens, which doubtlesse they learned as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, from the people of God; as the ancient Fathers have observed touching many passages of practice in holy writ: there especially, when they intreat, <hi>de Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum furtis.</hi> So the names of Deities, and other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular usages, they received from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (though with much difference and variety, both as comming farre, and not well apprehended, or understood in the carriage and delivery) so also it is very probable, that of them the <hi>Syrians, Phoenicians,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> first learned to give the tenth unto God, and other holy usages, and then more remote Nations afterward: which might well admit in passing up and down, and in long continuance, much variety, and not fully in every point answer the proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, or originall.</p>
                        <p>But from whence soever they received their first directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for custome and practice they most part went beyond
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62279:87"/>
Gods own people: which though it be strange, yet so it is, that in zeal unto piety and the service of God, not onely <hi>Samaria</hi> hath exceeded Jerusalem, but even <hi>Babylon</hi> put down <hi>Sion.</hi> And so <hi>Theodoret</hi> complaineth, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did give their tenths and first-fruits, to be employed in their idolatrous service, to the maintenance of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Oratories, Priests, and Altars, in more liberall manner then Christians: but saith he, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>But King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, about the year 1042, made all certain; namely, that Tithe was due unto God, and should be paid, the tenth sheafe, the tenth foal, the tenth calf, the tenth cheese; where cheese was made, or the tenth days milk, where there was no cheese made; the tenth lamb, the tenth fleece, the tenth part of butter, the tenth pigge; and that they that had but a calfe or two, should pay for every of them a penny.

And to this price is the Parson generally holden at this day, when ten of our pennies are scarcely worth one of that time. He also ordained, that Tithe should be paid of bees, woods, meadows, waters, mils, parks, warrens, fishings, coppises, orchards and negotiations: and out of all things, saith the Law, that the Lord giveth, the<note place="margin">For the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were in those days, the Kings Justices in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and all matters were heard and decided before them.</note> tenth is to be rendred unto him that giveth the nine parts with the tenth: and bindeth the Sheriffe, as well as the Bishop, to see this executed.

                        <hi>CAP. XXVIII.</hi> Tithe is not meerly <hi>Leviticall:</hi> How it is, and how not; and wherein <hi>Judiciall.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>TIthe is not simply a <hi>Leviticall</hi> duty, but respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not the naturall childe of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doptive: Consider first the action, and then the end; the action, in payment of them; the end, in the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or disposing of them: The action of payment of them cannot be said to be properly <hi>Leviticall</hi> for divers reasons.</p>
                     <p>First, it is much more ancient then the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, as is already declared, and cannot therefore bee said to begin by it, or to be meerly <hi>Leviticall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, the manner of establishing of it in the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, seemeth rather to be an annexion of a thing formerly in use, then the creating or erecting of a new custome; for in all the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, there is no originall commandement to pay Tithe, but in the place where first it is mentioned, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 30. it is positively declared to be the Lords, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62279:93"/>
precedent to yeeld it to him. Some hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily will affirm the commandement in the 22. <hi>Exod. that thou shalt not keep back thy Tithe,</hi> doth belong to the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, though it were given before the <hi>Levites</hi> were ascribed to the Tabernacle. Yet (if it were so) that is no fundamentall Law whereupon to ground the first erection of paying Tithe, but rather as a Law of revive, and confirmation, as of a thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>in esse:</hi> for detaining and keeping back doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently imply a former right, and therefore Tithe was still the Lords, <hi>ex antiquiore jure,</hi> and not <hi>ex novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio praecepto,</hi> by a precedent right, and not by a new commandement.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it containeth no matter of ceremony; for if it did, then must it be a type and figure of some future thing, and by the passion of our Saviour Christ bee converted from a carnall rite into some spirituall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, (for so saith <hi>Jerome</hi> of the legall ceremonies) but no such thing appeareth in it, and therefore it cannot be said to be a ceremony. The whole body of the Fathers doe confirm this, who in all their works doe confidently affirm the doctrine that S. <hi>Paul</hi> so much beateth upon, that all legall ceremonies be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished; and yet as many of them as speak of Tithes, doe without all controversie both conclude and teach, that still they ought to be paid, and therefore plainly not to be a ceremony.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Tithing now used, is not after the manner of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law; for by the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law nothing was tithed, but such things as renued and encreased out of the profits of the earth; but our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of tiching is after that of <hi>Abrahams, who gave</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>tithe of all.</hi> And this is a thing well to be considered,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62279:93"/>
for therein as <hi>Abraham</hi> tithed to <hi>Melchisedek</hi> not being of the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> so our Tithing is now to Christ being of <hi>Melchisedeks</hi> order, and not of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> but of that of <hi>Juda,</hi> whereunto the Tribe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi> is also to pay their Tithe.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly and lastly, the end whereunto Tithe was ordained is plainly <hi>Morall,</hi> and that in three main points: Piety, Justice, and Gratitude. 1. Piety, as for the worship of God. 2. Justice, as for the wages and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration of his Ministers. 3. Gratitude, as <hi>sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium</hi>
                        <note place="margin">And to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in the service of God. 2 Chron. 31. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>laudis,</hi> an offering of thankfulnesse for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits received. All which were apparent in the use of Tithes before they were assigned over to the <hi>Levites,</hi> both in the examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and by the practice of all Nations. For God was to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped before, in, and after the Law, and though the Law had never been given; but his worship could not be without Ministers, nor his Ministers without mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and therefore the maintenance of his Ministers was the maintenance of his worship; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the tithes applied to the one extended to both. God himself doth so expound it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he tearm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the not-payment of Tithes to bee his spoil: and wherein his spoil, but in his worship? and how in his worship, but by taking from him, the service of his Ministers, the Priests and <hi>Levites,</hi> who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived thereof could neither perform his holy rites in matter of charge, nor give their attendance for want of maintenance?</p>
                     <p>So that herein the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were not onely guilty of that great sinne committed against piety, in hindering the worship of God; but of the crying fin also committed against equity, in withholding the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62279:94"/>
of the labourer, (his Ministers) and consequently of that monstrous and foul sin of Ingratitude, which <hi>Jacob</hi> in vowing of his Tithes so carefully avoided.</p>
                     <p>To come to the other point before spoken of, the disposing or employment of the Tithes after they were paid, (that is, when they were out of the power of them that paid them, and at the ordering of the <hi>Levites</hi> that received them) it cannot be denied; but therein were many ceremonies, as namely, in the sanctifying of them, in the eating them in the Tabernacle, the eating of them by the <hi>Levites</hi> onely and their family; and as they were otherwise applied to the ceremoniall habit of Gods service for that time: but yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, even then they still served in the main point to the <hi>Morall</hi> end of their originall Institution; that is, the worship of God <hi>in genere;</hi> the maintenance of his Ministers <hi>in genere;</hi> and for a token of thankfulnesse <hi>in genere.</hi> Against which the particular applying them to the particular form of worship, and ceremonies of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, (for that time abolished) had no repugnancy. And therefore though that manner of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them were <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> and did vanish away with the ceremonies themselves: yet did it nothing dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the <hi>Morall</hi> use, and validity of the Institution <hi>in genere;</hi> which notwithstanding still remained to be accepted and imitated by all posterity; and yet to be altered and changed accidentally in the particular orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and disposing of them, as the present estate of Gods worship, and the necessity of the time should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Law, at the pleasure of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law: under the Law, by the rules of the Law: and now in the time of the Gospel, as the Church of God either hath, or shall appoint them:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62279:94"/>
keeping always (as I say) the <hi>Morall</hi> considerations of their Institution, for they may not be diverted from the Minister, though the course of Gods service be altered from that of the <hi>Levites,</hi> but both they and the <hi>Levites</hi> are labourers in the Lords Vineyard; and therefore what kind of work soever, either the one, or the other, be for the time there employed upon, the wages ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed (<hi>Denarius in diem, Mat.</hi> 20. 2.) is due unto each of them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to take away the <hi>antithesis,</hi> or opposition that some make between the Ministers of the Gospel, and the <hi>Levites</hi> and Priests of the Law; God himself in the last of <hi>Esay, v.</hi> 21. calleth the Ministers of the<note place="margin">Esay 66. 20.</note> Gospel Priests and <hi>Levites,</hi> as though he had onely changed the course of their service, and not the main, or end of their Institution. <hi>I will take of them (viz. of the</hi> Gentiles) <hi>for Priests and Levites,</hi> that is, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Levi</hi> shall no longer be appropriate to my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but I will communicate their function to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and out of them will I take Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> to perform the service of my charge.</p>
                     <p>God therefore brought no new thing into the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> Law, neither changed he the nature of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Institution thereof, nor the course of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor the quantity of the portion assigned, nor the end whereto it was; but looking generally into the equity of them all, and approving them all in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, (yea, though they were used by the Heathen) he descended into further particularities for order and government, whereof he prescribed divers rules, and observances, some <hi>Morall,</hi> some <hi>Judiciall,</hi> and some <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall,</hi> according to the fashion of his Church at that time; which like old garments being wholly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62279:95"/>
worn out with the old Law, the body whereupon they were put, remaineth still in the first shape and vigour. And whereas before the Law it seemeth to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at randome and uncertain, God by his owne mouth in the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> hath established, and confirmed. So that these things considered, it cannot be said to be <hi>Leviticall</hi> in substance, but respectively onely, and by way of accident.</p>

                        <head>§ 1. An Objection touching sacrifice, and first-fruits, and circumcision.</head>
                        <p>It may be objected, that sacrifice and first-fruits were also in use under the law of Nature, and from thence, (as Tithe was) translated into the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law: yet they ceased with the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, and why should not Tithe cease likewise?</p>
                        <p>Though sacrifice and first-fruits were in use under the law of Nature, and from thence (as Tithe was) translated unto the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, yet the mark they shot at, and the end whereto they were employed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once accomplished, there was in reason no further use of them; for they were like the cloudy and fiery pillars, that directed the children of <hi>Israel</hi> to the land of promise, who being arrived there, needed those helps no longer, and so they vanished away, as then not necessary. But Tithe in it self and before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, was onely an act of justice and piety; and therefore though the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, employed it partly unto ceremonies yet the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof was not thereby changed, and therefore it still lived, when the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law died. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the whole frame of <hi>Leviticall</hi> ceremonies, it is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62279:95"/>
like that of <hi>Daniels</hi> image: the body is decayed and gone, but the legs being partly iron, as well as clay, by which it was supported; though the clay, that is, the ceremony be abolished, yet the iron, that is, the <hi>Morall</hi> Institution thereof, endureth for ever.</p>
                        <p>The rites of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law were of two sorts; some the naturall children thereof, others the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. I call them naturall, that sprang out of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of it, as those touching the Ark, and Institution of the <hi>Levites.</hi> Adoptive, those that being in use be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were afterward annexed to it: And of these I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve two sorts, one arising from some positive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, as that of Circumcision; (whereof I will speak anon) and the other deduced from the law of Nature, as those concerning the worship of God: whereof some were generall and necessarily incident to every form of his worship in all ages; as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to perform his service, which they called Priests, and means to maintain it, which they ordained to be by Tithes. The other appropriate to the naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of those times; as sacrifice, and first-fruits, which though they rose out of the law of Nature, as touching the common end of being offered by way of thanksgiving unto God; yet in that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so types and figures, full of ceremony, they became temporall, and thereby transitory. For the children of <hi>Adam</hi> finding themselves in the wrath of God, and their flesh, bloud, body, and life, to be altogether corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and accursed by the transgression of their father; they sought by all invention possible to help it as far as nature could; and therefore both to expresse the present estate of their miserable condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the mark also they aimed at for redemption in time
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62279:96"/>
to come, they held it as a necessary correspondency, that flesh should be redeemed with flesh, bloud with bloud, life with life, the guilty body with a guiltlesse body, and to be short, the trespasse and corruption of man, by the innocency of some sanctified creature of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto God for remission of sin. And because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under the sun could be offered up, but it also was full of corruption, and that nothing could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, that was impure, therefore though they chose the cleanest and perfectest beasts, and things for these offerings and sacrifices, and purged and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified them by all manner of means they could, yet they devised further to sever the purer and aeriall part thereof from the grosse and earthly; consuming the one, that is to say, the flesh and the bones (as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of sin and corruption) with the deserved torment of fire, and sending the other, that is, the fume and vapour, as the purer part to carry their prayers and invocations up into heaven, before the Throne of God. First, how corruptible they were, that is, even like the great body of a bullock suddainly consumed. Secondly, the punishment in justice due unto them, even the torment of fire. Thirdly, the place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from whence they hoped for redemption: Heaven and Almighty God. And lastly, the means whereby they were to attain it, taken from two of the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fire, light and heat: that is, first, the light of faith, whereby they long foresaw the promised seed; and secondly, the heat of zeal and hearty prayer, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and sent forth from the altar of a fervent heart, whereby they hoped to obtain remission of their sins.</p>
                        <p>After all this they yet considering further, that the corruption and wrath fallen upon them was perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62279:96"/>
and that these oblations and sacrifices were but temporall and momentary, they thought in reason (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely under the law of Reason) that the one could not countervail the other, and that therefore it was necessary by continuall reiteration and multiplying of sacrifices to sollicite and importune God from day to day untill the time came, that a perpetuall sacrifice might be offered up to make <hi>finalem concordiam,</hi> in the high Court of heaven, a full atonement betweene God and man: which being once accomplished by our Saviour Christ, both the institution and the end of sacrificing were wholly accomplished, and so no cause for ever after to use that ceremony any more. <hi>For with one offering,</hi> saith the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews, hath he consecrated for ever them that are sanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14.</p>
                        <p>Touching Circumcision, though it were before the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, yet it rise not out of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or <hi>Morall</hi> Law, but was instituted by a positive constitution, made by God himself, and not as a part of his worship, but as a seal of his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which by this ceremony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of cutting away the impurer part of the flesh, did put the children of <hi>Israel</hi> ever in mind to cast away carnall affections, and to hope for the promised Messias, that should cleanse them from the impurity of sin, and restore them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the favour of God: which being performed by our Saviour, the Covenant was fulfilled, and the seal of Circumcision presently thereby defaced.</p>

                        <p>The Institution of the Sabbath day had in it much more <hi>Levitical</hi> ceremony, then the matter of tithing; for no man ought to kindle a fire on that day, nor dresse the meat he should eat, nor carry any burden, take a<note place="margin">Exod. 35. 3. 16. 24. Jer. 17. 11.</note> journey, or stir out of the place he was in. <hi>Tarry eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in his place, let no man goe out of his place the seventh day, Exod.</hi> 16. 29. It was besides a day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for divers particular ceremonies, sacrifices, and offerings, as yee may read, <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 9, 10. and amongst other significations, to be a memoriall of the great deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (a thing peculiar to the <hi>Jews.</hi>) Neither have we any commandement, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a precedent for the keeping of it, from the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. Yet durst never any man say, that the Sabbath was therefore to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, but the temporall and ceremoniall parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being taken away, the morall use of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, which is, that the seventh part of our time must be dedicate to the generall service of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for ever to the worlds end; for otherwise our Sabbath is so remote from the Sabbath commanded in the Decalogue, that the one holdeth almost no affinity with the other, as appeareth in the points aforesaid; and for that their Sabbath was the last day of the week, ours is the first: theirs was in celebration of the end of his workes; ours in celebration of the beginning thereof; for in the first day were the Elements, the Angels, &amp;c. made. <hi>August. Tom.</hi> 10. <hi>fol.</hi> 250. Theirs in memory of the Creation of the world, ours of the Redemption, that Christ rise from the dead the first
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62279:97"/>
day of the week. And though the Apostles taught us by example to exchange the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sabbath for this of ours, as touching the publique meeting on the first day of the week, for setting forth the glory of God, yet they gave us no commandement to abstain from work on that day; but the Church decreed, saith S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> that all the honour of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sabbath should be transferred to the Christian; (<hi>loco dicto</hi>) and is done upon the <hi>Morall</hi> reason of the commandement, not the <hi>Leviticall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So likewise in tithing, cut off those parts that were temporall, and ceremoniall, which as I have shewed were neither in the payment, nor in the receiving of them, but in the manner of sanctifying and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of part of them, after the <hi>Levites</hi> were possessed of them: and then that which remaineth, namely, the payment and receiving of them for maintenance of the service of God remaineth for ever, as a part of the <hi>Morall</hi> Law, and common equity.</p>
                        <p>So touching <hi>Easter,</hi> Christ our Passeover was sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. and thereby the end of Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution accomplished: how come we then to continue it, especially, having neither commandement, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent thereof from the Apostles? The <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> part of the Paschall feast, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Lamb, the Purification precedent, &amp;c. are abolished with the Law, yet in that Christ came in the room of that <hi>Leviticall</hi> Lamb, and was sacrificed at the same time, and gave his body to be broken and eaten by all, as the Paschall Lamb was for a satisfaction for our sins, as S. <hi>John Baptist</hi> saith, <hi>Ecce Agnus Dei</hi>—therefore is that Feast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as it was formerly used, without changing either the number of the days, or season of the year,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62279:98"/>
or the solemn estimation that was anciently had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yet note that <hi>Easter</hi> is kept according to the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> manner for the time, after the full Moon, and is therefore moveable; whereas the day that Christ suffered is otherwise fixed, as that of the Nativity.</p>
                        <p>So likewise <hi>Pentecost,</hi> being the 50. day from the first Passeover, eaten by the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the day also whereon the Law was given in Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> and therefore hallowed as one of the three great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est feasts; the Law then being ended, the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the birth-day thereof, must in all reason also be ended; yet because the fulnesse of grace, (that holdeth always an <hi>Antithesis</hi> with the Law) that is, the holy Ghost in shape of cloven tongues was at the end of 50. days after Christs first Passeover sent down upon the Apostles; therefore is that Feast also continued, at the same time and number of days, that the <hi>Jews</hi> used it: although in all the New Testament we have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commandement, nor example for keeping either of these Feasts; for though it be said, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1. <hi>that when</hi> Pentecost <hi>was come, the Apostles were all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place,</hi> yet was not that their meeting to celebrate the <hi>Judaical</hi> Feast: but because the people from all parts then flocked to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Apostles were there also, for the better publishing of the Gospel, and for the same reason was the holy Ghost also in this miraculous manner sent at this time, that by this means the fame thereof might be carried throughout all the world. For it cannot be intended, that the Apostles met to celebrate the Christians feast, insomuch as at the beginning of this their meeting the holy Ghost was not sent upon them. Yet all this while, nor in the Apostles time, as far as the New Testament discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62279:98"/>
was <hi>Easter</hi> used, nor the Feast of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> for though it be said, that when the Feast of <hi>Pentecost</hi> was come, they were all with one accord in one place, <hi>Act.</hi>

                        <hi>CAP. XXIX.</hi> How Appropriations began.</head>
                     <p>MAny things are notoriously wicked in conclusion, whose beginnings are not suspected: so hath it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Appropriations. The Livings that belong to them, were first given for the maintenance of the Church &amp; her family, that is, Ministers and poor people. In the Primitive Church the Bishops disposed them accordingly, but the burden growing in time too great for them, the Parsons were themselves trusted to doe it every one in his own Parish. Then divers religious men, as Abbots, Priors, single Deans and Prebends, that had advowsons to them and their successors, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this, began first to collate themselves to those Churches, and for lucres sake were contented in their own persons to doe the divine service thereof; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62279:99"/>
sweetnesse in it, as enjoying thereby the whole fruits of the Benefice. Every successor did the like, and by that means kept the Living perpetually in their owne hands, without any favour, or thanks of, or to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; at length to avoid the multiplicity of Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Inductions, they easily obtained licence of the King and Ordinary (sometimes of the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) that without these usuall ceremonies, they and their successors might be perpetuall Incumbents, and take the profits of those their Benefices. In old time whilest these Churches were in the Clergy-hand, they were called Appropriations, because they were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to a particular succession of Church-men; now they are called Impropriations, for they are improperly in the hands of Lay-men.</p>
                     <p>But thus Churches became first appropriate, yet onely unto such as were meerly spirituall, and might in their own person minister the sacraments and divine service. But shortly after Deans and Chapters obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like licenses to them and their successors, who being a Body corporate, consisting of a multitude, could not jointly perform this function, and in particular none of them was tied unto it. Then was it devised, that by their common seal (which is the tongue of their Corporation) they might appoint a Deputy or Vicar to doe it for them; which invention gave the wound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, whereof she bleedeth at this day.</p>
                     <p>By these examples, Abbots, Priors, single Deans and Prebends, that before served God in their own persons, learned also to doe it now by Vicars and Substitutes, and so like faithlesse shepheards left their flocks to care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pages, themselves minding nothing but the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Livings. And this device being once a foot,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62279:99"/>
the very Nuns and Prioresses (that could by no means administer these holy rites) laid hold thereof, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religious persons obtained also the same Licences: all of them pretending that with great fidelity they would see that performed effectually to the Church and poor, that those Livings were at first ordained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Divine service, and Hospitality. By this window crept the Vicars into Churches, who for the most part were some of the Monastery, whereunto the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation belonged; till the statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. provided, <hi>That in every Church so appropriate, a secular person be ordained Vicar perpetuall, Canonically institute and induct in the same, and convenably indowed by the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ordinary,</hi> (1) <hi>to doe divine service,</hi> (2) <hi>and to inform the people,</hi> (3) <hi>and to keep hospitality there—and that no Religious be in any wise made Vicars, in any Church so appropriate, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus came Vicars to get a lock out of the Parsons fleece, which though it were a very poor one, yet was it in some sort proportionable to the deserts and quality of such heardmen, insomuch as then they were single men, as well as simple Clerks; but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they were thus indued before this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, for in the Synod holden at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Canterbury, Anno</hi> 1222. <hi>ca.</hi> 18. it was ordained, that lesse should not be assigned to a perpetuall Vicar then five marks a year in rent, which in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the rents of that time hold to this, cannot be lesse then 301 or 401 a year.</p>
                     <p>So that the Appropriation of a Parsonage was no more at the first, but a grant made by the Pope, &amp;c. to an Abbot, Prior, Prebend, or some other spirituall person, being a Body politique and successive, that he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62279:100"/>
and his successors might for ever be Parsons of that Church, that is, that as one of them died, his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors might enter into the Rectory, and take the fruits and profits thereof, without further trouble of admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, institution, or induction; which upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Plowd. 500.</note> was no more but to doe that briefly at one cut, that otherwise might and would in length of time be done at severall times, as to admit, institute, and induct the whole succession of a religious body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique at once, whereas otherwise every successour must have had a particular institution and induction; and therefore every such successour during his time, was as perfect an Incumbent, as if he had been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly instituted and inducted: but when the succession failed, then it was again presentative as upon the death of an ordinary Incumbent: and by extinction of the House, dissolution, cession, or surrender of the House and Order, the appropriation is determined, and they are now again presentative: for the appropriation is<note place="margin">Dier Howd. 497. Manwood 501</note> but as a stop in a run, which being taken away, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer right renueth.</p>
                     <p>What alteration then did the Statute make of them? did it make them lay, or temporall Livings? no, the words of the Statute are, <hi>That the King shall have them in as large and ample manner, as the Governors of those houses had them, &amp;c.</hi> So that though the Statute chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the owner of the thing, yet it changed not the nature of the thing. The Monasticall persons had them before as spirituall Livings, and now the King must have them in as large manner, but still as spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Livings: and with much more reason might the King so have them, then any other temporall men; for as the Kingdome and Priesthood were united in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62279:100"/>
the person of our Saviour Christ, so the person of a King is not excluded from the function of a Priest, though as Christ being a Priest, medled not with the kingdome, so they as Kings, medle not with the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Yet by the Laws of the Land the King is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as well of a spirituall body politique as of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and by this his spirituall body he is said to be supream Ordinary, that is, chief Bishop over all the Bishops in <hi>England,</hi> and in that his Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall authority, doth many things, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in his temporall he could not doe; and therefore the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> doth agnise the words, <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In this part of his power <hi>W.</hi> 1. made Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations of Parsonages, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he could not doe. <hi>Coke p.</hi> 5. <hi>f.</hi> 10.</note> 
                        <hi>nostra regia Suprema &amp; Ecclesiastica qua fungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> which the King useth in divers Charters tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching spirituall causes, doe testifie, that he taketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the execution thereof: and therefore in this respect he may much better hold them then his lay subjects. Neither is this authority of the King foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 8. or any other puisne institution, but deduced anciently from the very Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kings, as appeareth by many of their Laws, and Charters, wherein as supream Ordinary they dispose of the rights, and jurisdiction of the Church, delivering unto religious persons, greater or lesser por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, according to their own pleasure, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging and exempting other from the authority of the Bishops, and Archbishops, or any other Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Prelate. And in this respect it seemeth that the Chappell of the Kings house was in ancient time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no other Ordinary, then the King himself; for <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour granting all exemption to <hi>Battail Abbey,</hi> granteth that it shall be as free from the command of any Bishops, as his own Chappell.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62279:101"/>
                        <hi>Dominica Capella,</hi> which as it thereby seemeth was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no other Bishop then the King himself.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the Bishops agreed to the granting away of these</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                        <hi>Church Livings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that the Law accounteth the judgement of the major part, to be the judgement of all: but the Bishops cannot be said to have agreed unto it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing with it, but as concluded by legall neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and inference. For though all the Bishops said nay, yet the Lay Barons by reason of their number excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Bishops were not able to hinder it: and no man doubteth, that in publique suffrages, very many times, <hi>major pars vincit meliorem;</hi> therefore I neither accuse, nor condemn the reverend Bishops herein: for their voices, though they had given them every one against the Bill, were not able to hinder it. Neither doe I think but that they being men of another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, unexercised in the elenchs of the Law, were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the frame of words, and thereby passed that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a cloud, which if they had perceived could never have been won from them with iron hooks. But in this matter, there being a question of Religion; Whether Tithes be due <hi>jure divino,</hi> or whether they could be separated from the Church; it was not properly a question decidable by the Parliament, being composed wholly of Lay persons, except some twenty Bishops, but the question should first have been moved amongst the Bishops by themselves, and the Clergy in the Convocation house, and then being there agreed of according to the Word of God, brought into the Parliament. For as the Temporall Lords exclude the Bishops when it commeth to the decision of a matter of bloud, life and member: so by the like reason, the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62279:101"/>
Bishops ought to exclude the Temporall Lords, when it commeth to the decision of a question in Theology; for God hath committed the Tabernacle to <hi>Levi,</hi> as well as the kingdome to <hi>Juda:</hi> and though <hi>Juda</hi> have power over <hi>Levi,</hi> as touching the outward govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even of the Temple it self; yet <hi>Juda</hi> medled not with the Oracle, &amp; the holy Ministery, but received the will of God from the mouth of the Priest. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour required <hi>Ambrose</hi> to come and dispute a point of <hi>Arianisme</hi> at his Court, he besought the Emperour, that he might doe it in the Consistory amongst the Bishops, and that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour would bee pleased not to be present among them, lest his presence should captivate their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or intangle their liberty.</p>

                        <p>Spirituall things and spirituall men are correlatives, and cannot in reason be divorced: therefore was no man capable of Appropriations but spirituall persons before the laws of dissolution, which first violated this holy marriage, and (like <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 20. 2.) took the wife from the husband, and made Laymen which before were the children of the Church now become spirituall Fathers. The act of Appropriation is nothing but to make a body corporate or politique spirituall, that hath succession, perpetuall Incumbents in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; or no more, upon the matter, then to entail the incumbency to one certain succession of spirituall men. Therefore as a Patron (saith my Lord <hi>Dyer,</hi> Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and <hi>Plowden</hi> 496.) must present a spirituall person to a Church, and not a temporall: so by the same reason, an Appropriation must be made unto a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall person, and not temporall; for saith he, the one hath cure of souls, as well as the other: and they differ in nothing but in this, the one is Parson for his life, and the other and his successours, Parsons shall be for ever: and for this in the beginning (saith he) were

And for the same reason at the first it was holden, that they could not grant their estates to any other, no more then the Incumbent of a Parso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage presentative, who though he may lease his Glebe, and Tithes, yet can he not grant his Incumbency to any other, but must resign it; and then the Patron and Bishop must make the new Incumbent. And so the Incumbency which is a spirituall office cannot be granted, nor by the same reason could the perpetuall Incumbent (which is the Approprietary) at the first grant his estate which contained the Incumbency, and the Rectory, which is the revenue of the Incumbent.</p>
                        <p>Therefore when the Order of the Templars (to whom divers appropriate Parsonages were belonging) was dissolved, and their possessions granted to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of S. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> Justice <hi>Herle</hi> in 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. said, that if the Templars had granted their estate in the Appropriations to the Hospitalers, that is, to them of S. <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Hospitalers should not have it; for it was granted onely to the Templars, and they could not make an Appropriation thereof over unto others. Therefore to make good the estate of the Prior and Hospitalers, it was shewed there that by the grant of the Pope, King, and Parliament, the Prior had the estate of the Templars: And so by <hi>Herle,</hi> an Appropriation cannot be transferred to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and with good reason, (saith the book) for it hath in it a perpetuall Incumbency, which is a spirituall function appropriate to a certain person spirituall, and cannot be removed from them in whom it was first setled by any act of theirs.</p>

                           <hi>Herle</hi> there also said that, That which was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate unto the Templars, was disappropriate by the dissolution of their Order, <hi>fo.</hi> 497. <hi>B.</hi> So that as death is the dissolution of every ordinary Incumbent, so the dissolution of a religious Order, Monastery, or Corporation, is the death thereof, and by that death (according to this opinion of Justice <hi>Herle</hi>) the Church appropriate that belonged thereunto is again become presentable as it was before the Appropriation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto my Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> and <hi>Manwood</hi> doe also agree; and<note place="margin">Dier Plowd. 497.

                        <p>1. The Statute saith, That the King shall have all such Monasteries, Priories, and other such religious

Houses of Monks, &amp;c. as were not above 2001 a year. And the Sites, and Circuits thereof, and all Manours, Granges, Meases, Lands, &amp;c.

                        </p>
                        <p>The words have divers significations, and therefore make the sense the more obscure.</p>
                        <p>Monasteries, Priories, and religious Houses are,</p>
                        <p>1. Sometimes taken personally, for the Heads and Members of the House, that is, for the men of the House, as Church for the Congregation, City for Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</p>
                        <p>2. Sometime they are taken locally, for the soil of the House, and in this sense one while extensively, to all the Territory thereof: another while restrictively, to the site and building onely.</p>
                        <p>3. They are taken civilly, or locally, for the whole rights of the House, the lands, the rents, the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and inheritances whatsoever. In which of these senses the Parliament hath given them to the King, and whether in all of them or not, it is not manifest; but I conceive the words must be taken in the last sense, which as the more generall, includeth also the second; and if the very carkasses of the Monastery persons had been worth the having, might well enough have fetcht them in also. Therefore though after these generall
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62279:104"/>
and spacious words, there followeth a grant of divers particular things, as Sites, Circuits, Granges, Meases, Lands, Tithes, &amp;c. yet I take this to be but an enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the things <hi>in specie,</hi> which before are granted <hi>in genere;</hi> for if the generall words have not carried them, as the body carrieth the members, then it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth these particulars doe not carry them, for they are granted but as Appurtenances to the said Monasteries, and Houses, for the words be, Sites, Circuits, Lands, Tithes, &amp;c. appertaining or belonging to every such Monastery; words in my understanding onely of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation and restraint, and not trenching to the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the grant.</p>
                        <p>So that upon the matter the Parliament hath granted Tithes and Appropriations to the King, if they belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto the Monasteries, and not otherwise. Let us therefore see whether they belong or not.</p>

                        <p>Abbots, Priors, and such religious men had two sorts of Tithes; one incorporate to their Houses, which I call Monasticall Tithes: the other depending upon their function, as they were Parsons of any Parish, which therefore I call Parish Tithes. 1. The first of these came unto them, as their very lands did, by plain point of Charter; for before the <hi>Lugdune</hi> and <hi>Lateran</hi> Councels, every man might bestow his Tithes upon what religious House person he listed: and then the founders and benefactors of religious Houses did ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily grant all or some portion of their Tithes to those Houses, as by a multitude of precedents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62279:105"/>

But the other sort, that is, Parish Tithes, belonged onely to the Parson of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, by reason of his function, and incumbency; which function, though by act of Appropriation, it were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated upon these religious men, yet did it not invest the property of those Tithes in their Monasteries, but made their persons capable of them by reason of that their function; for without their function of being Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall persons, they could not have them, being forain unto them, as I may tearm it, and not domesticall, as belonging to their house, or monasticall, as belonging to their conventuall body.</p>

                        <p>Though the Parliament hath power to dispose tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall inheritance, and to make Lawes to binde the rights of subjects, yet it is confessed by the Books of the Law themselves, that it can establish nothing against the law of God; and therefore if Tithes be in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy by the Law of God, as before we have shewed, then can they not be pulled from him by any law of man. Neither hath the Parliament as it seemeth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to doe it, but insomuch as they were mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed by the Clergy of that time, therefore the Parliament took them from them, and gave them to the King, not in any new course of property, or to be

                        <p>This point dependeth upon the precedent, for the end why they were given unto the King, is declared by the manner of giving them unto him. Therefore though the Statute saith, <hi>To have and to hold</hi>—to his Majesty, his heirs, and their own wils, to doe and use therewith, his and their own wils; yet lest their wils should decline from the due employment of them (as the religious persons did) therefore the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute addeth these words, <hi>to the pleasure of God, and to the honour and profit of this Realm.</hi> So that the King had not the things themselves simply, but in such manner onely as the religious persons had them, and that being but to the service of God, and benefit of the Church, the King could have them in no other manner then for the service of God, and benefit of the Church; and then to the words subsequent in the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum, viz.</hi> to doe and use therewith their wils, is no more, then if we should say, That the King, &amp;c. should have them to dispose of in the service of God and of his Church, according to his own will and wisdome; which the words annexed plainly intimate, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto the King by what bounds and marks hee must walk in disposing of them, namely so, as may
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62279:106"/>
be to the pleasure of God, and the honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Realm. But it cannot be to the pleasure of God, that his Ministers should be defrauded; nor to the honour and profit of the Realm, that the service of God should be hindered, or neglected, and therefore the King must have and hold them to those purposes, and to none other.</p>
                        <p>And that the King was not deceived in this kinde of construction of the Act of Parliament, it appeareth by a Declaration made by himself freely in an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his unto the Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 37. of his reign, where he saith,—<q>I cannot a little rejoyce, when I consider <hi>the perfect trust and confidence,</hi> which you have put in me, as men having <hi>undoubted hope, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned beleef,</hi> in my good doings and just proceedings; for you without my desire or request, have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my order and disposition all Chauntries, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Hospitals, and other places specified in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Act, firmly trusting, that I will order them to the <hi>glory of God, and the profit of the Common-wealth.</hi> Surely, if I contrary to your expectation should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church to decay, or <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (which is so great a jewell) to bee minished, or poor and miserable to be unrelieved, you might well say, that I being put in so speciall a <hi>Trust,</hi> as I am in this case, were no trusty friend to you, nor charitable to my <hi>even Christian,</hi> neither a lover of the publique wealth, nor yet one that feared God, to whom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count must bee rendred of all our doings.

                        <p>In the 45. chap. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> God commandeth the Prophet to divide the Land into three parts, one for God himself, and his servants the Priests, the other for the King, and the third for the people. And then he saith, <hi>Let this suffice, O yee Princes of Israel,</hi> v. 9. <hi>Leave off cruelty and oppression, and execute judgement and justice, take away your exactions from my people.</hi> And again, <hi>chap.</hi> 46. 18. <hi>The Prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance, nor thrust them out of their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, but he shall cause his sonnes to inherit his owne possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his own possession.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Though the said Texts savour something of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, as to preserve the Tribes from confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, yet they present also unto us rules of <hi>Morall</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. First, that in the division of the Kingdome, wee must remember to give him a part for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that giveth us all for our necessities; therefore he saith in another place, (45. 1.) <hi>When yee shall divide the Land for inheritance, yee shall offer an oblation unto the Lord, an holy portion of the Land.</hi> Secondly, that the Prince must be contented with the portion assigned him, and not to disturbe the people in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62279:107"/>
their possession, but not God especially in his, for that is priviledged further and defended with another iron barre, <hi>it is an oblation,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>unto the Lord, yea, it is an holy portion of the land.</hi> Holy, because it is offered unto God, and holy again, for that being offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the Lord it is severed from the injury of man, it must not be violated, nor plucked back, it must <hi>not be sold, nor redeemed, it is an inheritance separate from the common use, it is most holy unto the Lord,</hi> Lev. 27. 28.</p>
                        <p>It being thus manifested, what are the chief ends and uses of Parsonages, it appears how unjust it is to tolerate Appropriations, and how miserable their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is who hold them: Oh how lamentable is the case of a poor Approprietary, that dying, thinketh of no other account, but of that touching his lay voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then comming before the Judgement seat of Almighty God, must answer also for this spirituall function; first, why he medled with it, not being called unto it; then why (medling with it) he did not the duty that belongeth unto it, in seeing the Church carefully served, the Minister thereof sufficiently maintained, and the poor of the Parish faithfully relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This, I say, is the use whereto Parsonages were given, and of this use we had notice before we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased them; and therefore not onely by the Laws of God, and the Church, but by the Law of the Land, and the rules of the Chancery, at this day observed, we ought onely to hold them to this use, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Look how many of the Parishioners are cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for want of teaching, he is guilty of their bloud; at his hand it shall be required, because he hath taken upon him the charge. He saith, he is Parson of that place, and of his own mouth will God judge him, for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62279:107"/>
idle Parsons are guilty of the bloud of the Parishioners; and this S. <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, when he saith, I thank God I am pure from the bloud of all men, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 26. mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he taught the counsell of God so faithfully, as if any be not saved thereby, their bloud is upon their own heads, for he on his own part addeth, that hee hath kept nothing back, but shewed them all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of God, <hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>
                        <p>It is not therefore a work of bounty and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to restore these Appropriations to the Churches, but of duty and necessity so to doe.

commandeth nothing in Ecclesiasticall causes, neither as the supream Officer of the Church doth he interpose in the temporall government: but like the common arch arising from both these pillars he protecteth and combineth them in perpetuall stability, governing that of the Church by his Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, and that of the Common-wealth by his temporall. For this cause, as <hi>Moses</hi> was counted <hi>in sacerdotibus, Psal.</hi> 99. 6. though he were the temporall Governour of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> so the Laws of the Land have of old armed the King, <hi>persona mixta, medium,</hi> or rather <hi>commune quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam inter laicos &amp; sacerdotes:</hi> and have thereupon justly assigned to him a politique body, composed as well of Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, as temporall, like to that of <hi>David, Jehosaphat, Hezekias,</hi> and other Kings of <hi>Juda,</hi> who not onely in respect of their Crown, led the Armies of the people against their enemies: but as anointed with the holy oyle, ordered and disposed the very function of the <hi>Levites,</hi> of the Priests, and of the Temple, as you may read in their severall lives in the books of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles.</hi>

                        <p>But the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have proceeded yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the gradations of Ecclesiasticall profession, as thinking it with <hi>David,</hi> more honourable, to be a door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in the House of God, then to dwell in the tents of the ungodly, that is, to execute the meanest office in the service of God, then those of greatest renowne among the Heathen and Infidels. Therefore they have by ancient custome even before the Conquest, amongst other the solemnities of their Coronation, not only been girt with the regall sword of Justice by the Lay Peers of the Land, as the embleme of their temporall authority, but anointed also by the Bishops with the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62279:111"/>
oyle of Priesthood, as a mark unto us of their Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall profession and jurisdiction.

The reasons of which, if we shall seek from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Institutions of the Church, it is apparent by the Epistle of <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, unto <hi>Aregius</hi> Bishop of <hi>France,</hi> that this <hi>vestis dalmatica,</hi> was of that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<note place="margin">Ep. l 7. c. 111.</note> amongst the Clergy of that time, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Church-men, no not the Bishops themselves, might wear it without licence of the Pope.

                        <p>In which words I note, first, that the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in those ancient days, being before their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meerly Lay persons, were by their consecration made <hi>candidati Ecclesiasticae potestatis,</hi> and admitted to the administration thereof; for to what other purpose was Consecration ordained, but to make secular things to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the Temple, and Lay persons to become sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Ecclesiasticall? like <hi>Jacobs</hi> stone in the time of the <hi>Morall</hi> Law, which presently upon the anointing thereof became appropriate to the House of God.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he plainly maketh the King head of this Monastery, that is, of the place it self, and of all the persons and members therof, which then by consequence he might likewise be of all other Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and places through the whole Kingdome. And even that also he granteth in a sort in the end of his Epistle, <hi>Vobis &amp; posteris vestris regibus committimus advocationem &amp; tuitionem ejusdem loci, &amp; omnium totius Angliae Ecclesiarum, ut vice nostra cum concilio Episcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; Abbatum, constituatis ubique quae justa sunt.</hi> So that if the Kings of <hi>England</hi> be pleased to execute this Ecclesiasticall authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Popes Vicar, then by this his Charter they are invested therewith; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> can never revoke it, being granted <hi>posteris regibus:</hi> and the Epistles of the Popes, being as <hi>Barclayus</hi> saith of <hi>Nich.</hi> 1. to <hi>Michael</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as an Ecclesiasticall Law, <hi>Lib. de potest.

And to give more life to the matter, it appeareth by <hi>Baronius,</hi> that Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> the granted not onely as much in the Kingdome of <hi>Sicil</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> being the anointed King thereof, but added also to that his Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, divers branches of spirituall power belonging meerly to the keys, and not to the sword, that is, to the very function of a Bishop, as namely, that of Excommunication.

And in further declaration thereof doth by that his Charter by and by after prohibit all Bishops from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within the Isle of <hi>Glastenberry:</hi> and lest he should seem to doe a new thing, he closeth it up with this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, That his predecessors, <hi>Cemwines, Ines, Ethelar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Cuthredus, Elfredus, Edwardus, Ethelstanus, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus,</hi> had all of them done the like; and he might have added out of <hi>Bede, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. that <hi>Cenwalch</hi> King of West-Saxon, of his own authority divided the Sea of <hi>Agilbert</hi> his Bishop, being a French man, and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother language, which he understood not, and gave one part thereof unto <hi>Winus</hi> a man of his own Nation, which though he were afterwards compelled by neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and discontent of <hi>Agilbert</hi> to reunite, yet his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor <hi>Inas,</hi> divided them again, and then they so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. <hi>Hen.

For so likewise may the Popes own authority be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, insomuch as he also required the generall Synod, then holden at <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 965. (as <hi>Malmsbur.</hi> saith) to confirm it. But the fashion of those times was, that secular Princes sought sometimes to have their temporall Laws confirmed by the Pope with a curse against the breakers thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as did <hi>Howell Dhae,</hi> for those his Laws of <hi>Wales;</hi> and in like manner was it usuall for Councels and Synods to seek the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Canons from temporall Princes, as did that of <hi>Orleans</hi> before spoken of from <hi>Clodoveus,</hi> and the Councell of <hi>Toledo</hi> from <hi>Euricus,</hi> who made a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Law for establishing it, as you may see in the Laws of the <hi>Wisegothes, l.</hi> 12. <hi>tit.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 3. <hi>ut sic gladius gladium adjuvaret.</hi>

                        <p>It may be objected, that <hi>Edgar</hi> being the great King of this whole Isle, (for he styled himself <hi>totius Albionis basileus</hi>) might usurp upon the Church, and doe these things rather in the will of a Prince, then by just au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. It is manifest partly by that which I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but plentifully by his Charters, that the Clergy of that time were so far from denying, or repining at this his jurisdiction, that they affirmed and subscribed unto it, as appeareth in his Charters. And how large soever his Dominion was, his humility was as great, for though in matters of government he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62279:115"/>
as the head Officer of the Church, yet in matters of faith he was so obedient, that to expiate his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency with a Nun, he threw himself at the feet of <hi>Dunstan</hi> his Bishop, submitted himself to seven years penance, and presumed not to be consecrated till the 14. year of his reign.</p>
                        <p>But these things were no novelties either in the person of <hi>Edgar,</hi> or in the Princes of those ages; for the minor Kings themselves within the orbs of their own Dominion used the like jurisdiction, as you may perceive by those cited by <hi>Edgar,</hi> in the Charter of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenberry,</hi> and by many other in particular Charters of their own. Yea, the Kings of <hi>Mercia</hi> that were but vassals, and underlings to the Kings of West-Saxony, within the limits of their little Kingdome used the same plenitude of authority, as appeareth by the Charter of <hi>Kenulphus,</hi> who lived about the year 850. made to the Abbot of <hi>Abingdon,</hi> wherein he saith,—<hi>Sit autem prae-dict' rus liberum ab omni regali obstaculo, &amp; Episcopali jure, in sempiternum aevum, ut habitantes ejus nullius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis aut ministrorum suorum, Episcopive aut suorum offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alium jugo deprimantur, sed in omnibus rerum eventibus as defensionibus causarum Abbatis Abbindenensis, Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterii de caetero subjiciantur, Term.

                        <p>To leave the Saxon Kings, and to come to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that we may see by what channell this fluent of authority hath been deduced to his Majesty. <hi>Lanfranc</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the Conquerours time, would have given the Abbotship of S. <hi>Augustines,</hi> but
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62279:116"/>
the new King, (saith the book) i. <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, did deny it, saying, <hi>that he would conferre all Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Staves in his Realm, and would not conferre that power to any whatsoever. Govern you</hi> (saith he) <hi>that which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to faith and Christianity among the Monks, but for their outward service, you shall let me alone with that.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You see here, that the King doth not in covert man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or by little and little, creep into Ecclesiasticall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, but with an absolute resolution, whilest he yet stood as it were but upon the threshold of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and might justly fear some notable transmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in discontenting his Clergy, the halfe arch of his Kingdome, even then hee forbare not to contest with them upon points of jurisdiction, confining theirs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to matters of faith, and extending his own to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most limits of the outward government of the Church. But because his hand and his seal doe more authentical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enforce credit, then the report of Authours and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, see what he assumeth in his Charter of founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Monastery <hi>Sancti Martini de bello,</hi> commonly called <hi>Battail Abbey,</hi> for that he built it (as <hi>Romulus</hi> did the Capitol) in the place where he overcame his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this Charter he granteth that, <hi>That Church shall be free from all servitude, and from all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever mans invention can imagine,—and commandeth therefore that it be free from all government of Bishops—neither shall the Bishop of</hi> Chichester, <hi>though it be in his Diocesse, make any Ordinations there, nor grieve it any thing, nor execute any kind of government, or authority there; but that it be as free</hi> (saith he) <hi>from all his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as my own Dominicall (or Demesne) Chappell.

And this also by my Regall authority,—I ordain, that the Abbot shall be Lord and Judge of all things in his own Church, and within one league round about it, &amp;c.</hi> see the Charter at large. Here it appeareth, that this victorious King <hi>Will.</hi> 1. took himself to have, <hi>Pallium Ecclesiasticae jurisdictionis,</hi> the fulnesse of Ecclesiasticall power; and as the supream Magistrate thereof, not only abridgeth and revoketh the jurisdiction of other Bishops within this place, as of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> but disposeth the same according to his owne pleasure, namely, to the Abbey of <hi>Battail,</hi> with so great enlargement of priviledge and authority, as no Bishop of the Kingdome hath the like. <hi>Free from all servitude, and from all things whatsoever mans invention can imagine,</hi> are exquisite words of priviledge, and how far they might stretch at those times, (when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our Laws was not a science) into Regall, or Canonicall jurisdiction, I cannot judge: but I know by <hi>Staffords</hi> case, 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>f.</hi> 18. they will now bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained with many exceptions.

As also it is, that hee should be Judge of things in his own Church, and the circuit assigned, which though here it bee but a league, I see not, but he might as well have made it ten, if it had pleased him, and by consequence a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Province. And lest the King should seem to have done this by some indulgence from the Pope, or
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62279:117"/>
connivency of his own Clergy, he saith expresly, that he doth it by his <hi>Regall authority,</hi> and that not closely, or under-hand, but <hi>Episcoporum &amp; Baronum meorum attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi> And to declare how far the Clergy of that time was from repining or impugning this his jurisdiction, the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Winton,</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> are witnesses to the Charter, and denounce a curse against the breakers thereof. One other thing also is worthy of note, that the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean Chappell, seemeth by this, not to be within the jurisdiction and Diocesse of any Bishop, but exempt and as a Regall peculiar reserved onely to the visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and immediate government of the King, or such as it pleaseth him to substitute; for the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath no jurisdiction there by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, <hi>ut pat.

                  </opener>
                  <p>THough it were high presumption for a private man, as I am, to presage what so wise a Senate as the Parliament will doe for the future, either in point of Tithes, or any other affaire of so publike concernment, yet I hope I may, without reaching above my line, take upon me to tell you, that the ground of your doubt touching their alienation of Tithes from the Ministery, (which I shall bring in its proper place) is but such as will serve rather to beare up a transient suspicion or surmise of such a matter, then a settled assurance that it either is so already, or that hereafter it will be so. For the first, <hi>That it is not so,</hi> I am sure; because,</p>
                  <p>1. They have passed an Ordinance for the Ministers recovery of Tithes, and other Ministeriall dues from such as doe detaine them, November 8. 1644. which is still in force, through the influence of their power and favour.</p>
                  <p>2. They have made competent additions to very many livings out of impropriated Tithes in the hands of Delinquents; and this they have done with so much cheerefulnesse, and beneficence on the Ministers behalfe, by the Committee for plundred Ministers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that many have cause to blesse God for them as their great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and benefactors for that manner of maintenance; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have done beyond and above any Parliament that were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62279:119"/>
before them, and they continue and persist in the making of such augmentations, as occasion is offered, to this very day.</p>
                  <p>3. They have given the repulse to divers petitions against Tithes, which by the instinct and instigation of men of unsound princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and unquiet spirits have been put up unto them.</p>
                  <p>For the second, that they will not take them away in time to come, I have these grounds, if not of infallible certainty, yet of very great probability.</p>
                  <p>Though they have resolved upon the sale of Bishops lands and revenues, in their Ordinance of November 16. 1646. for that purpose, they have made an especiall exception with respect to the maiutenance of Ministers in these words, <hi>Except parsonages appropriate, tithes, tithes appropriate, oblations, obventions, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of tithes, parsonages, vicarages, Churches, Chappels, advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, donatives, nomination, rights of patronage and presentation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In excepting the right of patronage, they meane neither to leave it to the power of the people to choose what Minister they please, (and the practice of the Honourable Committee for plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ministers sheweth the same, for they appoint and place Ministers very often without the petitions of the people, and sometimes against them, as their wisedome seeth cause; and if it were not so, many would choose such as deserved to be put out againe.) Nor to put the Ministers upon the voluntary pensions, or contributions of the people for their subsistence, but assigne them under such a title what belongeth unto them by the Laws of the Land, <hi>viz.</hi> Tithes, obventions, &amp;c. which intimates their mind not onely for the present, but for the future.</p>
                  <p>Their wisedome well knoweth that the Revenue of Tithes as it is most ancient for the originall of it, and most generall in practice, both for times and places, so it hath the best warrant from the word of God (not onely in the old Testament, which none can deny, but in the new, which though it be denyed by some, is averred by others, as D. <hi>Carleton,</hi> M. <hi>Roberts,</hi> D. <hi>Sclater,</hi> M. <hi>Bagshaw,</hi> in their treatises of Tithes, and yet unrefuted by any) and from the Laws of many Christian States, especially from the Statutes of our Kingdome, whereof abundant evidence is given in the booke of the learned Antiquary, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

for them, the people are backward enough to pay to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters a competent maintenance; and if Tithes should be put down by the Parliament, it would be very much adoe to bring them up any other way to any reasonable proportion of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for their support; and so in most places the Ministery would be reduced to extreame poverty, and that poverty would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce contempt of their calling, and that contempt atheisme.</p>
                  <p>4. That it is evident that such as make the loudest noyse against the tenure of Tithes, are as opposite to the office and calling of Ministers as to their maintenance; and intend by their left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed Logicke (because as the saying is, the Benefit or Benefice is allotted to the office) to make way for the taking away of the Ministery, by the taking away of Tithes; and not to wait the leisure of consequentiall operation, (according to the craft of <hi>Julian,</hi> who robbed the Church of meanes, expecting the want of wages would in time bring after it a want of workmen) but presently to beare down both, as Relatives mutually inferre one another, as well by a negative as a positive inference; and so as the Parliament having put down the office of the Prelacy, now makes sale of their lands, they, if they could prevaile for the discarding of Tithes, would by the same argument (cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and slander) presently and importunately presse for depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Ministery. And we see how they take upon them with equall confidence and diligence, not onely to write, but<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>5. That if rights, so firmely set upon so many solid foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, should be supplanted, it would much weaken the tenure or title that any man hath to his lands, or goods, and would be a ready plea for rash innovators; and the rather, because of the manner of the Anabaptists proceedings, who began their claime of Christian liberty with a<note n="b" place="margin">Sleydan Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. l. 5. fol. 71. a</note> relaxation <hi>of Tithes,</hi> and went on to take off the Interdict or restraint in <hi>hunting, fishing,</hi> and <hi>fowling,</hi> wherein they would allow neither Nobility, nor Gentry, any more priviledge then the meanest peasant.

                  <p>2 As for money, so for commodities to be bought with it, the prices have been very various; In the<note n="b" place="margin">See Polt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg. Edict.

And I well remember that not very many yeares agoe there was a controversie brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commissioners of charitable uses in Cheshire; wherein was discovered the cheapnesse of things in former times: the case was thus. There was a legacy of twenty markes given to the parish of Wood-church in that County to buy oxen to till the ground of poore men, with which small summe at the time of the dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (about sevenscore yeares before) were bought no fewer then twenty yoke of oxen; which because the poore people were not able so to keep that they might be strong to labour, it was thought fit to sell them and to buy in their stead as many milch kine as the mony would reach unto, which were to be hired at a low rate to such as were not able to buy such cattell for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But it is yet a cheaper price we read of in <hi>Edward</hi> the first his dayes, when by <hi>Stat. Westm.</hi> an oxe was to be sold but at 5. s. so in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeare of <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. cited in <hi>Cokes</hi> Instit. part 2. p. 410. How rates are raised in the present age (whether by scarcity of things, or by the increase of people, or multiplication of coyne, or all) is not unknowne to any, and too much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally by many whose portion is too penurious for their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary expences. Nor is this great difference of rates, either for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or for goods, brought to passe on the sodaine, but raised by degrees; so that if the rule of tithing should be laid down, the Ministers wages must be changed, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> was in <hi>Labans</hi> service, many times over, which would be an intricate trouble to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to severall variations of persons, and places; to which inconvenience the maintenance by Tithes is not obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; nor to any other, which may be compared with such as will hardly be separated (if at all) from the alienation of Tithes.</p>
                  <p>That if any innovation be made in this matter, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be displeased with it, (as they will quickly be displeased with any thing which puts them to cost) they will take the more boldnesse to contemne it, because it is new, and for that it neither hath, nor is like to have such a ratification of authority, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or humane, by constitution or prescription, as tithing hath had; no, though it should be supposed to last to the end of the world.

                  <p>To these I could adde divers other considerations of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which cannot be hid from the prudence of such a multitude of sage Counsellors as that most Honourable Senate the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consisteth of; which maketh me confident that before they give assent to any such petitions as are put up against Tithes, they will be pleased to heare what the Assemblie of Divines can say in answer to such objections, as are framed against them, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence either of Scripture or religious reason.</p>

                     <p>AGainst this, that which moved you to thinke the Parliament would take away Tithes, was, that you have read in one of the newes bookes, that the Knights and Gentlemen of <hi>Kent</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented a petition to the Honourable House of Commons, against the payment of Tithes unto Ministers, and that they received thanks from the Speaker in the name of the House for that service, and that it is held fit to be a leading case for all other Counties of the Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>You must beware how you believe the newes bookes, for they are many times ignorantly and inconsiderately erroneous, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laciously false, out of an ill affection to some, and apparent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality to others.</p>
                     <p>For the Petition it selfe, 1. It commeth not as from the Knights and Gentlemen of that County in common, (who I am credibly informed are not very well pleased with it) but from the Committee of <hi>Kent,</hi> who (if they be like the Committees in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places) are not all of them men of sound, and orthodox Judgement, neither for matter of Tithes, nor for divers other Tenets of Religion.</p>
                     <p>2. Howsoever they professe a good meaning to establish a sufficient maintenance <hi>for godly and well deserving Ministers;</hi> a very good meaning to extend it so farre as to succor their wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62279:122"/>
and fatherlesse children, as we see by the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> proposition of their new project. It will be a probleme (which the present age perhaps will not be able to resolve) who the Trusties in after times will accept for such Ministers; although they may have cause to suspect that some part of <hi>Kent</hi> for the present is not so refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as it should be; Anabaptists and other sectaries having mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many into adverse principles, not onely to Tithes, but to other matters of moment, concerning mans duty both of the first and second Table.</p>
                     <p>3. For their exceptions against the received maintenance by Tithes they say first, in generall, <hi>That they bewayle the sad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Country, in respect of the uncertaine floting, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of the Ministry, occasioned by the very nature, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and adjuncts of the way of Tithes; which the experience of thus many ages doth plainly evince to be miserably attended with these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing mischiefes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I answer;</p>
                     <p>That the miserable and floting condition of the Ministry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from the nature, manner or adjuncts of their subsistence by way of Tithes; nor doth the experience of thus many ages (that is, of the precedent ages hitherto) evince so much; for God (who is omniscient, and therefore cannot but foresee all subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inconveniences for many hundred yeares to come) establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that meanes to be a standing and settled maintenance for his service; and the misery of the Ministry proceeds not from the nature or manner of Tithes (which to affirme may seem to coast too neere their conceipt who imagine God to be the author of sinne) but from the ill consciences of men, who make no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to rob God of his right, <hi>Malach.</hi> 3. (for Tithes are his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 30.) and Ministers may suffer very much in the present age, because there be many Anabaptisticall sectaries (from which <hi>Kent</hi> is not more free, but as some say, more infected then some other Counties) who take up importunate clamours against Tithes as Antichristian and Jewish; and there will be the more by the countenance they may have from such a petition; and such petitioners, because divers of them are of good reputation, not onely for wealth, but for their wisedome and learning well affected to Religion and the Parliament; and I beleeve it the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62279:122"/>
rather, because some godly ministers have expressed their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation both of it &amp; them, though therein I conceive they shewed more of the simplicity of the dove then of the wisedome of the serpent; for albeit their meaning might be so to gather the Tithes, and to put them into such hands, as might be rather for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters ease then for their losse, no man can prophesie that so good a spirit will descend upon their successors, nor how crosse they may prove to such a Christian Intention.</p>
                     <p>2. For the particular exceptions, they say; first, <hi>That for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

                        <hi>of this subsistence it is a very mystery, and secret, not easily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much art and industry attained unto; namely for the Minister to know his dues demandable, or the parishioners their dues payable; whence ariseth that multitude of scandalous and vexatious suites and brables betwixt Ministers and people, which doth fill all the Courts at Westminster, and other the Justice-sittings in the Country like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with causes in this kinde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this charge there be two particulars contained, first, of the difficulty of knowing the right of Tithes; secondly, of the vexatious suites raised betwixt pastors and people upon that ground.</p>
                     <p>For the first, It is a very strange mystery, that after so many hundred yeares of Tithing it should not yet be knowne what it is; but I doubt not but in this case the right is better knowne unto Ministers that should receive Tithes, then acknowledged by the people that ought to pay them; And how can they set up their new designe upon the old foundation of Tithing, as they project it, if it cannot be knowne what is the Ministers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandable due, what the peoples payable duty: that modell is more like to be a mystery which they propound, since it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of in this Kingdome untill they had devised it; and as like it is to prove a misery to Ministers, if their portion should come into no better hands then most of theirs, who have petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned against Tithes since this Session of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>And secondly, for the multitude of scandalous and vexatious suites, they make no more against the Right of Tithes, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst borrowing and lending, buying and selling, letting of leases, setling inheritances, Joyntures, &amp;c. upon which titles are set the greatest number of suites; and for suites for Tithes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62279:123"/>
if the law allow them a right, it alloweth them a remedy to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that right; and for the suites that were occasioned thereby, they are neither so many as is here presented, nor so scandalous for the Ministers part, for they may be imputed to the old avarice of worldly minded men, who being of a contrary mind to the Apostle, thinke it an hard bargaine <hi>to exchange their carnall for the Ministers spirituall things;</hi> but principally to the new principles and practises of such unreasonable reformers, as imagine they are never sarre enough removed from one extreame untill they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the other, accounting all superstitious in point of Tithing, that are not sacrilegious.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>For the manner of it, respecting either the collecting or pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Petit.</note> 
                        <hi>of Tithes, it is a mutuall scourge in the hand of Ministers and people each to other, if either or both (as too often it happens) prove covetous or crosse.</hi>

                     <p>If it be a mutuall scourge, it would well become the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">Answ.</note> of these Committee-men to enquire where the right is, and who doth the wrong, and to project a way how the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doer may be made to doe right and to give due satisfaction to such as suffer under an undeserved scourge, and I hope when our reformation is grown up to such a competent degree of strength and stature as that it may quit the service of Country Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, there will be no more cause of such a complaint then for many hundred yeares heretofore there hath been.</p>

                        <hi>mischiefes of them will appeare innumerable, if the pregnancy of onely one be but considered; namely, in the unreasonable proportion of livings, or values of Churches to which they are belonging, whence arise these inseparable evils.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By what new-found Logick will you frame such an Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> as from one particular to inferre innumerable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, particularly from the disproportion of livings? You seeme to thinke otherwise, where you say in your 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that in the distribution of the revenues for Ministers regard must be had to the desert of the person, his family, and charge;</hi> if so, certainly there is a great disproportion in deserts; and for charge it is considerable, not onely for the greatnesse of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters family, but for the dearnesse of his education; some have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62279:123"/>
spent many yeares, and a large patrimony in the University, to make them fit for the Ministery; and should not they be suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a more liberall allowance (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) then those who have been at little expence both of time &amp; estate to be duely qualified for such a calling? If the proportion of parts, and paines, of charge both Academicall, and Oeconomicall, be due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed, there will be many more livings found too little then too great for a Ministers maintenance; especially if you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him a Library (such as a learned Knight thought necessary for a Minister) of 600. l. value. But if the proportion be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, must Tithes be supplanted and their ancient Tenure abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished for such a disproportion? must the foundation be digged up because the building is too high? may not a tree, whose bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are too luxuriant, be lopped, and left entire in the bodie and roote? when a mans beard is too long, will you cut off his chinne? that out of doubt were an unreasonable reformation.</p>
                     <p>4. From this unreasonable proportion, you say, arise these<note place="margin">Petit.</note> unseparable evils. 1 <hi>That most unworthy persons, who by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or friendship or any sinister wayes can get into the greatest livings, being once invested with a legall right of freehold for their lives, securely fleece the flocke, and feed themselves without feare or care, more then to keep themselves without the compasse of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration, whilst others both painfull and conscionable both serve starve.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is not (as you call it) an unseparable evill from the proportion you speake of; for there be some men who have<note place="margin">Answ.</note> had, and at this present have great livings, not by any sinister wayes, but by such favour and friendship as is ingenuous, and just, and who keep as great a distance from desert of sequestrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as any Committee man doth within the County wherein they live. And if they carry themselves so as to be without feare and care, and without the compasse of a sequestration, in these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive and accusative times, they are more to be countenanced and encouraged then many of those who are professed adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to them. But the matter, it seemes, that troubles you is, that <hi>they are invested with a legall right of free hold for their lives,</hi> and if they have such a right, and walke so warily as to keep out of the reach of a just sequestration, why should they not enjoy

it? would you have all to be betrusted to the discretion and conscience of your arbitrary Committees? Truely Gentelemen, we are afraid to trust you so farre, as to give up such a certaine title as formerly and anciently established upon the Incumbent by the fundamentall Lawes of the Land, as the right of any person to his Temporall estate, and to stand to your arbitrary dispensations for our livelihood; lest <hi>Laban-like</hi> you should change our <hi>wages ten times:</hi> and if your petition should take place, it might prove of very ill consequence in another generation, were you never so well minded, and it may be sooner (in the next succession:) for if the Trustees should be either proud or covetous, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or licentious, hereticall, or schismaticall, the best Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters might happily be the worst dealt withall; and the right of receiving Tithes taken out of their hands might put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the passive condition of silly and impotent wards under sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and domineering <hi>Tutors</hi> or <hi>Guardians,</hi> in name <hi>such,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing lesse then assertors and defenders of their rights, as Tutors and Guardians ought to be. And that our feare and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie is not without cause in respect of Trustees and Committee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor so much of you in particular, of some of whom we have heard and beleeve much good, as of such as may have as great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority without so good an intention, we shall give you our ground out of the observation and complaint of witnesses above exception, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>well affected freemen and covenant-engaged Citizens of the City of</hi> London, <hi>in their humble representation to the right Honourable the Lords and Commons in Parliament as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,</hi> in these words. <hi>And here we may not omit to hint unto your Honours the exorbitant practises of many Committees and Committee-men, who have such an influence by meanes of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon the people, they being at their wills and in their power to doe them a displeasure, that they dare not doe otherwise, then obey their unlawfull commands, without the inevitable hazard of their peace and safety; through which meanes tyranny is exercised by one fellow-subject upon another, and justice and equity cannot enter. The cryes of all sorts of people through the land are growne so loud against the people of this vocation and profession, by reason of those grievous oppressions that are continually acted by them, that in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of affection toward our brethren, not being ignorant or insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>

                        <hi>of our owne sufferings in this kind, and the great dishonour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewing to the Parliament thereby, that we cannot but be earnest sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to your mercy and justice that such may be dissolved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. For <hi>obtainment of these livings we see such sordid compliances</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Petit.</note> 
                        <hi>with such persons as have the fattest benefices (as they count and call them) in their dispose; such artifices in contriving, making, and colouring over Simoniacall and sinfull bargaines, compacts, and matches, such chopping of Churches, and restlesse change of places, till they get into the easiest and warmest: and other such like practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses not to be named, nor yet to be prevented or removed, otherwise then by flucking up the very roote which naturally brancheth out it selfe into these foresaid mischiefes, so obstructive and destructive to all reformation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is a great deale of aggravating rhetoricke against the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<note place="margin">Answ.</note> of Church-livings. But why should all this evill be imagined rather of Ministers fat benefices as you say they are called, then of great and gainfull offices in the State? Is there not more care had, and more strict triall taken of Ministers sincerity and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity then of secular officers? surely we are bound in charity to expect a more reformed Ministery, then we have had, who will rather say unto a Simoniacall patron as <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus, Thy monie perish with thee, Acts</hi> 8. 20. then be <hi>Levies</hi> to such a <hi>Simeon</hi> in making a base and corrupt contract for a benefice. And for that you say, that <hi>such practises are not to be prevented or removed, otherwise then by plucking up the very roote, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally brancheth it selfe out into these foresaid mischiefes, so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive and destructive to all religion.</hi> Whether you meane Tithes to be this roote, or the disproportion of Benefices, or the right of patronage and protection, I cannot tell, but sure I am, that the Apostle cals <hi>covetousnesse the root of all evill,</hi> and so the root of that evill which sometimes passeth betwixt a Patron and his Chaplaine: and may as frequently, and with as much injury be found betwixt some Committee-men and Trustees and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of their choice, as any other. But as I am confident that there will be an amendment on the Ministers part, by the regular way of the Parliaments reformation, according to the directions of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Ministers already printed &amp; accordingly practised, so will it bee not onely possible, but easie for the State to finde out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62279:125"/>
a fit means to prevent prevarication on the part of the Patron; but if Tithes be removed from their ancient foundation, and lest loose to the disposall of Trustees or Committee-men, they will be a more ready prey for the covetous into whose hands they may come, and from whose hands perhaps they cannot without great difficulty be redeemed.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, in the close of this Petition, the Petitioners shew great care that the Ministers may be freed from the incumbrance of Tithes, <hi>to serve the Lord without distraction, and to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Word of God and Prayer, and to be onely employed to make ready a people prepared for the Lord;</hi> And so they may do if they be maintained by Tithes; for that means of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance gives a man occasion of more and better acquaintance with the particular disposition of his people, and it is his part to <hi>be diligent to know the state of his flock, Prov.</hi> 27. 23. And for that trouble which may be thought inconsistent with the Calling of a Minister, if his means be sufficient, he may have a servant to take it from him, and ease him of it. I know a Minister whose Benefice was a Vicarage, and his Parish so large, that it was 11 miles in length, and of a proportionable breadth, yet did it not put him to the expence of one day in a year to compound for, or gather in his dispersed portion.</p>
                     <p>Now for the successe and acceptance of the Petition in the Honourable House of Commons, to which it was presented; if such an innovation had been granted for that County, it had been fitter to have been made a <hi>Sibboleth,</hi> for that <hi>cauthe</hi> or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the Kingdome (for so the word <hi>Kent</hi> signifieth) as their custome of <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Gavelkind</hi> is a custome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Kent,</hi> whereby the land of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is equally divided among all his sons, or the land of a brother equally divided among his brethren, if he have no issue of his own, this was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a custome as appears by the Stat. in the 18. year of <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. that there were not above 30 or 40 persons in <hi>Kent</hi> that held by any other tenure; but <hi>Anuo</hi> 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>ca.</hi> 3. many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon Petition got an alteration thereof.</note> 
                        <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> then to be made a president or pattern of conformity to other parts of the Kingdome, as the News-Book of the same week prescribed that to his Reader.</p>
                     <p>But the answer of the worthy Senate was such as may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm us in our confidence, that they will still continue to be gracious Patrons of the maintenance of Ministers, and that they will be more ready to ratifie precedent Statutes and their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62279:125"/>
own Ordinance made in that behalf, then to dissettle their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure which is founded upon them, and to make Ministers arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Pensioners to such as may be so far swayed by misprision of judgement, or personall dis-affection, as to deal most penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously with those, who being truly valued (without erroneous mistaking or injurious misliking) may both by the eminence of their parts, and their faithfulnesse in their places, deserve the most ample, and most honourable Revenue. I will give you their answer in their own words, which are most authentick, they are these.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>Speaker by order of the House of Commons did give the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners (the Committee of</hi> Kent) <hi>thanks for their former services, and took notice of their good affections to the Publique; and did acquaint them, That the great businesses of the Kingdome are now instant and pressing upon them, and that they will take the Petition into consideration in due time, and that in the mean time they take care that Tithes may be paid according to Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there are some in the Parliament that hold the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance<note place="margin">Object.</note> of Ministers by Tithes to be Jewish and Popish, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will give countenance to Petitions that are put up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and doe what they can under such titles to render them offensive to such as are truly religious, especially to those who have most power to abolish them.</p>
                     <p>1. It may be there are some such, and if there be some such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<note place="margin">Answ.</note> so many, it is neither to be thought strange, nor true, for such a number of them as may be able to carry the cause against the continuance of Tithes.</p>
                     <p>2. For the tearm Jewish, it is mis-applyed against Tithes, as it was by the Prelates of late, &amp; is by the Anabaptists at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent against the Sabbath; nor are they more Popish then Jewish; For the Papists, though their people pay them, and their Priests receive them, yet they for the most part holding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to depend meerly upon Ecclesiastical constitution, made no scruple of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them into secular titles or uses, as in Impropriations in the hands of Lay-men, and many other distributions made out of them severall ways, without any respect to the service of the Sanctuary. Nor is there any thing in the payment and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Tithes under the state of the Gospel, which may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62279:126"/>
be suspected to have any savour of Judaisme, or Popery, save onely the payment of Tenths by the Ministers to the King, as hath been lately well observed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <p>The fear of sacriledge hath been of such force with some hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Moralists, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> observeth in his Morals, that if they pulled down a house contiguous to a temple, they would leave some of that part standing which was next unto it, lest they should with it take away any part of the Temple it selfe. Wherein if they shewed any spice of superstition, it will be more capable of pardon, or lesse liable to punishment at the hand of God, then we may expect if we proceed hastily to lay violent hands upon any thing peculiarly entituled to his honour, who is the authour and giver of all things to all men.</p>
                     <p>2. If the plea of a divine right for Tithes (supposing it set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them up too high) should incline to irritation in some to make opposition against them, why should not the contrary te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net which peremptorily taketh them down too low, calling them Jewish, Antichristian, and Popish, and that undeniably, (as hath been said, but never can be proved) move others the rather to retaine them, and confirm them? chiefly the Parliament (whose authority is most engaged for their justification) and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially since the servants of God have had possession of them by so many laws, and so long a prescription; for according to

                     </p>
                     <p>3. If the Parliament doe not in their approbation of Tithes come up to the tenure of divine right, they may yet be willing enough to establish them upon other grounds, and leave Divines to the liberty of their judgment &amp; consciences to plead for them according to the principles of their own profession, as in their Ordinances made for setting up of the Presbyterial Government, though yet they be not satisfied of the claim of divine right for it, they were pleased to authorize it by their Ordinance, and to require Divines to prepare the people for the reception there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by preaching of it, and for it; so as both to clear it, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it (so farre as they could) by the sacred Scripture.</p>
                     <p>And on the other side while they approve it, though but by a civill assent, (as to a prudentiall design, untill they see more light, which they look for in the Answer to their Queres propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Assembly of Divines) the Presbyterians who hold it in the highest esteem take none offence that they proceed no farther, and professe themselves well satisfied with their civill sanction; so one of the learned Commissioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath said, in the name of the rest, in these words, <hi>If they shall in a</hi>

                     <p>2. For the boldnesse of the Anabaptists at this time, and in this Cause, and this City, there may be divers conjectural reasons in particular given thereof, besides the generall already obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; as,</p>
                     <p>1. Because they advance in their hopes of a toleration of their Sect; and to promote that hope they have been so ready to engage in military service, with a designe no doubt to get that liberty by force (if they be able) which by favour of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they cannot obtain.</p>
                     <p>2. For this matter of Tithes, they might be more forward to oppose their tenure, because it is a very popular and plausible argument, wherein they might have the good wils of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they might prevail, and their conceits that they did so, (though they did not) because they would <hi>be very apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi>

                        <hi>what they vehemently desire may come to passe;</hi> and it is not to be doubted but a dram of seeming probability will prevail more with most worldlings to spare their purses, then an ounce of sound reason to put them to charges.</p>
                     <p>3. They might take some encouragement to dispute against Tithes in this City, because there is a project to change the maintenance of the Ministers set on foot by many worthy, and well-minded Citizens, which yet in truth makes nothing for the Anabaptists opinion, who would have Ministers maintained by meer benevolence; for the Citizens, as they intend a more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall allowance then the former, (since they see many of their Churches are destitute of Ministers, because their Ministers have been destitute of means) so they mean that it shall be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, setled by Authority, and not left arbitrary to the courtesie of men.</p>
                     <p>3. For the two disputes, the one managed betwixt M. <hi>W. I.</hi> and M. <hi>B. C.</hi> the other purposed betwixt M. <hi>I. Cr.</hi> and the same <hi>B. C.</hi> but disappointed, it makes nothing at all for the taking away of Tithes; For as touching the former, they who were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62279:128"/>
not possessed with prejudice, or corrupted with covetousnesse against the truth, were much confirmed in the lawfulnesse of such rates as are paid in <hi>London</hi> under the title of Tithes, though indeed they are not Tithes, and of such onely was the debate at that time.</p>
                     <p>For the intended debate which was to be touching the divine right of Tithes, though some godly and prudent men thought it should not have been taken in hand without the warrant of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique authority, yet they made no doubt but that the truth of the cause, or ability of the man, who undertook the defence of it against M. <hi>C.</hi> would prevail unto victory. But for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, it was by the warrant of the Lord Major of the City, to them both, interdicting the dispute, which was both without M. <hi>I. Cr.</hi> his knowledge, and against his good will; yet he obeyed the prohibition, and when his Antagonist insisted, and urged the performance of what was agreed upon, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the contrary command of the Lord Major, his answer was, that it was agreeable to the Anabaptists principles to disobey Authority, but not according to the principles of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians. And lest <hi>B. C.</hi> should take it for a token of distrust in his cause, and make it an occasion of vain-glory, either against the cause or person of M. <hi>I. Cr.</hi> he proposed the printing of M. <hi>B. C.</hi> his arguments against Tithes, and engaged himself to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer them in print, and so to refer both to the judgment of al un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed Readers, which was the best way to give clear and full satisfaction to such as doubt on which side the truth is swayed by the most authentick testimony and soundest reasons.</p>
                     <p>It is no part of my task for the present to argue farther for Tithes, then may answer the doubt you have proposed to me, which is, of the Parliaments purpose and proceedings touching the establishing, or abolishing of them.</p>

                     <p>Wherein the Authors say much in the outside, but make no answerable proof in the inside of the Booke. They direct it in the Title page as <hi>a Declaration to divers worthy Ministers in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and in the beginning of the body of the Book they present it as <hi>a joynt Declaration of the people of severall parishes for their opinion concerning Tithes,</hi> as a Reply <hi>to certaine papers from some Ministers, pretending to prove Tithes due by authority of Scripture.</hi> It had been faire dealing if they had printed those pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Ministers, that it might appeare how well they had answered them.</p>
                     <p>But for the confident contradiction of the Divine right they alledge,</p>

                        <item>4. The trouble of them to the Minister.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>For the first; they referre the <hi>originall</hi> of them under the Gospell, for the author, to Pope <hi>Vrbane;</hi> for the time, to the three hundredth yeare after Christs ascension; and for proofe of both, they cite <hi>Origen, Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> at large without any particular quotation to find what they cite: <hi>untill which time,</hi> say they, <hi>there was community of all things among Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But first, they should tell us which <hi>Vrban</hi> it was, (who they say began to bring Tithes into use for the maintenance of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) for there were 8 of that Name, and of those 8 (if <hi>Origen</hi> be a witnesse of it) it must be <hi>Vrban</hi> the first, Anno 227 who sate but 6 yeares, &amp; 7 moneths, &amp; there was not another Pope called <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> untill the year 1087. which was long after the latest of those three, <hi>viz. Gregory,</hi> (whether they mean <hi>Greg. Nazianz.</hi> or <hi>Greg. Nyssen,</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> surnamed,) the <hi>Great,</hi> Bishop of Rome; and <hi>if Origen</hi> testified so much of Tithes recalled by Pope <hi>Vrban,</hi>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62279:129"/>
their originall must be ancienter then 300 years after the ascens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that <hi>Vrban</hi> lived not beyond the year 234, and <hi>Origen</hi> flourished Anno 226. and if Tithes began when Christians gave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the community of goods, as these men say p. 2. in the name of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but bring no proofe of it, then had Ministers a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in Tithes as soon as others had a propiety of estate; and sooner it could not be. And that which caused this community, the persecution of the Church (which reached to his age: for the<note place="margin">Tom. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. p. 104.</note> next predecessor to that <hi>Vrban, Calixtus</hi> was a Martyr) might very well cause a suspension of Tithes for all that time.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>For the tenure of Tithes;</hi> there be 3 disputable opinions:<note place="margin">Decimae sunt pura eleemosyna, &amp; parochiani possunt propter peccata suorum praelatorum, ad libitum suum auserre eas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>3. Some Ceremoniall, as these parishioners doe. There is the least reason for this last opinion. For Tithes were taken as a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute by God himselfe as the chiefe Lord of all the earth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 30. whereby hee is acknowledged giver of all; and that it is in his power to curse the earth with barrennesse, and to starve the creatures that live upon it; and this is true of all ages, and therefore we reade of payment of Tithes by <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 14. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 4. and vowing of Tithes by <hi>Jacob,</hi> before the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Priesthood was established, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 22.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Object.</note>But sacrifices, say they, are ancienter then Tithes, and were long before the Ceremoniall Law was ordained, yet they are not to be continued in the time of the Gospel.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Answ.</note>True, because they were types of future things to be exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the New Testament, but Tithes have no typicall intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their institution or use, being set apart by God for himselfe, and given by him as the wages to his servants for doing his work; which he assigned to the <hi>Levites</hi> for their time, and made them sutable to their state by peculiar ordinances, as <hi>Num.</hi> 18. 26, 27.

&amp;c. <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 3. 4. 5. which expired with the Priesthood, though Tithes in generall did not; and therefore such particulars are no more to be urged against that maintenance of Ministers in the New Testament, then the Jewish observations of the Sabbath against the keeping of a Christian Sabbath at this day.</p>
                     <p>3. For that they say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>of inequality</hi> in respect of <hi>impropriations,</hi> p. 6. in respect of <hi>tradesmen in Townes and Cities,</hi> who gaine more then farmers and pay no Tithes, p. 9. and in respect of the losse which may befall the farmer, when he hath not increase to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his cost and labour, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the two first, it is worthy consideration of those who are in authority how to reduce them to more equality. For the third; the exception lyeth no more against Tithes now, then in the time when they acknowledge them most in force; and when it proveth an ill yeare with the plowman, it will be well for him to consider whether his unconscionablenesse in Tithes have not procured a curse upon his portion, according to the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the third of <hi>Malac.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, for the <hi>trouble of the Minister;</hi> 1 If he have but a little Tithe, it will be no great trouble for him to order it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since he may lawfully exchange it into money. 2. If he have a great Tithe, it will beare the charge of a servant to ease him of the trouble. And 3. If this inconvenience could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, (as well it may) there would follow farre greater upon the taking away Tithes, such as before we have observed.</p>
                     <p>With these exceptions against this revenue of Tithes they have delivered something worthy the acceptation of Ministers, which is p. 5. 6. <hi>It is the desire,</hi> say they, <hi>of al Gods people (&amp; so it ought to be) that the Ministers of the Gospell should have a sufficient mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance allowed them, nay not onely a sufficient maintenance, but an abundant, a large and rich maintenance, such a maintenance as they may live liberally without any other imployment but the Ministery; Nor is it fit or becomming Christians that their Minister should live in a meane condition either of diet or cloathing, but as he is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in calling, so ought he to have a more large &amp; better mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in those respects then others, for he feeding the soules with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, the word of God, the people ought to feed his body libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with their base temporall things:</hi> and in the next page say they;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62279:130"/>
                        <hi>And is it not a shame for a rich and flourishing common-wealth to have a poore and bare Ministery, either in the generall, or in some particulars? &amp; yet into such a condition have Impropriations brought the Ministery of this common-wealth in very many places.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>This may suffice for this little Treatise, which, though little, if it had not been lesse in weight then in length, I would not have been so observant of the importunity of the Printers calling for my paper, as to dispatch mine animadversions upon it in the short interim of one night, betwixt rising from supper and reposing for sleepe, which yet had been too much if most readers were not too readily prepared to entertaine any Text that makes for their commodity, whether by acquiring advantage, or sparing expences.</p>
                     <p>Now for your secondary doubt concerning the disposall of your sonne, give me leave, Sir, to give you my sence fully and freely in the case.</p>

I see by you and him (which I am sorry to observe, yet I feare it is like to prove too true in all ages) that if there be not sufficient and certaine meanes allotted to the labourers in the Lords harvest, he is like to have but a few workemen to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, and goe through with it; therefore those that <hi>Julian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> take away the hire of spirituall labourers, make way, as much as in them lyeth, for the marring of the harvest; for either there will be a want of workemen, or of such sufficiency in them as may make the worke to prosper in their hands: hence is the miserable condition of the Greeke Church, living (if not langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing) under the dominion of the Turkes, where their Clergy as they are the meanest sort of men, (like <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Priests, who though they were to serve in the <hi>house of high places, were the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of the people,</hi> 1 Kings 12. 31.) so are they as despicable for their ignorance and meane qualifications every way as for their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,<note place="margin">G.

                     <p>2. But I feare no such fayling of maintenance for Ministers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, as may occasion such a discouragement to parents that they should not be willing to dispose of their children in that<note place="margin">Vincent.

                     <p>3. Yet if that were true which you reade in the weekely pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, or which you had by report, of the likelyhood of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe Tithes by the Parliament, I must tell you plainly as your friend, I like not your wavering touching the disposall of your sonne; for if he be furnished with personall abilities for the service of the Sanctuary, if he be (as I hope he is) a man of holy life and conversation, if he find himselfe inwardly moved by the holy Ghost to enter into that holy function, it will be a greater sacriledge in you then robbing of the Church of so much Tithe as would maintaine him, to divert him from the service of Christ, and salvation of soules, through distrust of the divine providence for his support.

But being far from my books, and having not so much as that Treatise of his by me, or any note out of it, I shall no doubt forget, mistake, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and misplace many things. Wherein (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) I must entreat thy patience and favour.</p>
                  <p>It being brought unto me, I ranne over divers leaves thereof, wherein I met <hi>multa verba, nulla verbera;</hi> but judging therefore the Author by his worke, I thought neither of them worth the answering: himselfe, as it seemeth, some rude Naball delighting in contentions and uncivill speech: wherein I will not contend with him, onely I will consider of his reasons, though indeed they are such as will shew him to be a weake adversarie <hi>Qui strepit magis quàm sauciat.</hi> And therefore though I sit safe out of his dint, yet will I let the reader see, how vainely he bestoweth his shot, and how farre from the marke.</p>

                  <p>First, he quarrelleth with me about the title of my booke, in that I use the word <hi>Ecclesia</hi> for a materiall Church, or (as in contempt he termeth it) a <note n="*" place="margin">Steeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.</note>

Surely if I guesse right some Dictionary hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, for perhaps his reading reacheth not so far, as to resolve him herein: but if two thousand authorities be sufficient to defend me withall, I speak it without <hi>hyperbole,</hi> I assure my selfe I could produce them. Who
<pb facs="tcp:62279:136"/>
knoweth not how ordinary a thing it is, to have one word signifie both the persons, and the place: as <hi>Civitas,</hi> the citizens, or towne; <hi>Collegium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I am sure he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that where it is said, <hi>He loveth our nation and hath built us a synagogue:</hi> It is not there meant of the persons, he built them a congregation, but of the place. A <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> signifie both one and the same thing, the congregation, or place of congregation; in which sense we Christians notwithstanding use onely the word <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> for our congregations, and houses of prayer, for that the Jews had taken up the other word, for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb facs="tcp:62279:137"/>Another of his quarrels is that I apply the place of <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>cap.</hi> 56. 7. <hi>My house shall be called an house of prayer,</hi> locally to places of prayer, whereas he saith, it was spoken figuratively of the congregation of the faithfull. I exclude not that sense, but I assure my selfe our Saviour Christ, when he whipt the sellers out of the Temple, not out of the congregation, applied this Scripture to the very place of prayer: and it is question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that the old and late classicke writers so expound it.</p>

                  <p>Againe it much offends him, that I interpret the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 12. <hi>Despise ye the Church of God?</hi> as spoken of the materiall place, which after his manner he will also have to be onely understood of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and had the word <hi>ecclesia</hi> no other signification, then doubtlesse he had obtained the cause. But obserue I pray, what I have formerly said touching that point, and then take into your consideration, the words of the Apostle as they lye in that chapter.

Yet let us see which is more probable, or at least whether my trespasse deserves

                  <p>This foundation being now laid upon the words of the Apostle himselfe, let us see how it hath been since understood by the Fathers, and Doctors of the Church, as well ancient as moderne. <hi>Hieroms</hi> opinion appeareth already in my booke, and <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> you shall heare anon. But this man despiseth the first, and therefore I am sure he will account as lightly of the second.

Yet to satisfie some others, whose eares perhaps may be better in tune, I will cite one who for humblenesse of spirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of life, and admirable learning for the time he lived in, hath ever since been venerable throughout the world; and no forreigner but our Countreyman <hi>Bede,</hi> who upon these words <hi>Numquid domos non habetis?—an Ecclesiam Dei contemnitis?</hi>

                  <p>But come we now to that part of my booke which puts him most out of patience above all the rest, my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the 83. <hi>Psalme</hi> to such as destroy Churches, and bereave them of their maintenance. This he saith, fitteth my matter as an Elephants skin doth a gnat, yea it hath no cohaerency therewith either figuratively, alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall, or anagogicall. To retort his scoffe I might say, it seemeth, an Elephant of absurdity to the Gnat of his learning: but I desire rather to satisfie him (<hi>Si malitia non mutaverit intellectum</hi>) then to disgrace him.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied if there be a correspondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the body of our Church and Common wealth, with the body of the Church and Common wealth of the Jewes, the same must also hold proportionably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb facs="tcp:62279:139"/>
the members thereof, and in consequence that the passages of state, of government, of peace, warre, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, oppression, prosperity, adversity, and other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents either active or passive, must hold some aspect and analogy, one unto the other. And then also that whatsoever is denounced against the enemies of the one, trencheth comparatively against the enemies of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Come then unto the matter. The prophet inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against them that seeke to spoile, oppresse, or disturbe the Church of God seated in India; be it openly by war, or secretly by some stratagem of wit: Doth not this thwart them also that attempt the like in our Church? Yes, saith he, against them of the King of Spaines Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado in 88. and those of the Powder Treason, wherein the universall desolation both of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Church and Common-wealth were not onely projected, but attempted by our enemies.</p>
                  <p>But shew me, will he say, what hath the appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of a pelting Parsonage, or the pulling downe of <hi>a stone-house,</hi> which you call a Church, is unto this? for the one is an Elephant, the other but a Gnatt.</p>
                  <p>I answer. <hi>Eadem est ratio partium quae est totius.</hi> And out of this reason and analogy our Saviour Christ argueth him that casteth but a lascivious looke to be guilty of the great Commandement, <hi>non maechaberis,</hi> as well as him that committed the very heinous act it selfe: and then also that whatsoever the Prophet denounceth against them that spoile the Church in generall, the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends upon every particular man, that spoileth the same in any particular part: as, <hi>Omne genus praedicatur de omnibus &amp; singulis suis speciebus etiam infimis &amp; indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the taking up of these parsonages and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb facs="tcp:62279:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of places of publike prayer is a spoile of the Church of God, appeareth in this, that the meanes and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the seruice of God, and of his ministers is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diminished, and destroyed, which subtraction of maintenance from the minister, God in <hi>Malachi</hi> 3. 8. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth to be a spoyling of himselfe, for that his seruice is thereby hindred, and his Church impaired. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this man affirmeth, that although there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a <hi>stone-Church</hi> or minister in the kingdome, yet the Church, and service of God might stand well enough, for that every mans family is a Church, and every ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thereoftyed to instruct his servants, every father his children: yet by example of the Church in the time of the Apostles, we ought to have places of publicke pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and some to instruct these masters and fathers; for the husbandman, the artisan, the day-labourer, are not commanded to neglect their vocation and turne preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as too many now adayes do. And though perhaps some such good men out of their devotion would preach now and then to instruct their brethren, yet who shall do it ordinarily, and where shall the Assembly be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; for every town hath not a Guild-hall, a Sessions<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, a Cock-pit, or a Play-house fit for such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. And though they may, as he saith, serve God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with <hi>Paul;</hi> in a dungeon with <hi>Ieremy,</hi> or on a muck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill with <hi>Iob,</hi> yet heat or cold, wet or wind will hinder them at one time or other: so that doubtlesse it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry necessary to have a man, and a place publickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the service of God in every Congregation. And then since this man cannot perform his office with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out maintenance, and such a place as we speake of, the taking of them away puts him from doing his duty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives his parishioners of their instruction, and then by
<pb facs="tcp:62279:140"/>
consequence spoyles the Church of God; and so the curse of the Psalme lyeth justly against them.</p>
                  <p>But let us now take a view of the gnat he speaketh of, and which he contemneth so much in respect of the smalnesse thereof. Had there been but three or foure of these livings taken from the Church, his fancy might have had the more colour, to use such fond applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but if it cometh to three or foure hundred, it groweth now beyond the size of a Gnat, what shall we then say of 3845. livings, or appropriate Parsonages,<note place="margin">☞</note> thus taken from the Church, which is more by 1126. then the halfe of all those that remaine, and within 897. as many as them all: for the Churches not appropriate are but 5439. through all England and Wales. So that the parishes of the Churches appropriate containe neare about the one halfe of the kingdome, which is more, if <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Dardanus</hi> (as I take it) deceive<note place="margin">Dordanus.</note> me not, then twice so much as all the land of Iudea, though we reckon the kingdome of Israel into it, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times more then the kingdome of Iudea, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined but the two tribes onely that stucke to God; and of whose times this Psalme seemeth to be a prophecie. And thus ye see both the gnat and the Elephant that he speaketh of, though I mean not to propose them to you by way of comparison, but discover his intemperance or want of judgement.</p>
                  <p>But to support his credit with a broken prop, it may be he will say, that upon the appropriating these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and transferring of them to the King, there was a provision left in most of the parishes for a Vicar, or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to do divine service there, and that nothing was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them but superfluity: so to keepe them in diet, and bridle their immoderate luxurie, which he proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb facs="tcp:62279:140"/>
to be so exorbitant as scarcely all England, and Virginia to boot, can satisfie. Lord blesse us! is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that our Church-men should become so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous? or hath <hi>Shimei</hi> thus railed against the body of them without his perill? I hope much better of their temperance, then of his tongue: But I leave them to make their own Apology, for I have digressed beyond my purpose, and therefore will spend no time in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing upon the provision made for Vicars and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in these Churches appropriate. He seemeth to be of <hi>Micahs</hi> mind, that ten shekels, or a matter of foure nobles a year, besides diet and a suite of apparell is a faire maintenance for one of our Ministers. In which point I have else-where declared my selfe at large, and will not therefore here insist upon it; onely this I would know of him, what surplusage, or superfluity there could be to give unto the King, or take from the Church, when besides the maintenance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, much was to be disposed by them in relieving the poore, and other pious uses.</p>

Esto quod de decimis dissentiant, an sint de jure divino? in isto tamen non consentire solùm, sed &amp; conjurasse plane omnes videatur, Deo dicata surripi non posse in exitium ecclesiae. Quid autem est ecclesiam excindere si hoc non sit? panem tollere ministrorum, quin &amp; sine noxa? At Ecclesiam (aies) in hoc connivisse; Episcopos conspirasse; parliamentaria ipsa comitia Herculano nodo rem conclusisse, &amp; sanxisse? Sanxisse dicam? imo Deum testor quaenam sit sanctitas in ista sanctione. Sed de re summa, summa cum humilitate. Nosti quàm lenis sit ecclesia, tunicam subtracturo, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium etiam dimisit. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.

Taceo technas, dolum, insidias, quae in tranfigendo negotio forte non defuerant.
<pb facs="tcp:62279:142"/>
Sed esto ecclesiam laeta fronte haec omnia concessisse; Certe eatenus cum Baronio (Ascanio Cardinali respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente) in sententiam ivero, Ecclesiam nihil posse in se statuere, hoc est, in suam perniciem. Idem enim est &amp; se abnuere, &amp; ministros suos non alere. Nam in primis catalysis illius legibus, nihil statutum est de ministrorum alimonio: mel abripitur, sed nec loculi relinquuntur, nec alveus. Etiam ejiciuntur tam apes, quàm faci, nulla omnino habita examinis ratione. Hoc justum dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris? Concilio certe tum lapsum est, quod in caeteras itemque regni ecclesias non grassatum sit. Quid enim emeruit ecclesia Petri, ut suis juribus potius privaretur quàm Pauli? Quid ecclesia unius populi magis quam aletrius? à neutris enim peccatum est. Ecce aenigmatis solutionem. Viatorem duplicem furibus eripuimus; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum hunc adhuc, sed illum vinctum: de utroque sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuimus (misericordes) ut invenimus. Emancipatur li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, perpetuo carceri addictus est vinctus. Siccine nos edocuit (Luc. 10.) Samaritanus? Sic fidem nostram apud Deum tuemur?</p>
                  <p>Jurarunt sane hi omnes, jurarunt, inquam, nostri ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jores, Reges, proceres, parliamentariae ipsae celebritates, hoc est, Regnum integrum, omnisque populus, non suo solum sed &amp; nostro, &amp; nepotum nostrorum nomine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpositis etiam horrendis execrationibus nulla se un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam temporum aeternitate, haec ecclesiae surrepturos. Quis obsecro nos liberos faciet ab his vinculis? Quis audax orator causam hanc apud Deum aget? An flocci pendeas? Cave ne fidem, quam apud me splendidam habes illico labefactes. Si beati Rechabitae, qui nuda ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa patris sui mandata observaverunt, An non maledicti nos, qui non singularis unius, non privati cujusdam pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentis mandata contemnimus?

But also in my owne conceit and opinion calling to remembrance my great and manifold insufficiency in learning, to write unto so mighty and famous a Prince I should even by and by have disallowed mine owne behaviour in that behalfe, and judged my selfe worthy of blame. but now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb facs="tcp:62279:145"/>
most benigne Soveraigne Lord, how much all your subjects be imperpetually bound to laud, praise, and glorifie almighty god, to send unto us so Christen a kinge to have rule and governance over us your subjects, by whose great and inestimable diligent labour, charge, study and paine, we be delivered from the hard, sharpe, and X. M. times more than judicyall captivity of that Babylonicall man of Rome to the sweet and soft service, yea rather liberty of the gospell. I can for my part no lesse do, then to present to your grace somthing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to declare how gladly I would give thankes to your highnes, for such proofs, as I among others have received by this said benefit in our deliverance which act is of it selfe so highly to the great peace, unyte and welth of this most noble Empyre of England, that if there were non other cause but that only we were bound to and with all our diligence and industry to study, labour and devise how this benefit exceeding all other, might world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end be extolled, praised, and made immortall, and to receyte how much the furtherance of gods glory is by the same act set forth and advanced, my learning ne yet wytte will not serve me. Yet I dare boldly afferme, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and considering depely the effect and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this matter, This act is no lesse worthe then well worthy to be set in the booke of Kings of the old testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a thing sounding to gods honour, as much as any other history therein conteyned. but what should I attempt or goe about to expresse the condigne and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting praises and thankes, which your majesty hath deserved of all your hole Cominalt for the benefites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named, unlesse I would take in hand like an evill workeman which by reason of his unperfectnes in his science should utterly staine and deface the thing he
<pb facs="tcp:62279:145"/>
would most earnestly and diligently shew and set forthe. I will therefore most excellent Emperor of this realme, set all this aside, and shew to your grace the cause of my enterprise, for so much as I perceave that all your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proceedings are onely driven and conveyed to the most highe, just, and sincere honour of Almighty God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the publique welth, and unity of all Christendome, most especially of this your most noble Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, it hath animated and incouraged me according to the small talent of learning that the Lord hath lent to me to put your grace in remembrance of the intollerable pestilence of Impropriations of benefices to religious persons, (as they will be called) some to men, and some to women, which in mine opinion is a thing plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the most holy and blessed decrees and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Almighty God, and highly to the extolling, supporting, and maintenance of the usurped power of the Bishop of Rome, as your Majesty shall perceave in reading of this little treatise, which your grace not being offended, I shall ever, God willing, be able justly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and also stop the mouthes of them, that shall say and abide by the contrary, and that not with mine owne words, but with authorities of holy Scripture. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I doe most humbly upon both my knees beseech your Imperiall Majesty, that unto such time, as this my little book be cleerly confuted by like holy Scripture and authorities, as I have approved the same, that it may safely goe abroad under protection of your gracious and redoubted name.</p>
                  <p>And for the prosperous preservation of your most royall estate, of your most noble and vertuous Queene, of your deere daughter Lady Princesse, daughter and

                  <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bigott</hi> Knight of Yorkshire wrote this<note place="margin">Note.</note> Treatise: whereof this Preface I received from Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> but the rest of the book, I could never yet finde, thoughe it be mentioned by severall Authors, <hi>Bale, Hollinshead,</hi> and lately by Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> in his history. It seemes to have bin written after the Kings breach with the Pope, his marriage with <hi>Anne Bolen,</hi> and the birth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> as I conjecture by circumstances. His purpose was chiefly bent against the Monasteries who had unjustly gotten so many Parson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages into their possessions. It is much desired that if any man have the rest of the book, that he would please to communicate the copy, that hereafter, as occasion serves, it may be published compleatly, together with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of this argument, that the learned Knight hath committed to my charge: but by reason of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent troubles I cannot now attend to prepare them for the Presse. As for Sir <hi>Francis Bigott</hi> himselfe, he was found afterwards active in the troubles of Yorkshire, that happened in 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and being apprehended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, was put to death, 29. <hi>H.</hi> 8. as our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chronicles doe report.</p>

                  <head>To the right Reverend Fathers and Brethren, the Bishops and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have caused this little Treatise (right reverend and beloved in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus) to be printed againe in North-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, for many causes: first, because I was informed, that there came forth, but a few copies at the first printing thereof in South-Britaine: Againe, I hope this doing will incite that worthy Knight, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour thereof, quicklier to send out the greater worke, which he promiseth of that same argument; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to incite you, whom these matters most nearely doe concerne, to look into them more advisedly, then as yet ye have done: it was a private occasion, as that worshipfull Gentleman sheweth, that led him to this writing: You have a publique, whereof it is pitty you are so little moved: who seeth not the state of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> as concerning the patrimony to go daily from worse to worse? <hi>Sacrilege</hi> and <hi>Simony</hi> have so prevailed that it beginneth to be doubted of many, whether there be any such sinnes, forbidden by God, and condemned in his Word? Neither can you deny the cause of this evill, for the most part to have flowed from your selves: your selling and making away of the Church rights without any conscience, the buying and bartering of benifices, with your shamelesse and slavish courting of corrupt patrones, hath made the world
<pb facs="tcp:62279:147"/>
thinke, that things Ecclesiasticall are of the nature of Temporall things, which may be done away at your pleasures: and where at the first it was meere worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that led men on those courses, now a great many to outface conscience, and delude all reproofes, they stand not to defend that Lands, Tithes, yea whatsoever belonged to the Church in former ages, may lawfully be alienated by you, and possessed by seculars: which opinion must either be taken out of the mindes of men, or need you not looke to have these wicked facts in this kinde unreformed: to this end should all Ecclesiasticall men labour to informe themselves, as well by the Word as by the writings of Ancients, and Constitutions of Councels, touching the right and lawfulnesse of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall things, that when they are perswaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the truth, they may the more effectualy teach others. There is no impiety against which it is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite you set your selves in this time: for besides the abounding of this sinne and the judgement of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the land for the same, who doth not foresee, in the continuance of this course the assured ruine and decay of true Religion?</p>
                  <p>Of all persecutions intended against the Church the <hi>Julian</hi> was ever held to be the most dangerous: for <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidere presbyteros,</hi> is nothing so hurtfull, as <hi>occidere pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterium.</hi> When men are taken away, there is yet hope, that others will be raised up in their places: but if the meanes of maintenance be taken away, there followeth the decay of the profession it selfe: Men doe not apply themselves commonly to Callings, for which no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are appointed; and say that some have done it in our dayes, some out of zeale, and some out of heat of contention, yet in after-times it is not like to continue
<pb facs="tcp:62279:147"/>
so; neither let any man tell me, that a Minister should have other ends proposed to him, then worldly mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. I know that to be truth, yet as our Lord in the Gospel, <hi>hoc etiam oportet facere, Et illud non omittere.</hi> Speaking of payment of tithes to the Pharisees: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth them, saith he, to be paid: if not, it is not to be expected, that men will follow the Calling.</p>
                  <p>To rest upon the benevolence of the people, as it is a beggarly thing, and not belonging to the dignity of the Ministery, so the first maintainers of that conceit have found the charity of this kinde so cold, that they will not any more stand by their good-wills, to this allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Therefore it lieth upon you to foresee the estate of your Church, and either in this point of maintenance to provide that it may be competent and assured, else looke not for any thing but ignorance and basenesse, and all manner of mischiefes which flow from these, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the whole Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>How a competency may be provided, except by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing the Church to her rights, I doe not see; and what this right is, if I should stand to define, and justifie it here, I should exceed the bounds of an Epistle. Many of this time have cleared the point sufficiently. And if any scruple be remaining, the worthy Authour, I hope, will remove it in the greater worke we expect: whose judgement and dexterity in handling the argument, may be perceived by this his little pinnace. It should shame us of our calling to come behinde men of his place, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in knowledge, or zeale. His example who is nothing obliged, to labour in these points, as you are, shall doe much, I trust, with you, for the time to come. Should any look carefuller to the Vineyard then the keepers? or should any out-goe the servants of the house in dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence?
<pb facs="tcp:62279:148"/>
Repent therefore and amend your owne negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in this behalfe, and call upon others for amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whilest you have time. Thinke it not a light sin, to spoile Gods inheritance; and if we look for heaven, let us be faithfull to our Lord here on earth. I beseech God to give us all wisdome, and keep us in minde of that strict account, that we must one day give for all our doings, and chiefly these which concerne the Church, which is his body. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Unfaithfull traytours to the flock shall ye be before the Lord Jesus, if that with your consent, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ye suffer, unworthy men to be thrust into the Ministery of the Church, under what pretence that ever it be.
