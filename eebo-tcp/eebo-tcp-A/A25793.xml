         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe worke of Reformation in these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
is so great a worke, as no age nor
history can parallel since Christs dayes, for
no one Nation had ever such a Reformation set forth
unto them, much lesse three Kingdomes, so that this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53264:3"/>
Generation may truly think themselves happy, if
they can be instrumentall in it. And as the work is
very great, so it cannot be expected, but it must have
great and powerful enimies; not only flesh and blood
which hate to be reformed, but likewise principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and powers, the Rulers of the darknesse in this
world and spiritual wickednesses in high places. As
the dangers are great we must looke the better to
our duties, and the best way to perform these, is to
keep us by the rules which are to be found in our
Nationall Covenant, principally the word of God,
and in its owne place, the example of the best refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches; And in our way wee must beware
of some Rockes, which are temptations both upon
the right and left hand, so that we must hold the
middle path. Vpon the one part, we would take
heed, not to settle lawlésse liberty in Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
instead of Vniformity, we should set up a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Heresies and Shismes which is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to our Covenant. Vpon the other part, we are to
looke that we persecute not piety &amp; peaceable men,
who cannot through scruple of Conscience, come
up in all things to the common Rule; but that they
may have such a forbearance as may be according to
the Word of God, may consist with the covenant,
and not be d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>structive to the Rule it self, nor to the
Peace of the Church and Kingdome, wherein I will
insist no further either to insist your Lordships pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
or judgements, who I doubt not will be very
careful to do every thing according to our covenant.
As to the other point, concerning the peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53264:3"/>
of the Kingdoms, I know it is that which all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
they desire, I hope it is that all do aym at; sure I
am, it is that which all men doe study and endeavor,
and I thinke it not amisse to remember your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
of some former experiences, as an argument to
move us to be wise for the future.</p>
            <p>If the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in the 1640. yeere of
God, then sitting in Parliament, had concured, as they
were desired against the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> no
question wee had been brought to many difficulties
which blessed be God, was by the wisdome of the,
Honourable House apreuedted: so likewise when this
Kingdom was in difficulties, if the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had not willingly, yea cherfully sacrificed their
peace to concur with this Kingdom, your Lordships
all know what might have bin the danger.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let us hold fast that union which is so
happily established betwixt us, and let nothing make
us again two, who are so many wayes one, all of one
Language, in one Island, all under one King, one in-Religlon,
yea one in Covenant; so that in effect wee
differ in nothing but in the Name, as Brethren doe,
which I wish were also removed, that we might bee
altogether one, if the two Kingdoms shal thinke fit;
for I dare say hot the greatest Kingdom on the earth
can prejudice both so much, as one of them may doe
the other.</p>
            <p>I wil forbear at this time to speak of the many je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
I hear are suggested, for as I do not love them
so I delight not to mention them, onely one I cannot
forbear to speak of, as if the Kingdom of Scotland,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53264:4"/>
were too much affected with the Kings interest. I
wil not deny but the Kingdom of Scotland, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Raign of many Kings his Progenitors over
them, hath a natural affection to his Majesty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they wish he may be rather reformed then ruined,
yet experience may tell, their personal regard to him
has never made them to forget that common rule,
The safety of the People is the supream Law. So
likewise their love to Monarchy makes them very
desirous that it may be rather regulated then destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which I hope need not to mention further to your
Lordships, who I trust are of the same mind.</p>

would have had some respect to tender Consciences
yet it is reported here by Malignants of which there
are store that they shal have another day and that the
King shall be brought again, &amp;c. These are likewise
the hopes of the Remainder of those which the Mar.
of Huntly commanded formerly, by which wee
may perceive that for the present the division is great
amongst these, so is it in their Army; some are for
Episcopacy, and setting up the King in as great power
as ever he had <unclear>heretofore</unclear>; others say, then to what
purpose have we hazarded our lives, and entred into
Covenant, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus are we as men in a maze what will become
of these things; especially, seeing some of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
