            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A BRIEFE DISCOVRSE OF THE SPANISH STATE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>HILIP (the father of great Alexander) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing increased his small kingdome of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia to the Empire of Greece: and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how needfull the fauour of all men was for the life of his reputation in that romth; commanded that daily ere he came from his chamber, a boy standing at the dore should say with loud voyce, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip remember thou art a mortall man: a course beyond anie expectation of that time; he being deriued from Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, whom for his excellencie, they feigne was transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongst the gods.</p>
            <p>Some who haue since that time preferred iustice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other vertues, do name humilitie; (as that which belongeth onely to man) to be the meanest notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that she linketh the rest, and is mother to clemencie, who chiefly bringeth forth the fauor of the people.</p>
            <p>The regard which this prudent king had to make his succession immoueable, and to raise them to the highest top of glorie (as he did by making their foord, by his affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, tempetance and clemencie) is of excellent presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for all Princes: who to effect the like, are to appeare before God as men clothed with humilitie; and before men as God adotned with clemencie: they being both men &amp; gods respecting their condition of humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and high place of their royall dignitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:9809:5"/>The error which groweth by the abuse of these things is dangerous, as that which leadeth either into a manifest tyrannie, or a remissenesse of gouernement. For howe may he that perceiueth not the passions of men, or feeleth not in him selfe an inclination to mercie; either relieue the people of their miseries as man, or prouide for their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as God?</p>
            <p>To seeme therfore such who seeke a reformation and benefit of the people (a report very plausible) and couertly to deuour manie prouinces, is a practise neither of man or God, but of Deuils incarnate. I would there were not any vnto whom this might be obiected: &amp; that her Maiestie whose most noble Progenitors haue deserued well of <hi>Spaine,</hi> might, if for no other cause then the auncient league betweene the Crowne of <hi>Castill</hi> and the house of<note place="margin">Frossart.</note> 
               <hi>Lancaster,</hi> haue enioyed their good neighbourhood and friendship of times past. But seeing that their cheerefull countenance (being oppressed with the ill humours of their ambition) is turned into a melancholie darke, I haue thought good for the benefit of her Maiesties subiectes, (some of them hauing vaine imaginations of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards excellent giftes and greatnesse) to drawe the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Empire and good nature, by which it may appeare howe monstruous the proportion of both is, which they would should seeme most exquisit and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all men.</p>
            <p>It is certaine that <hi>Spaine</hi> is of great antiquitie, bearing that name vnder the first Monarchie; but when we shall consider the significations of her and of her first inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, we shall find her age no ornament (as it hath bene in the names of the foure Monarchies, and of some other nations) but a great deformitie considering her incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9809:5"/>
and peruerse qualities of that people all naturall defects being made more imperfect by continuance or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of times. Touching therefore the significations<note place="margin">Gieronimo Ruscelli <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el Ptolomeo.</note> of that countrie: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (being a Greeke word) is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted needinesse, penurie and raritie; and was not long after the diuision of tongues, first inhabited by the third sonne of <hi>Iaphet</hi> named <hi>Iobel</hi> or <hi>Tubal,</hi> signifying worldly,<note place="margin">Iosephus lib. 1. antiq. cap. 11.</note> or of the world, confusion and ignomie: which signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations meet so iumpe regarding the state of that counrie, and customes of that nation, as nothing could be deuised apter.</p>
            <p>Of this contemptible beginning (which in respect of their meannesse was long without suspition of tyrannie haue they (lothing the streights of <hi>Hercules</hi> pillers, and his <hi>Plus vltra</hi>) extended their limits to the vtmost In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; where they haue erected this <hi>Trophaea</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> conceipt, <hi>Non sufficit orbis;</hi> but how farre from the temperance of good Princes, let anie barbarian iudge, who would haue bene glutted with halfe the miseries of them, with whose euils the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is not yet satisfied.</p>
            <p>For better expressing the particularities of their policie let vs (before we come to the significations of <gap reason="foreign">

Thirdly, that whilest the great kings of<note place="margin">3</note> Europe liued, they were obscure, and haue onely since their time bene seene, like glowe wormes shining in the darke. Fourthly, that this region of <hi>Spaine</hi> (though verie<note place="margin">4</note>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:9809:6"/>
ancient) was after the report of <hi>Polybius</hi> vnknown to the<note place="margin">Lib. 3.

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>It is conuenient, that we perceiue the effectes of this name by nearer circumstances of ages then the former generall poincts: in respect whereof, we must first looke<note place="margin">1</note> backeward as farre as three thousand yeares: at which time the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> (who were then of the greatest naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation)<note place="margin">Diodorus Sicu. rerum anti. lib. 6. cap. 9.</note> did buy of them their mettall for things of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt and small price: an argument that either the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> then were of great simplicitie (a qualitie neuer growing to a habit in them) or that they had great want of those things which are ordinarie for the life of man, which is an inseparable accident of the greatest part of their countrey. Secondly who considereth their naturall<note place="margin">2</note> disposition to robberie in the maiden yeares of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diodorus Sic. rerum anti. lib. 5. cap. 2. &amp; li. 6. cap. 9.</note> would thinke they had onely studied that lawe <hi>Licurgus</hi> made in the benefit of secret theft; neither <hi>Hercules</hi> though he maistered their countrimen <hi>Gerion</hi> and the sonnes of <hi>Chrysaurus;</hi> or the <hi>Romanes</hi> who often restrained them, being able to suppresse their theeuerie. But they depend vpon this ground, that those things in which manie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, are alwayes forgiuen, and that there is no law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to necessitie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly behold their small multitude of people regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">3</note> the bignesse of their countrey, being one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test kingdomes of Europe: which proceedeth of the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of <hi>Spaine;</hi> caritie, penurie and want.

            <p>Fourthly, suruay the scituation of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally<note place="margin">4</note> yeeldeth moe rockes and barren hils, than champain and plaine fieldes, from which (after the midst of Iune) they reape no profite till the next spring: their trees and vines excepted, neither haue they any great vse of their riuer waters, which are so troubled and extreme colde in<note place="margin">Frossard.</note> the first part of summer by snowes, that descend from the hils by the heate of the sunne, that they do not onely mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and kill horses, but also men if they haue not the dayly vse of Garlike, which is esteemed very profitable for them that drinke corrupted water.</p>

            <p>Sixtly, marke their couetousnesse: which vice though<note place="margin">6</note> it be not alwaies in the poore, yet haue they more cause to offende therein, respecting their needie state, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

            <p>Touching their couetousnesse, it partly appeareth in fraudulent shifting their creditors: partly by their raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous desire to oppresse all parts, and partly by offending against the affections and dignitie of parents.</p>
            <p>As concerning the cousinage of their creditors, our Princes haue deeplier tasted their deceit then any others.</p>

            <p>To returne to the second part of their couetousnesse, ouerthrowing the foundation of Iustice: if this ground be true that nothing is profitable that is not honest, these men are too deuout seruitors of the Pope, he crying this Prince sweats, or fetch, to leape like water spaniels at the sacred dignities of kings, and to enter violently their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines established by his diuine order, who said by me<note place="margin">Prouerb. 8.</note> kings do raigne.</p>
            <p>I will iustifie it, that if the right of <hi>Millaine</hi> appertaine not to the kings of <hi>France,</hi> who claimed that Dutchie by <hi>Valentina</hi> grandmother to <hi>Levvis</hi> the twelfth, &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and heire to <hi>Iohn Galeazzo,</hi> who had it of the gift of the Emperor <hi>Sigismund,</hi> that then it belongeth to the Empire.

Furthermore, their title to <hi>Maiorica, Minorica,</hi> &amp; to the higher <hi>Nauar,</hi> resteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these doubts: first that if king <hi>Philip</hi> were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in battel, or intrapped by other meanes, and imprisoned during his life, whether <hi>Spaine</hi> shuld be forfait to him whose captiue he were. Secondly, if <hi>Spaine</hi> were prescribed by the holy father (who many times is implacable) whether that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were his, who first laid hand thereon. I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they would reck on these questions absurd: but if the case bee altered with names, it is cocke on the hoope for them, &amp; clearer then the midday. For the king of <hi>Aragons</hi> conquest of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> and <hi>Minorica</hi> was by no other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9809:8"/>
meane then by keeping the king of both in prison till his death: of which wrong the king his sonne complained to <hi>Edvvard</hi> Duke of <hi>Aquitan,</hi> who assured him, (his wars<note place="margin">Frossard.</note> ended for <hi>Don Piero</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi>) he would yeeld him all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor possible.</p>
            <p>Their chiualrie in their thieuish surprising the higher <hi>Nauarre</hi> (which they hold by force of the Popes proscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is of like condition: whereby it may appeare that notwithstanding these <hi>Caualeros</hi> haue their Rapiers han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging point blancke, that it is their penurie at home, that giues them stomake, according to their name that they are <hi>Sagaces Hispani,</hi> to winde, or smell their neighbors cupbords abrode.</p>
            <p>The late Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> hath declared their iniurie to <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> for <hi>Portingall,</hi> and God himselfe, (wherein we haue to boast and be thankfull) hath with hautie stile penned our <hi>Apologie</hi> for England: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I omit both, to shewe the last branch of their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, then which there is nothing that more tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth their indignitie: for if it be proper to the Lion and Tiger to pursue with incredible furie, those that bereue them of their whelpes: what greater beastlines can there be in man who hath reason, &amp; is not borne for himselfe, then contrarie to the naturall instinct of brute beastes, to make his issue captiue, whom nature made free? as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by selling the <hi>Indian</hi> women conceiued with child by them, haue done to their great obloquie.</p>
            <p>This kinde of auarice caused the <hi>Indians</hi> to practise new matter: but rather it may be the diuine punishment, considering the simplicitie of that people; who as they could opportunely take the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> powred melted gold into their mouthes, vsing <hi>Thomyris</hi> words to <hi>Cyrus</hi>

head in bloud, now drinke your fill</p>
            <p>To returne from whence I digressed, touching their qualities expressing the significations of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Next to their couetousnesse their enuy is to be regarded, a vice proper to men of base account, and peculiar aboue all<note place="margin">Prossard.</note> others to this nation: as well by testimonie of <hi>Gaston</hi> the Erle of <hi>Foix</hi> (a Prince of singular magnificence and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure) who (dehorting the Lords of <hi>Biern</hi> from seruing the king of <hi>Castill</hi> against the <hi>Portingall</hi>) tould them the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were filthie, lowsie, and enuious of the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of straungers: which at <hi>Iuberoth</hi> the French desiring to haue the vanward found true: the king of <hi>Castill</hi> not being able (in regard of their place) to bring his <hi>Spaniards</hi> though 20000. to make supply: by meane whereof, the Lords of <hi>Biern</hi> with their retinue, being 12000. were slaine. As also by the Duke of <hi>Albas</hi> reproouing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>Egmond,</hi> (who with the aide of our artilery from sea) ouerthrew the Frenchmen betweene <hi>Grauelin</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercke:</hi> which victorie the <hi>Spaniard</hi> imputed onely to the Counties temerity, and for recompence of his valure, could not after aford him his life.</p>
            <p>Hitherto haue I prooued the significations of <hi>Spaine</hi> as causes by their effects, or maximes by their consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: now remaineth to speake of <hi>Tubal,</hi> signifying, of the world, worldly, confusion, and ignomy.</p>
            <p>Some may thinke that what hath bene said for <hi>Spaine</hi> belongeth also to <hi>Tubal;</hi> but I am of another minde: for as it followeth not necessarily, that whosoeuer is rich, is therefore proud, high minded and insolent, no more is it consequent, that the poore are worldly, confuse, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious: many of both sorts being such whom God doth loue: in respect whereof, it behoueth me to handle
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9809:9"/>
this, as the other a part; to make apparant that they are no lesse confuse, and ignominious, than naturally poore and miserable.</p>
            <p>As for these words, worldly, or of the world; although their grosse ignorance of diuine things may be prooued thereby, yet for that they belong to my Masters the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, I let them passe.</p>
            <p>First therefore as touching confusion, it is a peruerting or confounding the comlinesse and order of things Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, naturall, and ciuill; by meane whereof a detriment or deformitie of our persons, dignities, or states presently ensueth.</p>
            <p>As concerning things Diuine, there is no nation that so confoundeth their vse, and seemeth religious not being so, as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for an instant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> after they had recouered <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado</hi> from the <hi>Mores,</hi> were presently intituled the most Christian Princes: which being stomached by <hi>France,</hi> they had after the name of Catholike, which did no lesse hurt then the title of vniuersall or supreme bishop: for hauing so glorious an addition annexed to their newe kingdome, they studied to do somwhat, sauoring also of noueltie, that might seeme worthie of the holy fathers fauour, and their <hi>Epitheton:</hi> in respect whereof they esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished a company of the order of <hi>Dominicks,</hi> to looke into the corrupt life &amp; maners of the <hi>Mores</hi> and <hi>Ievves</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whom they named fathers of the holy Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>These Fathers as dropt from heauen, gaue great hope of their proceeding to all men; for in short space, all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humatisme</hi> and <hi>Iudaisme,</hi> seemed by their diligent search to be extirped in <hi>Spaine:</hi> neither was there any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9809:10"/>
from them, but the effects of pietie, and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christianitie: their aduantage to this sentence, <hi>The vvorkman is vvorthy his hier,</hi> excepted; which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inriched their holy house with confiscate goods, but after their trade, in which they had found some sweetnes, began to decay at home; they thought good (as gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds missing wolues do fall to sheepe) to make it cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at <hi>Naples,</hi> which the Princes &amp; people of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome a while withstood: but being after terrified, partly with the Popes censures, partly with the power of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. they accepted it, <hi>Sed iniquis condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing gotten free passage for this newe creature in <hi>Italy,</hi> they attempted to make it knowne to our worlde, where it bred such <hi>Antiphisicall</hi> effects, by tearing the vnion of <hi>Belgia,</hi> and renting our peace, that if euer this saying were found true that <hi>Religion brought forth riches, and the daughter deuovvred the mother,</hi> it was then when their auarice, cloked with Christian reformation, filled all places with proscriptions, slaughter, and flame.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, where the Greeke <hi>Tau</hi> (hauing some forme of a crosse) was amongst the <hi>Egyptian Hierographicall</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in great admiration, as containing diuine mysteries: and furthermore, where the Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> had<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 9. cap. 9.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9809:10"/>
theeues, wherein they blasphemed not the signe, but the thing signified.</p>
            <p>This report <hi>Antonio di Gueuarra</hi> (a man of more quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied condition than their countrie yeeldeth, made in his Oration at <hi>Braxinia</hi> to the Knights of the assembly.</p>
            <p>He affirmed also in his Epistle to the bishop of <hi>Zamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> chieftaine of the rebels in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that one of his priests standing behind a window at <hi>Tordissillas,</hi> ouerthrew ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Emperors souldiers with his Hargabusse: with which ech time before he slew one with the bullet, hee crost himselfe.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Charles</hi> the fift censure their Pageants with their holy father, and his venerable companie vnder <hi>Bourbon,</hi> at that time his son <hi>Philip</hi> was borne: he doubting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had more cause to glorie in the birth of his sonne, or to lament their contempt of the Pope, and holie places.</p>
            <p>I denie not but some <hi>Almaines</hi> had their handes also in that matter, but the fault belonged to no other then the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> (who the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> being slaine) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the armie, and were masters of the field.</p>
            <p>In reproouing of their abuse, either of the Crosse or Pope, let no man take me that I esteeme them as things Diuine or holy: I speaking onely according to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of both, which they reckon diuine and holy.</p>
            <p>Nowe commeth in place the second part of confusion, which consisteth in violating that order which hath bin prescribed by nature, for preseruation of honestie, and the excellency of man.</p>
            <p>This schoolemistris, was of her selfe daintie and most excellent, till the serpent deflowred her, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> abused her fauour: notwithstanding which, she aloweth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9809:11"/>
not the desire of man to increase his like, in vnlawfull or vncomely sort: both which are against the dignitie and intention of Nature, whose obiect is honestie. Her lawes are, that we be followers of modesty, that a Parent should cherish his childe, a husband his wife, and all liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures should liue pacified with them of their owne kinde. But to vse women forcibly in publike places, or in the presence of many, as some phrenticke persons accustome<note place="margin">Sansoninus de Regnis.</note> in <hi>Fez:</hi> or for Parents to kill their children, husbands their wiues, and one people many Nations, she detesteth, as customes vnfit for men, and not vsed (the first excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) by fierce and vnreasonable creatures.</p>
            <p>I meane to cite but few examples, yet such as may no lesse expresse this confusion, then the print of <hi>Hercules</hi> foote his whole stature.</p>
            <p>At their first arriuall in the West <hi>Indes</hi> (there accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing vnlawfull) exercised all tyranny on that people, who hauing till then enioyed a long libertie, este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more daungerous than wilde beasts: in respect whereof many flying their seruitude, cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from rockes: other pined themselues with famine, and some cut their throates with sharpe stones: neither spared the <hi>Indian</hi> women that were with childe to take venimous potions, and to rippe their wombes to set free their infants from the cruell bondage of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this booted not, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> minding rather to reserue them to foule vses, and to aid them in their slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then they should pine, or ende their liues by any other meane then their chiualrie.</p>
            <p>Hauing therefore recouered such as Fortune spared, they shamed not, driuing them as droues of beastes, to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish the women hauing children fastened to their necks,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9809:11"/>
both their owne bands and the <hi>Indians</hi> beholding them.</p>
            <p>But what durst not these rutters do amongst a naked, &amp; simple people, that omitted no outrage in a country ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lawes, walled townes, and armed men? for many thousand of like stuffe receiue this one for proofe of the rest.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Insul</hi> a towne in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> three of these gallants entered a citizens house wholy of their faction; where two of them held the husband, whilest the third rauished his wife in his presence: who crying for helpe, &amp; hauing two neighbours come to his rescue, the <hi>Spaniardes</hi> also cried <hi>Spaine</hi> (a watch word to assist their villanies) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon diuerse of their company repaired to them, accusing the husband and his neighbors of riot, for which the one was adiudged to be whipt, and the other to be hanged.</p>
            <p>Let this much suffise for that vice, wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only with vnreasonable creatures: somewhat being to bespoken also of their murther and cruelty, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to this part of confusion, wherin they alone haue top and top gallant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solon</hi> hauing giuen lawes to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded why he made not one for parricide: for that saith he, I thinke no man so beastly to commit it. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher thought nature to haue great authority in this matter; but seing that loue only descendeth, she comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth little.</p>
            <p>That the child hath murthered the parent, moued by a couetous desire, either of patrimony or gouernement, is more apparant in the line of <hi>Othomano</hi> then piety would: but for the father to kill his innocent sonne, or the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his chast wife, besides that family and the act of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> I knowe no authentike proofe, vnlesse <hi>Spaine</hi> can
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9809:12"/>
yeeld some president for both.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1568. the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> descending with the <hi>Terrezans</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> into the lower coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, vpon pretence of pacifying that state: and leauing no kind of tyranny vnexercised, gaue great mislike of his doings to all men: especially to the young Prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who often complained of his crueltie in those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces: the gouernment of which belonged (as he saide no lesse to him in the life of his father, then it did to <hi>Philip</hi> (who had the same) in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift.</p>
            <p>This complaint though it seemed iust to some, yet others, chiefely the fathers of the Inquisition, reproued it as matter to be suspected, and sauoring more of noueltie then appertained to one of his yeares: by which slaunder they brought him into common hatred, specially of his father, who being wholly addicted to his secreat plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, easily beleeued any thing: in respect whereof, and that hee had made committies for hearing all matters of State: it was thought meete by them to restraine the Prince of libertie, as a man without other practise, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatnes of his mind, to shorten his time, although he died not without suspition of poyson.</p>
            <p>The Queene of <hi>Spaine</hi> during his restraint (presuming much on her place, and pitying his innocencie and tender yeares) solicited the king to receiue him againe into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: but the mallice of the Princes aduersaries preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both towards him and the Queene, whom they found no lesse zealous for the peace of <hi>Belgia,</hi> then for the kings honour: for which cause they ordered that both their hearses were within one moneth, which I sawe at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarpe</hi> lamented with teares, and at <hi>Naples</hi> solemnized with ioy: so great a matter it was for the prouinces to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9809:12"/>
loose good Princes, and for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be ridde of them, by whose pietie and wise prouidence their auarice and crueltie had beene bridled, and so small a thing it is in <hi>Spaine,</hi> for a father to murther his son, and a husband his wife: the one being after the French phrase <hi>Le petit fils</hi> of two Emperors and the sonne of a king: the other the daughter of a king, the sister of kings, and wife of a king.</p>
            <p>Some may obiect that these reports are scandalous, and belong rather to the Councell of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and fathers of the Inquisition, then to the king.</p>
            <p>I confesse that besides publicke fame, which suffizeth to driue the accusant to his purgation; I can oppose but these grounds. First, that he who propelleth not an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie if he may, is no lesse faultie then he that offereth the wrong: secondly that those subiectes, whose Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth not by what meane his sonne and wife were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, are not to hope the defence of his ciuill or martiall sword.</p>
            <p>Now remaineth their confusion of things ciuill, which I ascribe not only to the subuersion of positiue lawes, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and customes; but to the ouerthrow also of that society, which ought to be betwene men of one nation, or seueral countreyes, for maintaining their particular quiet.</p>
            <p>That they haue subuerted the ciuill state by altering of ancient ordinances, I hope they will not denie: which if they do, their policie in <hi>Belgia</hi> (framed by <hi>Escou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>do</hi> secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi>) (<hi>vz.</hi> that the king must cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice one Prouince by an other to be made absolute in all) being compared with the priuiledges and customes of those Prouinces, graunted in the Bull of gold, and since confirmed by their Princes, will conuince them of great
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9809:13"/>
impudencie. For if amongst other things contained in that Bull, the Princes of <hi>Belgia</hi> are prohibited to amplifie the Ecclesiasticall state further then hath bene prescribed, or to leauie any mony, or to make any innouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of state without consent of the Nobilitie and people: or to place forenners in the ciuill gouernment, vnlesse in some small offices, with this caution, that if they fall into any of these errours, their subiects (making due protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) are absolued from their obedience: what is it to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne diuerse townes of <hi>Brabant</hi> to receiue Bishops, the vnited Prouinces the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition, &amp; <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> gouernours? and to impose this burthen, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the yearely tenth of mens goods, nothing is bought and sold to the vse of the bodie, out of which the kings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers trie not a part of siluer? What other thing I say is this alcumie, then the rooting vp of a State planted by the hands of good Princes, then which there is no iniustice more capitall?</p>
            <p>To antiquate these things seemeth no other, then the cancelling of societie, but they are distinct, and but in part like: some obeying no ordinance, and yet hauing mutuall societie; which groweth by a secret agreement of nature making them conuersant.</p>
            <p>By which I collect the confusion of societie amongst men liuing vnder one law, is their morositie onely.</p>
            <p>This vice is rife amongst them, and wherein the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> hath his difference from all men, aswell for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therein their owne persons, as priuate persons the Soueraigne, and the Soueraigne the subiect: as also pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate persons one another: in all which they haue predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatiou, and if it were possible exceede them selues.</p>
            <p>For sinning against their owne persons behold a rare
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9809:13"/>
example. <hi>Don Piero</hi> of <hi>Castill</hi> the sonne of <hi>Alphonso</hi> the xi. leading the vantgard of a battail against the <hi>Mores</hi> of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado,</hi> and being aduertised that his vnkle <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> who was in the arergard, was like to be distressed by a sudden eruption of <hi>Mores:</hi> and finding him selfe vnable to relieue<note place="margin">Piero Messie.</note> his vnkle, his souldiers departing the field, was so surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with beastlines, that he fel from his horse dead: which when <hi>Don Iohn</hi> was certified, he died also. A matter saith the author, not before heard, that a man should die of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure: yet presidents no lesse rare in their sort do folow: but first of offences against the Soueraigne.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Spaniard</hi> beholding <hi>Ferdinando</hi> (grandfather to <hi>Charles</hi> the fift) in procession at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> that day they name <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> feast, strake him so furiously with a dagger on the necke, that he had slaine him if the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his chaine had not put by the thrust: and that for no other cause, as he confessed being taken, but that the king stood not in his good grace, and that he liked not his countenance: an opinion no lesse daintie then that of the <hi>Romane</hi> Senate: for as they esteemed not on a God, who<note place="margin">Euseb. Eccl. hist.</note> was not allowed by their authoritie, no more would this yonker that any should haue the name of king, that had not dignitie of person agreeable to his romth: which vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus temeritie hath giuen iust cause for Princes to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their ordinarie presence from the common subiect; and to bring in this custome, that no man weareth a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But nowe to their confounding of societie with the subiect: for the sequell, of singular president for all princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the fourth of <hi>Castill,</hi> for displeasure onely against two knights of good name, made their processe of execution; and though supplications were offered with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9809:14"/>
teares for pacifying that rigor, yet contrarie to the lyons nature (who spareth the humble) he proceeded with all seueritie: in respect whereof the two knights appealed to the great iudge, before who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they summoned the king to be in person within twentie dayes; the last of which, <hi>Ferdinando</hi> appeared.</p>
            <p>Time may rather want then iust matter to blase their vices, which are not common, but rare and in the highest degree of beastlinesse: leauing therefore their murthering the Nobilitie of the sacred order of <hi>Burgundi,</hi> their cutting out, and searing with hot irons the tongues of honest Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, their drawing the mouthes of some a sunder with other instrumentes, their wilfull murthering a father at <hi>Traiect</hi> beyond the <hi>Mose,</hi> for lodging his sonne one night; their banishing chast matrons, for receauing their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, an act condemned by no good law, for the insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bonds of their loue: their furious beastlinesse at <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi> vpon the citizens and a widow named <hi>Potier</hi> whom they slue with her daughter and neece; and their massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring with bullets the vnarmed people at <hi>Ipre</hi> beholding a godly minister put to death: I will touch onely their barbarous inhumanitie towards the naked <hi>Indians,</hi> a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very tractable, if they had found good maisters, and such as had skill of honestie.</p>
            <p>Setting the acts of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Iosua</hi> a part, I think there is no president that the godly haue rooted out the natural inhabitants of any countrey: but that the wicked haue chastized sinners, many passages, both of diuine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane writings haue testified. It is then apparant that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as idolaters were suffered to chastice idolaters, and not to enlarge the faith: for had their intention bene to haue learned those simple soules the true knowledge of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9809:14"/>
God, (as they made shewe at the first by erecting in some regions diuerse Bishoprickes and schooles) they would either haue continued that order, or haue bin conuersant with them in all mildnesse and humanitie: pietie being no way better taught then by demonstration: but as they could seeme no others then they were: no more could the Indians gather grapes of thornes: in respect whereof though at the first this naked people might haue bene moulded into anie forme, yet after they had tasted the <hi>Spanish Creados,</hi> they abandoned their companie, with all rites and ceremonies of the Romish religion, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of them had reuerently before receiued: neither was there anie death so fearefull, whether by poyson, famine, or other meane before mentioned, that in respect of the cruelty of those <hi>Don Diegos,</hi> they would not haue willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced as their sure port of rest &amp; end of their euils.</p>
            <p>In describing the miserable state of these wretched people, <hi>Metellus</hi> saith, that to a very ill president, manie of the <hi>Spanish</hi> souldiers punished their seruants most gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously; if either they brought not home their day hier, or finished not their taske in the gould and siluer mines, or had committed smaler faults yealding them (their hands and feet being bound to a crosse pale) in steed of their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, many stripes with corde, or the sinnewes of a <hi>Buphal;</hi> dropping on them either boyling pitch or oile: and after washing them with salt water they would lay them so long vpon a table, as they imagined those wretches might beare the paine: after this kind of cookerie, if a more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell maister hapened to some of them, they were buried all night in earth to the necke, as a present remedie for their stripes. If any of them died in this newe diet (as it chaunced very often) the maister accompting to the King
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9809:15"/>
the heds of his slaine seruants was quited of the paine of manslaughter. This crueltie some excuse saith <hi>Metellus</hi> by the law of <hi>Baion:</hi> But it appereth vpon iust cause wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to all men, as being void of all piety.</p>
            <p>Touching this barbarous crueltie he bringeth in also one <hi>Alquinotec</hi> baptized <hi>Cacicnis</hi> of the prouince of <hi>Iucatana,</hi> complaining to <hi>Monteius</hi> generall of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince in these or the like wordes.</p>
            <p>Our natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Monteius,</hi> whilst I was a boy, was grieuously afflicted with a disease causing them to vomit wormes, whereof the greatest part died: after which (falling by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from on euill to another) we had wars with them of <hi>Mexico;</hi> wherin we lost mo then an hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand; all which, in respect of the slaughter &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie that we receaue of thee, <hi>Monteius,</hi> &amp; of thy souldiers, we esteeme nothing. <hi>Metellus</hi> further affirmeth, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hauing wasted many prouinces with their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie; and transporting by sea (from other places better peopled) sundry of those miserable &amp; wretched <hi>Indians</hi>) murthered many by pestering them in the bottomes of their ships: some by famine, &amp; some by their daily stripes, so that few or not one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> landed, that were imbarked.</p>
            <p>Hee moreouer specially noteth for the rest, one <hi>Piero Calis,</hi> who (in driuing whole droues of that naked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) slue all that were not able to trauell, without regard of age, sexe, or their vse of labour, which in respect of a continuall ease, was most hard and intollerable to them.</p>
            <p>He lastly concludeth with <hi>Macchiauel</hi> (who maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that where the Pope and Cardinals set footing, they leaue most fearefull printes of confusion) that in what place the <hi>Spaniards</hi> display their ensignes, nothing is to be looked for but crueltie and slaughter, and all miserie:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9809:15"/>
The prouince of <hi>Cumanus,</hi> of 700000. hauing scarce any remaining: <hi>Hispaniola</hi> of 2000000. hauing left but 200. or 150. and <hi>Hondurensis</hi> of 400000. but 8000. besides the slaughters of <hi>Cuba, Iamica,</hi> and <hi>Portus diuitis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus farre Metellus, by which I collect, in respect of a <hi>Sympathia</hi> betweene the creatures of seuerall kinds, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are no lesse daungerous, in regarde of their crueltie, then the <hi>Basilisc,</hi> both hauing a desolate and wast Empire: as also that those <hi>Indians</hi> hauing behelde moe miseries then all the Nations of the earth, haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued for the handes of this cruell and proude Nation, whose condemnation may appeare iust, and most great.</p>
            <p>I also note the sagacitie of this politike and wise peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that if they establish any law tending to reformation, they conuert it for the most part to their priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: for as they dealt by the Inquisition, specially proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Ievves</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> so haue they done by the Law of <hi>Baion</hi> made by <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> for the <hi>Canibals</hi> onely: not one in these dayes fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the smart of either, hath not more pietie, or is not more simple then others.</p>
            <p>Omitting for that I would draw to an end, their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<note place="margin">Petrus Martyr de angleria.</note> which haue no ende: as their hunting the <hi>Indians</hi> with dogs, and other like villanies, (hauing spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of men offending against their owne persons, the subiect the Magistrate, and the Superior the inferior.) The next is of confounding societie amongst priuate persons, of one Nation, for which I wil cite one example, as it was reported to me at <hi>Venice</hi> 1569. by a Gentleman of the house of <hi>Mantua,</hi> of great credite: His other addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I passe with silence, least he yet liue, and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be in daunger of the bugges of <hi>Millan</hi> his neighbors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:9809:16"/>The manner thereof was, as he said, in this sort. One of these monsters meeting his enimie vnarmed, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to kill him if he denied not God, his power, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall properties, vz. his mercy, sufferance, &amp;c. the which when the other desiring life, pronounced with great horror, kneeling vpon his knees: the <hi>Brano</hi> cried out, nowe will I kill thy bodie and soule, and at that instant thrust him through with his Rapier.</p>
            <p>The last part of confusion is left to their confounding the societie of Nations, belonging also to ciuill societie, maintained by Ambassadors, entercourse of trafficke, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice ministred strangers, open denouncing of warre, and mercie to the vanquished.</p>
            <p>As for the first, though it hath beene in vse to beare with whatsoeuer an Ambassador (not exceeding his commission,) or an <hi>Herault</hi> (wearing the Cote-armor of his Prince) deliuered, (as the French king, <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt, suffered a proud defiance from the Duke of <hi>Geldres</hi>) yet haue the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (as men tied to no rule) not onely murthered Ambassadors passing their countrie (as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohan. Slai. lib. 14.</note> 
               <hi>d'Aual</hi> their Lieuetnant in <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> slue <hi>Caesar Fregoso,</hi> and <hi>Antony Rinson,</hi> sent from <hi>France</hi> towards <hi>Constantinople</hi>) but also haue killed some sent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:<note place="margin">Philip du Comines.</note> as <hi>Ferdinando</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> who vsurped <hi>Naples,</hi> murthered one <hi>Segnior Iacobo</hi> the Ambassador of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> and imprisoned others, as the king of <hi>Aragon</hi> did the Archbishop of <hi>Buxdeaux,</hi> sent from the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> before named.</p>
            <p>Neither haue they beene lesse iniurious to our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants: they hauing arrested some, burnt others, and stayed the goods of many without restitution: vpon this pretence, they had in their ships or chambers, the Psalmes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9809:16"/>
of <hi>Dauid,</hi> or some treatise of Scripture in the vulgar: the same being either the Erle of <hi>Surries</hi> sonets, or some other like matter: but neither were our countrie men so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie to bee afflicted for righteousnesse, or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> so iust in censuring their lightnesse, which should haue bin reformed at home: for if the reading a <hi>Sonet,</hi> or the bookes of <hi>Amadis du Gaul,</hi> which they haue incresed to a great volume b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e death, which of them are free from iudgement? their chiefest Lectures consisting (vnlesse in the superstitious iudicials of Astronomie) in such light and vaine matter: <hi>sed hinc ille lacrymae,</hi> that they are of all men most contemptible, if they loose the counterfait of holinesse.</p>
            <p>To seeme good and be so, is hard: but to be euill and seeme good is easie, and the onely thing that hath made them great.</p>
            <p>To seize therefore on the foxes case, it was requisite to name him a horned beast entring the lyons denne: which rule maketh much for their oppression of all nations by stealth.</p>
            <p>Neither is this name <hi>Lutheran</hi> vnprofitable for them, they meaning to ouerthrow thereby this position: <hi>Contra hostes non est nisi legitimè dimicandum,</hi> (which partly is by deuouring warre to them whom they inuade) and to draw vs either as heretickes, or traitors to their persons, into a degree higher then those that are tearmed <hi>hostes.</hi> But how that may be I see not, the one being in question, and the other vntrue: vnlesse the regard of neighborhood<note place="margin">Gen. cap. 14</note> be an offence, which <hi>Abraham</hi> with the testimonie of a good conscience vsed.</p>
            <p>But grant we were worthily excluded the priuiledges of armes, for not being of that church (we thanke God)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9809:17"/>
they are of. What moued them to pretend an indefesible peace (by meane of no lesse State than <hi>Philip</hi> the Archduke of <hi>Austria</hi>) with <hi>Levvis</hi> the twelfth, named for his piety<note place="margin">L'estat des maisons il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres de France.</note> the father of his countrie, and being as they tearme their friends <hi>buenos Catholicos,</hi> they surprising at that time the kingdome of <hi>Naples?</hi> surely no other thing then which caused the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to entertaine her Maiesties Ambassadors with a long parle, till their great <hi>Armado</hi> was vpon our coast.</p>
            <p>These things are inexcusable, and therefore I am of this minde, that if they had that bell named <hi>Martinella,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nic. Macch lib. 2. hist.</note> which the ancient <hi>Florentines</hi> rong one moneth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually before they entered into any warre, they would say they could not make her sound for want of a rope.</p>
            <p>Their want of compassion towards the vanquished, is of one scantling with their iniustice to straungers, to whom the lawe of Nations hath alwayes had speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</p>
            <p>The lawes permit to take armes against enimies, but to spoile them who haue submitted their liues to vs, is ignoble, and farre from the generositie of our elders.</p>
            <p>Some obiect for their cruelty, the slaughter of the French prisoners at <hi>Iuberoth,</hi> wherein (I shew my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they had double wrong: first for that they were <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingals</hi> that did that deede, a Nation for this eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares distinct fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>Indians:</hi> and for their purpose to doe, shewe him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Marquise of <hi>Guasto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is in controuersie whether a Christian taking a Christian in battell may giue his armes: so is it determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hee may not simply detaine his prisoner paying his ransome; much lesse oppresse him being yeelded: the Marquise notwistanding these rules, encountering <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Earle of <hi>Anguien</hi> at <hi>Sirrizolles,</hi> entended<note place="margin">L'estat des maisens il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres de France.</note> (had he gotten the victorie) to send all the frenchmen in chaines to the gallies: a most cruell thought, considering the noblenes of the French Nation, and his owne profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of knighthood.</p>
            <p>Thus much of their confounding things diuine, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ciuill, and forren; the same appertaining to one of the significations of <hi>Tubal:</hi> now remaineth to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the other and last signification, which is <hi>Ignomy;</hi> This may be named a reproch or blot belonging to the foulenesse of any act before done: a description not disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greing with the French prouerbe, <hi>Orguiell cheuauche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, &amp; honte vene apres.</hi>

            <p>Whosoeuer is a tyrant (saith he) is also a coward: for an instance of which, after he had cited sundrie cruelties of <hi>Alphonso</hi> the father, and <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the sonne (kings<note place="margin">Philip de Comines.</note> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and vsurpers of <hi>Naples,</hi>) he sheweth that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the approach of the French king <hi>Charles</hi> the eight to <hi>Naples:</hi> they both departed the realme in such haste that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9809:18"/>
manie of their souldiers lept out of the windowes hauing not seene the enimy: <hi>Alphonso</hi> beleeuing that all thinges tooke part against him in fauour of the French king: and that the moouing of the leaues of trees, sounded in the behalfe of <hi>Charles</hi> (as a watchword of partie) <hi>France, France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinando</hi> his sonne (after <hi>Charles</hi> had taken his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the kingdome, and was departed towards <hi>France,</hi> leauing for his viceroy the Duke <hi>Monpensier</hi>) returned, and hauing alied himselfe with the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Marquise of <hi>Mantua</hi> (who could not digest the greatnes and neighborhood of the French nation) he fell to ill arts, for recouerie of that kingdome he lost by cowardice. This disgrace he recompenced with a greater, tending to his perpetuall infamie.</p>
            <p>For after the French had cleared all parts from appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hostilitie, they were notwithstanding conquered by diseases, gotten by eating the flesh of dead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando</hi> had procured to be sold them for <hi>Tunny:</hi> the vse of which, corrupting the liuer by extreame moisture, and matter of too neere qualitie; brought forth most foule vlcers, with other paines, of which many miserably died: leauing for <hi>Trophees</hi> of their victories, their countrie name to the disease.</p>
            <p>This is fearefully described by <hi>Guicciardin,</hi> (in respect<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Hist.</note> the disease was infectiue, and then incurable) and as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely laide downe by <hi>Giouanni Fioreuanti</hi> a Philosopher of that time; who beholding the deformitie of that sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and hearing of their new diet, indeuoured to finde the reason by the effects.</p>
            <p>He kept (for that he would not be deceiued in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of kinds) a tame Pie and a Dog so long without
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9809:18"/>
meate, that the one refused not to eate the flesh of another Pie; and the Dogge to feed of an other Dog: by meane whereof the Pie within few dayes lost her fethers, and the Dog his haire, both hauing most filthy soares breaking forth in sundrie parts of their bodies.</p>
            <p>The want of victuall being accessarie to this calamitie, draue the French to accept no lesse dishonorable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for their departure, than their disease was horrible; the most part of them dying in their returne.</p>
            <p>Some reply, that if that contagion were as <hi>Fioreuanti</hi> coniectured, the <hi>Canibals</hi> would haue the like: which obiection proueth no lesse then is affirmed, no people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more subiect thereto then they that are within that tract: in which (as in the scorpion there is his sting to kill, and his oyle to cure) is found the wood <hi>Guaicum,</hi> a most present remedie for that disease.</p>
            <p>This practise hath deepely touched the renowne of<note place="margin">Exodus 22.

            <p>To returne from whence I digressed: the Archbishop of <hi>Treues,</hi> withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the election of the emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the fift (whose greatnesse was extolled by <hi>Maience,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his new kingdome of <hi>Spaine</hi>) affirmed that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> seldome aford them selues in field without the aide of straungers: a report very sclaunderous to chiualry, for which (though they be often well backt as they were at <hi>Naueret</hi> by the Lords of <hi>France</hi>) they deserue no soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers crowne or garland.</p>
            <p>This cowardise at <hi>Nauaret,</hi> where they had 60000. of their owne people, was after obiected against them by <hi>Monsieur du Lignac</hi> in a consultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warre amongst the French men that serued king <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Castill</hi> (sonne to <hi>Henry</hi> the bastard) against the Duke of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> It hath bin also remembred by <hi>Frossard,</hi> against whom &amp; <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur du Lignac,</hi> they can take no exception.</p>
            <p>He first citeth the wordes of one <hi>Hartesel</hi> an English man at <hi>Iuberothe</hi> to the king of <hi>Portingall,</hi> whom he told that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were flying calues without wings, bearing banners wauing with the winde: &amp; lastly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his owne opinion of them as followeth.</p>
            <p>At the first incounter, saith <hi>Frossard,</hi> they are fierce, (&amp; if they haue aduantage) high minded: they fight well on horseback; but as soone as they haue cast two or three dartes, and giuen a stroke with the sworde, and see that their enemies be not discomfited, they turne their horses and fly.

            <p>By comparing these numbers, I find them no lesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to defend, then to recouer a thing lost; so there be an election of seasons, and a prouision of other necessaries: which is to be regarded by our nation, as well for that we being brought vp in a more temperat and colder clime then <hi>Spaine,</hi> haue our naturall moisture easilie exhausted by the heat of that country opening our poets in the som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: by which that quicke and subtill ayre named <hi>Serena</hi> entreth the vitall parts, and sleyeth the bodie: as also for that we being not accustomed to their strong wines, and hauing no other waters to mingle with them, then snow broth descending in the spring from the hilles into the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, fall into pestilent feauers, fluxes, and inflammations of all the inward parts: as moreouer, for that after May (about which time they haue their haruest) nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth out of their townes (vnlesse some fruites) to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine either man, or horse, their fields being extremely parcht with the Sunne till the returne of the Equinoctial.</p>

            <p>First the <hi>Phoenecians</hi> had (for things of small price) great store of their mettall, by the helpe whereof, they erected diuerse colonies in <hi>Sicilia, Sardinia, Libya,</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> it selfe.</p>

            <p>This my self can say, that I haue knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fifteene hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred <hi>Biscaies</hi> (which people <hi>Florus</hi> nameth the chiualrie of <hi>Spaine</hi>) at their first landing in <hi>Antvvarpe</hi> to be men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible of person, filthy in apparell, and rude in beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour; and within one moneth after they had tasted the pay of that towne, and relished the cates of that contrey, to be terrible of countenance, magnificall in gesture, and seeming of so hautie conceit; as though all things were vile which they esteemed not: and therefore dare auowe that who so was entertained with their customes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered as a tree embrased with iuie.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9809:22"/>
they named <hi>Granado</hi> of a citie they built.</p>
            <p>The next are the <hi>Vandals,</hi> a people of the North, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that part, after their name <hi>Vandaluzia,</hi> which by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the first letter and corruption of speach is called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daluzia,</hi> as <hi>Arrogona</hi> hath <hi>T,</hi> being before <hi>Terracona.</hi> But here I must not forget a report of their own touching the etimologie of <hi>Andaluzia:</hi> which is, that the <hi>Mores</hi> landing in <hi>Spaine,</hi> demanded a pesant driuing an asse, the name of that prouince: but he vnderstanding them not, spake to his asse, <hi>Anda luzia,</hi> which is, <hi>go luzia:</hi> according to which the <hi>Mores</hi> named that country: but to returne. Of these is a like <hi>quintessence</hi> drawne as <hi>Alexander</hi> drank out of the hoofe of an horse: for what vicesoeuer hath bin peculiar to any of them (besides those they had in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon) is now proper to them all.</p>
            <p>As I sayd before that a simple is more perfect then a compound: so affirme I, that those beasts which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of sundrie kinds, are most cruell. If a lion match with a Parde, there remaineth in the issue some generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the parent: but if the Leopard couple him self with a Tiger, nothing is to be looked for in their broode, but a barbarous fiercenesse. The naturall <hi>Spaniard,</hi> being as a simple, is of a confuse and beastly conceipt, of diet misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and furious, nourished to increase those humours in scarsitie: but mixed with the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> giuen to the euery and drunkennes: mingled with the <hi>Mores</hi> cruell and full of trecherie: and consequently, tasting of euerie one, a spring of all filthinesse.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> hath this prouerbe, that a thing begun is halfe ended: and experience teacheth, that after the sunne hath climed the Meridian, he declineth. All things haue their infancie, riper yeares, decrepitage, and are subiect to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9809:22"/>
alteration; yet passe not with like celeritie to their period. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to be of some reputation but in the time of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Isabella,</hi> (who vnited <hi>Aragon</hi> and <hi>Castilia</hi>) before which they were either subiect to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians, Romans</hi> or some other nation: or els so deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into small kingdomes, that they were of no force.</p>
            <p>It is therefore no maruell that <hi>Antonio di Gueuara</hi> in regard of their weaknes, and want of valiant personages, cited, (in his epistle to <hi>Don Ian di Padillia</hi> a Captaine of the rebels in <hi>Spain</hi>) one <hi>Cid, Fernan Gonsalis</hi> &amp; the knight <hi>Tiran:</hi> and in his epistle to <hi>Sir Antoni</hi> of <hi>Cuniga</hi> (prior of <hi>S.

               <hi>Comines</hi> maintaineth, vnlesse it be to rob him of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and dignitie.</p>
            <p>In the time then of <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> after the rapine of the kingdomes of <hi>Naples, Sicilia</hi> and <hi>Nauarre;</hi> were they first esteemed: neither would their fortunes haue had longer life then his age, had they not ben after houed vnder the wings of the eagle (during which time they increased their empire with <hi>Milan</hi>) and caught some heat of the <hi>Lion.</hi> In their prosperity they are of the nature of gourds which ouerlooke those things by which they clime. England hath yelded them the greatest countenance (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their comoditie of sheepe, the King hauing for the duties of wool 30 <hi>quentos</hi>) &amp; the lower contries the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test reuenues, and these two are they at which they haue first leuelled.</p>
            <p>They esteme the kingdoms of <hi>Castill</hi> and <hi>Aragon</hi> to be the cheifest of their <hi>Diadem,</hi> yet do the commodities of <hi>Belgia</hi> contrepois more then the weight of both: the due of the prouinces being seuen hundred <hi>quentos,</hi> the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

of <hi>Castill</hi> but foure hundred and fifty: and of <hi>Aragon</hi> &amp; <hi>Catalonia</hi> but one hundred and fifty: wherby it should seeme that before they had rauened <hi>Malorques, Nauar, Milan, Sicilia</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> that their proper right (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their mine of <hi>Guadalcanal</hi>) was of no great accompt; the kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> yelding three hundred and fifty <hi>quentos,</hi> and the state of <hi>Milan</hi> three hundred <hi>quentos,</hi> (or after the opinion of <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thousand Duckets) which cometh neere to one reckning (exceeding the rest of their auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Domains of <hi>Spaine.</hi>

               <p>I gladly allow your opinion of this one, and of some other of that kinde of most excellent qualitie: all which notwithstanding are no swallowes to make our summer: you know what the learned antiquitie both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and prophane haue thought of the weakenesse of this sexe, whose gouernement elsewhere I reuerence, as the ordinance of God, and agreeing with the lawes of other Nations? Yeelding therefore all due honor to your star of peace, which I pray may long shine in the Church of God: I will (leauing that <hi>Bruenhault,</hi> who according to her Nation, was most daungerous for our Countrie) name but one of the house <hi>de Medicis:</hi> who after the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Poet, was the calamitie of our land. This Ladie hauing (by the death of her husband and discretion of diuers Lords) oportunitie to looke into the gouernment of her children: not onely abused (for desire of rule, of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9809:29"/>
of which she was impatient) their young yeares, but also the authoritie of the Princes of the blood, to whom du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the minority of the king the same belonged: causing moreouer her sonnes (for seruing her ambition) to play all parts of a dreadfull tragedy, in which she was a seuere actor till her last breath: hauing vnto that time hid many daungers from the king which might greatly haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited him and the realme, had they bene reueiled in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which she concealed for her owne profite: not one being more able to dissemble then she, who had by that meane deceiued many great Princes and Captaines of her time, especially the Admirall <hi>Chastilion,</hi> who affirmed in all speeches of her, that he greatly doubted her vnstable wit. And though that wind be ill that turneth none to good, yet her arts greatly auailed <hi>Spaine;</hi> which she euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more regarded for preferring her particular (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the losse of her daughter) before the nobilitie and common profite of <hi>France,</hi> entertaining in respect thereof diuerse (vpon other mens cost) with the hope of many excellent titles and great <hi>Signiories;</hi> the desire of which are not yet forgotten, nor will be, till God mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our troubles, and take compassion of our poore affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>France.</hi>
