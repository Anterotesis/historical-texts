      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe States Army by order from his highnesse the Prince of Orange is commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided vpon a march into three Brigades or Tercias. In French he is called <hi>Le Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,</hi> or <hi>Le Sarjant Majour de battaille,</hi> and in English one of the great Corporalls of the field. A Sariant Maiour then of a Tercia doth receive his order immediately from the Lord Generall himselfe, or the Lord Marshall, but most commonly from the Sarjant Majour Generall aboue mentioned, To wit, in what forme the Brigade or Tercia is to be ordered, and how many regiments of foot and horse are to march under it, and with what ordnance and baggage. He assignes and shewes them the place, where they are to draw out in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallie, and receives order from the Sarjant Majour Generall whether they are to march in the Avantgard, the Battell, or the reere, so that in marching every one of these three shall attend upon his Brigade, and severall devisions, and in the absence of the Sariant Maiour generall see that the order of marching and embattalliing be duely kept and observed. And every one of these three Sariants maiours de Brigade are to be at the command of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonoll Generall or he that leads and commands that Brigade or Tercia, and is to be sent to the Lord Generall the Lord marshall or Sariant Maiour Generall upon any ocasion which belongs to the present service.</p>
               <p>These three Sariant Maiours of the Tercias are to be lodged as neere the Sariant Maiour Generall as conveniently may be. And these three which attends upon the Avantguard the Battell and the Reere with the Sariant Maiour shal make choise of ground for the placeing of guards, and assigne them to the Sariant Maiours of every Regiment, they are to goe the Round and to visit the guard commonly every night, and at such an houre as the Sariant Maiour shall appoint them either by day or night.</p>

He is presently to advertize the Sariant Maiour Generall with the said wants, and then by his direction shall goe with an officer of every Regiment of that Tercia to the Generall or Lieutenant of the ordnance, or to the commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Generall of the amunition or victuals.</p>
               <p>To conclude, he having received his orders from the Lord Generall the Marshall or the Sariant Maiour Generall gives them to the Sariant Maiours of the particular regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but because the word and the orders are to be sent to quarters farr distant one from another, the Sariant Maiour of every regiment cannot come conveniently to the Sariant Maiour Generall. Therefore the Sariant Maiour of the Brigades are to attend every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening upon the Sariant Maiour Generall, of the Army to receive their orders and to carry the word to the severall quarters, whether the Sariant Maiour of the regiments comes to him, and from him receiue the word and orders.</p>

               <p>THe Lord marshall of the feild is in command and authority next unto the Lord Generall, as is (as it were) his Lievtenant and mouth, and therefore haveing so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent a place, he ought to be acquainted with all the duties of the officers of the feild: especially with the Generalls office it selfe, because there is such an affinity betwixt them, as having absolute power to command the Army in the Generalls absence, and may oftimes be employed to command the Army himselfe, as commonly the marshals of <hi>France</hi> doe.</p>
               <p>His office is also to see that Iustice be duely administred, and that the Lawes, Articles, and ordinances of marshall discipline be strictly kept and observed, that all banishments, and proclamations, comming either from the Generall, or the Councell of warre, be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and excecuted, and by his authority, to cause malefactours, and offenders, to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for an example of others. And seeing that all he doth is for the generell good of the whole Army, he ought to be feared, honoured, and respected of all men, and in no wise contradicted, seeing it is his proper charge to take care that the policie and discipline of the Army established by the Generall, bee exactly kept and maintained under his authority.</p>
               <p>All quarrels and duels hapning between officer and officer, souldier, and souldier either of horse or of foote, ought to be brought before him, seeing it is his office to right the wronged, and to punish the offender, or by his wisedome and authority to appease and compose them.</p>
               <p>The Lord Marshall also when the Avantguard is drawn out, and are ranged in battallie while the battell and the reere are dislodging, he sees and commands that both horse and foot march orderly and in their owne place.</p>
               <p>And with some choise troupes marcheth before the Avantguard, and considers the waies and passages, as Valleys, Rivers, Marras, Boggs, Mountaines, Hills, Hedges, Woods, Hollow and Narrow waies, throw which the Army is to passe, that he may order the march accordingly as also to send out Scouts, Guides, Spies, to discover and get inteli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from an Enemy.</p>
               <p>He marches also in the head of the armie, Sometimes with the Sariant Maiour Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the quartermaster Generall, and the quartermaster of the Regiments, as men experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced to view and make choice of the ground wherein the Army is to bee lodged and quartered.</p>
               <p>He obserues also the order of marching, quartering, and fighting, the three chiefe things belonging to an Army, and sees and commands that the march, quartering, and fight, bee conformable to that order, which the Generall hath prescribed, and the devisions, and Troupes being ranged in battallie, he is full of action, and considers the place and soyle of the ground, the advantages of the Sunn, Winde, and dust, and how the troupes with the most advantage may be brought to encounter an Enemy, takeing care that the order com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Generall be not changed, and when the troups are engaged in fight, he sees that they be duely seconded, and relieved, and being overlaid or charged, to cause them to retreat orderly for the avoiding of disorder and confusion, having a watchfull eye upon all casualities which may happen, for what the Lord Generall ordaines, the Lord Marshall sees performed and executed, to the end, that both their desires may take one and the same effect. For when commanders undertakes a warre, and fights with councell and iudgment, and sees all things also executed with wisedome, discretion, and valour, giving the succes to God, no man can then be blamed.</p>
               <p>The Lord Marshall also ought to be acquainted with the Generals designe, and whether he is resolved to fight with an enemie or no. To consider whether he is to charg an enemy in the Front, in the Reere, or on the flankes, to hinder them from quartering, and to send out convoyes for the cutting off, of his Victuals and provisions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94790:8"/>He ought to consider likewise how an Enemy lies encamped, which way he can come to attempt him, whether he is to march, and whither his dessigne tends, what order he keeps, with what Troupes he may hinder or annoy an Enemy, or being once ingaged in fight, where and how he may best second and relieve his owne men, either with horse or foot, to place and bring up the devisions of Muskettiers, where they may most offend and gaule an Enemy, and the bodies of Pikes may with the most advantage be brought to give a charge, or a shock.</p>
               <p>Also to understand and get intelligence of what force and strength an Enemy is, what baggage, carriages, and incumbrances he hath, and from whence his victuals and provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to come, to know whether any more forces are to ioyne with him, and how and in what manner he may break their conjunction.</p>
               <p>He is also to have in a readinesse, an exact Mapp of that Country through which the Army is to march, and a description of all the waies, rivers and passages, through which the Army is to passe, having also by him good Guides, which are well acquainted with the severall passages of that Country and place.</p>
               <p>The Lord Marshall likewise, with the Sariant Maiour Generall, ordaines and appoints all places for watches and Guards, either of Horse or Foote, which they assigne to the three Sariant Maiours of the Tercias, and they to the Sariant Maiours of the Regiments, and the places which they are to maintain and make good, also for alarme-places, and the choice of ground to fight a battell in, for the most safety and defence of the Army.</p>
               <p>In the day of battell he must be stirring and full of action to give orders and directions where need most requires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <p>Vpon a march or the Army being encamped, he ought to counsell Tradesmen and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallers, which bring provisions to the army, and gives command that they be not wrongd and abused by the Souldiers, but that they may sell their commodities peaceably: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he gives order by his authority to the Provost Marshall Generall, and to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Marshalls of every Regiment, that they set reasonable rates and prizes upon victuals and beere for the good of the poore Souldier.</p>

               <p>A Generall also ought to be qualified with these excellent vertues, as wisedome, valour experience, providence, constancy, authority, and liberality, and should well ponder and consider the occasion which might move him or engage him into a fight, or to give bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell to an Enemy, he ought to be sparing and a good manager of the lives of his men, and not rashly and unadvisedly to hazard his Troupes, for he may aswell van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish by policie, in putting on the Lyons skinne, and foreseeing all advantages and disadvantages, as by surprising an Enemy unawares, as by laying hold upon an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, when their Troupes are in disorder, when they are dispersed, when they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hartened, harryed and wearied out, when they are pinched with hunger, thirst and cold, and such like casualityes which may befall them.</p>
               <p>Also by seeking to divert, amuze and devide their Armie, while he keepes his owne in peace, concord, and unity, which is one of the chiefest points of Warre. To gaine time and advantagious places, to prevent and hinder an Enemy from possessing them, and to seeke by all meanes to breake an Enemies dessigne, and with all expedition to put his own into execution, and to premeditate and to overweigh with a thousand things, which depends upon the warre, having a vigilant eye upon all occasions, for the Art Military hath many difficulties attending upon it, and one is not able to expresse the many hazards, straights and plunges which befals this profession.</p>
               <p>He ought not lightly to hazard his men either in skirmishes, or in a battell, unlesse he be forced to it, and that upon very good grounds and advantages: for having flesht his men in small occasions, it hartens and embouldens his men, and gives them the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and assurance of good successe, for they perceiving the valliant, wise, and able carriage and conduct of their leaders and Commanders, especially of their Generall, this makes them fight bravely, and gives them hope of victory.</p>
               <p>A Generall also ought to take the grave Councell and advice of his Chiefes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and (as is said to make choice of the best, and yet not to make known his owne resolution, for many a brave attempt and enterprise hath been broken for want of Secrecy, and if he should reveale it to some intimate friend: yet to do it as sparingly and reservedly as he can, by which meanes he shall gaine knowledge and experience, and in an instant will be ready to lay hold upon such and such occasions as may execute his resolution.

and there by make him capable of prevailing.</p>
               <p>A Generall ought to take care, that his Armie be not wearied out, and fatigated over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, which breedes sicknesses, &amp; causes the weakning thereof, to see &amp; Command that the Regiments be well armed, &amp; duely exercised in all the seuerall motions of warre, that Iustice be readily executed, to be fauourable to good men, and seuere against Euill-doers &amp; Offendours. It is also the Office of a Generall to giue Charge, that the Armie be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Victuals, amunitions, and other things belonging to the warre.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Generall</hi> ought to speake diverse languages, for hauing to doe with sundrie Nations vnder his Command, being able to speake vnto them in their owne language, this giues a great deale of Contentment.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he ought to be learned, a good <hi>Mathematician,</hi> &amp; well seene in the points of <hi>Fortification,</hi> and to haue excellent Inginiers about him, that are carefull in running the lines of Approches, for the preseruation of the liues of men.</p>
               <p>It is requisite also, that he should haue good <hi>Guides,</hi> and spies about him, to get him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the State of an Enemie, &amp; ought to spare no mony that way, for the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an Enemies dessigne, and for the aduancing of his owne.</p>
               <p>A braue Generall also considers, that the force of an Armie consists not in the multitude of men, but in Valliant &amp; well experienced souldiers, &amp; Officers, which are well instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and trained vp in the vse of their armes, &amp; knovves that Victorie consists not in many Troupes; but that an Enemies army being stronger then his, as hath often hapned by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing of good order, &amp; dicipline choosing of aduantages of VVind, Sunne, and Ground together with the ready obedience of his men, in executing of his Commaunds, &amp; by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in their profession, they become more bould &amp; confident in fight, so that an old beaten souldier, knowes by heart, what his Chiefe &amp; Generall will require of him.</p>
               <p>As a Generall should be beloued: so likewise he ought to be feared, &amp; of the two among. Cammon souldiers, rather to be feared, for the most part of them, vvil be soner restrayned from doing euill for feare of punishment, then for any loue they beare to their Generall.</p>
               <p>To conclude, he ought to be experienced in the beleegring of Tovvnes, &amp; Forts, to vievv all places of advantages, &amp; vvhere an Enemy may most offend him, to forrifie his Campe strongly with lines of <hi>Circumvalation, Forts</hi> and vvorkes vpon it, to know the site, and situation of a tovvne, hovv, &amp; in what manner those vvithin are able to defend it vvith men and munition, to cause his Inginiers to be very circumspect, and carefull how they run their lines, to sap forward to the vveakest part of the Tovvne or Fort, which he intends to become Master of, vvith diverse other things requisite in a brave Generall, vvhich for brevities sake I will omit.</p>

               <head>How the Artillerie, and the Carriages are to March.</head>
               <p>The Ordinance marches first with all the Carriages, and the Pyonniers are alwaies by them, having noe other waggons mingled among them, &amp; so march in their order onely with one waggon before them, laden with spades, shovels, Axses, hachets, hand biles, and other instruments to make the wayes, &amp; to explaine the ground &amp; ditches, after which is drawne an Instrument, which doth make a <hi>rut</hi> vpon the waye, to show which vvay the Canon is to passe. The lesser lighter pecces of Ordinance layd vpon their Carriages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovves the said Instrument, &amp; aftervvard the great peeces dravvne upon block-vvaggons vvhen there is no danger: but expecting to be encountred by an Enemie, they dravv them vpon their Carriages for feare of loosing time in mounting them, least an Enemie might fall suddenly vpon some part of the Armie. Next after the Ordinance follovves the vvag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons vvith Instruments, &amp; Tooles for Carpenters, and Smiths, the vvaggons laden vvith Bullets, povvder, and match, and after them vvaggons vvith Pikes and muskets, all vvhich being passed; then follovves the vvaggons belonging to the Generall of the Ordinance &amp; his Inferiour Officers.

               <p>But vvhen necessitie requires, some Feild peeces marches before in the head of the Armie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94790:10"/>
vvhen an Enemie is expected to fall on, vvith vvhich there marches some vvaggons laden vvith povvder, match, and Bullets to be vsed vpon any occasion.</p>
               <p>All the Ordinance, carriages, and baggage being thus ordered, and the armie devided into the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> the <hi>Battell</hi> and the <hi>Reere</hi>: the <hi>Sariant Maiours</hi> of the foote Regiments, and the Commissaries of the Horse Troupes, having order, shevves vvhich vvay they are to leade the Troupes, that they may give noc hindrance one to an other, &amp; the <hi>Generall,</hi> or the <hi>Sariant Maiour Generall</hi> gives Command, that the <hi>Vantguard</hi> shall begin to march, and sends out before it Guides &amp; light horsemen, to discouver the passages: yet so, that they ride not so farre afore: but that they keepe alvvaies vvithin sight of the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the discouverie of an Enemie, they may advertize and givi them vvarnin of it in time</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vantguard</hi> then (as is sayd) hath commonly some small peeces of Ordinance mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching before it, vvhich likevvise may happen before the <hi>Battell,</hi> &amp; in the <hi>Reere</hi> of all vvith a greater number of horse, and foote, as the necessitie may require: so that the three <hi>Tercias</hi> of the Armie, are all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> provided vvith Ordinance, vvhere it is thought most needeful and vvhere it is imagined an Enemie may give an attempt, either vpon the <hi>Front,</hi> the <hi>Reere</hi> or vpon either of the <hi>Flankes</hi>: for vvhich one can give noe certaine rule, but must defend themselves in that place, vvhere the occasion presenteth it selfe.</p>
               <p>When a <hi>Campagnie,</hi> Heath, or Feild is spacious and large, then one may march in full Battaile by divisios, &amp; close by one an other in good order, vvhich an Enemy perceiving, it may be he dares not offer battell, othervvise every devision, &amp; <hi>Battaeillion</hi> may march by it selfe vvith more ease and liberty, then vvhen they are ioyned close together: yet so that in case of necessity they may easely be dravvne vp together, as likevvise the Ordinance, &amp; baggage dravvne to that place, vvhere they may be safest, and best defended by the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, if an Enemy should giue an attempt vpon them.</p>
               <p>The vvaggons ought to be dravvne vp, and ranged into eight, or ten rancks close one to an other, that they may march vvithout hindring one an other, and the Ordinance may march vpon one of the flankes of the Armie, and some Feild peeces before if necessity should require, vvithout hindring, or putting the rest of the vvaggons into disorder, vvhich the Master of the Ordinance, or the Carriage Master, ought to Consider vvell, and take a speciall care of.</p>
               <p>The Chiefe Officer vvhich Commaundeth the <hi>Reereguard,</hi> gives order that some Troups of light horsemen shall march vvith in sight of the vvhole <hi>Reere,</hi> especially, vvhen they are to passe over a Heath, or <hi>Campagnie:</hi> but the Countrie having mountaines, hils, &amp; vallies in it, then the horse may be commaunded to march sometimes in the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> &amp; sometimes in the <hi>Reere</hi> of all the Armie, and keepe such vvatch, and centinels vpon the highest places, that an Enemy may not discouver the strength of the Armie as it passeth, or in vvhat order it marches.</p>
               <p>When the armie is to march throug some narrovv passages, the <hi>Vantguard</hi> is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly strengt hened vvith some foore, or Ordinance dravvne vp before it, least an Enemie migt surprize it, &amp; marches the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by files, &amp; dravves vp as the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the place vvill permit. In like manner the <hi>Reereguard</hi> in places of daunger, ought to be strengthned, as also the <hi>Battell</hi> to be ranged into such an order, that the Ordinance, &amp; Baggage, being placed in the middest, may come best to serve, &amp; relieve the other Troups, from vvhence they may send Harquebussiers (as occasion serves) to attend both vpon the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> and che <hi>Reere,</hi> and as the ground vvill best afford.</p>
               <p>In case that the vvaies and passages be so narrovv, that the Ordinance, Carriages, &amp; bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage takes vp so much time, that the <hi>Vantguard</hi> cannot be easely seconded by the <hi>Reere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,</hi> then there may be appointed some Troupes of <hi>Reserve,</hi> vvhich may march along vvith the Carriages, &amp; Baggage, to be disposed of in such a sort, that they may the better relieve those Troupes, vvhich should be overcharged by an Enemy.</p>
               <p>Vpon such an occasion, one ought to consider and observe vvell, the nature, &amp; condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that passage, throug vvhich the Armie is to march, vvhether there be any vvindings and turnings in it, or other intrieate vvaies, as through vvoods, hils, and vallies, vvhere an Enemy may best lay his <hi>Ambuscadoes</hi>: therefore vpon every such turning, or crosse vvay,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94790:11"/>
a troupe of horse, &amp; some foote ought to be placed vpon it, to guard there, till the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Carriages, &amp; Baggage be past &amp; out of daunger.</p>

               <p>A Bridge then (having good Inginiers, Carpenters, and vvorkemen) is presently made over a River, or a brook, for the securing vvhereof, there are certaine peeces of Ordnance, dravvne vp, and planted by the river side, to play vpon an Ennemie, if they should force the passage over it, and likevvise dravve vp some <hi>Harquebussiers,</hi> lighthorsemen, firelocks, and muskettiers, to give fire vpon an Enemie, vvhile the bridg is a making.

            <head>FIRST. OF THE ORDERING AND FORMING of a Devision, or a Battalion, and then the forme of an Army of thirty thousand Horse, and Foote raunged in Battell.</head>
            <p>THe ordering of a Regiment, according to his highnesse the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, hath bin showne already in the first part of this book, namely, that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies being made into even files, &amp; ten deepe, foure or fiue Comapnies, ioyned together make a division, to wit, the Pikes are drawne first into one bodie, and then the Muskettiers into an other, standing in their true distance of three foote in file &amp; Ranke, and 18 foote distance betweene the Pikes &amp; the Muskettiers, this is the first order. The second is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Muskettiers are equally devided, as neere as may be, and drawne vp on the right, and left flankes of the Pikes, there to giue fire by Rankes, or to march away, as these two first figures marked with number 1 and 2 doe shew.</p>
            <p>Now the fittest number of men to make a devision of, is accounted to be 500. Pikes, &amp; Musketteires, that is, 25 files of Pikes, and 25 files of Musketteires, or more, or lesse of the one or of the other, as they fall out.</p>
            <p>This number being so embattailed makes an <hi>Agile</hi> bodie, &amp; the best to be brought to fight, and two of them being ioyned neere one an other, can best second, and releiue each other, better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your great <hi>Phalanges,</hi> which are unweeldy bodies, the experience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was seene in the Battell of <hi>Nieuport:</hi> for being once broken, &amp; routed, they can hardly be reallyed againe, and cannot bring so many men to Fight, as the Lesser Bodies doe.</p>
            <p>Many of these Devisions being drawne together make a <hi>Tercia, or one of the third parts of an Armie,</hi> and three of them the whole.</p>
            <p>For all the Officers and Souldiers of an Army, are devided into three parts called <hi>Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi> or <hi>Tercias,</hi> each of them having a severall name, to witt, the <hi>Vantguard, the Battell, &amp;</hi> the <hi>Reereguard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that Tercia, which is to march first, is called the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> that which marches in the midst the <hi>Battaille,</hi> and that which comes vp last the <hi>Reere.</hi> Everie one of them vpon a march every day takeing their turnes interchangeably: for the second day of the march, the <hi>Battaile</hi> becomes the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> and the <hi>Reere</hi> the second day hath the <hi>Battaile,</hi> and the third day the <hi>Tercia</hi> which had the <hi>Reere</hi> the first day is the <hi>Vantguard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, each <hi>Tercia</hi> may likewise be subdivided into a <hi>Vantguard</hi> a <hi>Battaille &amp; a Reere,</hi> to the end each of them with the more convenience may be orderly brought to fight, and by that <hi>Cheife</hi> which commaunds them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the <hi>Battaill</hi> one of the <hi>Tercias</hi> of the Army, being placed in the midst, that of the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> may be drawne on the right, and the Reere on the left flanke of the <hi>Battaille.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the number of the devisions, which each of these <hi>Tercias</hi> haue, are ordered, and devided after this manner, two devisions before, two in the midst, and two behind, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aboue, as you may see in some of the figures of the Battells following, having six or 7 devisions placed in evetie <hi>Tercia.</hi> The seventh being vneven, is placed as a Reserve behind the Reere, to second the others in time of neede.</p>
            <p>The first devisions of the <hi>Tercias</hi> standing in a right line, are to give the first <hi>charge,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of their <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second devisions standing likewise in a right line, makes likewise the second troupes and the third part of the <hi>Battaile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these devisions are also ordered and ioyned, that if the first should be overcharged and come to give ground then the second are to come vp, and to releiue the first, yet in such a distance, as they may not hinder one an other in marching by them, but finde place to come vp betwixt the first.</p>
            <p>The third devisions are to be placed directly behind the second, in a distance twise as

as the second is from the first, that if it should happen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the first division should stand behind the second, that then the third might have roome enough, to put it self into good order.</p>
            <p>The Horse Troupes are commonly ordered, the one halfe on the right, the other halfe on the left flanke of the divisions, and Battaillons of foote, as the first figure of an Armie demonstrates.</p>
            <p>And sometimes there may be <hi>Battaillions</hi> of Horse interlaced, and placed betwixt the <hi>intervals,</hi> and distances of the Foote, as the ground and necessity may require. For, if an Enemies Horse should be ranged betweene his <hi>Battaillions</hi> of foote, it is needefull then, that the other side should observe the fame forme likewise, and have horse to encounter horse, least they should breake in vpon the foote divisions, &amp; so by this meanes they may with the more convenience second, and relieve one an other, otherwise the Foote being overlayd with an Enemies Horse, having not Horse at hand, to charge and second them, might be casely routed and overthrowne, and though and Enemie have not placed Horse betweene their <hi>battaillions</hi> of foote, yet it may easely be done, according to the discretion, and foresight of the Generall. All which shalbe clearly demonstrated to the Eye by figure first in beginning with an Army of six thousand Horse, &amp; 24, thowsand foote embattailed into three Tercias, with their severall divisions, and afterward I will show the grounds and platformes of the Battaile of <hi>Nieuport in Flanders,</hi> fought (Anno 1609) betweene <hi>Prince Maurice</hi> of famous memorie, <hi>&amp; Albert Arch Duke of Austria,</hi> and then proceede on to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present vnto you the formes of Battailes shown by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> abouesaid, &amp; his highnesse brother the Prince of Orange that now is till Anno 1635, which may give some satisfaction to those, which are desirous to follow the profession of a Souldier.</p>

               <p>THe two first figures, marked with the figure <hi>1</hi> and <hi>1</hi> are two Divisions of <hi>25</hi> files of pikes a peece, and ten rankes deepe, ranged in Battaille.</p>

               <p>Now if you are desirous to alter this forme, and divide your Muskettiers into two parts, then you may draw vp <hi>13</hi> files on the right flanke, and <hi>12</hi> files on the left flanke of the Pikes, and giving them their true <hi>In tervals</hi> and distances for the Muskettiers to fall away, then there are two divisions made of a Regiment, and they stand as is shewed vnderneath, marked with the figure <hi>3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The figure <hi>B</hi> represents the forme of an Armie embattailed, consisting of <hi>24</hi> Regiments of foote, each Regiment making two divisions of <hi>100</hi> men, and <hi>20</hi> divisions of Horse, Curassiers, and Harquebusiers, each division consisting of <hi>300</hi> Horse, makeing six thousand Horse in all ranged into three Tercias, with the true number of feete, and distances betweene them, as the figures showes.</p>
               <p>Note also, where the gentle Reader sees a P marked within the Division, that signifies Pikes, and the division underneath are muskettiers marked with the Letter M.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the Horse are noted in French with C for Cavallerie, and in English with H for Horse.</p>

                  <head>Of three sorts of Campes or Leagers.</head>
                  <p>THere are three kindes of <hi>Campes,</hi> The first is called in Latine <hi>Castra Temporaura,</hi> that is, A <hi>Campe</hi> which staies not long in a place, but removes and changes euery day: the second <hi>Castra Strataria</hi> a settled Campe, which environeth a Towne, or a Fortresse with intent to take it in, and the third is called <hi>Castra Sustentoria,</hi> a Campe lying vpon a passage, or river to stop and hinder the incursions of an Enemie from getting into a Countrie.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Campe which dislodgeth euery moment is called Castra Temporanea.</head>
                  <p>This Campe is also called a <hi>Flying Leager,</hi> hiving no certaine place of abode, but at every motion, is continually to attend an Enemie vpon every remove, and this Armie is to encampe, when the Enemies Armie encampeth, and therefore is called a <hi>Flying Campe,</hi> because it is to hinder the Enemies progresse.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>A Campe having a trench Cast vp about it, or beset with Turne Pikes and Palissadoes.</head>
                  <p>Now for a <hi>Campe,</hi> which is ready to remove vpon an instant, we vnderstand that, which takes vp a quarter onely for one night, which forme requires a great deale of wisedome, and circumspection, especially when it is to march, or Quarter not farre from an Enemies Countrie. Therefore, it is very necessarie, that the <hi>Generall</hi> sends out before, a good number of Horse, to view, and informe themselves of the nature, and condition of that place, where the Armie is to Quarter that night, for the accommodation where of, they ought to chuse, as neere as possibly may be, a place situated in a plaine Feld, to which the Armie being come (and that in good time by day, the Quarters shall be made neere vnto the a dioyning villages) if there be any and the Horse lodged about them, in places of danger most suspected. A campe may be encompassed with a Trench 4 foot high, and 3 foote broad for their more safety against an Enemie, which otherwise might give an attempt vpon some part of the Armie. The moorish grounds, where is Enemie is not feared, that may be beset with <hi>Turne Pikes,</hi> or with <hi>Palissadoes,</hi> which may be taken vp againe, when the Campe removes.</p>
                  <p>After the Thenches are in defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the Souldiers begins to make their huts of forks, lathes, withes and straw, or for a night onely with sticks and boughes, or such things as they can get, the carriages and waggons laden with Amunition, Materials, and Victuals are to be lodged in the middest of the Campe, with a small trench cast vp round about them; but some peeces of Ordinance are to be planted vpon those <hi>avenues</hi> and passages, where an Enemie may best give on vpon the Campe when the watches, and the Centinels are disposed of, the rest of the Armie goes to take their rest, the next morning at the breake of the day and at drummes beating the Armie dislodges, and every one makes ready for to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94790:29"/>
march away, while the trench is a Casting downe, lest an Enemy, which followes the Armie might lodge in the same quarter.</p>
                  <p>But if the Armie is not to march through an Enemies Countrie, and that one is assured they cannot come neere vnto the Campe so soone it is not necessarie to environ the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe with trenches, but the Souldiers are either Quatered in houses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or feilds next adioyning to them, in disposing of guards, and Centinels in every place needfull, and this order of march observed everie day, till the Armie is come vnto that place, which is resolved to be beseiged; where then a formall, and a setled quarter called <hi>Castra strataria</hi> is made.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Castra Strataria and the proprieties thereof.</head>
                  <p>The propriety of this Campe may be observed well out of the Instructions of <hi>Veget</hi> in the 22 chapter of his fust booke, as also in the <hi>Castrametation</hi> of <hi>Hygnius Gromaticus,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to these observations following.</p>
                  <p>First, that the Quarter be made in safe place, that is, where there are no hils and heights, which may commaund and serve as an advantage to an Enemie, when he resolves to relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the Towne, or Fort beseiged, or to assault the Campe; for being lodged and fortifying himself vpon them, he may easilie overlooke the Campe, and then it is subiect to be played vpon by an Enemies Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>That it be made (if it be possible) neere vnto some brooke or river, which may commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously serve, aswell, for the watering of Horse, and Cattell, as also for the Souldiers, and by which, with shipping, or boats one may bring vp Munition with provisions, and Victuals to the Campe, by the helpe of a running river, or the winde for the saving of excessive charges, when one is driven to bring them vp to the Armie by <hi>Convoyes,</hi> and waggons, which oftentimes causeth a dearth in the Armie: for commonly Victulars, and Sutlars raises the price of their Victuals, and commodities, according to the lengh of the way, if they be constrayned to bring them vp by waggon hire. Besides, it is a great advantage for a Quarter, to lie by a river side, because sometimes the water may be carryed round about the <hi>Campe,</hi> which will make it stronger, then if it were lodged in a plaine Feild, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed with some small Forts, and Redoubts; so that all that charge is saved in makeing of workes, if the Campe may commodiously be enclosed about with water. I say nothing of the great stinke, caused by dead Horse, and beasts, as also by Butchers and their sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which like wise is avoyded by the helpe of Water, neither are men so subiect to sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and pestilence, which takes away many times a greater number of people, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens an Armie more, then if it were assaulted by an Enemie. For, the prevention of which inconvenience, the Carrions, panchescand garbidges of Beasts are cast into it, and carryed away with the streame, and the Butchers quartered in the most remote parr of the Campe.</p>
                  <p>One must also have a speciall care, that there bee no thick-bussches, and woods about it, where an Enemie may lie in <hi>Ambuscado,</hi> or fortifie themselves without any hindrance, which would keepe a Campe in Continuall feare, of being assaulted by an Enemie out of a wood.</p>
                  <p>To make choise then of the sittest places, to encampe and Quarter in, those are held the most commodious, which are situated in a plaine Feild, seing an Enemie may be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a far of, having then time to draw into Armes, to oppose them, and that the Canon may play vpon them, in case an Enemie would attempt to assault the Campe by force.</p>
                  <p>As many sicknesses are engendred by stanch, end the putrifaction of the aire: so likewise many are caused by Moorish grounds, <hi>Marras,</hi> and bogs, in regard of the damps, and fogs, which riseth out of the waters, as also poysonable vapours, arising out of marshie grounds, where vpon the Souldiers hutts are built.</p>
                  <p>Therefore one ought to be well informed, before a quarter or a campe be made for an Armie, whether those grounds bee covered or overflowhe with water, which may often happen in <hi>Autume,</hi> or <hi>Winter,</hi> which were a great annoyance, and hurt to the Campe, if it were driven to stay there all winter, and that one knew not the Condition of the place. Againe, it may serve for some vse to helpe the beseiged, or those which come to relieve the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94790:29"/>
Towne, when they may turne the water by some places into the Campe, or can cut some dikes or Seabanques, or keepe vp the water by banks, and sluces, to make it overflow the <hi>Campagnie,</hi> which will bring a greater dammago to the Campe, then fire would doe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one ought to consider, and ponder well all these things, and to thinke vpon some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie to prevent these inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>One ought also to make choise of such a place, which yeelds good store of gràsse, and hay for Cattell, and straw for the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modation of the Souldiers; because the want of fourrage for Horse, will constraine them to fetch it farre by convoyes, which is dangerous for the Souldiers, when an Enemie lies vpon the snap for them, and their Horses in those places, where they are driven to fetch their fourrage, which one is forced to doe with great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyes,</hi> and excessive expenses. Also there must be care taken, that there bee no want of wood for fyring, and building of Souldiers buts, as also straw serving for the same vse.</p>
                  <p>A Campe ought not to quartered too neere the Towne Beseiged, lest the Enemie may reach it, and doe great annoyance to it with his Canon, neither ought it to be quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red too farre of, but that one quarter may with expedition relieve one another, as also those which worke in the Approches, if the beseiged should sallie out vpon them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the furthest, and the nearest distance for the better safety of the Campe, is to lie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Canon shot.</p>
                  <p>The Circumference, measure, greatnesse, and largnesse of a Campe, ought to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the greatnesse or littlenesse, of it: for one must not take a place too little for a great Armie, neither a place too great for a small Armie: for the one will not be able to defend the Campe, because of the smalnesse of it, and the other not able, and sufficient to defend a great place.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it is a point of great consequence for a Campe, to have all the <hi>avenues,</hi> and passages that comes to it well guarded, so that an Enemie cannot lodge neare it, to hinder the provisions and Victuals which comes to it, for want where of many times an Armie is forced to rise.</p>
                  <p>A Campe then being endowed with all these <hi>Proprieties,</hi> no question but it is well sett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But seing that such places are seldome found, which answers to all these proprieties described above, one must accommodate themselves, according to the propriety of the place, and repaire that by Art, which is wanting by Nature.</p>
                  <p>If there being any hils, or <hi>heigths</hi> in it, you must quarter, and lodge vpon them, when the nature of the place will afford it, or if there be any other commodious place neere vnto the Quarter, it ought to be taken in, and environned with a Trench, and a Redoubt made in it, and Ordinance planted vpon it. But this height being situated vpon a passage, or place of importance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Fort is made vpon it in taking away, as much as possible may be all advantage from an Enemie.</p>
                  <p>The seige of the <hi>Bosch</hi> may give vs an exsample herein, where was a height situated vpon the way, as you go to <hi>Vliemen,</hi> and towards the Longstrate, vpon the top of which hill, a fouresquare Fort was made with foure <hi>Demy-Bulwarkes,</hi> and besides a <hi>Crowne-worke</hi> before it, and before that as a surplus, there was made a <hi>Horne-worke,</hi> all which workes were neverthelesse environned with the line of circumvalation, which encompassed the whole Armie: for the Enemie could hardly assault the Campe on this side, because the hill lay so, that it commanded all the grounds about it.</p>
                  <p>When there is no River, then all necessaries, and provisions must be brought to the Campe by waggons, wherevpon care must be taken, that the waggonmen and Sutlars set not too high a price vpon their provisions, and Victuals, which might cause a Dearth and scarcity in the Army.</p>
                  <p>For the avoyding of stincks and noisome smels, the dead Carions of horses, and other Beasts ought to be carryed and buryed farre off without the camp and quarters, to which order also the Butchers are subiect, for the carrying away of the panches, and Entrailes of the Cattell which they kill, and to bury them in pits without the campe.</p>
                  <p>The woods, thickers, and groves, which stand not farre from the campe, ought to be taken in within the Trench, when it may conveniently be done with asmall charge, which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94790:30"/>
wood and timber may serve for firing, and other good vses. But when they lie too farre of, and cannot have all within the Compasse of the line of Circumvalation, which may be dammageable to the Campe, then they are cut downe, and burnt, lest an Enemie might lay any <hi>Ambuscadoes</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>Also, having a water, or a river, which may be stopped by the Beseiged: so that in time, it might overflow the Campe, one ought to take a singular care by hindring it, and casting vp of some bank to stop, and carry it about the Campe, to discharge it self elswhere, wich necessity, and experience will teach one.</p>
                  <p>All these things then being maturely considered, and overweighed, after one is well informed of the nature, and condition of the soile, lying about the Towne, or Fortresse, which is to be beseiged, and being come within two or three Durch miles of that place, the Quartermaster Generall before the Armie rides out with some 80, 100, or a greater number of Horse, as necessity may require, to view the towne, or Fortresse to be beseiged and considers well the soile and grounds that lies about it, and draws a draught and plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of them, that he may the better distribute, and give out the severall Quarters.</p>
                  <p>All Quarters are not alike over all, and of one and the same forme, but one must accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himself many times, according to the site of the place; for sometimes one must content himself with one Quarter alone, and otherwhiles the Campe may be devided into two, three, foure, or many quarters.</p>
                  <p>The Forme is also diverse, seing one must governe themselves according to the situasion of the place, The largnesse must be answerable to the number of the Regiments, which are to be Quartered, and which shal be handled in the next chapter.</p>

               <head type="sub">TOGETHER, With the true measure and distances of them, according to his Highnesse the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his new Order for a Regiment, and for the quartering of the Captaines in the Reere, for the preventing of fire, and disorders,</head>
               <p>BEfore wee come to the division of the ground, appointed for the Quartering of a regiment of foote, it will be necessarie to discribe first, how much ground, commonly a Companie of 120, or of a 150 and of 200 heades must haue, which may serue then as a Generall rule in the distribution of the quartering of severall Regiments, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diverse Colours, and Companies vnder them.</p>
               <p>First for a Colours of 120 foote, there is ordayned three hundred foote deepe. But the bredth must be according to the number of the heades in a Company, which are some more some lesse: For a Company of 100, or 120 heads must take vp 24 foote inbredth, that is, two rowes of Huts, and a street betwixt them, a Companie of 150 must haue 40 foote in bredth, to wit, three rowes of huts and two streetes, and a Collonels Companie of 200 heades, requires 56 foote in breedth, that is foure rowes of Huts, and three streetes, besides the back streetes, which are betweene Companie and Campany.</p>
               <p>As for Example, the <hi>Quartermaster</hi> hath giuen him a <hi>Paralellogramma</hi> of ground, which is 300 foote deepe, and 24 foote broade for a Companie of 120 heades, which he devides thus, from the Lieutenants and Ensignes huts downeward to the Sariants huts in the Reere, of the Sariants hutt, and the boughs of the Captaines hutt: next the Captaine hath allowed him 40 foote in depth and some 20 foote btoad (because a passage for the Souldiers must not be stopt vp) for him to build in, Then betweene the Reere of the Captaines, and the Sutlars hutts, there is a large streete of 40 foote made for the passage of men and waggons, and for feare of fyre. And last of all, there is 20 foote allowed for the depth of the Sutlars huts, to wit, ten foote for the forepart of his hutt for eating and drinking in, and 10 foote for his Kitchin, and this is the distribution for a Companie, which must take vp (according to the Princes new order) three hundred foote in depth.</p>
               <p>The bredth of a Quarter, is according to the number of the Heades of a Company.</p>
               <p>In the depth of 180 foote for the two rowes of huts aboue menrioned, there may be made in each row, twentie or two and twentie Hutts with a distance of two or three foote betweene every Cabin, for the avoyding Eues-droppings and a little trench to receiue the Water made betwixt thim.</p>
               <p>The doores of the Lieutenants, and Ensignes Cabbins commonly opens towards the Front, and the Armes, and the Alarme place, but the Sariants towardes the Reere.</p>

               <head>THE FORME OF QVARTERING OF A REGIMENT of Horse, consisting of five Troupes, according to the Prince of <hi>ORANGE</hi> his new Order, the Captaines being quartered in the Reere. THE THIRD CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>FOr everie Cornet of Horse, there is ordayned (as the foote are) a depth of 300 foote, the bredth is not alwais a like, but must be given according to the greatnesse, and smalnesse of the number of heads, serving vnder the said Cornet.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Cornet</hi> then containinge hundred Horsemen, must have a place of 300 foot deep, and 70 foote broad, wherein they are to lodge, and content themselves.</p>
               <p>The Captaines Hutt of the Troupe, with his boughes is 70 foote broad, and 40 foote deep, being a part of the 300 foot abovesaid.</p>
               <p>Betweene the Reere of the rowes of the Horsemens Huts, and the Captaines, there is a street of 20 foote, and the two rowes of the Horsemens Huts (as the foot is) is 180 foot deepe, to wit, from the Lieutenants, and Cornets, Huts in the front, to the Quartermasters and Corporels in the Reere, wich makes in all two hundred foote deepe, and 70 foote broad, the room for the Huts in each row is ten foote, after which there is a small streete of 5 foote, in which the Huts have their doores, and commings out. For the Horse there is a space left of ten foote broad, seing that the Cornet consists of no more then of 100 horse, so that there are placed 50 Horse in one row, and 50 in another, and every Horse is allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed 4 foote in bredth, and 10 foote in depth, which is the space also appointed for his Master.</p>
               <p>Betweene the Captaines Hut, and the Sutlars, there is also a streete of 40 foote for the same reason, as wee have discribed in the Quartering of foote, after which there is a place for the Sutlars Huts, which is answerable to the breadth of the Cornet 70 foot, and for the depth of his fore Hutt 10 foote, and for his kitchin 10 foote more allowed him, so that the true dimension for the Quartering of a Troupe of 100 Horse, is 300 foote deep, and 70 foote broad.</p>
               <p>But a greater Cernet consisting of 140 heads, (or it may be 150) then they have given them a row of Huts more, so that they must have in al three rowes, of which the last stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alone, is separated from the second by a streete of 10 foot, which reacheth from the hutts of the second row, and the Horse are set behind this new row, after which (as before) there is a depth of 10 foote for a Horse, and a small streete of 5 foote, and for the Huts of the Horsemen likewise 10 foot, whence followeth, that the breadth for a Cornet of Horse of 140 heads takes vp 105 foote, for the two rowes takeing vp 70 foot, if you adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the two streets, the one of 10, and the other of 5 foote, with the distance left, for the Horse, and the Horsemen, makeing 20 foot, it is in all 35 foote, vpon shall then have the breadth of 105 foot for a Cornet of 140 heads, and the depth of 300 foot as before.</p>
               <p>Note that every Horse hath his head standing towards his masters hut, that vpon any occasion his Master may goe directly to his Horse, without going about his hut.</p>
               <p>The space being deepe enough for the huts, they neede not build them closse one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but leave a little distance of a foote and a halfe, or two foote at the most betweene the Hutts: but betweene every fifth and sixth hutt, there is an open space left of some 6 or 8 foote, for the Horsemen to draw out of, if necessity should require.</p>
               <p>The Hutts which the Horsemen build, are built in the same manner as the foote are, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that they take vp more roome, for the depth of the Hutts for the foote, is but 8 foote, and the Horsemen must haue ten.</p>
               <p>The two first Hutts in the head of the Quarter is appointed for the <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Cornets,</hi> and the two last in the Reere are ordayned for the <hi>Quartermasters,</hi> and the <hi>Corporals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before the Horse, (between the Hutts and the streets) there are mangers made for the Horse with boords, or plancks fastned and nailed together, which stand vpon posts driven

into the ground, and have S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iles covered over them, from the one side to the other, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many Horse are of such a nature and condition, that they will not stand together, there are posts tyed between them, that they may not strike, and hurt one another.</p>
               <p>Now if there be any likelihood, that it may prove a settled <hi>Camp,</hi> or <hi>Leager,</hi> then they may also build Huts for their Horse, to keep them from cold and Sun. Th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se Huts are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with straw, as the Horsemens are, but are open before and behinde, (because every Horseman may have an eye to his Horse) so that they are but onely covered over head on both sides, which coverings are also made oftentimes with such Sayles, as Tents are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made of.</p>
               <p>But the Horse being come to such a place, are commonly lodged and quartered first in Villages, houses, and barnes, if there be any thereabouts, at leastwise till they have built them huts for themselves, and their Horse. But finding no Houses, Stables, and Barnes, or such like accommodations for them, then they will be constrained to let their Horses stand uncovered, till they have built their owne Cabins, which being done, then they may make their Horses.</p>

                  <p>BEsides, the Quarters aboue mentioned, there are also Particular Quarters in a <hi>Campe,</hi> which ought to come into consideration, to wit, The <hi>Generals,</hi> The <hi>Generall of the Ordinance,</hi> the Quarter for the Canon, Carriages, and waggons, as also some other Quarters, which shall be discribed as falloweth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Generall</hi> hath a square place of Ground giuen him, which as a Regiment is 300 foote deepe, and 600 foote broade, and his Tents and Pivillions sett vp, and disposed of as the <hi>Generall,</hi> and his <hi>Tent-master</hi> shall thinke fitting.</p>
                  <p>Also there is given to the <hi>Generall of the Ordinance,</hi> a depth of 300 foote, and a bredth of 480 foote for him, and his traine of Ordinance, Officers, and Handie crafts men to Quarter in, hauing a little trench cast round about it.</p>
                  <p>In which ground also, is built a foure square Redoubt with haire cloth ouer it, to laye in powder, and Fireworkes, for feare of fyring, and to keepe them from wetnesse, and rayne seing they are not so combustible and will not take fire so soone, as straw, or sailes will.</p>
                  <p>There is also a place ordayned of 300 foote in bredth, and depth for some chiefe Officers of the feild, which are not lodged within the Regiments.</p>
                  <p>The waggons also have a certaine place given them, that they may give noe hindrance to the <hi>Campe.</hi> The depth is also commonly 300 foote, but the bredth must be answerable to the nomber of waggons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Market place,</hi> where Marchands, Victulars, Tradsmen, Butchers, and Bakers are lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged have a depth also of 300 foote given them, and is some 400 foote broad, in the midst whereof there is an open place left for the market place, and the sides are divided into ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of hutts and streetes. They make ordinarily eight rowes of hutts, whereof foure are sett upon the one, and foure vpon the other side, every hutt being ten foote broade, and betweene every two rowes of hutts, there is a streete left some 20 foote broade.</p>

               <head>The Ichnographie of a Campe. THE FOVRTH CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Quartermaster Generall</hi> makes first a Scale, which will serue for a sheete of paper, fitting it according to the proportion, as the said paper will beare, either greater or lesser, and then makes a draught vpon it. According to the measure of his Scale, he drawes out vpon this, some <hi>parallell</hi> lines of 300 foote deepe, which shewes the depth of every quarter, with some other <hi>parallell</hi> lines of some 50, 80, or 90 foote, as the ground will afford, and the divisions betweene Regiment and Regiment.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he marketh upon a paper, euery one of the said quarters, and Regiments a part, according to the proportion of the same scale, as one hath drawne the lines aboue said, and then cut it of so that they haue all one depth of 300 foote, and the bredth according to the list of the number of the Companies of every Regiment, and how many foote every Regiment and quarter will take up. It were better to take a peece of past board paper &amp; then make &amp; cut out also vpon the said paper, the depth the bredth, and the name of the Regiment the Colonell and person to whome the quarter belongs; doing the like in all the other quarters. These littles papers being so cut and ordered, one may put and lay them again upon the paper with the <hi>parallell</hi> lines abouesaid, euen till they he laid according to your desire, and let them be as they are fitted. One must nevertheless have a care, that the Generals quarters be in the middest, and that there bee a convenient space without his quarter, aswell before, as on both sides, as the figure following will showe marked with the letter A, where the Generall is lodged in the midst of the Campe, and the bredth of his quarter, according to this scale is 1250 foote, and the depth as is said 300.</p>
               <p>The quarters are separated one from an other by streetes, and divisions some lesse some more, as the ground will give it, as somewils 500, otherwhils 80, 92, or 100 foote betwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne quarter and quarter, as you may see in the figure following.</p>
               <p>Finally the <hi>Quartermaster Generall</hi> takes first the bredth and depth of the whole quarter, and Campe, and draws it out (as io taught) upon a paper. The bredth here takes up 3000 foote and the depth 2000.</p>
               <p>The draught of the campe being drawne upon a paper, and the whole quarter designed, it will be easie then to lay them out in the field.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To this end, the <hi>Quartermaster Generall</hi> hath a chaine divided into <hi>Rhyn-landish</hi> foote &amp; Rodds at 12 foot the rodd, &amp; an instrument vsed in fortification, or at least a wodden crosse with foure right angles, and a good number of Beackons with banroles vpon them, called <hi>Quarter beackons,</hi> whereof the statues are painted, and are some nine, or ten foote long, and sets vp one of these angles of every quarter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Being come into the field, in which he is resolued to encampe the Army, first he layes out the circuit of the Generall quarter, with foure exteriour lines in such sort, that every corner of the quartes makes a right angle.</p>
               <p>After one hath measured out the foure lines abouesaid, he sets vp foure quarter Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and then begins to lay out every quarter a part, according to the proportion, which he hath marked in this paper: but to the end one may not err, he puts upon the little cut paper the number of every quarter, with which also the Beacons are marked, by which meanes the same quarter is bounded in the field, and the number is painted, or cut upon the Beacons. It will not be amisse, to have alwayes foure of them of one number, which may easely be known by the Beacons, in case they were all of one coulour. All which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated in the figure of a Campe where the Beacons are set up, and noted with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4.</p>

And then by the rule of 3 (knowing the line and circumference) and the number of companies, say, the number of all the Regiments, and Compagnies which are to make upe the line of <hi>Circumvallation,</hi> amounts to so many feete, or rodes, how much ground then must a Regiment of ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies haue that containes so many men. This <hi>calculation</hi> being made, the companies of euery Regiment draw out so many men, after the Quartermaster hath furnished them with materials, which is quickly done, seing the men are relieved, and many hands (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe is) makes light worke, and will make hast, that they may haue time to build their own huts and cabins to keepe them vnder covert.</p>
                  <p>The quarters being thus fortified, and the line of <hi>Circumvallation</hi> made a double ditch for horses and strong <hi>Redoubts, Horne-works, Crowne-works, Batteries, Half-moones</hi> and

               <head>OF ALL MANNER OF APPROCHES, AND their Profiles, with the definition what approches are. THE FIFTH CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>THe Approch by which one approcheth safest towards a Towne, or a Fortresse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, are certaine hollow ditches; called <hi>Trenches</hi> digged into the Earth, whereby one may approch neare vnto a Towne, or a fortresse covertly, without any great harme, if the lines be carryed well, and kept from the sight of an enemy.</p>
               <p>In approching one ought to consider well; 1. <hi>The situation of the Towne or fort to be besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi> 2. <hi>The propriety and forme of the approach.</hi> 3. <hi>The beginning and distance of them, and fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their profile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Site of the place, one ought to consider well the propriety, and nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whether the ground bee high, low, hilly, or plaine. In plaine and even ground, one may finde foure kinds of Earth, to wit, 1. a Clayie &amp; a solid Earth, 2. Sandie, 3. a Spongie and rotten earth, &amp; 4. moorish and a marchie ground which may bee covered &amp; lie vnder water, hauing no firme foundation to work vpon. Secondly, hilly places whether they have a solid foundation, 3. Sandie, and 4. Stonie. Also one must take into consideration the Forrests, woods, wayes, ditches, hills, and such like things, as may lye round about it, or go towards it.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of foure wanner of Approches.</head>
                  <p>FIrst, if one can not make choise of such ground as they desire, then one must take it as it fals out, whence there follows diuerse manner of Approches; for if it be good ground, then they run their lines directly from the left hand to the right, &amp; from the right hand to the left, continuing it <hi>alternatively</hi> till you come to your distance desired, the half of which trench is digged into the Earth, &amp; the other halfe cast vp with a <hi>parapet</hi> raised vpon it, which serves as a blinde to keep your men from the sight of an enemy, and thus you continue your approch by windings and turnings, till you come to the <hi>Counterscharfe,</hi> and moate of the Towne besieged, and this kinde of approach you vse in good and firme Earth.</p>
                  <p>The second kinde of Approach is that, which is made in a <hi>Sandie ground,</hi> which you may run in the same manner with windings, and turnings as you did the first, saving that your <hi>parapet</hi> will not hold with sand, and therefore, because Sand is not so good to work vpon, and will not lie so firme as other Earth doth, but will cost more labour, and require more time then solid Earth, therefore one must approch neerer and neerer by setting vp of Gabions.</p>
                  <p>The third way hath another difference, then those two aboue mentioned, for sometimes one may finde good Earth, and Sandie mingled together, yea, and somewhiles a <hi>Marras</hi> on both sides, in so much that one shall haue but a narrow way, through which one is to carry his approch, and as in the former you cannot run your lines from the left hand to the right, or from the right hand to the left, so in this you are driven to run a line directly vpon the Towne or Fortresse besieged.</p>
                  <p>Now this manner of approach carried in a right line, is not so laboursome &amp; chargeable as the others before-named, which are run with <hi>oblique lines:</hi> but the greatest labour is, such an Approach must be made deeper, then the former, &amp; do require a double trench &amp; <hi>parapet,</hi> whereas the others haue but a single one, and ever and anon there must be blinds sett vp because this kinde is more dangerous, and in this approch the one half of the Earth is sett vp with a parapet on the one side, and the other half on the other side.</p>
                  <p>The Approch which is made through moorish, and marchie grounds overflowne, is almost impossible, by reason of the inconstancie of the water, which riseth, and falleth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the season, and which causeth many inconveniences: for when one expects dry
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94790:41"/>
season, the weather may alter and proue rainie and stormie, which may not onely hinder the approch begun, but also fill the trenches with water, therefore in such cases, one must accommodate themselves, according to the weather, and vse the wisedome, &amp; experience of jngeniers herein, for the preuenting of these inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>As the half of an ordinarie approch, is digged into the ground, so the other half is cast vpon ground: this kinde being made over water and <hi>Marras,</hi> having no firme foundation, the foundation of them is layd by filling vp the water with bundles of Boughs, Brush, fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, &amp; such like things, hauing Earth cast vpon them, to settle them, &amp; make them lie fast, &amp; the Earth being brought vpon wheelebarrowes from some other place, a <hi>parapet</hi> is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and blinds sett vp, that the workemen, &amp; Souldiers may work and be in more safety, which guards it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth difference of approch, is also made by Earth brought from some other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, having <hi>Fagots, Brush, Bavins,</hi> and planches layd vpon it, with <hi>parapets</hi> and blinds sett vp.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, having want of good Earth, and finding great store of Sand, then the parapet must be made with <hi>Gabions,</hi> and Cannon Baskets filled with Earth.</p>
                  <p>The sixth &amp; last manner taketh its originall from the former, &amp; is made with Redoubts in ioyning the one to the other.</p>
                  <p>And if your meete with a stonie place, then you must help your self with <hi>Gabions,</hi> &amp; fetch your Earth from some other place, as you did in marchie grounds.</p>
                  <p>These are all the severall kindes of Approches, that we have mentioned here in this Chapter, which one cannot make without difference and judgement, because the one is more laborious, and dangerous then the other, as we have taught.</p>
                  <p>But to the end all inconveniences may be avoided, one must first informe himself well the nature of the place, through which one is resolved to run an approch, &amp; take a speciall care, that no errour and faults be committed through ignorance, which may loose time expence and labour, and may crosse the happy successie of an Armie, for it were an absurd thing, of one should make that approchin a moorish ground, which is to bee made in a plaine place, where there is good Earth, where one hath elbow room, and space enough to run oblique lines, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one would make them above the ground, when there is Earth enough to be digged out of the ground and cast vp.</p>
                  <p>Besides, one ought to consider well, the distance of the first breaking of ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Towne or Fortresse to be approched to, that one begins not roo neere, nor too farre off, for the beginning of the Approches being too farre from the Fortresse, one looses both time and paines, when one begins to breake ground from a place which is in safety.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, to begin an approch within the sight of an Ennemie, one cannot so well defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de himself from musket shott, because the Muskettiers may take a surer marke, then when they shoot at <hi>Randum,</hi> and it will be hort for the workmen, before they can gett into the ground, besides the workemen cannot be so well seconded, and relieved without great danger, especially if the besieged sallies out, and gives them hort <hi>Alarmes,</hi> so that they must be presently, relived, or else they will be driven to quit the approches and to retire, if they be not seconded betimes.</p>

                  <head>The distances betweene the beginning of an Approch, and a Fortresse.</head>
                  <p>HEnce one may clearely vnderstand, the distance of the Approch to the Towne or Fortresse besieged, and the place where one begins to breake ground first, ought to be as farre, as a musket can well carry from the outworks of the Fortresse, which may be about some 90, 80, 70, or 60 rod at 12 foote the rodd, or as the nature of the place wil afoard it.</p>

                     <hi>or first breaking of Ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When one would begin an Approch, there must be choise made of 200, 300, 400, or 500 lusty souldiers, which are vsed to work, now besides the ordinairies armes, which they carrie, they take downe alo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g with them into the approches spades, shovells, pickaxses, and others materials necessary for work, and are set in order by the Ingenier in that place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the Approch begins, &amp; to the end they may begin with the more safety, they have diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se <hi>guards of</hi> Foote, and horse standing up and down, here and there to defend them, if the besieged should sally out vpon the workemen, and because they may make a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, first they cast vp a <hi>Redoubt</hi> or two, from whence the trench &amp; approch is run, which are environned with a parapet, &amp; a good ditch, &amp; the sides of the redouts made some eigt rods square, as you may see in the profile of trenches.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, sometimes as occasion may serve, they make <hi>demy Bulwarkes,</hi> or it may bee <hi>Whole Bulwarkes,</hi> for which one takes a <hi>Profilie</hi> answerable to the greatnesse, for when they are litle one makes vse onely of the <hi>Profile</hi> of ordinarie trenches, and when they are great thier <hi>Profile</hi> must be likewise correspondent vnto them.</p>
                  <p>These workes and Redouts serve for a Retreat to the workemen, if an Enemy should make a great sallie vpon them: for being retreated into the said <hi>Redouts,</hi> they may resist an Enemie, and stopp them, till they are seconded, so that such <hi>Redouts</hi> are very necessary. For if the workemen had not a place to retreate into, they would beforced to betake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their heeles, and to abandon and loose their worke.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Inginiers</hi> which are employed therein, ought to vse all the skill, industrie, and experience they have to run their lines in such a sort, that those which are in the trenches and approches may not be discovered and seen by an ennemy. In a word, they may runne their approches with the more safety, and as much expedition as possbile bee towards the place, or part of the Fortresse, which de Generall desires to become master off.</p>
                  <p>There are two principall parts in a Town or Fortress, one of which must be battered, if one is resolved to take it in, and that is, either a <hi>Curtaine,</hi> or a <hi>Bulwarke.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>What part of a Fortresse ought to be approched to.</head>
                  <p>IT is not good to approch to a <hi>Curtaine,</hi> which is defended by the two next Bulwarkes, and their flankes, when you are to expect an enemies Canon continually on both sides of you, especially, when you would give an assault vpon it; for afterward it may easely be cut off. Besides that the moate is broader before the Curtaine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in other places whence it followeth manifestly, that there is no advantage in approching vpon such a place.</p>
                  <p>But a <hi>Bulwarke</hi> is the safest, &amp; best to be approched to and taken in: my reasons are these first the moate is not so broad and large, as it is before the <hi>Curtaine,</hi> &amp; a Bulwarke hath but a single defence, coming from the Bulwark opposite to it, which may be better beaten vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Batteries then the Curtaine can. Moreover, a Bulwarke hath but a little defence of it self, because on may be forced to retire from it, &amp; to make new workes, &amp; cuttings of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde that part which is quitted. And because there is no so much space, as is within the curtaine, the fortification there of is more painefull, and more incommodious, &amp; therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re it is better to approach to wards Bulwarkes, then curtaines, which is found by practize, and daily experience.</p>
                  <p>There are other works belonging to a Town, or Fortresse, as (<hi>Crown-works, Hoorn-works, Tenailles, Ravelings, Halfe-moones,</hi> and others. The manner of carrying of approches wil be cleare and easie enough, when wee come to shew an approch by figure vpon a Towne or Fortresse which is to be taken in.</p>
                  <p>After one hath naturely resolved, whether he will run an Approch vpon a Curtaine, or a Bulwarke. The Ingenier being prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the breaking of the ground, is to shew &amp; informe the workemen well, how they are to run their line, and as necessity requires, being of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse lengths, but most commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly some 20, or 40 rod long, or sometimes shorter or longer
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94790:42"/>
and broken and turned as often as is necessary. The line then being laid out, &amp; marked they divide and place the Workemen in order, that they may not hinder one another.</p>
                  <p>Now they give to every man the length of foure or fiue foote, and every one maketh as much hast as possible may bee, to gett into the ground, for the avoyding of the danger wherevnto he is exposed, while he stands vpon the open feild, therefore the Earth, which he diggeth he casteth it vp before him, and with all expedition maketh a hole like a graue: it is needlesse that at the first breaking, the ditch should be any broader or deeper then three foot, for the Earth being cast vp three foote aboue the Ground, and the ditch like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise three foote deepe, a man then hath covert enough.</p>
                  <p>The Workemen then being got into the Ground, they enlarge and deepen the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as necessity requires, but those which are fardest of from the Towne, they need not be soo deepe at the beginning, as when they come neerer to the Fortresse. The bredth of the Approches ought to be some 10 or 12 foote broad, as may be found necessarie: yea, sometimee one is constrayned to make them larger, least they might be to narrow, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard waggons may be driuen through them, with materialls necessarie for the Gallerie, as also Canon which must be drawne downe, and mounted vpon the Batteries.</p>
                  <p>But by how much larger the Approches are made, by so much ought the parapet of the Trench to be heightned, that the Enemie may not discover the Souldiers that are in them.</p>
                  <p>Especially one ought to heighten those points, and windings, where the Line turnes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it may proue very hurtfull and dangerous.</p>
                  <p>While the Souldiers are busied in makeing of the Line, others are employed in makeing of a Batterie, to hinder the Enemie from Sallying out.</p>
                  <p>When the night is past, there are fresh workemen sent downe to relieve the first, and to enlarge, heighten and repaire that nights worke, vnlesse some of them are willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their worke, and these commanded men, are to have ten stiuers a peece, whieh the Quartermaster of every Regiment, who delivers the matterials doth solicite for, and payes them.</p>
                  <p>After the first nights worke (or it may be the same) there are <hi>Corps de guard</hi> made, to putt a good number of Souldiers into, where they keepe their <hi>Maine guard,</hi> which are made sometimes within the lines, with which the <hi>Corps de guard</hi> ought to be <hi>Parallels,</hi> or else vpon the point where the line turnes, and sometimes without the Approches, to which the <hi>Corps of guard</hi> are ioyned to them by a line of <hi>Communication:</hi> so that they lie three or 4 Rod from them.</p>
                  <p>It is not alwaies needfull that these Redoubts be made square, but one may make them <hi>long-wise,</hi> or else with 5 <hi>Angles,</hi> and after diverse other manners, as the Ground will best afford.</p>
                  <p>Most commonly one workes by night, that they may receiue the lesse harme, and that the day following the worke may be repaired.</p>
                  <p>When one line is finished as abouesaid, and that it must be run no further that way, the <hi>Inginier</hi> turnes the line another way, (bearing it from the Towne or Fortresse) and placeth the Workemen in order as abouesaid, in continuing so by windings, and turnings. till he hath gott something neere vnto the Fortresse beseiged, and makeing good the Line conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuly with <hi>Corps de guards</hi> and Batteries.</p>
                  <p>But the neerer they approach vnto the Fortresse, the more subject they are to danger, so that their pay is encreased every day, as the Approach is advanced, seing they hazard their liues for it, they haue a halfe Rixdaller a night, sometimes a whole Rixdaller other-whiles a Rixdaller and a halfe, yea sometimes ten Rixdallers for an howers worke, if it be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>Finally when you are approched with your trench so farre, that you are continually in the sight of an Enemy, &amp; where you cannot get any more ground, but with great danger, they make vse then with an other manner of digging, or an Approach called commonly a <hi>Sapp,</hi> which is made in this mannet following.</p>
                  <p>When a resolution is taken, to approach vnto a <hi>Curtaine,</hi> or a <hi>Bulwarke,</hi> you run a right
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94790:42"/>
line upon that place, which you intend to assault: as for example, suppose it were upon the <hi>Demiface</hi> of a Bulwark, in such sort, that it lies without the flancking blowes of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse.</p>
                  <p>A man then kneeling upon his knees, digs to get into the Ground, and casts up the Earth before him on both sides, with a short spade, towards that part of the Fortresse, till he hath digged three foote into the Ground, and that he is covered with the Earth, casting alwaies the Earth like a moald before him towards the Towne, and on that side, where the most danger lies, he ought to cast up the Earth so high that it may be able to shelter those, which comes to repaire and make the Sapp larger. After the first man which makes the Sapp is got into the ground and covered with earth, he advanceth forward and continues the Sap, till he hath got some six foot, and then follows another Sapper presently, who repaires and enlargeth the ditch to the bredth of six foot, while the other advances forward three foote further in bredth and got so deep, that he is alwaies covered with the Earth, which he casts up before him, and the other follows him continually enlarging the dich from three foot to six. After him comes a third man, which finishes the whole Sapp, and gives it the conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient height, depth, and bredth answerable to the first approch. But one must have a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular care, that the approches and Sapps bee not digged so deepe, as that water may rise in them, but that they may alwaies remain dry upon firme ground, which the condition of the ditch wil shew it: For when the water within is very deep, and the declinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> high enough, one may make the Approches as deepe as the ditch, when the water that is in it, is distant from the plain Earth.</p>
                  <p>Touching the manner of Working, an Agreement is made with certaine worke-men, because a greater number of worke-men cannot worke in so narrow a passage, they take on five or six worke-men, and give them 4, 5, 6, yea, sometimes more as six-dallers apeece, as they can agree with them, and as the danger is little, or great.</p>
                  <p>In this manner of work, being come so neer for the safeguard of the Muskettiers, which are to give fire, there are <hi>musket baskets</hi> set up vpon the top of the Parapet of the approches, closse one to another filled with Sand or Earth, between which the Muskettiers puts out the noses of their muskets, to give fire upon the besieged.</p>
                  <p>And because the Approches, the neerer you come to the Fortresse are made much dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then at the first breaking of ground, there are one or two foote Bankes made for the souldiers to mount up upon, and to discharge their muskets or firelocks.</p>
                  <p>As for example, the figure following numbred 153, is the part of a Towne or Fortresse upon which wee are to run our approches, and that upon firme and good ground.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The First Example.</head>
                  <p>For as much as the Fortresse is environed with a <hi>Corridor</hi> or a Counterscharfe, one must not take the distance from the great Rampart, but from the Counterscharfe, and begin the Approches some 90 rods distance from the <hi>Corridor,</hi> because one may with the more safety put the spade into the Earth. Therefore one beginneth the first line of approch from the letter A, and runs it to the letter B, being some 30 rods long or thereabouts. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the line is fortified with a Redoubt marked with the letter C, into which the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (if the besieged should fall out) may make their retreate, and into which also the guards for the workmen may retire. The first line turneth at B, taking its beginning neere unto the Corps de guard D, and runs to E, being some 30 rods in length, where an other Redoubt is made marked with the letter F, to hold a guard in it, and because it might be dangerous to run this line any further, it turneth from F to G, and from G to H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where another Corps de guard is made. For the neerer you approch unto the Fortresse, the more the approches must be strengthened with guards and batteries. Besides the Approches there ought to be made deeper, and higher, because you come neerer the Enemies, Canon, and his Musket shott, which may shoot the surer upon you, here then you begin to set up Musket baskets, and make foot-bankes to your Approches, that the Souldiers may gett up to them when they are commanded to give fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:94790:43"/>When one is approched so neere by meanes of these turnings and traverses that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder may be run with a long Traverse, then one begins to Sapp from H to I, from which also one may make another line to approch unto the other side of the same Bulwarke, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the other Bulwarke, as the line from I to K, shews. Behinde these lines the Muskettiers gets up allwaies to discover, and shoot at those that would peepe into them.</p>
                  <p>There are likewise two Redoubts made on both sides for guards, as the letters N and O, do show.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Interim</hi> a Sapp is begun, that runneth towards the Bulwark, which one is resolved to mine in, and which is made in the same manner, as we have described above, when you sapt into the Counterscharfe, and that you are come to the brinke of the Moate, then you are to fill and damme it up, and to make a gallerie, and blinds which wee will treate of when wee come to speak of a Gallerie.</p>
                  <p>While you are busied about making your approches, diverse batteries are made here and there, which serve partly to spoile the Ramparts and partly to dismount and hinder the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Canon from playing upon you, and to keepe the besieged in awe, that the workmen may worke with the more safety, as you see by these fixe Batteries noted in the figure 153, and thus much for Approches upon good ground.</p>
                  <p>Wee have divided the approches, which run in a right line into three sorts: The first is in a narrow way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an earth which may be spitted out somewhat deepe, and yet neverthelesse without turnings and Traverses: The other is when you cannot digge into the earth, but there is, or you shall have water presently, as hapneth in low and moorish grounds.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Second Example.</head>
                  <p>When you are to approch unto a Fortresse in a right line, and that the nature of the way through which you are to carrie your approches, is of such a condition, that you cannot digg into the earth with spades, then you must do as is showne in the figure 154, where they are covered with earth both on sides, &amp; are made a little deeper then ordinary Approches. Now seeing the danger is greater in this kind, then in the first, and that a right line causeth you to be continually in the sight of an Ennemy, you must prevent, and avoid that danger by making of blindes, which are either made of bundles of rise, or brush<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or with thick oaken planckes foure or five ynches thick, and as in this figure you may see, for what use they serve.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The third Example.</head>
                  <p>There where one cannot digg, as in Marras and moorish places, a foundation must be made with sinkers, that is bundles of boughs bound fast together, upon which (as is said) earth is cast. Vpon this foundation one makes Traverses and Blinds with <hi>Gabions</hi> as you may see in the figure 155.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Gabions</hi> are also filled with earth and made so strong, that they are Canon proofe, one may sett up also a double row of <hi>Gabions,</hi> which sometimes have earth cast about them.</p>
                  <p>The bredth of such Approches is from 4 to 8 rod, as the place is narrow or broad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as necessity and danger requires, but the Ordinarie bredth is no more but four or five rod. One must have also a care, that one Traverse endeth there where another beginneth, to witt, there where an alley is left.</p>
                  <p>The like manner of Approches were made at the seige of the <hi>Bosch</hi> on Count <hi>Ernest</hi> his side, to which as being a new found-worke, it got a new name, and was called the <hi>Greate Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This manner of Approch may be used also in a stonie ground, where one cannot digg the earth because of stones.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth Example.</head>
                  <p>Againe you meete sometimes with a foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which one cannot passe through <hi>dryshod,</hi> and cannot get deepe enough into the Earth, but one is forced to approch in that manner as is represented in the figure 156 in taking the neerest way, which may be to approch unto the Fortresse, and the Approches is made of that Earth, which is digged about it, in stead of setting up of <hi>Gabions,</hi> and as in the former Approaches the traverses, and blinds were made of Gabions, so here they are made with whole Redoubts: in the midst whereof there is a gape or a Sallie, made in such sort, that the one Redoubt is joyned to the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of every Redoubt, being some six or eight Foote in length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as much in bredth.</p>
                  <p>Such Traverses are oftentimes made so strong, that they are able to resist a Canon-bullett when they have Earth enough, for sometimes they are made sixe foote, but the heigth of them is not alwayes alike, seeing they must bee made higher there, where most danger is.</p>
                  <p>The gates are made in such sort with a falling plancke, that they may bee drawne up, and shut, and are of that height, and bredth, that a waggon may come through them.</p>
                  <p>It is a thing impossible to describe all the manner of approches, because they are so mixed and of such great diversity.</p>
                  <p>Neither is the ordinary way of approches alwayes a like, because the one are made deeper, and larger then an other: but commonly they are from 8 to 14 foote broad, and three or 4 foote deep in the earth, or thereabouts: the <hi>Basis</hi> of the earth layd upon it, in stead of a parapet, ought to be betweene seven and eight foote.</p>

               <head>OF COUNTER-APPROCHES. THE SIXTH CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Beseigers</hi> having approached neere unto a Towne or a Fort, it behoves then the beseiged to look well about them, and not to be idle, but stirring, and to doe their uttermost endeavour to hinder, and offend their Enemy.</p>
               <p>The defence which is made against these Approches is rightly called Counter Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>This defence also is made after diverse manners, first when the Beseiged are a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, so that oftentimes they are able to fall out, and make Sallies, which they ought to do as often as may be, notwithstanding that they loose men, which of necessity must happen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Beseigers are much more stronger then the Beseiged, and have farre more forces, then those which are within the Fortresse.</p>
               <p>For by this meanes the Enemie will be hindred, and his Approaches slowly advanced, being many times beaten back, and constrayned to retyre into his workes, during which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme,</hi> they cannot advance forward their workes, neither can they begin them againe, till the Beseiged are retreated.</p>
               <p>They ought to have a singular care, when one makes a Sally, that their men be not expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to slaughter, but must be commanded to fall on with discretion, advantage, and profit, to the end that the Towne or Fort beseiged be not bereft of their men by foole-hardinesse, rashnesse, and imprudencie.</p>
               <p>For a Fortresse which wants men, may bee compared to an empty purse which hath no money in it. It lies much upon the endevour of the Horse, which are in Fortresses, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Sallies, and which ought to fall out oftner then the Foote, because they can fall on and retreate with more speede, and though some be lost, yet the hurt will not be so great, as the losse of foote, which must be husbanded, and spared as much as posible may be, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse the assault of an Enemy.</p>
               <p>The second manner of defence is made by <hi>Canon,</hi> which must play continually from all places upon the workemen and Approches, to doe them as much harme as possible may be, whence it comes to passe, that the Workemen are amazed and frighted, when they see ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their fellow workemen fall and slaine miserably by the Canon, which will abate their courage, and make them worke more faintly: in such sort, that an Enemy is driven to leave of their worke, till such time as the offensive side have made Batteries, against the Besei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>But when it is not feisible, they must be constrayned at last to breake up, and quit the seige, otherwise if they continue, it wilbe exceeding chargeable to them, because no men will undertake the work, but such as wil be soundly payed for it.</p>
               <p>For every man hazards his life, when Ordinance and Musketteirs play continually upon him, and a man will not venter his life for nothing, but will sell it at as deare a rate as he can: besides in so doing, it prolongs the time for an Enemy, so that a Fortresse may sometimes be relieved, or when Winter, or bad weather comes on, they may be forced to abandon the Siege.</p>
               <p>The third manner is by makeing of all sorts of <hi>Outworkes,</hi> and in takeing up the Ground, whereunto an Enemie Approches, which may be made during the siege, and while an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie Approaches, as by makeing of <hi>Ravelings, Halfe-moones, Horne-workes, Tenailles,</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses</hi>: for all these workes may be made, while an Enemie advances his Approaches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Towne or Fortresse, but it were better they had bin made before the Towne was beseiged, for the gaining of time, and saving of charges, which might be employed in other works.</p>
               <p>The fourth maner is when the Beseiged make Counter Approches, whereby they may resist an enemy that he may not get into the Outworkes and Counterscharfe with his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where to hinder him, they must cast up some Traverses, and other lines running them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94790:46"/>
from their outworks, as it were to meet the Enemies works, and so make them get ground (as it were by peece-meale) till they come to the Fortresse: But neverthelesse one must observe well, that they must be carryed and made so, that they may alwaies flank upon the Beseigers works, and approches, and that the Approchers may do them as little harme as may be, alwaies making them so, that they lie open towards the Towne or Fort Beseiged. from whence they are to be defended, and must be so carried, that they may give no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to an Enemy, when he takes them in, and see that they may be flanked from the Town and Fort both with Canon and Musket.</p>
               <p>At the last seige of <hi>Bergen op Zoom,</hi> there were many such Counter Approches made, wherewith the Beseiged gauled the Enemy shrewdly, insomuch that he was not able (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the losse of abundance of men) to get a foot of ground of them, having chests in the Counter-Approches which played continually with muskettiers and firelocks upon the Enemy, and casting fireworks among them, taking up also the ground and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous places before the Enemy could approach unto them, which did disharten them much, for assoon as Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of happy memory, came to <hi>Rosendale</hi> with his Army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Towne, <hi>Marquis Spinola</hi> seeing no hopes of getting it, after the losse of twelve thousand men, was driven to rise without it, and quit the seige.</p>

               <head>OF ALL SORTS OF BRIDGES, ESPECIALLY, your flagg, or Bulrush Bridges. THE SEVENTH CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>UPon an expedition of warre, when of necessity an Army is to passe over a River, or a Brook, there are commonly carryed Boates, or sloopes upon Waggons, as hath been taught before, having Beames, or Boards, all necessaries laid in the Boates to be used, first they take downe the Beames and Posts, and then the Plancks, and Boards, which is done in a trice, when all things lie in order, sometimes they carry onely Boats, and sometimes onely plancks. To make then a Bridge over a River, first these Boats (as many as you shall have use off to lay over the River) are launced into the water, which are bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ropes, and fastened with Cables and Ankors in the bottome over, which sparres and beames are laid, and then plancks and bords layd orderly upon them, for men to march over. There are likewise such kind of bridges made with great boates in Fortresses lying upon a river side, when an enemy is feared, and where one dares not make any other bridge for it is drawn up every night like a draw-bridge, that if an Enemy had any enterprise upon that place, he might not passe over it.</p>
               <p>There are made likewise bridges over the moates of the outworkes of a Fortresse: but an Enemy being approached neere unto the Fortresse having made batteries to beate them down, these bridges are broken down in the outworkes, and sally bridges made, to which they cannot do much harme, for the making of which, one takes some Barrels, or Hoggs-heads bound about with iron, and pitched, unto which rings of iron are made fast for to put posts into them, by which meanes these Barrels are ioyned together, and lockt one to another, upon which there are laid planckes for men to passe over and repasse, and if one would take them up in the night, they do it in such a manner, that they are soon sundred one from another. An Enemy cannot so easily spoile such a Bridge, because it lies even with the water, and if one part of it should be shot a peeces, one may presenly help it againe, with other Barrels and posts.</p>
               <p>There is an other kind of Bridge, over which one may give an assault, whereof some of them are borne upon waggons, and others upon boats, and are made after the manner of <hi>Draw-bridges,</hi> saving that they are lighter, and are drawn upon the waggons, or boates upon which they are laid, but when one is to use them, then they must take them downe. Read the Treasury of the <hi>Mechanick Secrets</hi> of <hi>Augustine de Ramely:</hi> The Artillery of <hi>Diego Vffano,</hi> and the Theater of the instruments of <hi>Henry Leysing,</hi> which treate of these things at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:94790:47"/>But of all Bridges none are found more necessary and usefull then those that are made of flaggs and Bulrushes. For all others require great charges, especially when some Ingenier takes some old invention from an ancient Author, and gives it out for a new one: for it is reason such a one should be recompenced, because of his invention, and afterward becomes a directour for the making of it, as though no other could be made, but that which he hath invented, and so by this meanes makes his benefit of it, and his count and reckoning accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his desire, by making a bridge at such a high rate and charge, that makes his masters purse light, and his owne heavy. But if you looke narrowly upon it, you shall find it to be an old invention, as one cast off, and serves for no use. The like doth happen here, for when you consider well many new invented Bridges, made with great skill and industry, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse they serve for little or no use. But your bridges made with flaggs, or bulrushes, are nothing so chargeable, and yet neverthelesse of great use: we will shew here in few words, how they are, and in what manner to be made.</p>
               <p>The matter whereof they are made, are called in Dutch <hi>Biesen,</hi> in French a <hi>Ionc,</hi> in Latine <hi>Iuncus,</hi> and in English a <hi>Bulrush.</hi> This rush groweth in Rivers, waters, Brookes, some foure, five or six<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foot high, and is commonly found in brook pits Marras, and wet places, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by Rivers sides, whereof also many times houses are tharcht. The nature of this bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rush is to float above the water, and are used (being bound up in a bundle) when boyes learnes first to swimme, putting them under their arme-pits.</p>
               <p>This Bridge above mentioned is made with this rush after this manner following, when they are ripe and growne to their length, then they must be plucked up, and well dried, and when you would make such a Bridge, you must bind up these Bullrushes in round bundles, or foure square, whereof the sides must be some ten inches broad, and about foure or five foot long.</p>
               <p>Now having got good store of them, one makes a hurdle of them, enterlaced with small withs, 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foot broad, and 7. or 8. foot long: Vpon this hurdle one layes and binds in order the bundles, one after an other, and afterward one takes two long stakes, a little greater then a pike, which is fastened to the hurdle, drawing and binding these bundles fast one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are likewise bound with canvas, at the end of the hurdles one fastens at both ends two or three rings made with withs, to joyne and fasten the joynctures of this bridge together.</p>
               <p>These kind of Bridges are of excellent use in Seiges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chiefely in places where one is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to take in a worke upon a suddain enterprise, and would not be at the charge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Gallery.</p>
               <p>When one is resolved to take in such a work, those which are appointed to force it, being well armed as is requisite, being come to the brink of the moate by the meanes of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, which are brought thether, they send out before some venterous Souldiers, which carrying this bridge launces it into the water, and joynes the peeces together withall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (and while the musketteirs gives fire as fast as ever they can) till they have laid it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the bredth of the moat, and fastened it on the other side, which being done, the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers goes over it, and strives to enter by all meanes to take in the work, as they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>But if there be any mine made ready, they stay the putting over of the Bridge, and the falling on, till the mine be sprung, for feare of breaking the Bridge, and that it might spring backward.</p>
               <p>When the beseiged are resolved to make a sally, they may likewise make use of these kind of Bridges, all other commodities and utilities, necessity the mother of such like inventions will shew you.</p>
               <p>Now for the better understanding of all things touching these bridges above described, we have represented them in the figure 159. where you shall see how they are made fast, on that side which is to come into the water.</p>
               <p>But they are to weak, where you are to put over a broad moat, such as are before Townes and Royall Forts, over which one must passe, before they can come to the Wall, for these
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94790:47"/>
serve onely for some suddaine peece of service, and therefore it is needfull to make use of some other invention called a Gallery, which is of excellent use though chargeable, and which we will handle in the next chapter following.</p>

               <head>OF GALLERIES. THE SEVENTH CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>VEgecius</hi> in the 16. chapter of his fourth book, describeth a certain kind of work, which the Ancients called <hi>Vinea,</hi> and saith it was a work made of plancks ioyned together, some eight foot high, seven foot broad, and sixteen foot long, the roofe or toppe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was covered with boards, and hurdles interlaced together, and the sides with Boughes, in such wise that it could not be spoyled with stones, over which also was laid thick Oxen hydes, newly killed, or coverlids of hair cloth, to keepe them from firing, (whence it hapneth, that we make use of such coverings in our moderne warres, for to hinder the force and violence of Gun-powder, because they are not so easily spoyled by fire (as hath bin said above) and these workes being in a readinesse, one makes use of them to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>When they have made good store of them, then they joyne and fasten them together, and the Beseigers being blinded and covered under them, begin their approches to the wal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and sapp under the foundation of them to make them fall.</p>
               <p>There is no work which resembles more rightly this invention of the Ancients, then our moderne Galleries: The preparation, the use, the height, the breadth, are almost all alike, and do agree so together in all things, that we must needs confesse our Gallery is no new invention, but was in use among the Ancients, and which of late yeares hath bin renewed again.</p>
               <p>For if one considers neerly their structure, the Vinea of the Ancients was made with timber and plancks, and our Galleries for the most part are made with postes and plancks joyned together: That had also posts to rest upon for its foundation, and this hath also great posts to beare up the weight of the whole work: The sides of the Ancients Vinea was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified against the force of the Balists, because they were laid with hurdles and boughs, wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed together, but our Galleries are covered with plancks, and earth cast upon them, so that they cannot be spoyled by Canon: The Vineas were kept from firing by the helpe of <hi>Oxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hides</hi> wherewith they were covered, and the sides of our Galleries have earth cast about them, that fire-works may do them no harme.</p>
               <p>These Vineas served to come to the wall, to sapp it, but our Galleries are brought to the Basis and Barme of a Rampart, to make a mine in a Bulwarke, and so to blow it up.</p>
               <p>The hight and breadth of the one and the other do not differ much, but it seemes the length is differing, though in effect it differs not much; For the Vinea the joynts of them being fastned one to another were reasonable long, but our Galleries are set up with plancks and posts and as it were makes but one peece joyned together.</p>
               <p>Whence it appeareth, that our Gallery is not wholy a new invention, but hath been in use of old, though in some things it is altered and changed.</p>
               <p>We will now take it in hand, and shew after what manner it must be made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with all the appurtenances thereunto belonging.</p>
               <p>When an aproach then is brought so far, where a Sap is to begin not far from the Town or Fortresse beseiged, and that one is sapped to the Counterscharfe, then one sees how a Gallery may be put over the moate. For the effecting whereof, one must make provision of many things necessary thereunto, and first of all get good store of longbrush and bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of boughs, to fill up the moate, with a great number of plancks and posts ioyned and made together like a Gallowes, all of them having one height and bredth, which are so fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and made by the Carpenters before they are brought down into the Aproaches, tha
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94790:48"/>
one may either take them asunder, or pin them together without any great labour, for being brought thither, where they are to be used: Jt is easily done by marking the joynts and peeces with one and the same number which they may fit, and joyne together without any great difficulty.</p>
               <p>Such a Gallowes hath five peeces, to wit, two posts which stand upright, one croswise over them, which ioynes the other two together, and two props or supporters of timber to bear the crosse post up, the two posts are set upright being 8 or 9 foot long, and are cut halfe a foote in the upper end of them, for the crosse beame, or post to rest upon the other two posts, and to ioyne them together, and a foot and a halfe at the lower end is sharpned and set fast into the Ground, so that it remaines seven foot high for the top of the Gallery. Yo shall see the forme of it set out in the 160 figure following, whereof the length of them from <hi>a b</hi> to <hi>c d</hi> are each of them 9. foot long, and the bredth 6. or 7. inches, the halfe of this breadth at the uppermost end of these two posts is cut the length of halfe a foot, to lay the crosse beame upon them, which ought to be cut in the like manner, having the length of ten foot, or thereabouts, for the longer this crosse post is, the broader will the Gallery be, and the better for the souldiers to march five or fixe in front, when they are to give an assault upon the breach, the greatnesse is answerable to the two others, being marked with <hi>A C.</hi> Now forasmuch as these posts are made in such a manner with joynts that they may soone be joined together or severed, they cannot be so firme as those which are joined and pinned fast together by force, without being afterwards taken asunder, especially, because of the great weight which they are to beare, therefore there are props made to support the crosse post, as you may see by <hi>E.F.</hi> and <hi>G.H.</hi> marked in the 160. figure, all which being done, and all the peeces joined and pinned fast together as is fitting, every peece is marked, and holes bored through them to fasten them together in a little time, when there is occasion to have them set up.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of the Bords and Planks for a Gallery.</head>
                  <p>AFter this you must provide in a readinesse good store of Fir boards and plancks, which must be as long as the two posts, or rather four or five inches longer, so that if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between post and post be 5 foote broad, then these plancks must be five foote, and a halfe long: for the odd half foot is divided into two equall parts, taking up three inches on either side of the two posts, into which holes are bored, to naile the plancks and the posts fast together.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary space between the posts joyned together is commonly 4. or 5. (but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) six foot in bredth, which oftentimes is changed according to the condition of the place, and as the danger is great or little.</p>
                  <p>The thicknesse of the plancks is without any certain measure, because it is needlesse to make them all of one thicknesse, for it may so fall out, that somtimes you must use a thick planck, and some whiles a thinner is fitter to stop a hole withall, as occasion may serve.</p>
                  <p>Now for the joyning and fastening of your posts together, you must provide good store of oaken pins, and bore all the holes with a borer, to the end the holes may not cleave, now all these pins ought to be of one bignesse.</p>
                  <p>Also in Galleries there are used nailes some greater and longer, as you shall have use for, some of them are 4. or 5. inches long for to naile the plancks with, which covers the sides: some other 6. or 7. inches long, which nailes the props into the posts, you must have good store of them of all sises for to use them, when necessity shall require. Your ordinary wheel-barrowes and shovels are here of exellent use, but you must have shovels that have longer hafts then ordinary, to cast the earth a good way into the moate, which cannot be so well done with short hafts.</p>
                  <p>Jn this place one ought to make use of thick plank-blinds, which we have mentioned in the chapter of gabions and blinds, which serve for a very good use in Galleries, as we shall show you hereafter.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94790:48"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94790:49"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94790:50"/>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:94790:50"/>A Gallerie raised without, being covered with Earth, is represented unto you in the 161 fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
                  <p>After you have sapt through the Counterscharfe, and that you are come to the edge or brinke of the moate, and resolve to lay a Gallerie over it, you must first of all provide good store of these bundles of long brush before mentioned, brought downe in waggons, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of wheele-barrowes, to fetch Earth into the Gallerie, to cast these things into the moat, and to fill it up, even to that place, where you intend to make a <hi>Mine,</hi> and in so doing, you shall by degrees fill up the moate, and make a good foundation for your Gallerie to rest and stand upon.</p>
                  <p>But because any cannot cast and lay these bush-faggots in order, as one would, you shall meet with some venturous souldier or another, who for money will adventure in the night to goe out at the mouth of the Gallerie into the moate, to lay them in order. And to the end they may not be seen by the Enemy, one must observe well to make the <hi>perpendicular</hi> of the face of the Bulwarke, which will be the shortest way to come unto it.</p>
                  <p>The moate then being filled with these long bundles, and fagots of Brush abovesaid, so that one may cast Earth upon them brought from the next sap, the work-men fetches good store of Earth in wheel-barrowes upon plancks laid in the Gallerie, and brings it to the mouth of the Gallerie, casts it upon a heape and then two or three workemen which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to worke in the mouth of the Gallerie, casts it into the moate to settle the fagotts. This Earth cast up in the forme of a heape, serves to cover and make a blinde for the work-men onely before, but not on the sides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore they must be constrayned to make blinds on that side which is most dangerous, til the posts be set up, yea oftentimes they must make blinds on both sides of the Gallerie, if an Enemy flanks it from two places. After this one begins to set up one of the posts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ioyned and pinned together as hath been taught, and as you may see in the 160 figure. And sets some men continually to fetch Earth in their wheele-barrowes, others from the top of the heape casts the Earth with their Tong-shovels into the moate, and gets more ground to set up the other past, for haveing got a matter of five foot or there-abouts, they sett up the other past ioyned together as is said, after they have set forward the blinds for to cover the sides of it: which two posts being set up, then they naile the plancks fast to both sides of the Gallerie, and they set onely the others upon it without fastning them by covering the side onely with Earth, which may be beaten downe by the Enemie, till it is able to resist a Canon bullett, and then casts Earth above the Gallerie, about a foote or a foote and a halfe high, which must be spread, and laid even, to the end, fireworks may not lie upon it, and spoile the Gallerie by fyring of it.</p>
                  <p>It happens sometimes, that one side of the Gallerie is out of the Enemies sight, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be beaten downe with their Canon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in such sort that one needs not cover it with Earth and then that time and charge is saved, unlesse it lies so, that an Enemie can sett fire on it with pitch ropes and other fire workes, or spoyle it with his Canon, which lies in his <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes,</hi> which being so, then of necessity, you must cover that side, till it is able to resist the Enemies Canon.</p>
                  <p>And because it would be very darke if the whole Gallerie were covered with Earth, and so very incommodious for the workmen, therefore to helpe that on the safest side, there are little windowes or holes made of a foote high, and a foot and a halfe long, betweene every three or foure postes ioyned together, to give light into the Gallerie.</p>
                  <p>This work is continually aduanced and the heape raised by the workemen, which cast the Earth into the moate in a great quantity before them, haveing alwaies a singular care, that the heape from whence they cast their Earth growes not too low, least the workemen be discovered. Afterward they sett up the third posts ioyned together in the same manner as hath been said, and make fast the boards, and planks to them, this labour must be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the Gallerie is advanced even to the very soote and barme of the <hi>Rampard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All which is shown in the 162 figure where a Gallerie is made &amp; covered, as also to show that one of the posts ioyned and sett up, which must be nailed to the other with planks, and the heape of earth behinde, which the man stands and works is also here pourtrayed out.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94790:51"/>
When the Gallerie is brought over almost to the very foote of the Rampart, then one may come to it with more safety, for then the heape is taken away, and a blinde made of thick oaken plankes to begin a mine into the Bulwarke.</p>
                  <p>At the lower end of these posts abovesaid, as you may see from B to D, there is an other post besides of the same greatenesse, which cannot be seene, therefore wee have purposely omitted it, but will remember to speake of it, when we handle the makeing of the posts and palisadoes.</p>

               <head>THE EIGHTH CHAPTER. OF MINES.</head>
               <p>AS a <hi>Gallery</hi> is an ancient invention, so likewise Mines, which we make at this day have been heretofore in use amongst the <hi>Ancients</hi> also: And this is the last thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the besieged are troubled.</p>
               <p>A Mine then according to the definition of <hi>Vegetius,</hi> is a Cave by which one makes secret goings under the Eearth, to come by night unawares to a Fortresse, or by which one diggeth into the foundation, and bowels of a wall, or of a Bulwark, underpropping the earth with posts of wood, and laying under it dry wood, for when they would make a hole in the wall, they set fire on this wood, which being burnt with the props, the wall fell down, and the Besiegers being in a reddinesse attending the fall of the wall, ran presently up by that breach, to assault the Fortresse; which is understood also of our moderne Mines which we make in by blowing up the powder that is laid in them, whence it appeareth clearly, that this is also an ancient invention, being a little changed, and amended at this day.</p>
               <p>This mineing (or digging under the earth) is called in Latine <hi>Cuniculus,</hi> of which name ancient Writers, as <hi>Iulius Caesar, Livius,</hi> and <hi>Curtius</hi> make often mention of in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Stratagem,</hi> it signifieth a Moole from whence the name is taken, because the Mines made under <hi>Rampards</hi> and <hi>Bulwarks,</hi> resembles the holes and passages which Mooles makes under the earth. There are others which derive this name from the Latine word <hi>Cuneus,</hi> because the Mines are made in the fashion of a <hi>Wedge,</hi> which is thick at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and diminisheth little by little, even as the Mines which make a rupture in those places where they are made, may be compared to a wedge, which cleaveth a piece of timber in sunder. Mines were of old called <hi>Cuniculary.</hi> He that is desirous to know more thereof, let him read <hi>Vegetius</hi> and <hi>Vitruve,</hi> who have written of Military inventions among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</p>
               <p>We will here describe in a few words, how our <hi>moderne Mines</hi> are made at this day.</p>
               <p>The last meanes for the forcing of an Enemy besieged, to make him yeeld, is this making of a Cave or Mine under the earth, which is begun and finished (as is said) after you have brought your <hi>Gallery</hi> over to the <hi>Barme,</hi> or foot of a <hi>Rampard</hi> or Bulwark.</p>
               <p>But before it is begun, you must have all things necessary, and in a reddinesse, for the effecting of this work, first of all ye must have Spades, Shovels, Pickaxes, and all kinde of Masons tooles, with all things requisite to pierce and break the Wall, wherewith the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part is made.</p>
               <p>Afterward, one prepares props to support, and beare up the Mine from falling or sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being two, or two inches and a halfe thick, the length of them being not alike, because the entrance into the Mine is made higher then towards the end of it. One is furnished also with firre planks, for to line the Mine vvithin, as above, that it may not sink and fall down, for it must be set with planks on all sides, as vvell as the foundation, especially if the earth be moulding and vvettish.</p>
               <p>But before you begin to make your Mine, it vvill be necessary that you knovv the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94790:51"/>
of the place, that is, whether the Bulwark be hollow and vaulted, or whether the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation be laid with Branchages, Logs, or borne up with Piles: and whither water may not spoile your Mine, if you should mine too low. In case that the Rampard or the Bulwark into which you intend to mine, were laid with logs, or supported upon great Piles, which happens ordinarily in moorish and rotten places, upon which you must build your Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and Rampards; or when one can get no other Earth but sand: you must trie and get out all these Piles with Cables or ropes by winding them out with an instrument ordained for this purpose. Now you must pierce and pull out these loggs by such wayes and meanes as is known unto Miners, for the makeing of a way and a chamber to lay your Gunpowder in. When you are assured that you cannot digge no deeper, but that shall come to water, then you must raise your Mine a little higher, to the end the powder may lie drie in it.</p>
               <p>The Miners then beginning to break into the wall, do carry their Mine so close, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret as possible may be, that the Besieged may not heare any noise, or gather any notise, where the mine is made, and how it runs: for if they doe, without all question, they will make a <hi>Counter-mine</hi> to discover and spoile your Mine begun, so that you shall be driven to begin a new one in another place, as hath happened many times.</p>
               <p>The heighth, and the bredth of the <hi>Mine</hi> must be made in such a manner, as you may onely lay in the Barrels of powder, for it ought to be no higher, nor no broader, because your intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, but onely to chamber your powder in it, and therefore it must needs be so high as a man, and no higher, but that a man may onely work in that upon his kneés, and that he stoops lower, when he goes to lay the Powder into its chamber.</p>
               <p>The heighth then must be but 4, or 4 foot and a half high at the most, and the bredth but 3 and a half. or foure foot, according to vvhich measures, the props and the planks are framed, vvherevvith you are to underprop the Mine.</p>
               <p>When you begin to mine into a Rampard or Bulwark, you take out the earth, and carry it away in a vessell, or a pall of leather, which is light, in handing it one to another, till it be brought out of the hole, or entrance out of the Mine, and laid in the Gallerie, to the end the Enemy may not see it, and gesse where abouts your Mine is.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Master-miner,</hi> which hath the conducting of the Mine, ought to be a man of great experience, how he ought to carry it, lest he be mistaken, and so make it in a place, where he ought not to make it. Therefore he must have knowledge of a <hi>Compasse,</hi> and how the <hi>needle</hi> stands, that he may carry his Mine aright. He ought also to have skill in <hi>Geometry,</hi> to the end he may know of what heighth he must carry his Mine, according to the proportion of the Rampart.</p>
               <p>The nearer he comes unto the place where he is to make his Chamber, the narrower ought the way of the mine to be, in such sort, that it must be no broader or higher at the entrance into the <hi>Chamber,</hi> but that a Barrell of powder may scarcely passe through the way for the straighter and the narrower the passage is into the Chamber, the easier the Mine is stopt.</p>
               <p>The place where the Chamber is, ought to be so made, that the powder doth not break neither the one, nor the other side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that it may blow the earth upward. Neverthelesse sometimes the Miners are commanded, to make their Mine so, as it may blow the earth into the Fortresse, or else without which may be done, if they make that side, which is to be blown up, not so thick as the other: for the nature of powder is such, that it maketh the greatest operation alwaies towards the weakest place, and though it blows it up ordinarily: yet commonly it searcheth most often the place, where it may break out soonest in to the ayre, which appeareth both in your Canon and Muskets.</p>
               <p>The bignesse of the <hi>Chamber</hi> is divers, for it must be made according to the greatnesse and proportion of the wall or Rampard: neverthelesse one must observe, that it be made as narrow as possible may be, and yet must have room enough to lay the Barrels of powder into it: the ordinary heighth is some six or seven foot, and the bredth foure or five foot.</p>
               <p>When the Chamber is ready, then you lay in your Barrels, the number whereof cannot be so precisely discribed. For one Rampard is greater then an other, in so much, that a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94790:52"/>
quantity of powder is requisite more for one place then an other. The common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that a Barrel of powder will blow up a rod, or twelue foot of Earth. The Barrels are laid in such order, that in the twinckling of an Eye, they take fire all at one time, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a greater operation then if one Barrell should be blowne up one after another. After that your powder is chambred, the with all expedition you must stop the entrance into the chamber, with thick and strong planckes, and stopp it hard, and ramme it in with good Earth, and leaue a little hole or traine, to lay some powder in it, which traine is carried to the very end of the mine, and stops up the passage of it with firkins of Earth, that the aire may neither come in or out. For the stronger the Mine is stopt, it will take the greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. All things then being in a readinesse, it is left so till one is commaunded to give fire to it.</p>
               <p>In the 163 figure is represented unto you a myne marked, <hi>A B C D E,</hi> is the way upon the Bulwark, <hi>E</hi> is the entrance into the chamber, <hi>F G H</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> is the chamber it self, wherein the powder is laid.</p>
               <p>Here a question might be moued, whether mines ought to be carried with right lines, or crooked? The answer is, that mines, which are carried in a right line are sooner made, but because they take not so good effect, the other are to be preferred before them, which are made with oblique lines. For the windings and the turnings of them, adds strength unto them, that the powder hath not so much force to break the stopping. Now suppose that it should break the stopping <hi>D</hi>: E: the rest therefore is not broken, because the force of the powder is kept in by the Earth marked D, and driven back to blow upwards, or finding no vent to turne back againe, where it vvas laid. But in a right line vvhen the povvder breakes the stopping, the effect thereof is hindred and deminished, for it is certaine, that the stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, which is made nevvly is not so firme as the old setled Earth, vvhich hath lain a long time in it.</p>

               <head>OF COVNTER-MINES THE NINTH CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>WHere there is an <hi>Offensiue</hi> Warre, there is also a <hi>Defensiue,</hi> as appeareth by mines: for the Beseiged having discouvered them, vvhich one hath prepared for them, and that there is no hope left, but vvaiting for the Springing of an Enemies myne in their Rampard, and to giue them an assault, then they are to stand upon their defence, and beginn to make mines also, vvhich they eyther doe to offend an Enemy, or to defend themselues by them. Therefore vvee must understand here, three kinds of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to vvit, the vvorkes vvhich are made to finde out an Enemies mine, 2: The Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, vvhich are made to spoyle an Enemies mine, &amp; 3 the cutting off of a Bulvvarke or a <hi>Rampard</hi> vvithin, of the tvvo former, vvee will treate in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>For the first kind of Countermines, vvee understand those vvorkes, and mines, vvhich are made to discover, and find out an Enemies <hi>Mine,</hi> and to kill the miners in it.</p>
               <p>After one hath found it out, as also for the casting dovvn of the same vvork, and the taking avvay of the povvder chambred, the Enemy vvill finde himself deceived, vvhen he thinks to spring his Mine, attending the operation thereof in vaine, because the povvder is stolne out of it.</p>
               <p>For to finde out an Enemies mine, there are tvvo manner of vvayes, the one vvhich vvas used by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and the other practised at this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vitruvius</hi> in the said Chapter of his tenth book, describeth the maner of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and saith that the Cite of <hi>Apolonia,</hi> being besieged, and the Besiegers having made some Mines under the earth to assault the Citizens, on a sudden vvithin the vvalls; the Citizens being advertised thereof, vvere extreamly affrighted thereat, and began to faint and lose their courage: because they knevv no remedy to prevent it, and could by no means finde out the place vvhere the Mines vvere made. But <hi>Trypho Alexandrin,</hi> vvhich lived in that age, the <hi>Architector</hi> of this City, caused to be made along under the vvalls a great many ditches, and vvithall some Mines under the vvalls continuing them beyond the Enemies, as farre as one could throvv a stone. He caused to be hanged in these ditches vessels of Copper, under th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se places, vvhere the Enemy vvrought, vvhich made a noise, by reason of the moving of the earth, vvhereupon he found out the Enemies Mines, and filled Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of brasse full of boyling water, and melted pitch, to povvre it dovvn through those holes upon the heads of his Enemies mines. He cast dovvn also mens dung, vvhich vvas mixed vvith hot sand and gravell, vvhich he did by night into the Enemies Mines, into vvhich he had made divers holes, and by this meanes slevv a great many of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his <hi>Melpomina</hi> makes mention of a <hi>Tinker,</hi> vvhich dvvelt in the City of <hi>Barca,</hi> besieged by the <hi>Persians,</hi> vvho discovered the Enemies Mines by the meanes of a Buckler of Brasse, vvhich he hung in divers places against the vvall, and so found out at last the place under vvhich the Enemy mined.</p>
               <p>But at this day to finde out an Enemies Mine, they use to make counter-ditches, as hath been said, and before a Mine is begun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is necessary to be informed, after the manner of the Ancients of the place, vvhich may be undermined by an Enemy. But Mines are searched out after divers other vvayes.</p>
               <p>Some are of the opinion, that round about the vvalls, and Bulvvarks of a Tovvn or a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, (to vvit, vvhen the fortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is first begun) one should make hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> caves, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages under the earth, by vvhich one might discover, and finde out an Enemies mine. But this me thinks is not good, because the vvalls and Bulvvarks are made thereby slender &amp; vveake, and these caves &amp; being made vvith posts, and planks, vaults in tract of time are subject to rot, and &amp; the Mines afterward falling dovvn, all that labour is lost. Also it is dangerous to make vauts in Rampards, and Bulwarks, seeing it is to be feared, that such a work is not durable, sith it must bear up so great and ponderous a vveight, besides it vvill cost excessive expences. And though these Counter-mines should be thus made and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94790:53"/>
ordained: yet it is not certaine, but that an Enemy in myning may meet iust with one of these Mines, and so take his way and advantage, either over or under it, and so leatt this Counter-mine alone.</p>
               <p>A second opinion is this, &amp; some findes it good, that one should hang trees, and other bushes in them, which are found often in the Rampards of the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> which being stirred with the least motion, gives a sound, whereby one may finde out the place where the mine is. But this is a thing uncertain, because the least gale of wind, will easily shake these bushes, and branches of trees. And if they do so this must be done in a still and a calme vveather, vvhen there is no vvinde stirring. And therefore I ansvvere, one ought to search out an Enemies mine at all times, for it vvere an absurd thing, for one to stay from finding an Enemies mine out &amp; till a calme time comes, vvho vvill advance (as much as possible may be) his vvork, vvithout staying for still or faire vveather. Therefore this vvay serves but for little use.</p>
               <p>A third and a better vvay, and which is the ordinary way, is to set a drum in the place suspected, vvith some Dice, pease, or beanes vpon the head of it, vvhich upon any stirring, will leap upon the drum, when it stands over the place vvhere one vvorks. Neverthelesse you must not let it stand in one place onely, but remove it novv and then from one place to another, yea so often, till you are assured of the place, vvhich is shaken by the work vvhich is made under it. Some make use of a Bason of litany filled vvith water, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, that the mine is there, vvhere the water moveth, but that is uncertaine as that of the <hi>Cimbri</hi> is, spoken of before, but that of a drum is held to be the best and surest way. Notvvithstanding one may make good use of Basons, vvhen they are set upon a <hi>Rampard,</hi> as a drum with peas or other things. For by such a meanes one may knovv the place, vvhich is undermined. The use of Basons vvithout all question, took its Originall from the Invention of a Kettle, vvhereof vvee haue spoken even novv.</p>
               <p>A fourth opinion besides these vvhich is in use also; is a great long iron Borer, to bore into the Earth, wherevvith those which searched the Earth, bores a hole with it into the <hi>Rampard,</hi> &amp; laying his eare to the hole to listen well if he can heare any noize, vvhich is practised in suspected places. Many other Inventions are invented by necessity the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of practise.</p>
               <p>To resist then the mines of an Enemie, one makes use of this practise following. After you haue curiously searched out the Enemies mines, and that you are assured of the place under vvhich they are hid then you may find them out vvithout all question, &amp; nothing remaynes then, but to make a <hi>Counter-mine</hi> against them, vvhich is made in the same manner as vve haue discribed in the former chapter, treating of mines, to wit, by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propping the Earth vvith posts and laying planks betvveene them, that the Earth may not tumble dovvn. Now because one is not assured to meed iust vvith the Enemies myne vvhich may be made either too high, or too low, therefore you must make many, till by one of them you haue found it out, &amp; are come to the <hi>Chamber</hi> to take avvay the powder.</p>
               <p>When an Enemies myne is carryed so secret, and hidden, that one cannot finde it out, then the besieged must of necessity resolue to quit that part of the <hi>Rampard</hi> or Bulwarke under which they suspect there is a mine, and so cut it of invvardly. But for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they make ready also their <hi>Countermine</hi> made in that place, &amp; chambers their povv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der attending the effect of the Enemies mine, and vvhen he springs his mine, then they retire themselues into their nevv vvorke cut off, and the Enemy being lodged in that peece of the Bulvvarke or Rampart, vvhich they haue quitted, then they blovv up their <hi>Countermine,</hi> and slay all those, vvhich they find in it.</p>
               <p>The like also is done in outvvorkes, and Counterskarfes, vvhen one is driven to quitt them, and that one cannot keepe them any longer.</p>

               <p>WEe haue often made mention of <hi>Palisadoes</hi> and the use of them, especially vvhen they are struck into the ground about dry moates, for then they serue, in stead of vvater against the sudden assault of an Enemie, so that not onely the moates before great vvalls, and Rampards, ought to be set with them, but also all Outvvorkes must be fortified vvith them.</p>
               <p>They are likevvise of excellent use in the Field, vvhen trenches are set round vvith them, and struck in round about Forts, and vvorkes, vvhich lie in the most dangerous places.</p>
               <p>They are of no lesse use also in Fortresses, especially vvhen the Beseiged are constrayned to make cuttings off vvithin a tovvne, or Fort: moreover they are good to be struck in upon the topp of Breaches, vvhereof vve vvill treat in the next chapter.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Palisadoes</hi> then are made in this manner follovving, one makes choise of good and strong <hi>Sparrs</hi> being some 3 or 4 ynches in <hi>Diameter,</hi> but of severall lengths, according to the place into vvhich they are to be struck, vvhereof some of them may be 5, 6, or 7 foote long. Novv the lovver end of them must be sharpened and pointed, and the upper end flatt, that they may be driven into the ground vvith a mallet or a beetle: one bores also a hole some 3 or 4 ynches under the head of the <hi>Palisadoe,</hi> &amp; an other some three ynches under the first hole, and a third hole on the side through the middest of the tvvo others, in such sort, that the nailes, vvhich are driven through it, resemble as it vvere the corners. In some also they use to driue in tvvo nailes, so that they are not struck in a right <hi>Angle,</hi> but rises a little tovvards the head of the <hi>Palisadoe.</hi> The length of these nailes, must be some eight or tvvelue ynches, and so bigg, that they cannot be easely bowed or broken, and the <hi>Head</hi> vvhich is driven into the <hi>Palisadoe</hi> is some-vvhat greater, then that vvhich sticks out, vvhich ought to be very sharpe.</p>
               <p>When you are to use these <hi>Sparrs,</hi> vvhereof you must haue good store, you take first of the shortest size, being but fiue foot long, and strick in a long ranke of them, as you shall finde necessarie. They are driven into the ground the depth of a foot and a half, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, according as the Earth is conditioned, and thus you shall make your first ranke: then you shall driue in an other ranke of <hi>Palisadoes,</hi> being six foote long, vvhich are set behind the first ranke, to the end they may run in a right line vvith the first, but must be struck in a little sidelings, to the end, that their nailes may fill all places necessarie, and the heads of these <hi>Palisadoes,</hi> ought to stand about halfe a foote higher, then the others: In the same manner you driue in the third ranke, vvhich must be half a foot higher then the second, and thus you may doe, if you vvill driue in a fourth ranke, yea as many as it pleases you. These <hi>Palisadoes</hi> are represented unto you in the 164 figure.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Palisadoes,</hi> vvhich are used against assaults there are two sorts of them. The first is that sort of <hi>Palisadoes</hi> vvhich are sett upon the <hi>Parapets</hi> of Forts, <hi>Outworks,</hi> and <hi>Redoubts,</hi> for to hinder an Enemy that they may not so soone assault or scale a place: these ought to be 3 or 4 ynches in <hi>Diameter,</hi> and some 6 or 7 foote long, vvhereof the half past is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the <hi>Parepett,</hi> and the other half stands upright.</p>
               <p>For the other sort, those great headed piles or pales, clasped together vvith chaines, and plates of yron, vvhich sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d alwaies upon <hi>Ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pards</hi> and Bulvvarkes covered vvith a little roof against the time of necessity, vvhen as an Enemy seekes to assault a Fortresse.

               <head>OF PALISADOES, PALES, VRIZ-RVY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS, CAVALLIERS DE FRIZE, Called in English Turne-piks. THE TENTH CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>WEe haue observed in our declaration of Originall names vvhence, the <hi>Cavalleries De Frize</hi> tooke their name: to witt, at the siege of <hi>Groeninghen in Frizeland,</hi> vvhere they served for great use, by stopping and hindring the Enemies horse, when they came to relieue the Tovvn, and then got this name of <hi>Vrize ruyters</hi> in Dutch, <hi>Cavalliers de Frize</hi> in French, and <hi>Frize Horses or Turne-pikes</hi> in English, and besides the stopping of a suddaine charge of Horse, they are of excellent use, to be clapt on the topp of a breach, or some vveake place of a Trench, or a vvall, and good store of them ought to be carryed along vvith an Army on vvaggons, to be sett up in some <hi>Avenus,</hi> or passages, to stop and hinder the sudden attempt of an Enemy, vvhen one hath no time to cast up a trench.</p>
               <p>In Fortresses they are also of greater use then chaines or Barres, vvhich crosseth the streets, For a man may skip over a chaine, and a good Horse will leap over it: But being beset and crossed vvith <hi>Turne-pikes,</hi> neither Foot nor Horse are able to passe over them, seeing they have staves and sharp points through them on all sides. They may be set up also in the streets of <hi>Suburbs</hi> and other places instead of Barres, and vvhere some broad places are to be kept, in joyning many of them together, vvhich is done ordinarily in the expeditions of Warres.</p>
               <p>They are made in this manner following, you take a tree of firme wood, vvhich will not cleave, vvhere of the <hi>Diameter</hi> is five or sixe inches, and some 10, or 14 foot long, vvhich is made vvith six corners, so that it hath six sides, and in the midst of these sides, one bores three or foure inches one from another cros-wise, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> puts through these holes round javelings, vvhereof the <hi>Diameter</hi> is an inch and a half, or at the most two inches, the lengt of them is sixe or size foot, and so made, that they are all of one length, which are made of a strong and a firme piece of timber, which will not easily bend, nor will be weakned by raine, these are thrust through these holes, so that they are of a just length on both sides, and have as many javelings on the one side, as on the other: so that the <hi>Turnepike</hi> is alike over all, and falleth alvvaies after one fashion, as it lies, and as one vvould have it. Both the ends of these javelings are headed, and sharp pointed vvith yron, and the ends of the tree are plated about vvith rings of iron, that the tree of the <hi>Turnepike</hi> may not cleave and in the middest of both ends there are rings and clasps made to tye tvvo or three of these <hi>Turne-pikes</hi> together with chaines, if occasion should serve, all vvhich is represented in the 165 figure.</p>
               <p>Where there are some <hi>Banks</hi> near unto a Fortresse or water, vvhere Shipping may passe to and again, or vvhere a water may be vvaded through, there are made pales or <hi>Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi> represented in the 166 figure, which are made vvith Sparres of strong vvood, squared out, being some 4 or 5 inches big and some nine or ten foot long, vvhich are set between 2 great posts, about 5 or 6 inches one from another, as ye may see in thee 166 figure.</p>
               <p>The fouresquare <hi>Tanternailes</hi> is a very necessary thing for defence, having alvvaies one of the points standing upvvard. For they have foure points as sharp as a naile, whereof three stands upon the ground, and the fourth hovvsoever it lies, standing bolt upright. They are of divers greatnesse, for those vvhich are commonly used in this Country, are lesser then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94790:54"/>
those which are cast into a Moate. The point whereof 3 or 4, or 5 inches long. A For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse ought to have good store of them for to cast them into a moate, into a Falsebray, or upon a Breach, because they prick and hurt shrodly the Souldiers feet which strives to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They are represented to you in the 167 figure.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Dodanes</hi> or <hi>Beares</hi> made of stone or brick are set upon a banke by a river side, to keep the water from overflowing, (or running out of a moat. The Dutches cals it a <hi>Beare,</hi> because it represents the shape of a <hi>Beare,</hi> but the French terme it <hi>des d'Asnes,</hi> and of one word corrupted <hi>Dodanes,</hi> that is, an <hi>Asses backe</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because it hath some resemblance of an Asses back, upon which disobedient Souldiers, who committed some notable offence must ride upon some houres one after another, which we call in English a <hi>Woodden horse,</hi> and hath the fashion of an Asses-backe.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Symon Stephens,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his old Mathematician, in his new Booke of Fortification, and Sluces, makes mention of some great faults committed in the making of these <hi>Beares,</hi> because the foundation, which should sustaine and beare up this <hi>ponde<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For the preventing whereof, he gives good councill to sinke into the bottome of the moate, piles or <hi>Mast trees</hi> bound fast together and of one and the same bignes and length, which wil make a strong and a firm foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon afterward you may build your <hi>Beare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It must be made a good deale higher, then the water, when the tides, or the rivers are swolne up to the very bankes, and it must be made so thick, that it may be able to resist the force and violence of the water, and the stones and bricks so laid and plaistred together, that the water cannot eate or soake through it· And because these <hi>Beares</hi> in moates might serve as a way to straddle over and get into the Towne or Fortresse by, at both ends there is two palissadoes set the one upon the banke, and the other one either side next the Moate, as you may see in the 166. figure before which also is struck into the ground, many other small palissadoes of 4 or 5 foot length before mentioned. But the top of the Beare is made with a sharpe Edge, and in the midst of it a little round <hi>turrit</hi> to hinder, and keepe backe those that would clime over it: Sometimes there are made two round turrets when it is made over a broad water or moate, the figure 168. will shew you the <hi>pouretrature</hi> of such a Beare.</p>

               <head>OF RETRENCHINGS, OR INWARD CUTTINGS OFF, AND HOW ONE MUST RESIST AN ASSAVLT. THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER. Interiour.</head>
               <p>THE Art of Fortification is not onely of perfect Fortresses, provided with all kinde of Outward-workes, but also hath besides an other use, seing that it teacheth also how one ough to prepare and furnish a Towne or Fortresse with new workes, When the others are ruinated. This part of Fortification is called in French <hi>un Retrenchement Interieur,</hi> in Latine <hi>Recessus,</hi> and in English <hi>an Inward Cutting off:</hi> because such workes are made to no other end, but to make a Retreate into, when the others are lost. For, when one cannot maintain, and defend a whole worke, or a part thereof, because an enemie striveth with all his power to become master of it one must then resolve, when he is driven out of one work, how he may retire into another, and defend himselfe againe, against the assault of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, because it would be very hurtfull to defend one selfe, when he lies open to an Enemy.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Inward Cuttings off</hi> is of two sorts, the one in <hi>Outworkes,</hi> the other in a <hi>Fortresse</hi> it selfe.</p>
               <p>Besides, it is in <hi>Generall</hi> or <hi>particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee wil first handle the Cuttings off, which are made in outward works, which are the first, which an Enemy seekes to take in, and afterwards the Cuttings off, which must bee made in a Towne or Fortresse it selfe.</p>
               <p>Touching a generall cutting off, it is only used in Crown-works, Horn-works, or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nailles.</p>
               <p>The same is also of two sorts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Regular, and Irregular.</p>
               <p>A Generall cutting off is, when a worke is made in all things like unto that, which is Cut off, in such sort, that a Crown-worke is made within a Crown-work, a Horn-work within a Horn-worke, and a Tanaille within a Tanaille.</p>
               <p>Irregular cuttings off of outward works, is that which is that which keeps not the form of the worke, which is cutt off within, yet Neuerthelesse shutteth up the worke with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Parapet.</p>
               <p>A perticular cutting off is, when a worke is made out of broken workes, or severed one from an other, in such wise that there is made one, two, or three Reuelings, in stead of a Horn-worke, or two Demy Bulwarkes.</p>
               <p>You must observe well, touching every kind of cutting off here set downe, that they may have a good defence, and if it be possible, that they may also be defended from some other places, and that they lie open to that side which lookes into the Towne or Fortresse besieged.</p>
               <p>A Generall cutting off in Crown-works is done as followeth, one fals backward some 20 or 24 foote, yea more or lesse, according as the condition of the place is, and as necessity requires, and one maks the work within it, like unto the other which is cut off. And though his work being cut off, is lesser then the other, yet it will give an Enemy enough to doe when he shall attempt the taking of it in. Your Crown-workes are made commonly after the proportion of a small Fort Royall, where the proportion of the Polygones are of 5550 or 45 rodd, When you resolve to cut off a worke a little more inward, it will become nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower in a regard of the great work, yet will be great enough to defend it selfe</p>
               <p>The Generall Cuttings of Crown-works, will cost no great labour, which may easily be showne, in regarde it is very common. An example thereof you may see in the 169 fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure:
<pb facs="tcp:94790:55"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94790:56"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94790:57"/>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:94790:57"/>
The cutting off being made, one is forced to make a ditch, between the worke quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and the cutting off, which ought neverthelesse to be done, because one takes the Earth out of the ditch, to make up the cutting off withall: one must observe also that this cutting off must be made, as strong as possible may be. The cuttings off are maide only, while an Enemy is approaching towards you, but also when Towns and Forts are first fortified.</p>
               <p>Your General cuttings off in Tenailles doth not differ from that which is made in Horn-works, saveing that one make a Tenaile, in stead of a Horn-worke.</p>
               <p>The particular cuttings off of Horn-works is after so many wayes, that one cannot shew here all the kinds of them. A Cutting off is represented unto you in the 171 figure, where a Horn-worke is cut off, and two Revelings made in the sides of it, which are defended by a third, which are behinde the others: &amp; though they have a sufficient defence of themselves, yet the defence of the other Reveling is added to them over &amp; above, and is defended from the Tenaille, which is after it.</p>
               <p>Besides this, there is another kinde of cutting of a Horn-worke showne in the 172 figure. In imitating these cuttings off one may make many others, as necessity may permit, and as an Enemy attempts upon you, all which is impossible to marke out here.</p>
               <p>A Generall cutting off a great wall or Rampard is used very seldome, because the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers and the Besieged will at last grow weary thereof, Neverthelesse, this hapned in the seige of Ostend, which lasted three yeares, three months and odd dayes: for assoone as the Enemy had got into the wall by sapping and springing of mines, they presenly had an other Cutting off ready to entertaine them: in so much that dureing this seige, there were many Counter-approches against approches, Counter mines against the Enemies mines, so that the Enemy could not get for a long time sarcely an inch of ground upon our men, for there were above forty mines sprung on both sides &amp; when the Earth fel out, men fought for that and turned up the Earth against them, for these Generall and Royall cuttings off, lasted, till the Enemie had got more then halfe the Towne, before they gate over the whole. And though such a seige, and such a great cuttings off, happens but seldome, yet you shall see an example thereof in the figure 173, where is showne how one ought to quit a whole part of a Towne, or Fortresse, vvith the Curtaine and Bulvvarks, and hovv one by a cutting of a Bullvvarke, or a Curtaine is more usual, vvhereof vve savv an example at the seige of the Bosch in the Vucher Bulvvarks as also the last year at the seige of Breda vvhere both the Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nekeis and Haghish Hornvvorks, vvith both these Bulvvarks, vvere most dangerously cut off Novv to represent unto you some cuttings off, vvhich you may see in the 173 figure marked vvith A, B, and C. The letter C shovvs you hovv one ought to quit a vvhole Bulvvark, and hovv you ought to make your Capital line after a Bulvvark is cut off.</p>
               <p>Likevvise other kinds of cuttings off of Bulvvarks, are represented unto you in the figure 174, 175, 176, 177, and 178, after vvhich manner, you may make many others and change, and order them, as an Enemie comes neere you, and as the commodiousnesse of the place shall require.</p>
               <p>It happens also sometimes that Curtaines are cut of invvardly, vven as an Enemy may assault them vvith advantage, becaus of their length. You may then cut them of as is shovvn in 172 figure, vvhen you have time enough to cut them of Royally. But if time vvil not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt you to make a royall fortification, then you must make use of Traverses.</p>
               <p>It is impossible to cut of a False-bray, because of the little space, vvhich is in it. Notvvth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing one may cast up some Traverses in it, especially on that side, vvhich the Enemy seeks to take in, and tovvards vvhich part he vvould advance his gallery, to the end you may not give too much to an Enemy, but keep and maintaine the place as much as possible may be. For the Besieged may lay hold on the same advantage, as their Enemy doth, vvhen he is once got into the False-bray, and though vvhen he is in that they may cover the roof of it vvith planks one may neverthelesse set fire on it, and disaccommodate the Enemy on all sides.</p>
               <p>As for other vvorks as Revelings and Halfmoons, you may see hovv they are cut of after the same manner, as the Bullvvarks are, if the vvorke vvhich is to be cut of be great enough and have place enough in it to be cut off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94790:58"/>But forasmuch as all this here showne, concerneth principally the defence, which ought to bee considered in ordinary Fortresses, so one must have a speciall care to the materials whereof these workes are made: for in making of them, you must choose the best Earth that is to be got, which will make your workes the stronger.</p>
               <p>In outworkes you may alwayes take in the earth, which is digged out of the moate· But because that sandy earth, or earth mingled with sand, is not so good, it is lyned with rise, or Brush, which is layd betwixt and upon it.</p>
               <p>In great Bulwarks, where there is not Earth enough, and besides that is sandy, it must bee laid with rowes of Brush, driving them in with stakes, and sparrs of houses shot down with Canon. But when the ground is so sandy, that you cannot work it alone, then you must lay dung, and straw, and other things betwixt it to make it hold together, and you must wet the Earth as many times as is needful. You may fortifie your Parapets with Gabions, when you cannot make them otherwise, and likewise you may set great musket baskets upon the top of the Parapet, that it may be covered the better.</p>
               <p>In Outworks one may make use of the ordinary Profile, when you have time enough to make cuttings off, or you may make them long before hand. But the works which are made in great hast, have no certaine rule: howsoever, you must make them as strong as possible may be, and as meanes, and time will give you leave.</p>
               <p>Touching the cuttings off of Bulwarks and Curtains, one can give likewise no certain rule, only this you must ever have a care, that all inward works and cuttings off, lie open toward the Town or Fortres with this proviso also, that they be not made so high, but that the great works may over-look and command them: For if the Rampard of the cutting off be lower, then the high Rampard of the Town, then the Enemies Canon can do it no great harm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are defended from the great Rampard. Againe, the Enemy cannot discover the place and the forme of the cutting off, according to which one may governe themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. It is certain also, that one cannot beate an Enemy from a high place, which is neer at hand because he is blinded and covered with the Wall or Rampard.</p>
               <p>All these things being finished, when one is assured, that an Enemy is ready to spring his Mine, which cannot be found out, one must then strengthen, &amp; double the guards in every place, &amp; bring your canon to those places, where they may most gaul and flanck the enemy. One ought to have an eye, aswell on other places, as only upon the Breach, which is made by the springing of the mine. For an Enemy hopeing that he may have drawn, the most of the forces in a Town or Fortresse to defend the Breach, may attempt some other place of the Fortresse, which is not thought upon &amp; so become master of such a place, which is not provided with a sufficient defence.</p>
               <p>After that the Breach is made, the Besieged must expect to be presently assaulted, which they must maintaine and make good as long as possibly they can, by defending the breach couragiously, in doing whereof, they must throw downe from the top of it, abundance of these Sqare tanter-nailes spoken of in the chapter before, for to annoy and prick the Enemy, when he seeks to mount up and to enter it.</p>
               <p>Vpon the top of the Breach also, if they have time they may cast up a brest-worke, as Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> did in Ostend, or set up some turn-pikes, to hinder the Enemy for entring, and to strike in some Palissadoes upon the top of it, having Clubs, Flails, Stones: and Ashes, to offend them.</p>
               <p>It is necessary, when the Enemy strives to enter it, that the souldiers fight couragiously, &amp; that the officers should encourage them with their presence to carry themselvs like brave men, that being a place to gaine honour in, by giveing them also premisses of reward, and when they grow weary, to see that they be seconded with fresh men, which stand in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse behinde the Rampard, to relieve them.</p>
               <p>When they are not able to maintaine and defend the breach any longer, then they must retire into the cutting off, and take a new courage, and a heart of grace, in fighting behinde a new Rampard in makeing resistance as long as ever they are able, and thus much for the second part.</p>
