         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

my ſingular good
Lord) naturally giuen to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
workman and artificer,
that be his worke neuer ſo
rude and homely, yet would
he be loth that his labour
ſhould vaniſh, and periſh:
but ſeeing that it is the beſt that his abilitie can
performe, he deſireth the ſame as long as may be,
to remayne and continue vpon the earth. This
cauſe maketh alſo many to be ſo forward in publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
their writings in print, that when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
are taken away by death, yet by their works
there may ſtill remaine ſome laſting record, and
remembrance of the workemen. But the eſpeciall
cauſe which hath mooued me at this time to ſet
<pb facs="tcp:4035:3"/>
foorth theſe my two bookes of Phlebotomy, is, the
ſincere affection and deſire that I haue to bring
ſome ſupply and helpe (if I can) vnto two very
great wants and abuſes, which I dayly perceiue
to be now too common and graſſant in ſundrie
corners of this realme. For firſt, although in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as principallie in the famous Citie of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
the people enioy a great bleſſing of God,
in hauing ſo many worthie and expert Phiſitions
and Chirurgians ſo neerely dwelling together,
that at all times the one may be able and readie
to aduiſe, and the other alſo as willing and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to lend a helping hand: yet in Countrie
townes, there are many nowadayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which doe
practize the opening of vaynes (almoſt in euery
other Village one) and moſt of them neither haue
any learned counſaile to direct them, neither are
of themſelues ſufficiently inſtructed in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which they take in hand: whereby, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them do meane well, and intend all for the
beſt, yet in the euent, both to the harme of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
and alſo to their owne griefe, there often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth
more hurt and danger, then eaſe and ſuccour.
And another as great an occaſion there is of many
detriments and hinderances to mans health, to
wit, the wilfull temeritie and raſhneſſe of ſome
ignorant people, which for euery ſmall impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
haue recourſe preſently to letting of bloud,
and by their vnaduiſed importunitie do vrge for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Chirurgian, and euen greedily draw vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
themſelues thoſe manifold inconueniences, from
which afterward they can not againe ſo eaſily be
deliuered and made free. For although on the one
<pb facs="tcp:4035:3"/>
ſide the benefits be moſt excellent which redound
by Phlebotomy being rightly &amp; duly adminiſtred,
for thereby the fulneſſe of the body doth come to a
mediocrity, griefes which come by extenſion are
pacified, the ſpirits are refreſhed, &amp; naturall heate
euented, the lims being as it were eaſed of a great
burthen, are made more quick &amp; ready to execute
euery office, nature is inabled to concoct what is
requiſite, and to expell the vnprofitable, flowing
humours are either drawne back, or turned aſide,
from the place where they annoy, or elſe are they
diſpatched and vtterly auoyded, narrow and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
paſſages are opened; and finally, very
preſent help is brought thereby to many dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
infirmities: Yet on the other ſide, great alſo
are the harmes which may enſue by letting of
bloud, if the ſame be raſhly and vnconſiderately
attempted, the ſpirits and bloud are ſpent and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
the naturall heate is pluckt away and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed,
the principall parts are made ouercold,
and vtterly loſe their ſtrength, old age is haſtened
on, and made ſubiect to palſies, apoplexies, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
and cachexies or bad habits, many (the
bridle of choler being taken away) do in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
fall into moſt faint Iaundiſes, many haue
the one halfe of their hearing and ſight dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and the one arme and the one ſide vtterly
weakened, and many alſo are brought to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerable
deſtruction of their health and life.</p>

a little while reſerued, what courſe is further to be
taken with the patient.</p>
            <p>Before I enter into the diſcourſe vpon theſe ſeuerall
arguments, I muſt pray the reader firſt to giue me leaue
briefely to anſwere certaine doubts and occaſions of
offences which perhaps might ariſe vpon the publiſhing
of this treatiſe. Firſt therefore if any (becauſe I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
heretofore committed to the preſſſe certaine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and matters of Diuinity, do now begin to ſet

that I haue conuerted my ſtudies from the ſcriptures
vnto <hi>Galen,</hi> let him know that in this point I am vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
miſtaken by him, for moſt of my phiſick obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were then collected when firſt I gaue my mind
that way, which was long before I publiſhed any matter
of Diuinity: ſo that if there haue bin any alteration
or conuerſion of ſtudies, it hath bin from the peruſing

                  </gap>, <hi>deriuatio.</hi> The firſt, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4035:10"/>
is called Euacuation, is the auoyding of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
and fulneſſe whereby the body is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
               <p>Repletion or fulneſſe, called of the Grecians
<hi>Plethora,</hi> is an vniuerſall redounding of bloud.
It is of two ſorts, the one is called <hi>quoad vaſa,</hi>
when the vaynes and veſſels conteyning bloud,<note place="margin">Fernel. method. medend. lib. 2. cap. 1.</note>
haue their whole capacity fully and thoroughly
filled: and the ſecond repletion is called <hi>quoad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
in which the vaynes do not ſwell, and yet they
conteyne more bloud and nouriſhment then by
nature can be ordered and gouerned. In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
<hi>quoad vaſa</hi> (as <hi>Montanus</hi> ſheweth) are two
dangers,<note place="margin">Montanus medicinae vniuerſalis part. 3.</note> firſt, leaſt by the immoderate quantity
there ſhould happen either ſuffocation, or the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſome vayne: and ſecondly, leaſt the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of bloud ſhould corrupt and putrefie. For
the auoyding of both theſe perils, it is very expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
that in a full body a vaine ſhould be opened,
although no griefe do draw vs thereunto, but only
the meere fulneſſe.<note place="margin">Hippocr. 1. Aph. 1.</note> For as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſayth, <hi>The
full habit of the bodies of champions, if it come to the
higheſt degree of fulneſſe it is fraile and ſlippery, for it
can not contiune long in the ſame estate.</hi> The ſecond
kinde of repletion termed <hi>quoad vires,</hi> is rather to
be holpen by medicins then by letting of bloud.
For if raw and vndigeſted humours do abound in
the body, the opening of a vayne will draw out
much good bloud: but as for the bad bloud which
is gathered in the firſt vaynes about the liuer and
the middle entrals, it will draw it into the whole
body,<note place="margin">Gal. libr. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

therefore euacuation by ſome purging potion
ſhall in this caſe be more fit then letting of bloud.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4035:10"/>
Yet when by the nature of the diſeaſe there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
danger of a corruption and putrefaction
of humours to enſue, then a little quantitie of
bloud drawen ſhall be much auaylable to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
and preuent it, if alwayes regard be had how
farre the ſtrength will permit, and what humour
is eſpecially mixt together with the bloud in the
vaynes.<note place="margin">Fernel. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. medend. lib. 2. cap. 4.</note> For as <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſheweth, there is another
way two kinds of repletion or plethora, the one
is called pure, the other impure. <hi>Montanus</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
alſo two, the one ſimple, and the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.
The pure doth conſiſt of (in a manner) an
equall portion of all the beſt iuices. The impure
is an abounding of vicious humours in the vaines.
If the plenitude come by choler, the vayne may
the more plentifully make euacuation. But if
the fulneſſe come by fleame or by melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
then muſt the euacuation be made by little
and little at ſeuerall times when neceſſitie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
and when the vaynes being ouer-full doe
threaten danger. How all theſe ſeuerall kindes
of plenitude ſhall be knowne, I ſhall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

                  </gap>ayth he) in quotidians and quartans we do
often let bloud, not becauſe there is any fulneſſe or
great multitude of ill humours, but becauſe we
would by venting take away the boyling and
bubbling thereof. This venting hath place both
whether there be any putrefaction in the humour
or no. But if our ſcope and purpoſe be only ſimply

that hath more ſorts of it ſelfe ſubiect to letting of

which hath one continuall fit, ſeeing that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
of the inflammation of bloud, needs muſt
the opening of a vayne be very fit and conuenient

only the thinner part of the bloud is kindled, it is
diſſolued very often before the fift day, it hath

great and thick, but not euidently vnequall. And

In either of theſe ſynochi letting of bloud is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,

If at the firſt it were omitted, it may be done in the

they do aduiſe in the firſt beginning to open
a vayne, and if in the firſt day it be omitted when
the ague is thought to be but an <hi>ephemera,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming

of this hote ague comming of bloud inflamed, and

The firſt is called <hi>Homotona,</hi> which from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

ſecond <hi>Epacmastica,</hi> which increaſeth more and
more vntill it come to ſtate and vigor. The third
<hi>Paracmastica,</hi> which alwayes decreaſeth. In the
firſt and the laſt he admitteth boldly to let bloud,
but in the ſecond ſparingly, leaſt ſtrength and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
fayling the diſeaſe ſhould ouercome nature.
So alſo if it be <hi>febris putrida,</hi> or <hi>ſynochus cum putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi>
a feuer wherein the humor is putrified, he
doth require a little before in the ſame booke, that
we ſhould not let bloud in any great quantity:
<hi>Becauſe where the humour is already putrified, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4035:13"/>
though we ſhould let bloud euen till the ſtrength fayle,
yet ſhould we not auoyde the putrefaction: for putrified
bloud is become earthly, and therefore can not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.
And if we let bloud in a great quantity, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction
will ſtill remaine, and the vertue and ſtrength
will be made ſo weake, that we ſhall not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue

explanation vpon <hi>Galen</hi> doth ſhew) by the ſyſtole
and diaſtole of the pulſes. For there is a double vſe
of the pulſe, the one for cooling of the ſpirits, and
to that doth ſerue the diaſtole, or enlarging of the
artery, for when the artery is enlarged a more coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ayre being drawne in, doth temper the heate
of the ſpirits. The other is that the ſmoaky vapour
(which muſt needes be engendred by the force of
heate working vpon moyſture) may be ſo let out,
that the ſpirits may be purified: and to this vſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
ſyſtole the contraction or compreſſion of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4035:14"/>
artery. For while the artery is drawne and preſt
togither, the hote ayre and ſmoky vapours are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
and auoyded. Now it muſt needes be that
betwixt theſe two contrary motions, a reſt muſt
of neceſſitie goe betweene them. When there is
neede of cooling, there the diaſtole or enlarging of
the artery is ſwifter, and the inward pawſe or reſt
is ſhorter: but where there is more neede of auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
moyſt and putrifyed excrements, there the
ſyſtole or contraction of the artery is ſwifter, and
the outward pawſe is ſhorter. And this later he
maketh to be the moſt certayne note to know all
putrifyed agues, in which the humours rotting,
many ſmoky vapours muſt needes be engendred,
this he calleth <hi>ſo proper, familiar, inſeparable, and

                  <hi>The declaration of the quantity of the obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <hi>Montanus</hi> being fallen
into the conſideration of this place of <hi>Galen,</hi>
doth make three ſeuerall kindes of obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſheweth in which of them bloud-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is requiſite, and in which not. The fyrſt
obſtruction is when in the pores of the skinne
in the outward parts the tranſpiration and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4035:16"/>
out is ſtayed and prohibited. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
kind of obſtruction he calleth <hi>coarctatoria,</hi>
when ſuch a multitude of humours is conteyned
within the vaynes, that the paſſage of the ſpirits
being ſtopped, they cannot paſſe thorough the
vaynes, whereby there commeth a perill of ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The third obſtruction is called <hi>oppilatio,</hi>
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome tough matter doth ſo ſtop the conduits
and chanels of the vaynes, that neither matter nor
ſpirits can paſſe thorough them.</p>
               <p>In the firſt kind of obſtructions Phlebotomy is
good, becauſe by it the body is made more thin,
and humors being without the vaines in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of the skinne, are by bloudletting drawne
into the vaines, and ſo do paſſe away, as <hi>Montanus</hi>
doth demonſtrate out of <hi>Galen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond kind of obſtruction letting bloud
is alſo conuenient,<note place="margin">Gal. de ſanit. tuenda libr. 4.</note> that the thronging together of
humours may ceaſe, and that bloud may be ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But in the third kind of obſtruction it were
ill done to let bloud, becauſe the thick humour
which is impacted in the firſt vaynes, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
euacuated, but rather increaſed, as the ſame
author doth proue out of the ſame fourth booke
of <hi>Galen de ſanitate tuenda.</hi> I thinke he hath reſpect
to that poſition of <hi>Galen:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>In a weriſome and faint
body there is little good bloud, and many raw humours,
Phlebotomies do auoyd the good bloud, but as for the
ill bloud which is gathered together in the firſt vaynes,
especially that which is about the liuer and mid bowels,
they disperſe and ſpread it throughout all the body.</hi>
How in the two laſt kinds of obſtructions the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
muſt be prepared and made fluxible, before
we attempt any letting of bloud, it is to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4035:16"/>
hereafter in the third Chapter of the ſecond
booke. But the queſtion is here only of the firſt
kind of obſtructions, when in an ague called <hi>diaria</hi>
or <hi>ephemera</hi> (which laſteth not aboue 24. howres)
by reaſon either of the conſtipation or thicknes
of the skinne the ſpirits and vapours haue loſt
their accuſtomable flowing out, whereby the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are inflamed, whether in this ague bloud is to
be let or no? I anſwere, that according to the
iudgement of many excellent Phiſitions of our
time,<note place="margin">Platerus de febribus pag. 286. Fuchſius de morbis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendis. lib. 4. cap. 1. Brigthus in therapeutica.</note> this ague is beſt ouercome by cauſing kindly
ſweates, by medicins looſing obſtructions, and by
vſing fit bathes without letting of bloud. But if it
do continue more then a day, that it be now <hi>diaria
plurium dierum,</hi> or as ſome call it <hi>ephemera extenſa,</hi>
then all do agree that letting of bloud is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
for feare leaſt of an ague not putrified it
do become a <hi>ſynochus putrida,</hi> and ſo bring greater
danger. For as diaries or agues of one day do paſſe
into diaries of many dayes, vnleſſe the obſtruction
be looſed as <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth;<note place="margin">Gal. lib. 10. method. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnleſſe the obstruction be

diaries of many dayes do fall into putrified agues
and hectick feuers, vnleſſe they be in time holpen
and eaſed, as the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> ſheweth in the firſt

                  <hi>One obstruction commeth by multitude,
and an other by the quality of the humours being too
tough, or too thick. In that which commeth by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
letting of bloud is the chiefeſt manner of
curing, but in that which commeth by the quality

then he alloweth letting of bloud as a fit help to

ſometimes vſe phlebotomy in quotidians &amp; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,

                  <hi>It respecteth not the

ſayth, that Phlebotomy is not neceſſary, neither
euacuatiue, becauſe there is no fulneſſe of bloud,
but only euill humours mixed with the bloud,
nor yet Euentatiue, becauſe the paroxyſmes of
the tertians continue not aboue twelue howres,
and haue a great diſtance of intermiſſion, and
therefore can not haue ſo great a boiling as ſhould
neede to be vented with ſo great a remedie as is
Phlebotomy. And as touching the quartaine, he
ſayth, that bloud-letting doth not agree vnto it of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4035:17"/>
it ſelfe as it dependeth of melancholick humour,
but <hi>per accidens,</hi> as when it commeth vpon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
of the menſtrua or haemorrhodes, or when
it commeth <hi>ratione ſanguinis adusti</hi> by meanes of
burnt bloud, then he alloweth the letting of bloud.
<hi>Platerus</hi> doth thinke that all intermitting agues
do proceede of a putrified cauſe,<note place="margin">Platerus' de febribus pag. 151. &amp; 154.</note> lying hid in the
meſaraick vaynes, and therefore if any of them
could be opened, he ſuppoſeth ſome help might
come: but ſeeing thoſe meſaraick vaynes do no
where appeare at the skinne, it were beſt not only
in quartaines but alſo in tertians (if poſſibly it
may be) to cauſe a flux of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> haemorrhoids, becauſe
the haemorrhodiall vaynes are branches of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaraik
vaines. He will haue no vayne to be opened
there, vnleſſe it appeare exceeding well, becauſe
a ſmall wound made there, doth bring oftentimes
great torments: but he will haue either the flux to
be procured by ſome medicine, or elſe leaches to
be applied. He alloweth not phlebotomy in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
tertians, and ſuch as are afflicted with moſt
vehement heate, by reaſon of choler inflamed,
neither doth he thinke it fit in phlegmatick agues,
in which caſes he which ſhall raſhly and vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
let bloud, ſhall not only auoid nothing of the
cauſe lying hid in the meſaraik vaynes, but alſo as
he ſayth, <hi>the matter being plucked out of the meſaraick

ague make a continuall ague;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plat. ibid.</note> or elſe, <hi>the purer bloud,

whereunto bloud was before a bridle and a meanes to

concludeth, that in theſe kindes of agues more
harme is done by admitting Phlebotomy then by

of the heate after the fit, and when there is no fit)
then not in the beginning of the ague, but about
the third or fourth fit, in the day of intermiſſion,
out of that vayne of the arme that appeareth moſt
filled, it will do very well to let bloud 5. 6. 7. or 8.

and of little bloud: <hi>But the ſharp choler which is the
matter of the ague, and doth abound and boyle vnder
the hollow part of the liuer when bloud is taken away

but doth kindle other humours (which may be
knowen in that the pulſe is much leſſe,<note place="margin">Fuchſ. de morbis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendis lib. 4. cap. 7. Brigthus in therapeut.</note> thinner and
ſlower then the other, and the heate alſo leſſe) then
is no bloud to be taken at the beginning of the
Ague; but afterward the matter being prepared,
when the vrine doth appeare red and thick, a
vayne may be opened the day going before the
fit, and foure ounces of bloud may be taken. But
if the bloud prooue thin and ſomewhat yellowiſh,
then muſt you ſtraightway ſuppreſſe it. In the
melancholick quartaine if it come vpon the ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any vſuall or naturall purging of bloud,
then ſtirre vp that if you can: if you can not, then
within the 14. or the 20. day let a little bloud out
of the ſaluatella, if the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth be weake; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
out of the baſilica of the left arme, hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the melancholick (for the melancholick continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

you may let bloud in the beginning foure or fiue

For to black choler are due thoſe things which
may pacify the fiercenes of it, as Violets, Endiue,
and ſuch like: but to melancholy are due ſuch
things as are moderately warme and opening, as
the rootes of Capers, the aperitiue rootes, and
ſuch like, alwayes adioyning to them ſuch things
as haue <hi>vim humectandi</hi> a moyſtening force. And
as in potions and medicins theſe two require a far

               <p>In the intermitting agues we muſt not haue a

You haue his words and his reaſon in the firſt

but not in respect of the powers.</hi> He bringeth in
an inſtance of a peſtilent feuer, and ſheweth that
bloud is not to be let in it, becauſe although of it
ſelfe in regard of the peſtilent feuer there is no
greater remedie then letting of bloud, ſeeing that
by it the body is made apt to vent and vapour out
the ſpirits, the inward heate is extinguiſhed, and
putrified bloud is euacuated: <hi>yet if bloud be let all
do dye,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mont. Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore we muſt abſteine from Phlebotomy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4035:21"/>
in the pestilent feuer, becauſe in a moment of time the
ſtrength vtterly decayeth. Platerus</hi> ſheweth ſundry
great dangers which letting of bloud doth bring
vnto them that are infected with the plague,<note place="margin">Platerus de febribus pag. 225.</note> and
that little good helpe can be expected thereby.
<hi>I can not ſee how Phlebotomy can auayle to pluck that
venemous quality from the heart, or to bring it out of
the body together with the bloud, ſeeing that it is rather
procured thereby, that the infection which from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
commeth into the body and doth preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the ſpirits, ſhould be drawne more deepely inward.
And moreouer the motion of nature (whereby ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in the firſt inuaſion it goeth about to ſhake out
the poyſon by ſweates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plater. Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>by outward pustles and by bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
may be hindred by letting of bloud, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
thereby weakened, which we ought to keepe ſtrong to
expell that poyſon. It neither doth auoyd the cauſe of
the diſeaſe, neither is there any neede heere of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentilation
of heate, ſeeing it is not heere ſo vehement.</hi>
Hereupon he concludeth, that vpon raſh and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſed
letting of bloud in plague times many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
are killed. Yet he acknowledgeth that when the
plague hath taken hold vpon bodies which are
<hi>ſummè plethorica vel cachectica,</hi> full of bloud or of
corrupt humours whereby a feuer is kindled, then
if by opening of a vayne the plenty and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the bloud be taken away, all the other
ſymptomes will become more tolerable: but that
muſt be done ſparingly, and with a due regard of
the ſtrength. <hi>And if in the beginning ſtrength be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed,
then is Phlebotomy not to be admitted, though
the fulneſſe of the vaynes doe require it: for of lusty
youthes we haue found by experience more to eſcape in
the plague time without letting of bloud then by letting
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4035:21"/>
of bloud. If Phlebotomy be vſed it muſt be done ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in respect of the feuer then of the pestilent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
ſeeing that this venome doth not conſiſt in the
bloud, but comming from outwardly doth ſodainely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
the heart, and we do not thinke that it can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
or drawne out from it by Phlebotomy.</hi> And if
the caſe do ſo ſtand that by the meanes of the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
and feuer a vayne muſt needs be opened,
then he ſheweth in what order it muſt be done.
Firſt, it muſt be done in the beginning: for vnleſſe
the vayne be opened within 24. howres of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
it will rather hinder nature then do any
good. Alſo it muſt be conſidered whether the
party be in a ſweate or no: for in no wiſe muſt the
ſweate be hindered by Phlebotomy. But after the
party hath ſweat and hath bin refreſhed with a
little meate or ſome cordiall receipt, then may a
vayne be opened howſoeuer there hath gone no
clyſter nor purging before, becauſe the time hath
not giuen leaue. Chooſe the vayne in that ſide
which is moſt grieued. If any eruption appeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the flanck open the ſaphena. If in the vpper
parts, then ſome vayne in the arme or hand of the
ſame ſide. If vnder the arme-hole, take the baſilica.
If about the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the vayne vnder the tongue. And euer to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
appearing, let cupping glaſſes be faſtned, that
the poyſon may abide in the ſame place, and not
by Phlebotomy be drawne into the inward parts.
<hi>Trincauel</hi> doth accompt it very dangerous to let
bloud when pimples do outwardly appeare:<note place="margin">Trincauel tractat. de febre pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiali.</note> but
when as well by the pulſe, as by the former man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

following, the motion which is made by the force
of the vayne cut, ſetling on that ſide, doth giue an
occaſion of a new inflammation. And therefore
when there is a plenitude in the whole body, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

greatly commend the cuſtome practiſed for many
yeares with good ſucceſſe by the Phiſitions of

that opinion. For if <hi>Fernelius</hi> do make thoſe <hi>rectae

he not well, for the tranſuerſe fibres and not the
right do ſerue for expulſion: and if he make them
(as they are) helps of attraction, then muſt they
draw equally as well on the one ſide as the other,
becauſe they runne out equally by the length of
the vaynes on both ſides. And the like anſwere
they make to them which would haue the word to
ſignifie the continuing and ioyning together of
parts, as though all the vaynes of the right ſide
were ioyned one to and in an other amongſt
themſelues, and the vaynes of the left ſide ioyned
among themſelues, and did not rather participate
and communicate one with an other. But ſeeing
the trunke of the hollow vayne is one, the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
thereof on both ſides are equally ioyned to
the liuer. The breaking out of bloud out of the left
noſtrill doth empty as well the right ſide as the
left, and (as <hi>Reuſnerus</hi> ſayth) he ſaw often by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
that the diſeaſes of the ſpleane were holpen
ſometimes by opening the liuer vayne, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by bloud guſhing out of the right noſtrill.
And moreouer, as <hi>Andraeas Laurentius</hi> ſheweth,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4035:29"/>
there is no meeting together betwixt the vaynes
of the noſtrils and the ſpleane, and yet the ſpleane
being inflamed (as you haue heard) the bloud that
floweth out of the left noſtrill doth flow <gap reason="foreign">

will haue in euery inflammation two things
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4035:30"/>
principally to be regarded, the firſt, <hi>membrum
mandans,</hi> the member that doth ſend the humour,
and the ſecond, <hi>membrum recipiens,</hi> the member or
part that doth receiue the humour. As he giueth
his inſtance thus of the pleuriſy. Let there be (ſaith
he) one of a hoate liuer, who hath laboured in the
ſunne, hath dronken ſtrong wine, hath inflamed
his head, hath reſted ſodainely in a cold place, and
then (as it commeth commonly to paſſe) by the
cold the matter is expreſſed by the vaynes, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
by the vaynes it doth flow downe either
to the higher or lower ribs, and there followeth a
paine. Here the member ſending is the head, and
the member receiuing, the ribs. <hi>Let the place of the
inflammation be in the right ſide, where muſt we then
let bloud?</hi> He anſwereth, that ſeeing the humour is
caryed downeward, if we ſhould open the baſilica
of the ſame ſide we ſhould draw the humour more
downeward, and ſo increaſe the impoſtume and
indanger the patient. <hi>The fulneſſe is in the head, but
aboue the head there is nothing; if there were, we would
euacuate from it: Therefore either a deriuation muſt be
made to deriue the humour from the head, by opening
the vaynes which are behinde the eares, or by bleeding
at the noſe (which were excellent) or by ſtriking the
vayne vnder the tongue, or elſe we muſt follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Arabian Phiſitions, to let bloud on the contrary
ſide, that ſo by reuulſion the humour may be drawne
according to the directneſſe of the ſituation, from the
right ſide to the left.</hi> But if the pleuriſy do come of
another cauſe that the flux be not from the head,
but it be <hi>the liuer full of bloud and choler ſending hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
vnto the ribs by the aſcending vayne, becauſe
there is a plucking of the humours from the lower parts
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4035:30"/>
vnto the higher, in what vayne then muſt we let bloud?</hi>
He anſwereth, <hi>not from the baſilica of the ſame right
ſide, for then we ſhall draw the humour to the place: but
(as</hi> Auicenna <hi>doth teach) either wee muſt draw it
downe by opening the ſaphena of the ſame ſide, or elſe we
muſt deale with the oppoſite ſide aboue.</hi> The reſt of

into the vaynes of the hypochondria, and the

he addeth this, <hi>But if the colick do come by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation
of the colum, one of the loweſt guts, by
meanes of bloud or choler flowing to the place, in this
caſe if you let not bloud the patient will dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Dropſie <hi>Trincauel</hi> teacheth, that if it
come by the ſuppreſſion of ſome vſuall flux,<note place="margin">Trincauel de ratione curadi part. corp. aff. lib. 8. cap. 10.</note> as the
termes, the hemorrhodes, and bleedings at noſe,
whereby (by the ſuperfluous abundance of bloud)
the naturall heate of the liuer beginneth to be
quenched, then the firſt thing in the cure muſt be
phlebotomy. But if it come of fleame, then omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
bloud-letting, we muſt only ſeeke to purge
the fleame. He maketh there an obiection what
we muſt do if the termes be not ſuppreſſed, and yet
the vrine do appeare high coloured, whether may
we then let bloud or no,<note place="margin">Auicenna prima quarti.</note> ſeeing that <hi>Auicen</hi> ſayth,
that if the vrine do appeare red and thick, a vayne
muſt preſently be opened? <hi>Trincauel</hi> anſwereth,
that yet we muſt not let bloud, becauſe in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
that rule of <hi>Auicen</hi> doth not take place. For
the red tincture of the vrine doth not come by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of bloud, but firſt, <hi>becauſe little vrine is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4035:32"/>
made in theſe diſeaſes, therefore it is the higher colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
for the thinne iuices of choler and bloud, from the
which doth come the colour of the vrine, being mingled
with a little moysture, do giue the greater tincture, and
make it higher coloured.</hi> And a ſecond cauſe of the
high colour in the vrine, he ſayth, may be the debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the raynes, which by reaſon of their weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
being not able perfectly to ſeparate the bloud
from the excrement, do let ſome little portion of
bloud paſſe with the vrine, whereby the vrine is
dyed red. A third reaſon doth <hi>Fernelius</hi> giue why
the colour of the vrine may often deceiue, becauſe
when the choler is caſt out by the liuer, it doth not
only colour the thinne part of bloud, but maketh
the vrine alſo to looke as though the bloud were
inflamed, as he giueth an inſtance by Iaundiſes
and Dropſies,<note place="margin">Fernelius in method<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

offend, which by the vrine being of citrine colour, and
thicke, do iudge ſtraight that bloud is to be let.</hi> For
ſuch an vrine doth not come by the abundance or
by the kindling of bloud, but by the powring out
of choler out of the liuer. I will not ſpeake heere
of the razing of the ſtone in the raynes, and ſome
other occaſions that may be, that a little bloud
iſſuing, may alter mightely the colour of vrine.

the bloud doth only offend in plenty, and is not

auoyded by a good fit diet, dry, and moderately

extenuate and reſolue, then by ſeeking to draw

ſtate and vigor, it is beſt then to reſt. Galen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
vpon it, doth apply it to the two great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and eſpecially to Phlebotomy. The firſt
canon of <hi>Auicenna</hi> expounded by <hi>Montanus</hi> is,
<hi>A vayne is not to be opened in the day of the diſeaſes
motion,</hi> that is, when the matter of the diſeaſe doth
boyle and ſwell, and nature doth ſtriue to concoct
or expell it.<note place="margin">Montanus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                  <hi>Montanus</hi> ſayth, there is <hi>duplex motus
morbi,</hi> two manner of motions of a diſeaſe, the one
particular, which conſiſteth in the fits and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſines,
and the other generall or vniuerſall in
reſpect of the whole diſeaſe from the beginning
to the end, and this conteyneth the criticall dayes,
the fourth, the ſeauenth, the eleuenth, the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
the ſeauenteenth, the twentieth, &amp;c. Now
we muſt marke how the matter of the diſeaſe is
mooued, whether in a criticall day or not criticall,
and whether it be moued becauſe nature goeth
about to concoct it, or becauſe it is furious: <hi>If the
motion of it be furious, we muſt needs vſe euacuation.</hi>
But when the motion of the diſeaſe is ſuch that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth concoct the matter, then is it a day of
reſt, and no euacuation is then to be attempted.
And that doth he make to be the meaning of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi>
that we muſt reſt when the diſeaſe is in
ſtate and vigour, <hi>hoc eſt in die motus morbi ſeupugnae
tempore,</hi> that is, in the day of the diſeaſes motion,
or the time of the ſtrife betwixt nature and it.
Some affirme that in the criticall day bloud is not
to be letten, although it prooue a day of reſt. But
<hi>Montanus</hi> doth confute them, and doth iuſtifie
that rule of <hi>Auicenna, When nature doth mooue,
mooue thou nothing, but when ſhe mooueth not, mooue
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4035:50"/>
thou in the time of her motion. The time of natures
motion it the criticall day, and therefore in the criticall
day we muſt ſtirre the body.</hi> But therein the Phiſition
muſt be very wary and circumſpect, for if nature
haue moued in the fourth day (which is the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of the ſeauenth) then may we not euacuate in
the ſeauenth day. And if in the ſeauenth there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
any motion, we muſt not mooue in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth.
But if in the criticall day nature do neither
mooue, nor ſhew ſome good token and proofe
that ſhe will mooue, then may wee indeuour to
mooue by Phiſick. Afterward vpon the twelfth
canon <hi>Montanus</hi> reprooueth them which affirme
that bloud is not to be let after the fourth day of
the ſickneſſe,<note place="margin">Montanus in canonem Auicennae 12. Gal. method. therap. lib. 3.</note> and prooueth out of <hi>Galen,</hi> that in
ſome infirmities a vaine may be opened a hundred

we let bloud only in the beginning, <hi>becauſe

Phiſick ſeeing that a great part thereof doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the flowing and iſſuing, the ſtaying and the
paſſing away of humours, and that it is found by
the termes of women, by the fluxes and refluxes
of the ſeas, and many other wayes, that the moone
hath by the maker thereof certaine influences gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto her, much auaylable to the auoyding
and correcting of humours; I do not thinke but if
it be found by the experiences of former ages, that
at ſometimes and in ſome ſignes or aſpects her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are more violent then at other, we may haue
ſome conſideration thereof, and make choyce of
ſuch as are moſt meeteſt for our purpoſe, euen as
the husbandmen may alſo take ſuch times for their
grafting, ſowing, planting, and ſuch like, as by the
proofes of all nations haue appeared to be fitteſt
for the fruitfull growing and propagation thereof.
To returne now to our argument of letting bloud,
ſeeing that as I haue ſhewed the ſigne may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſeeme to be good, and yet by other aſpects
the ſame may be controuled, what courſe is then
to be taken when for want of good helps we can
not come to the knowledge of the aſpects? Surely
then our beſt way will be to obſerue the manner
of the weather. When the weather is ſetled to be
very dry, then are not humours apt to flow, but in
open and moyſt weather we find them very flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible.

               <p>But here we muſt take heed that we vſe not too
much to let bloud on one ſide, for that thereby we
ſee many to be brought to particular palſies, and
to loſe the vſe of one eye or care, or the ſtrength of
one arme or ſide, partly becauſe the longer that
ſuperfluous humours haue found a vent in one
place, the more apt they are to haue recourſe to the
ſame place; and if they haue not their former paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
they will eaſily either make obſtructions, or
breede ſome inconuenience; and partly becauſe
the letting bloud too much on one ſide, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

If therefore thou haſt bin heretofore let
bloud on the one ſide, thy beſt way is the next

that they may be caryed with no greater force

fitteſt time to ſtay the bleeding, firſt, by the change
of bloud: ſecondly, by the force of flowing, waxing
more faint: and thirdly, by the change of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
The firſt, that is the change of the bloud both
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4035:62"/>
in colour and in conſiſtence, muſt then eſpecially
be attended and wayted for, when the griefe or

ſheweth, that in a pleuriſie the bloud
which is nigh vnto the inflammation, doth farre
differ from that which is conteyned in other parts
of the body, being by the vehement heate much
altered: ſo that if the bloud of the reſt of the body
be phlegmatick, it will be about the inflammation
red; and if the reſt be red, it will be about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation
aduſt and burnt. This change of the
bloud is not alwayes to be taryed for, for it may be
that either the ſtrength is not able to indure it, or
elſe that the phlegmone is ſuch a maligne and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
humour, that it will hardly giue place. In
theſe caſes wee muſt ceaſe before the bloud doe
change, and the reſt is to be withdrawne by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
phlebotomy. The other note to know when
it is time to ſtay the bloud, is by the violence of the
flowing, now waxen more ſlow &amp; feeble, for that
ſheweth that the ſtrength and powers are ready
to decay,<note place="margin">

whole habit of the body and extinguiſh the feuer, and
alſo in very many the belly is wont to be made ſoluble,
and ſweates are accustomed to flow, by which deede
ſome are altogether deliuered from their ague.</hi> And he
doth confirme it alſo by the teſtimonie of the moſt
auncient and excellent Phiſition <hi>Philotheus,</hi> who
commenting vpon the ſame Aphoriſme, vſeth
theſe words:<note place="margin">Philotheus in Comment. in 1. Aph. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>In whome we may let bloud euen vnto
fainting, it is manifeſt that it is in them who are ſick of
burning feuers, and yet not them all, but thoſe in whom
the powers are ſtrong. But why dowe let bloud in them
euen vnto fainting, ſeeing that burning feuers are
kindled by humours putrified? The putrefaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth
two things, to wit, the matter putrified, and the
badnes of the quality. Bloud being let euen vnto fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
doth both diminiſh the quantity of the matter, and
moreouer extinguiſh the ſharp and inflaming quality,
for by the fainting of the courage the body is cooled.</hi>
And finally he doth conuince the ſame by reaſon,
ſeeing that by bloud breaking out at the noſtrils,
the ſayd burning feuers are oftentimes healed.

                  <hi>Fernelius</hi> thinketh, that the fitteſt plaſter

                  <hi>Fernelius</hi> immediatly
after doth ſhew,<note place="margin">Fuchſ. instit. lib. 2. ſect. 5. cap. 11.</note> as doth likewiſe <hi>Fuchſius,</hi> how
by the bloud hauing a little while reſted, wee
may much perceiue what humour doth moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in the patient. When the ſawcers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bloud is conteyned, haue bin ſet vp ſome
little time in a place where neither wind nor ſunne
beames may come vnto them, if the bloud be thick
and viſcous, ſuch as is the cauſe of obſtructions,
then it will ſoone congeale together, and being
touched, it will ſtick ſomewhat to the finger. If it
be long in congealing and waxing hard, then is
the bloud to be accompted very thinne: but if
when it is cold it waxe not hard at all, then
is it all together either wateriſh, or putrifyed.
Much whayiſh and yellowiſh water ſwimming
vpon or by the bloud, doth ſhew either too much
vſe of drinking, or the liuer weake, or the raynes
feeble and obſtructed. The ſpume or froth that
ſwimmeth vppon it (vnleſſe it come by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4035:71"/>
of the flowing) it ſheweth the heate and
inflammation of that humour whoſe colour it
caryeth, as the red froth ſignifieth the heate of
bloud, the yellow of choler, the white of fleame,
and the blackiſh and blewiſh of melancholy.
The colour of the bloud continuing red, is a
ſigne of good and profitable bloud. If it be pale,
it ſignifyeth choler; if white, fleame; if gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
burnt choler; if of a leaden colour, perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
melancholy; if it be of diuers colours, then
it is ſhewed that diuers humours doe abound.
There is ſometimes a certayne fatneſſe lyke a
ſpiders webbe ſwimming vpon the bloud: If it
be in a full bodie, it ſignifyth a bloud prone
vnto fatneſſe; but if it be in a leane bodie, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
of the conſuming and waſting thereof.
If the bloud doe ſmell ill (as it falleth out but
ſeldome) it is a ſigne of a very great putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Fernelius</hi> ſheweth,<note place="margin">Fernelius methodi me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi lib. 2. cap. 3.</note> how in the bloud you

                  <hi>Fernelius</hi> doth aduiſe vs not only to
marke the colour and contents, but alſo when the
bloud hath ſettled awhile, to compare the little
baſins one with an other. If all be like, it is likely
that all the reſt in the body is like vnto it, and that
only the multitude did offend. For although the
bloud be neuer ſo good, yet if it be in ouer-much
plenty, it may greeue the body, offend the ſenſes,
and bring very many dangers. If all the bloud be
ill, or if the firſt be good and the laſt ill, it ſheweth
that many humours do yet remayne to be rooted
out by good diet, and by fit euacuations, or elſe if
the bloud-letting be in a great inflammation,
then the laſt bloud being worſe then the firſt,
doth often declare, that the very matter of the
diſeaſe is auoyded, and the euacuation made fully
complete. So likewiſe if the laſt bloud be better
then the firſt, it is a good ſigne of a perfect euacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
If the bloud be powred afterward into
warme water that the ſubſtances of it may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
one from an other,<note place="margin">Fernelius ibidem.</note> it will declare much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs. The whayiſh thinne part will be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with the water, that you can not diſcerne
the one from the other. The thinner part of bloud
will alſo be mingled with the water; but yet ſo,
that by the colour thereof you may haue a good
iudgement of the nature of the humour. The
thicker and fibrous part of the bloud will ſhrinke
to the bottome, which ſhall be iudged to be pure
and agreeable vnto nature, if it be bright, thinne,
ſomewhat whitiſh, and cleauing well together;
but if it be thick, it declareth that the bloud in the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4035:72"/>
body is thick. If it be black or infected with any
bad colour, it ſheweth with what humour y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud
is oppreſſed. If it cleaue not together but do eaſily
fall aſunder, it is an argument of very great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction.
When thus the humour abounding is
knowne, and therewithall a conſideration had of
the ſtate, quality, and nature of the diſeaſe, if
it be found that there is ſtill a continuance of the
payne or griefe, then muſt we either vſe thoſe
things which do gently correct the humour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to abound, or elſe (if time and occaſion
require it) harken to that practiſe which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
