            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>CAius (<hi rend="sup">a</hi>) Mecaenas,</hi> that famous che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risher of good learning, to whom our Poet in this place acknowledges so much, was a Gentleman of Etruria, in high favour with <hi>Augustas Caesar,</hi> and in great imployment of State under him. Hee was in his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with learned men, not onely bountifull, but judicious in the placing of his bountie,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20026:39"/>
and above all others fortunate in the choise of the men. Among all the Poets, in that wise age wherein he lived, <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> were the onely two, which I can finde, whose meane fortunes needed his liberalitie, as well as their vertues deserved his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: how liberall he was, their often acknowledgements in their Works, have te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified to the world: how judicious or fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate he was in those mens acquaintance, no age of the world hath since beene ignorant; his name having beene generally used for the love of learning, no lesse than <hi>Caesar's</hi> for Imperiall dignity (though there were, both in that and the following ages, as <hi>Iuve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> witnesseth in his seventh Satyr, other men of honourable name and esteeme in Rome, who were lovers of such things, as <hi>Fabius, Cotta, Proculeius, Lentulus, &amp;c.</hi>) Those
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20026:39"/>
Lords eyther fayled in judgement in the choyse of their friends, or the injury of their times affoorded them not wits able enough to raise their fames; since wee finde not any such manifest honour done to their memories as to this <hi>Mecaenas.</hi> whose fortune it was, that <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> should live in his time; and in such estates, as to need his bounty for his owne honour: which is not a thing incident to every age, though wittie <hi>Martial</hi> in an Epigram of his could speake thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sint Mecaenates, non deerunt, Flacce, Marones.</hi> yet the contrary by experience hath oft been found. <hi>Maroes</hi> have beene borne when no <hi>Mecaenases</hi> have lived to cherish them (as <hi>Homer</hi> the wonder of posteritie, in his owne time little esteemed) and <hi>Mecaenases</hi> have lived and wanted <hi>Maroes.</hi> What Monarch
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20026:40"/>
in the world was ever more desirous of fame in that kinde, and more able to requite than <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great? Hee that so much honoured the memory of <hi>Homer,</hi> and at the sacking of Thebes spared all the posteritie of the Poet <hi>Pindarus,</hi> found in his owne time no able Poet to celebrate his fame. There were in his time (as <hi>Arianus</hi> witnesseth in the life of <hi>Alexander</hi>) many Poets, who would have written of him, and stirred up by the greatnesse of his actions, or moved with hopes form his known bounty, had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the praise of him; but such and so poore were their inspirations, they neyther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued the acceptation of <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor the sight of posterity.</p>

                  </hi>) Our Poet, after the description of those severall trees of strange natures, which enrich the severall climates of the earth, takes an occasion, by way of comparison, to extoll in all kinds the fruitfulnesse, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the happinesse of his native Italy, the magnificence of the Italian Cities, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and bravery of her people: Of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulousnesse of Italy thus <hi>Plinius</hi> at one place speaketh. This is that Italy, which, when <hi>Lucius Aemilius Paulus</hi> and <hi>Caius Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> were Consuls upon the fame of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of <hi>Gallia,</hi> armed presently of her owne
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20026:41"/>
forces, without the aide of any forreyners, and without mustering of any Italians beyond the river of Po, thirty thousand horsemen, and seventy thousand foot: and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> speaking of Rome before the second Carthaginian warre, sayes that the Senate as it were foreseeing the comming of <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> with a warre so bloudy, tooke a generall survey of themselves and their tributaries, and found the number of men fit to beare armes, to be ten hundred thousand. And speaking also of the populousnesse of the Iland of Sicily, esteemed then as a part of Italy (for it was all called <hi>magna Graecia</hi>) bids us not wonder at those mighty armies of <hi>Ninus, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis, Darius,</hi> or <hi>Xerxes,</hi> since <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> the tyrant, out of Syracusae onely, armed an hundred and twenty thousand footmen, with twelve thousand horsemen, and a navy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20026:41"/>

Others for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and hatred; as a Sow, because she roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up land and spoyleth corne, was offered unto <hi>Ceres</hi>: the Goat, because he browzeth the Vines, was offered to <hi>Bacchus</hi>: the Goat was likewise offered to <hi>Aesculapius</hi> the god of health, because the Goat is never without a fever.</p>

the dogge parting not from the two bodies, starved himselfe: for which piety both <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone</hi> and the dogge were taken and made signes in heaven. But not long after, for these murders unrevenged, the Athenians were visited with a great pestilence, and the virgins of Athens were possessed with a strange frenzie, and in their fits hanged themselves. The Oracle, being asked the cause of this pestilence, returned them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that it should cease when they in devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had interred the bodies of <hi>Icarus</hi> and <hi>Erigone,</hi> and revenged their murders: this being done, the plague ceased, and the people in honour of <hi>Bacchus</hi> celebrated yearely playes, and in remembrance of their former frenzy, upon pines or other trees were hanged up the images of virgins.</p>
