            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS <hi>HUMBLY OFFERD</hi> VVHY THE NAME OF WILLIAM LENTHALL Should be Left Out of the EXCEPTION in the ACT of OBLIVION.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THere is no action of mine that exprest me at any time averse to the King, and his affaires; for many years since I was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently prosecuted before a Committee of Parliament for sending money to his Majesty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and for suffering both Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Intelligence to pass to him by my Authority. This was so violently pursued against me, that when the Committee could not make it against me, the Council of War appointed a Committee of theirs, and I was prosecuted by Col. <hi>Venables,</hi> and one Col. <hi>Cook.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Her Majesty being near the time of Her lying in, could not obtain licence from hence for conveniences for her use; and by my power and by a servant of my own, I conveyed to Her all things necessary for that occasion, which Her Majesty was pleas'd to take particular notice of. And for this I was also accus'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I was not wanting in the duty I owed to His Majesties Children, the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that were here, and that there was no opportunity, but I made it my care to get necessaries and conveniences for them; and this will be testified by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall that attended them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There could be no Person more desir'd and endeavoured his Majesties honour and happiness then my self, and in order thereto advised some of the Commissioners that attended the Treaty, to labour all that could possibly be done to effect that; and that His Majesty should make no reliance on the Army, for they would deceive him. And this I signified in a Letter to the Speaker of the now-House of Commons.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That at all times when any thing came to my single Vote (and then onely I could expresse my Opinion) I never consented to any violent action, but rather shewed my dislike to any such thing, or any proceeding that was not regular.</p>
            <p n="6">6. How it was my labour (and not in vain) to break the Army, and to divide the Soldiers from the Officers, which I effected, in such a time, when if the other party had got the better, I must have suffer'd both in my Life and Fortune.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I gave and held Intelligence with my Lord Generall, by Letters from hence when he was in <hi>Scotland</hi> and at <hi>Berwick,</hi> and got privately such Officers conveyed to him as he wanted there.</p>
            <p n="8">8. My refusing to take the Oath of Abjuration, which if I had not particularly at that time discountenanced, it had been taken by a great part of the Army and many others, which would have engaged men to be more desperate in their resistances to His Majesty.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I did not onely refuse to sign any new Writs, but absolutely obstructed the going out of any to fill up that House, which if it had been done, had answer'd the desires and expectations of most; and would have so setled mens minds, that I do think it might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented His Majesties comming in, and continued the Nation under a form of Government, diametrically opposite to His Majesties.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the often attendancies I have made on his Excellency, to give him my humble advice for the speedy bringing in of His Majesty, and this when it was not publiquely known that there would be any such thing: And it was also the result of many pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>te advices that I had with divers persons that agitated His Majesties comming to His Dominions.</p>
            <p>There are onely two things objected against me: The one is, My going to the Army; The other is, My sitting in the House.</p>
            <p>To the first, I doe protest in the presence of God, I did think at that time the Army did intend the bringing in of His Majesty, and the settlement of the Kingdome, and that deceived me.</p>
            <p>For the other, I doe acknowledge my weaknesse; and yet even in that I was led to it with a thought that I might doe a great deal of good, and prevent all persons interest from running into a confusion, which I much laboured, and prevented many inconveniences. And this I can say, that in all this time I have countenanced a learned Ministery, and alwayes heard such, whose opinions were for the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King and the Church.</p>
