         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the meaneſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>REader, when I conſidered long
with my ſelf, what happy times it
had pleaſed God to let us injoy;
I mean theſe happy times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
in which men have liberty to
diſcover truths, and to reaſon what may
moſt tend to the good of the Common-wealth;
And in which we have ſo many
Patrons, Protectors, and advancers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
that, which is the onely ſupporter of
all Common-wealths and Governments
whatſoever. And when I had further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
that ſomewhat, nay I may ſay, as
much as the preſent extremities will permit,
had been done by our Parliament for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and amendment, or total expunging
of ſome ill Laws; and much more indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
which I doubt not will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
in due time. I thought it my
duty to caſt my mite into this Treaſury;
and to declare and ſet forth ſomethings of
our Law worthy of ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and (if I miſtake not) of reformation
too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115195:4"/>
That which I offer is againſt ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
practiſes or proceedings, and againſt
ſome principles of our Law; And here I
know it will be ſaid to me, that <hi>Contra ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantem
Principia non eſt diſputandum;</hi> they
are of ſo high a nature they ought not to be
diſcuſſed; eſpecially having been ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
uncontrolled Laws in all ages.</p>
            <p>To this firſt I ſay, that a common error
cannot make a Law, no more than cuſtom
againſt reaſon; there is no building of a
Law where reaſon is not the foundation.
And therefore I hope, that if all, or any
of thoſe things which I have offered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
ſhall be found light in that bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
that they will find no allowance or
approbation.</p>
            <p>But here ſome will ſay to me, as my Lord
<hi>Cook</hi> ſaith upon the like occaſion, <hi>Qui ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
in omnibus quaerit, rationem confundit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom I ſay, that this may hold well
in ſome things, and in ſome Arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
but, under favour, it ought not to
be ſo in Law; Law, if it be juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
binds men to obedience and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
thereunto, but it is unjuſt and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
and obliges not to ſubmiſſion, if it
be unreaſonable; and that Law muſt needs
be ſuſpected to be ſuch, the reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
muſt not be inquired into.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115195:4"/>
And <hi>Littleton</hi> fol. 89. ſaith, that <hi>per ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones
pervenitur ad legitimam rationem,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
is the way to find out the legall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
and ſo likewiſe it is to diſcover the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtneſs
or oppoſition of any Law to the
common good.</p>
            <p>We have one rule in Law, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
good and wel-fare is to be preferred
before the private, and certainly that Law
that croſſes that rule, is a very unjuſt and
unequal Law.</p>
            <p>All Laws ought to have this for their
Baſis, and their onely end and aim, the
common good and ſafety. And that Law
is moſt rational, which looks moſt that way.</p>
            <p>And therefore certainly it is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
of reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it to its perfection, to lay the Law
to this line, to put it to this Tryal; whether
ſuch or ſuch a Law, be moſt for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
good and wel-fare, or not? if it be,
to continue it, if not, to abrogate and
null it.</p>
            <p>We have another rule, that <hi>Intereſt Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae
ut ſit finis litium.</hi> And I am certain,
that you will find ſome of thoſe things,
which I have offered to conſideration,
(that, as it much concerns the Common-wealth,
that ſtrifes and controverſies be
ended, that peace and unity may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:)
<pb facs="tcp:115195:5"/>
much tending to that end, and
agreeable with that rule. And certainly
that Law, which moſt avoids and provides
againſt contentious Suits, and moſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
the ſupport of peace and quiet in a
Common-wealth, is the beſt and moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Law.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, Reader, I know
that by this ſmall work I ſhall contract the
odium and ill will of many of my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
who will caſt in my Teeth, that this
is a bewraying of my own neſt; and a ſling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dirt into the faces of our great and
learned Sages of the Law; or rather into
my Mothers face, whoſe milk I have ſuckt,
and by whom I have been educated, and
brought up to ſome ſmall underſtanding
thereof.</p>
            <p>To ſuch I ſhall ſay; that none more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
the Law than my ſelf, which I take
in the general, to be as juſt and as perfect as
any humane Law in the World, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Judge it ſo abſolutely perfect, as to
have no fault or blemiſh in it, for that were
to attribute abſolute and infallible perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in judgement to the makers; which
we know is not to be found on earth in any
humane race. You know what the Apoſtle
ſaith, the firſt of the <hi>Cor. 13. 9. for we know
in part, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115195:5"/>
And if we know but it part, certainly
our actions muſt needs be full of imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>And I hope none will judge me to love
my Studdy the leſs, becauſe I deſire to keep
it clean; Gold is the purer for being refined:
And the Tree grows the better for pruning,
and cutting off the exuberant and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
branches, which ſuck the ſap from the
body, and are uſeleſs for any thing, but the
fire themſelves.</p>
            <p>If we have any hard and unreaſonable
branches of Law, it is juſt to take them
away, to lop them off, the body of the
Common-wealth will thrive the better; and
if that flouriſh, certainly Lawyers muſt
thrive too, and be in as great reputation
as ever. For no living without Law, and
no better or more juſt Law in the generall
in the World, than the Municipal Law of
<hi>England;</hi> he approves the uſe, that labours to
take away the abuſe.</p>
            <p>Nor am I ſingle or alone in this indeavour
of mine; ſome have gone before me, and I
doubt not others will follow, in a work of
ſo great conſequence, and tending ſo much
to the common good.</p>
            <p>But not to hold you too long in an Epiſtle,
where the work is but ſhort, if any not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
what I have ſaid, ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

The Common-Wealths

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Firſt thing that I have
purpoſed to diſciſſe or
treat of, is touching him
that is ſeized of Lands in
Fee-ſimple, and his diſpoſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and therein I ſhall onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
this ſhort Queſtion, that is;</p>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether it be reaſonable, that he who
is ſeized of Lands in Fee-ſimple, to
him and his Heirs, by deſcent, or
gift, ſhould have the abſolute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115195:9"/>
power of the whole, and to
diſinherit his Heirs.</head>
               <p>I Do acknowledge the Law to be,
that he may diſpoſe of the whole
at his pleaſure, and that a condition
annexed to reſtrain him from it, is
nought. For it is againſt the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
purity of a Fee-ſimple, that
he ſhould not have power to alien it.
<hi>Litt. Sect.</hi> 360. for if ſuch condition
ſhould be good ſaith <hi>Litt.</hi> then it ouſts
him of all the power which the Law
gave him, which ſhould be againſt
reaſon, and therefore the condition is
void. But if the condition were ſuch,
that the Feoffee ſhall not alien to
ſuch a one, naming his name, or to
any of his Heirs, or of the iſſues of
ſuch a one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the like, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
do not take away all the powr
of alienation, ſuch condition is good.
Another reaſon that ſuch condition
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115195:9"/>
is nought, is, becauſe that he, who
hath departed with all his Eſtate to
another, and hath no hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter,
may not in reaſon annex ſuch
a condition to reſtrain the Feoffee or
alienee from ſuch alienation.</p>
               <p>This I allow to be the Law; yet I
beſeech you give but leave to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
theſe things according to right
reaſon, and judge according to that
which may make moſt for the good
of the Common-wealth, and then I
conceive it will be thought very
hard, that any man ſhould have an
abſolute diſpoſing power of the
whole, and diſinherit his Heirs.</p>
               <p>I intend this onely of a Fee-ſimple
deſcended from an Anceſtor to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or of a gift to a man and his
Heirs; for in caſe where a man,
through his own labour and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
hath purchaſed ſuch an inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
it ſeems more reaſonable for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115195:10"/>
him to have the abſolute diſpoſal of
it as he ſhall think fit; for I know no
reaſon, but that he who bought, may
ſell; but where Land deſcended to
me, or was given to me and my
Heirs, in ſuch caſe, for me to rob
my Heir of all that I never laboured
for, and to give it to a ſtranger, ſeems
to me unreaſonable.</p>
               <p>I ſay, that he ſhould have an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
diſpoſing power of the whole,
ſeems unreaſonable, but that he
ſhould have power to diſpoſe 2 parts
ſeems to ſtand with reaſon, ſo he
leave the third part to deſcend; for
otherwiſe he ſhall be utterly unable
to make a joyncture for his wife, to
advance his children in marriage, or
to pay his debts; all which, a man is
bound in conſcience to do: therefore
it were very unreaſonable that he
ſhould be ſo fettered and bound in
his Eſtate, that he were not able to
perform them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115195:10"/>
I am not ignorant, that when I
give Lands to a man &amp; his Heirs, the
Law ſaith, that the word [Heirs] is
by way of limitation, not of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe;
yet when an Eſtate ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends,
or is given as aforeſaid, the
Heir by the intention of the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
and the donor, ought to have an
Eſtate in point of intereſt, as alſo in
conſcience, after the death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For if a man ſhould demand
of ſuch a one who intends to leave
his Lands to deſcend to an Heir, or
of the donor, whether he intended
that his Heir, or the donor ſhould
ſell or give away the Eſtate ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
or come, through their
goodneſs, care, and providence, to a
ſtranger, I know their anſwer would
be, that they intended not a diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of the Heir, but that the Eſtate
ſhould deſcend &amp; go to their Heirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with the ſame freedom it deſcended
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115195:11"/>
or came to them; but I would not
be-miſtaken, for I intend onely a
third part to deſcend, for the reaſon
aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But now let us examine the reaſon
of the Law afore-ſaid; and where the
inconvenience lies. The reaſon is,
that 'tis againſt the purity and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs
of a Fee-ſimple, not to have
ſuch diſpoſing power; where lies the
inconvenience, that it is againſt a
Maxim of Law; nothing of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
either to the publick, or to any
private or particular perſon.</p>
               <p>And then examine the reaſon of the
other ſide, why ſuch a Tenant in
Fee-ſimple ſhould have power onely
to diſpoſe of two parts, and leave
the third to deſcend to his Heir: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
it would agree with the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Anceſtor, and likewiſe
prevent the beggering of the Heir, a
thing too common with profuſe and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115195:11"/>
prodigal Anceſtors in theſe daies.
So that I conceive it is evident to
you, that the inconvenience lies on
this ſide, and whether it is better to
continue a Maxim without reaſon;
or to alter it upon good grounds, I
leave to the conſideration of our
Sages; and of this onely thus much;
the next thing I have to treat of is,
common Recoveries; concerning
which I ſhall propound this ſhort
caſe and queſtion.</p>

               <head>Tenant in tail, with remainders over,
ſuffers a common Recovery, whether
this in Law, or conſcience, ought to
bind the iſſue in tail, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
over?</head>
               <p>IT is true, that through cuſtom
and long continuance, this is now
become the common aſſurance of
the Land; and I am not ignorant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115195:12"/>
that this point received a full reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the other Judges in <hi>Marie
Portingtons</hi> caſe, in my Lord <hi>Cooks</hi>
tenth Book, that ſuch Recovery was
good and binding, not onely to
the iſſue in tail, but thoſe in remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
likewiſe. Yet I hope a man may
now with freedom diſpute it, ſince
all conſcionable honeſt men, that
ever I met with, oppoſe it; and I
dare ſay, that policy and private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
firſt made this conveyance
Lawfull, or at leaſt to ſeem ſo. And
being that in the diſcourſe of this
caſe, it will be neceſſarie to know
what the Law was before the <hi>Stat.</hi>
of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. of intails, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchief
of that Law, which cauſed the
making of that <hi>Stat.</hi> for a remedy;
it will not be amiſs if I cite the <hi>Stat.</hi>
wherein we ſhall find both the one
and the other; the miſchief, and the
remedy; and then it will be eaſie to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115195:12"/>
judge whether the miſchief againſt
which the <hi>Act</hi> of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
doth not ſtill continue by

the remedy.</p>
               <p>But before I cite the <hi>Stat.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but put you in mind, that it
hath been deſired and propoſed by
ſome in Print (who either never read
the ſaid <hi>Stat.</hi> or did not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it) that the ſaid <hi>Stat.</hi> might
be taken away; the miſchief at the
common Law revived, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
ſuppreſſed. All that I ſhall
ſay to ſuch, is, that that Law (if we
will believe our Judges and Sages of
the Law) was made by very Sage
and wiſe men; &amp; therefore we ought
to judge it to be made upon very
good grounds and reaſons, and ſo
not to be repealed without better
reaſon; but I need ſay no more, for
I doubt not you will find upon the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115195:13"/>
reading of it, that it was made upon
ſolid and profound reaſon, and ſo
not to be altered upon any Clarks

               <p>FIrſt concerning Lands, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times are given upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is to wit, where any giveth
his Land to any Man and his Wife,
and to the Heirs begotten of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the ſame Man and his Wife,
with ſuch condition expreſſed, that
if the ſame Man and his wife die
without Heirs of their bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them begotten, the Land ſo
given ſhould revert to the giver or
his Heir. In caſe alſo where one gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Lands in free marriage, which

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115195:13"/>
though it be not expreſſed in the
deed of gift, which is this, That if

Land ſo given ſhall revert to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
or his Heir. In caſe alſo where
one giveth Land to another, and the
Heirs of his body iſſuing, it ſeemed
very hard, and yet ſeemeth to the
givers and their Heirs, that their
Will being expreſſed in the gift, was
not heretofore, nor yet is obſerved.</p>
               <p>In all the caſes aforeſaid, after iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
begotten and born between them
(to whom the Lands were given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch condition) heretofore ſuch
Feoffees had power to alien the
Land ſo given, and to diſherit their
iſſue of the Land, <hi>contrary to the
minds of the givers, and contrary to
the form expreſſed in the gift.</hi> And
further, when the iſſue of ſuch Feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffee
is failing, the Land ſo given,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115195:14"/>
ought to return to the giver, or his
Heir, by force of the gift expreſſed
in the deed, though the iſſue (if
any were) had died: yet by the deed
and Feoffement of them (to whom
Land was ſo given upon condition)
the donors have heretofore been
barred of their reverſion, which was
directly repugnant to the form of
the gift.</p>
               <p>Wherefore our Lord the King,
perceiving how neceſſary and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
it ſhould be to provide reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the foreſaid caſes, hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
<hi>That the will of the giver,
according to the form in the deed of
gift manifeſtly expreſſed, ſhall be
from henceforth obſerved:</hi> So that
they, to whom the land was given
under ſuch condition, ſhall have
no power to alien the land ſo given,
but that it ſhall remain unto the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
of them to whom it was given
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115195:14"/>
after their death, or ſhall revert un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the giver, or his Heirs, if iſſue
fail (whereas there is no iſſue at all)
or if any iſſue be, and fail by death,
or Heir of the body of ſuch iſſue
failing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if a Fine be levied hereafter
upon ſuch Lands, it ſhall be void
in the Law, and no claim needs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I have faithfully cited you
the <hi>Stat.</hi> word for word; and what
the common Law was before the
making of this <hi>Stat.</hi> is apparent.
Eſtates now by force of that <hi>Stat.</hi>
called intails were at the common
Law Fee-ſimple conditional. So
that a man having ſuch an Eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this <hi>Stat.</hi> had power after iſſue
had, to alien, and by that to barre the
iſſue, and likewiſe him in reverſion,
and this is ſaid by the <hi>Stat.</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be contrarie to the minds of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115195:15"/>
givers, and contrary to the form ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the gift, and this was the
great miſchief at the common Law.</p>
               <p>Then comes this <hi>Stat.</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
againſt the ſaid miſchief, that
the Will of the donor ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
and that ſuch donees in tail
ſhall have no power to alien to barre
their iſſues, or him in reverſion.</p>
               <p>Now certainly the beſt way of
Argument is upon the Law it ſelf,
and that is pregnant and plain, that
the donee after this <hi>Stat.</hi> had no
power to alien to barre his iſſue, or
him in reverſion.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you to what end
was this <hi>Stat.</hi> if notwithſtanding a
donee in tail might by a Recovery
barre his iſſue and him in reverſion;
certainly had any ſuch thing been
known then, as a Recovery, it
would have been provided againſt
as well as a fine, or otherwiſe a man
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115195:15"/>
might well queſtion the wiſdom of
the makers of the Law, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they have received ſo great
an applauſe by our Sages of the
Law.</p>
               <p>The Law hates vain and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
things; and had Recoveries
been known then, and not provided
againſt, certainly no Law could be
more vain and unprofitable.</p>
               <p>But now to come to <hi>Marie Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingtons</hi>
caſe in <hi>Cooks</hi> tenth Book,
where this caſe is largely debated;
there you ſhall find the Original of
theſe common Recoveries. There
by thoſe that argued againſt them,
'tis ſaid that 't was not invented till
12. <hi>E. 4. Taltarum</hi>'s caſe, that ſuch
Recoveries ſhould bind the Eſtate
tail upon a pretence of a fained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.</p>
               <p>To which it was ſaid by the
Court upon judgement given, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115195:16"/>
judgement given againſt Tenant in
tail, with voucher and recompence
in value, ſhall bind the Eſtate tail,
notwithſtanding the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> of 13.
<hi>E.</hi> 1. be the Recovery upon good
Title, or not; and that the judgement
given in ſuch caſe for the Tenant in
tail to have in value binds the Eſtate
tail, though that no recompence be
had.</p>
               <p>And this they ſay was Law in <hi>E.</hi> 3.
time, for which they cite theſe Books
(but here obſerve by the way, that
thoſe Recoveries were not invented
before that time, as themſelves do
agree, and of what validity ſuch new
invention can be againſt a <hi>Stat.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
againſt any alienation in ſuch
caſe, let any rational man judge.)
but for the caſes they have cited, 15.
<hi>E. 3. Tit. brief.</hi> 324. by Recovery in
value by Tenant in tail, the Eſtate tail
is barred, and he ſhall have a Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115195:16"/>
of the Land ſo recovered in
value, with which agrees 42. <hi>E.</hi> 3.
53. and 44. <hi>E. 3. 21, 22. Octavian
Lumbards</hi> caſe, Tenant in tail grants
a rent charge to one who hath right
to the Land in tail for a releaſe, it
ſhall bind the iſſue, 48. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 11. b.
<hi>Jeffrey Benchers</hi> caſe recovery in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
by Tenant in tail, ſhall bind the
tail, and a Formdon lies of the
Land recovered in value, with which
agrees. 1. <hi>E.</hi> 4. fol. 5. 5. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. 6.</p>
               <p>For theſe Books thus cited, that
ſuch recovery ſhall bind the iſſue in
tail; they are to be underſtood of a
recovery upon good Title, and of
a real, not a fained recompence, for
they all agree, that a Form-don will
lie of the Land recovered in value;
So that it cannot be intended of a
fained and pretenſed recompence. I
would fain know of any man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever he heard of any Action
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115195:17"/>
brought upon ſuch recovery in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
as recoveries are now uſed? are
they not become the common
courſe, and common way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
for to barre Eſtates in
tail, and to cut off all remainders,
without any poſſibility or expectance
of recompence in value? and do not
the Judges ſay before that it ſhall
bind be it upon good Title, or not,
and though that no recompence be
had? ſo that a pretenſed recompence
by them muſt carry away a clear
Title, and defeat the <hi>Stat.</hi> and the
intention of the donor? So that I
do conceive, notwithſtanding thoſe
Books, that ſuch recoveries ſhould
bind the Eſtate tail upon a pretence
of a fained recompence, was not till
12. <hi>E. 4. Taltarums</hi> caſe.</p>
               <p>And the caſe of <hi>Octavian Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi>
before cited agrees with this
difference, between a real, and a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115195:17"/>
fained recompence; for I do agree,
that a recovery upon good Title, and
a real recompence will barre the
Eſtate tail. The caſe of <hi>Lumbard,</hi>
that a grant of a Rent by Tenant in
tail to one that claims a right to
the Land intailed, ſhall barre the
iſſue, is, without queſtion, good Law,
for this is to preſerve the Eſtate tail,
and this is no fained but a real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence;
not ſo in our caſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſuppoſe thoſe Books
ſhould be intended (as I conceive
they cannot) of a fained recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce;
can any man ſay that any uſe or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
is good againſt a <hi>Stat.</hi> had ſuch
fained recoveries been in uſe at the
time of the making of the <hi>Stat.</hi> of
13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. which no man doth, or
can ſay, ſomewhat more might have
been ſaid for them; but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
after, it cannot be with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that they ſhould be of force to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115195:18"/>
fruſtrate, yea, and nul, upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the <hi>Stat.</hi> made before: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
(as I have ſaid before) the
makers of that Law would have
provided againſt this miſchief as
well as Fines, had ſuch recoveries
been then in being, for otherwiſe
vain and fruitleſs was that Law, as
indeed it is at this day.</p>
               <p>Again, by thoſe that argued againſt
common recoveries in <hi>Marie Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingtons</hi>
caſe; it is ſaid, that ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
are by divers <hi>Acts</hi> of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
marked and branded with
the blemiſh of fiction and falſity; as
in the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 34. <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 20. they
are ſtiled fained and untrue recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and ſo in the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 11. <hi>H. 7.
cap. 20. 32. H. 8. cap.</hi> 31. and 14. <hi>El.
cap.</hi> 8. they are named covenous,
and had by colluſion; and therefore
it ſtands with Law and reaſon to
provide for the preſervation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115195:18"/>
and remainders, againſt ſuch
fained and falſe and covenous reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</p>
               <p>To this objection, and theſe <hi>Stat.</hi>
this anſwer is given; and firſt it is
ſaid, that common recoveries is one
of the main pillars, which ſupports
the Eſtates and inheritances in the
State; That is, Reader: they muſt
unjuſtly, (becauſe contrarie to the
<hi>Stat.</hi> and the Form of the gift) take
away one mans inheritance, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
or ſettle it in another, and this
is called one of the main pillars of
inheritances.</p>
               <p>But to the <hi>Statutes;</hi> for that of
34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. it is of gifts in tail by the
King to his Servants and Subjects,
for to incourage others and their iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues,
and therefore recoveries ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by ſuch Tenants in tail, are
well taxed by Parliament to be
fained and untrue, becauſe they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115195:19"/>
did take away the intention of the
King.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, that they are
ſo termed by that <hi>Stat.</hi> not in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
onely to the defeating of the
Kings intention, but becauſe they are
ſo in themſelves fained and untrue.
Beſides are they ſo termed, becauſe
the intention of the King was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
defeated; why? where there is the
ſame reaſon, there ought to be the
ſame Law; and in this caſe, is not
the apparent intention of the donor
in his gift defeated by ſuch recovery
contrary to the <hi>Stat.</hi> which ſaith,
that the will of the donor ſhall be
obſerved.</p>
               <p>But it is further ſaid in that caſe,
that <hi>confirmat uſum qui tollit abuſum;</hi>
and that it was a barre in that caſe
before that <hi>Act</hi> of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. made to
the contrarie; certainly if it were an
abuſe in the Kings caſe, it is no other
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115195:19"/>
in a common perſons, and it were
very happy if an <hi>Act</hi> were likewiſe
made againſt them in our caſe; that
we might not have them known for
the future.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. when
a Woman advanced by the Husband
with a competent joyncture in tail
ſuffers a recovery to barre the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues,
this may well be ſaid to be by
covin.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you weigh the caſes
in the ballance of reaſon, and then
judge whether they differ or no. Is
it not as much covenous for any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in tail who takes ſuch Eſtate to
him and his iſſues to disherit his
iſſues by ſuch recovery, contrarie to
the ſaid <hi>Stat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 34.
<hi>El.</hi> of a common recovery againſt
Tenant for life; it may well be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
covenous and by colluſion. To
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115195:20"/>
this I ſhall ſay no more but this, that
certainly in our caſe there is as much
of injuſtice, covin and colluſion by
ſuffering ſuch common recoveries,
as in any of the former.</p>
               <p>Further it was ſaid by thoſe that
argued againſt theſe recoveries; That
that opinion, that a common reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
could not be reſtrained by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or limitation, was new and of
late invention, and never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sir <hi>Anthony Mildmayes</hi> caſe 6.
<hi>Rep.</hi> fol. 40. for it was admitted to
be reſtrained in the caſe of the Earl
of <hi>Arundell</hi> 17. El. <hi>Dyer,</hi> fol. 342.
343. and in the argument of <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasticas</hi>
caſe, 12. E. <hi>Com.</hi> 403. the
ſaid point of reſtraint of a common
recovery was never moved: here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
Reader, another new inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that theſe recoveries cannot be
reſtrained by any condition or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
ſo that there muſt be ſuch a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115195:20"/>
power given to ſupport theſe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
though againſt the Letter
of the <hi>Stat.</hi> and the Will of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
that no humane invention can
prevent.</p>
               <p>As to the Earl of <hi>Arundels</hi> caſe,
it is ſaid that nothing is ſpoken to it
by thoſe who argued the caſe, and
ſo no Authority. To this I ſay, that
certainly had the Law been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be ſuch, that ſuch recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
could not be reſtrained by condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it would have been then urged,
which rather concludes on this
part.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Scholaſticas</hi> caſe, all that my
Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſayeth, is this, he much
reſpects the reporter, and attributes
due honour and reverence to the
Judges, but <hi>amicus Plato, amicus
Socrates, ſed magis amica veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi>
Though that it was not then
thought on by the learned men of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115195:21"/>
that time, yet my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> will
have it to be Law, and prefers his
opinion, which he calls truth, which
truth ſo called appears to be onely a
new invention, before the contrarie
ſuppoſed Law of that time.</p>
               <p>And it is further ſaid in <hi>Porting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
caſe, that none ought to be heard
to diſpute againſt the legal pillars of
common aſſurances of Lands, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances
of the Subjects. And it
is likewiſe ſaid, that at a Parliament
holden in the raign of <hi>Q. E.</hi> in <hi>Vernon</hi>
and <hi>Herberts</hi> caſe debated before the
Lords of Parliament, <hi>Hoord</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
with <hi>Vernon</hi> invaied againſt theſe
recoveries; who was then reproved
by <hi>Dyer, Ch. Juſt.</hi> of the common
pleas, who ſaid, that he was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be of the profeſſion of the
Law, who durſt ſpeak againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
recoveries, which were the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
of the aſſurances of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115195:21"/>
and founded upon great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Authority; <hi>ſed non omnis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
hoc verbum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this you may eaſily judge
what moſt ſupported this aſſurance:
for if Lawyers muſt be ſilenced, it is
no wonder if common recoveries
paſs for Law. I know I ſhall not
paſs uncenſured, as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Hoords</hi> caſe will be mine, with
advantage: but it ſhall not at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
my reſt; for having truth of
my ſide, I care not who is againſt
me: and certainly that Councellor
that is a Councellor of the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the ſharpeſt reproof; and ſince
<hi>non omnis capit hoc verbum,</hi> as is
ſaid before, let me not be rebuked
without reaſon; and if any one can
convince me in that, I ſhall with all
humility ſubmit to his judgement.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is ſaid that <hi>D. 8. lib. 1.
cap.</hi> 26. approves common recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115195:22"/>
to bind as well in conſcience, as
in Law.</p>
               <p>For my part I conceive that the
better opinion there is againſt them;
and ſo I believe any man will judge
that ſhall read the Chapter, I ſhall
faithfully recite the diſputes and
leave it to judgement, and therein
firſt the manner and practiſe of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
ſuch recoveries; The Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
ſhall ſuppoſe in his Writ and
Declaration, that the Tenant in tail
hath no Entry but by ſuch a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
where neither the Demandant nor the ſaid ſtranger never had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the Land, whereupon the
Tenant in tail ſhall appear, and by
aſſent of the parties ſhall vouch the
common Vouchee, whom he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to have nothing to yield in value
(now Reader judge whether this be
not a meer fiction of a recompence in
value,) and the Vouchee ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115195:22"/>
and the Demandant ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
againſt him, whereupon he
ſhall take day to imparle in the ſame
Term, and at the day by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the parties he ſhall make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault,
upon which becauſe it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
in deſpite of the Court, the
Demandant ſhall have judgement to
recover againſt the Tenant in tail, &amp;
he over in value againſt the Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee:
And this judgement and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
in value is taken for a barre of
the tail for ever by reaſon of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence;
for by preſumption the
Vouchee may purchaſe Lands. Thus
you have the practiſe of a common
recovery, which is nothing elſe but
an invention to cut off intails, which
hath been the ruin of many a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>But it is reaſoned, that although
ſuch recoveries, in reſpect of the
multitude of them, be ſpared, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115195:23"/>
they ſtand not with conſcience: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

which is ordained by the Law, may
be adnulled by the Law, there is not
here like Authority for the one, as
for the other, for the tail is created
by Authority of Parliament the
moſt High Court in the Realm, and
the diſanulling thereof is by a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
recovery upon falſe ſuppoſals,
(here you have trueth clothed in
plain Language.)</p>
               <p>Then as to another objection, <hi>viz.
Communis error facit jus,</hi> that is to be
underſtood that a cuſtom uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Law of Man in ſome
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115195:23"/>
Countrey ſhall be taken for a Law,
if the inhabitants be ſuffered ſo to
continue it; but theſe recoveries, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have been long uſed,
have alwayes been ſpoken againſt
(Reader, obſerve that, who ever thou
art; and then I am ſure I cannot juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be blamed: nor need I care to
write againſt that, which hath been
always ſpoken againſt.) Alſo this
cuſtom could have no Lawfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and an evil cuſtom is to be
aboliſhed: Alſo a preſcription againſt
a <hi>Stat.</hi> is void: And it is alſo moved,
that in as much as there is no exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
recompence that the Law
hath been taken, that the Heir in
tail is not barred of his Formdon,
and although the Vouchee may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
after the iſſue hath recontinued
his own Land, that herein is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience;
for that the iſſue ſhall
be barred of the recompence in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115195:24"/>
in that he hath recontinued his
own land again, and ſo ſhall not
have both.</p>
               <p>I dare not go ſo far as to allow a
Formdon for the iſſue in ſuch caſe
(though enough hath been ſaid to
make that good too) by reaſon of
the many inconveniences that muſt
of neceſſity fall thereupon, but it
were happy (as I have ſaid before)
if ſuch covenous and fained recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were taken away by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected; that you
would have Tenant in Fee-ſimple to
have power to diſpoſe two parts,
for the reaſons and intents aforeſaid;
and why may not Tenant in tail have
the ſame power?</p>
               <p>To which I give this ſhort an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that it is agreeable with the
nature of a Fee-ſimple to be aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115195:24"/>
not ſo in caſe of an Eſtate tail,
for that is contrarie to the Form of
the gift, as the <hi>Stat.</hi> is expreſly; and
there is no power given by that <hi>Stat.</hi>
to the Donee in tail to diſpoſe of
the Eſtate in any caſe whatſoever;
and therefore he may not for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of his relations, or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of his debts, defeat his iſſue,
or in default of iſſue, thoſe in the
remainder, by alienation, contrarie
to the Form of the gift, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the donor.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall conclude this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
with a rule or two in Law, and
firſt the <hi>Stat.</hi> ſaid that the Will of the
donor muſt be obſerved in his gift,
which ſtands with the reaſon and
rule of the Law, for <hi>Cujus eſt dare
ejus eſt diſponere;</hi> a man muſt take
the gift with thoſe qualifications,
conditions, or limitations, that the
donor is pleaſed to annex to it, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115195:25"/>
cannot alter it, if ſo, what becomes
of common recoveries? or how in
Law or reaſon can the donee in tail
diſherit his iſſues; <hi>Note,</hi> much leſs
ſtrangers in remainder: as if land be
given to <hi>A.</hi> in tail, the remainder to
<hi>B.</hi> in tail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if <hi>A.</hi> ſuffers a recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
this not onely binds his iſſue, but
him in remainder likewiſe, which is
extream hard and unreaſonable, that
the Law contrary to the rules of
Law it ſelf, ſhould allow a ſtranger
to do an <hi>Act</hi> to my prejudice, for the
rule is, that <hi>Res inter alios actae alteri
nocere non debent,</hi> other mens actions
ought not to prejudiee a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
how then can that ſtand with
this rule of Law, that Tenant in tail
ſhould have powr to barre him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
by a recovery. Another rule
is, <hi>Quod noſtrum eſt ſine facto vel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu
noſtro amitti, ſeu ad alium tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferri
non poteſt,</hi> we cannot loſe what
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115195:25"/>
is ours, nor can it be given from us
without our own <hi>Act</hi> or default, how
then can it ſtand with this rule, that
he in remainder ſhould be barred by
ſuch recoverie as aforeſaid? I ſhall
ſay no more, but wait the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
leaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I doubt not, but
this will in due time be altered.</p>
               <p>The next thing I am to treate of,
is concerning the impriſonment of
mens perſons for debt, and in that I
ſhall propoſe this ſhort queſtion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether it be conſonant to reaſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
or for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
to Arreſt mens Perſons,
and to detain them in Priſon for
Debt?</head>
               <p>I Know this is a caſe in which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men have vented their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in publick, and it hath not
been without a ſolemn debate too in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115195:26"/>
the Parliament; ſo that there is the
leſs for me to do, and therefore I
ſhall be but ſhort in it.</p>
               <p>What reaſons induced the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to continue this Law, I know
not, nor is it for me to examine; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I beſeech you, let it not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
amiſs that I offer my reaſons in
it, and leave them to better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place I ſhall examine
what the old Law was, and when,
and how this Law of impriſonment
of perſons for debt crept in; for it
hath not been always uſed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and I may ſay in few other
places of the World; and where it is
in uſe, there is care taken that they
do not periſh in priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for want of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
ſuſtenance, but they and their
families to be maintained out of their
own Eſtates; and if they have none,
the perverſe and cruel Creditor is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115195:26"/>
to maintain them out of his proper
Eſtate; and not to ſuffer them to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
for want of food, as they do
commonly in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The body of the Defendant was
not lyable to execution for debt at
Common Law, for which ſee 13. <hi>H.</hi>
4. 1. But his Goods, Chattels, and
Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> or <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vari
facias</hi> within the year, and by
the <hi>Stat.</hi> of <hi>W.</hi> 2. by <hi>Scire facias</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the year, and by <hi>W. 2. cap.</hi> 18. an
<hi>Elegit</hi> was given of the moyety of
the Land; which was the firſt <hi>Act</hi>
which ſubjected Land to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a judgement.</p>
               <p>But the Common Law which is
the preſerver of the Common Peace
of the Land, abhorres all force, as
the capital Enemy to it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
againſt thoſe who committed
any force, the Common Law ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
their bodies to impriſonment,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115195:27"/>
which is the higheſt execution, by
which they loſe their Liberty, till
they had made an agreement with
the party, and Fine to the King.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is a rule in Law,
that in all actions <hi>Quare vi &amp; armis,</hi>
a <hi>Capias</hi> lies, and where a <hi>Capias</hi> lies
in proceſs, there after judgement, a
<hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> lies; and
there the King ſhall have a <hi>Capias
pro fine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then by the <hi>Stat.</hi> of <hi>Marlebridge</hi>
23. and <hi>W. 2. cap. 11. Capias</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in an account, for at common
Law, the proceſs in an account was
diſtreſs infinite, and after by the <hi>Stat.</hi>
of 25. <hi>E. 3. cap.</hi> 7. the like proces
was given in debt, as in account, for
before this <hi>Stat.</hi> the body of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
was not liable to execution,
for the reaſon and cauſe aforeſaid, all
which you ſhall find in my Lord
<hi>Cooks</hi> 3. Book, Sir <hi>William Harberts</hi>
caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:115195:27"/>
Here you ſee the Original of the
arreſting of mens bodies, and taking
of them in execution for debt; which
was by force of thoſe few but rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
diſtructive words in 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3.
like proces in debt as in account;
theſe few words have ruined many,
and almoſt numberleſs perſons and
Families; who, had they not been
cloyſterd up in Priſons, might have
lived to have got Eſtates, and to
have been able to diſcharge a good
conſcience in ſatisfaction of their
debts, and providing for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
               <p>For the proces by way of <hi>Capias,</hi>
or attaching of the perſon for debt, I
know it will be ſaid to me, if you
will have that courſe taken away,
what other will you provide conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for gaining of our debts? To
this I anſwer, that that which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
moſt convenient in reaſon, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115195:28"/>
which hath been already propoſed
to the Parliament, is by way of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as the Original in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Pleas is; and upon that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if no
appearance be, to have liberty to
proceed with all vigour, and to have
a judgement againſt the Defendant
for not appearing, as if he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and judgement had been
thereupon obtained againſt him.
Onely this I muſt obſerve, that it
is of neceſſity, that the ſervice of
the Summons be ſworn to, (as it is
in caſe of a <hi>Subpoena</hi> in the <hi>Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>)
before there be any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
otherwiſe, any man living
may be abuſed, and extreamly ſuffer
by the ſeiſure of his Eſtate upon exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
he having had no notice by
way of Summons of the ſaid action.
And this great advantage to the
Common-wealth there will be by
the way of Summons, that it will
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115195:28"/>
deſtroy all priviledged places, for a
Summons may be ſerved, where
there durſt not be an arreſt; So that
then there will be no protection of
men againſt their Creditours, but
that ſuch as have Eſtates, ſhall, as in
conſcience they are bound, pay their
debts, and not conſume them in a
corner, under the guard of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
               <p>The next thing, after the proces,
and judgement, that is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of is, what execution is moſt
juſt and reaſonable, and moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to conſcience, and the good of
the Common-wealth in ſuch caſe?
In this we muſt conſider what the
ſcope, aim or end of the Law is in
ſuch execution; and that is, the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the debt. Then the next
queſtion is, which is the moſt juſt
and probable way to attain to this
end? whether the taking of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115195:29"/>
or the Eſtate? To this I anſwer,
that certainly the neareſt, beſt, and
moſt conſcionable and rational way
to attain to that end, yea and moſt
equal too, is by ſeizing of the Eſtate.</p>
               <p>The moſt equal it is certainly, and
our Law much delights in equalities;
for it is not equal juſtice that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
(which is ſaid in Law to be the
higheſt execution, and ſo without
doubt it is, and much more to be
valued then all Worldly goods)
ſhould be captivated and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for any Worldly pelf, or ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whatſoever, body for body, and
Eſtate for Eſtate, is the moſt equal
way of juſtice in the World.</p>
               <p>And it is the moſt rational, the
readieſt and beſt way for to get a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the debt, and it is that
which muſt pay it at laſt, if ever it
be paid; for this is but a ſlender ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the debt. And this great
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115195:29"/>
inconvenience he lies under that
takes the body in execution, that he
cannot, after he hath determined his
Election by this way of execution,
during his life, take hold of his Eſtate
too. And heretofore it was a great
queſtion, whether if the party died
in execution, it were not a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the debt; and though there
were much variety of opinion in it,
yet certainly the beſt was, that it was
a ſatisfaction, ſo that the plaintiffe
could not reſort afterwards to, or
take out execution upon the Eſtate;
and for my part, I think it was the
moſt juſt Law, that he, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the body could ſatisfie,
ſhould have no other ſatisfaction,
this occaſioned the making of the
<hi>Stat.</hi> of 21. of King <hi>James;</hi> which
provides remedy againſt the Eſtate,
notwithſtanding the perſons dying
in execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:115195:30"/>
But I ſay, having thus determined
his Election by taking the body in
execution, he is upon this great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
that the debtors Eſtate
is free, and that which he would not
take to ſatisfie his debt, happens for
the moſt part to be waſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
in priſon. 'Tis frequent, that
a wilfull creditor finds as ſtubborn a
debtor; and ſince nothing will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him but the body, he muſt take
that for ſatisfaction; ſo that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
contrarie to reaſon and
common policie.</p>
               <p>'Tis likewiſe under correction, the
moſt conſcionable way too; and the
contrarie, which is the taking of the
perſon, the moſt unconſcionable,
eſpecially as it hath been practiſed in
<hi>England,</hi> for either the debtor hath
an Eſtate, or he hath none, if he hath
an Eſtate, it is all the Juſtice in the
World that that ſhould be reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115195:30"/>
for his debts; if he hath none,
what can be more unconſcionable or
unjuſt, than to keep his body in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<hi>Lex non cogit ad impoſsibilia,</hi>
the Law requires not impoſſibilities
at any mans hands, why then ſhould
one man ſo exact upon another? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
this renders a man utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of ever giving ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for
by this he is wholly deprived of all
poſſible means of diſcharging his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements.
Whereas had he his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
he may through Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon his honeſt indeavour, gain
ſufficient, not onely to ſatisfie his
debts, but to raiſe a fortune for his
poſteritie.</p>
               <p>But this will not digeſt well with
ſuch, whoſe principle is, that if
they have it not they will make dice
of their bones, (a ſaying that hath
been ever too common in this place)
that is, they ſhall ſtarve and periſh in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115195:31"/>
priſon: and whether this be not
meer and pure malice in ſuch men,
let all the World judge; and if
death ſhall thereupon follow, as too
too often God knows it doth, I ſhall
be bold to ſay, that ſuch a creditor
is as abſolute a murderer, as if he
had killed him with his own hand.
For what makes murder, but malice
prepenſed to kill: and what elſe can
that man have in his thoughts, who
reſolves his debtor ſhall rot and die
in priſon, though he knows he hath
not wherewithall to ſatisfie. To ſuch
unmercifull, pittileſs, cruel creditors,
(yea, and therein moſt cruel to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
too, had they grace to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it) I ſhall ſay no more but this,
that they cannot keep their poor cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
always in priſon, death will
at the length take pitty of them,
bring a diſcharge and open the
doors and let them out; and there
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115195:31"/>
(through their affliction, working
them to true and unfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and amendment of life) I
doubt not, ends their captivity: but
let theſe take heed, that they be not
one day caſt into that black, diſmal
and infernal Lake, from whence there
is no redemption.</p>
               <p>But I know that it will be objected
to me that debtors may conceal, or
ſecretly convey over their Eſtates to
couſen their creditours, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be diſcovered; ſo that if their
perſons may not be impriſoned, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
ſhall be wholy without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p>To this firſt I ſay, that it is a
rule in Law, that <hi>Nullum iniquum
eſt in lege praeſumendum,</hi> preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of fraude or deceite are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in Law, that is ſo juſt, that it
conceives all men to be juſt likewiſe,
till there appear ſomething to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115195:32"/>
contrarie: and why ſhould our
thoughts be otherwſe? but it is ſo,
men of corrupt lives, judge all others
like themſelves.</p>
               <p>I anſwer further, that ſuch as are
reſolved to be diſhoneſt, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
will make them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
and in ſuch caſe if you take
their perſons, you are further from
gaining of your debt than before, for
you cannot then faſten upon their
Eſtates; and let not the innocent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with the nocent, the willing and
unable, with thoſe that are able and
unwilling.</p>
               <p>Beſides, how often is impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made a meer cheat, even by
the priſoners themſelves to defraud
their creditors, they willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
themſelves to a priſon, to
preſerve their Eſtates.</p>
               <p>But it is further objected, that if
impriſonment of mens perſons for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115195:32"/>
debt ſhould be taken away, it would
be a great hinderance to trading,
which is, as it were, the ſoul of every
Common-wealth, for then men
would not dare to truſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, trading driven
upon credit ſeldom thrives; And I
may ſafely ſay, that many men, who
are now beggers, had been rich
men, had they had leſs truſt and
confidence, little profit without, is
more than great with hazard and
danger. I know no reaſon that any
man ſhould be truſted who hath not
wherewithall to pay; and certainly
men in general, then thrive beſt,
when they truſt leaſt; and for my
part, I judge that man worthy to
loſe his debt, who truſts to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a mans perſon onely.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Lex reſpicit finem,</hi> the
Law hath an eye to the end of all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115195:33"/>
actions; and as this is not the next
way to get mens debts by the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
of their creditors perſons,
(as I have ſaid, and proved before,)
So I beſeech you to conſider, who
it is that gains by it? it is certain the
creditor, ſeldom, if ever, gains his
debt the ſooner.</p>
               <p>Why, the onely gainers are, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,
Bayliffs, Serjants, Goalers and
Keepers of priſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are
they that grind the faces of the poor,
that add affliction to affliction, and
live upon the ruins of others; theſe
are the <hi>mala neceſſaria,</hi> the bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckers,
the leeches of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
evils they are, and great
ones too, I am ſure of it; but did I
ſay they were neceſſarie? I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
that word, otherwiſe, I muſt of
neceſſity approve of the Devil and
his curſed inſtruments; and Hell
and a priſon have no ſmall reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115195:33"/>
onely there is more hopes of
getting out of the one, than the
other. A ſilver key, ſo long as a
man hath it, will unlock the priſon
doors, and ſet him at liberty; but if
he ſhall make default in payment of
his rents, or other extortions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
of him, by the keeper, and
his bloud-hounds, he ſhall quickly
be hunted after, and fetched in again,
and there remain untill he hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
them; that being done, he ſhall
be reſtored to his former liberty; but
if his purſs be not of conſiderable
magnitude, it will ſoon be emptied;
and then, no longer pipe no longer
dance; the creditor ſhall be ſure then
to find him, and now nothing remains
but the body, which the creditor ſo
unwiſely made choice of, for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of his debt. This I know to
be the conſtant courſe of many
Keepers of priſons; and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115195:34"/>
of their priſoners; and whether
this be the way for creditors to get
their debts or no, let any ſenſible
underſtanding man judge.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, it hath been ſaid by
ſome, that it doth indeed ſtand with
reaſon and conſcience, that where
a man becomes unable, through the
Act, or hand of God, without any
Debauchery or default of his own,
to ſatisfie his debts, that in ſuch caſe
he ſhould not be detained in priſon;
but if through his own default, in
ſuch caſe he deſerves no mercie.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay, under favour, that
though he be ſo impoveriſhed
through his own default, it is very
hard, and to me unreaſonable, that
he ſhould ſo ſuffer; Firſt, becauſe that
this is not Gods Method or way of
dealing with poor ſinfull man, for
if God ſhould inflict the ſeverity of
his Juſtice upon us, but for one of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115195:34"/>
a thouſand ſins that we commit
againſt his Divine Majeſty, no fleſh
living could be ſaved, why ſhould
we then ſo exact one upon another,
as not to forgive one fault or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
of our Brother; are we not
required to be mercifull as our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father is mercifull? and do we
not dayly pray that God would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us our Treſpaſſes, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them their Treſpaſs againſt us?
how then dare we harbour malice in
our heart againſt our Brothers; ſince
except we truly forgive, we are not
to expect forgiveneſs? conſider with
thy ſelf how much thou art indebted
to God, and if he (as in Juſtice he
might) ſhould require that great
debt at thy hands, nay, but one of a
Million, thou muſt inevitably go to
priſon, I, to that priſon (to which
all earthly ſufferings and torments
are as nothing) from which there is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115195:35"/>
no redemption to all eternity; and
therefore forgive, as thou doſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Again, this is not the way to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the debt (which is the end of the
Law in ſuch executions) but to ruin
the party; who, had he is Liberty,
might leave his former vanities and
ill courſes, and live to be able to
make ſatisfaction of his debts; God
happily waits for thy reformation all
thy life, do thou (as in duty thou
art bound) deal ſo likewiſe with thy
Brother. I ſhall conclude all with
this one word, let us conſider thoſe
that are in bonds, as if we were in
bonds together with them.</p>
               <p>The next I have conſidered to
treat of, is the Chancery and its
power, and therein I ſhall propoſe
this ſhort queſtion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:115195:35"/>
               <head>Whether the High Court of Chancery,
as the practice is there, be not a
very great grievance, and burthen
to the Common-wealth?</head>
               <p>IT is not my purpoſe, or the ſcope
of my indeavour, to ſpeak or
write againſt a Court of Chancery,
I know there is an abſolute neceſſitie
of it. Equity ſaid <hi>D. 8. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 16.
is a right wiſeneſs that conſidereth
all the particular circumſtances of
the dead, the which alſo is temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with mercie, and ſuch an Equity
muſt be obſerved in every general
rule of the Laws of man, for <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
jus, ſumma injuria, viz.</hi> If thou
take all that the word of the Law
giveth thee, thou ſhalt ſometimes
do againſt the Law. And therefore
ſaid <hi>D. 8. cap.</hi> 18. very well; If it
were ordained by <hi>Statute</hi> that there
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115195:36"/>
ſhould be no remedy upon Equity in
Chancery, nor elſewhere, ſuch a
<hi>Statute</hi> were againſt reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and certainly ſo it were. He
approves the uſe of any thing, that
labours to take away the abuſe.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, that the Kings
of this Nation have ever had their
Court of Chancery, and their Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
or Lord Keeper of the Great
Seal; nor am I wholly unknowing of
the power and Authority of that
Court. In the Chancery, ſaith my
Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in his Juriſdiction of
Courts, there are two Courts, one
ordinarie, <hi>Coram Domino Rege in
Cancellaria,</hi> in which the Lord
Chancellor or Lord Keeper of the
Great Seal proceeds according to
the right line of the Laws and <hi>Stat.</hi>
of the Realm, <hi>Secundùm legem &amp;
conſuetudinem Angliae,</hi> and with this
Court, I purpoſe not to meddle, as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115195:36"/>
being not within the limits &amp; bounds
of my preſent diſcourſe. But the
other Court, that is extraordinary,
according to the rule of Equity, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundùm
aequum &amp; bonum;</hi> and that is
my work to treat of, and that you
may ſee the neceſſity of this Court,
it is <hi>Officina Juſtitiae,</hi> out of which
all Original Writs &amp; all Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which paſs under the great Seal
go forth, which great Seal is <hi>Clavis
Reipublicae,</hi> and for theſe ends this
Court is always open. And in this,
the Chancellor or Keeper was ſole
Judge, but he had power, if he
pleaſed, to aſſiſt himſelf with the
Judges.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall take freedom to
let you know what the ancient rule
was for this Court of Equity, which
is very good. Three things are to
be adjudged in a court of conſcience:
<hi>Covin, Accident,</hi> and breach of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:115195:37"/>
All <hi>Covins,</hi> frauds, and deceits, for
which there is no remedy by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
courſe of Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accident,</hi> as when a ſervant of an
Obliger, Morgager, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſent to
pay the Monies upon the day, and he
is robbed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> remedy is to be had
in this Court, againſt the forfeiture,
and ſo in the like caſe.</p>
               <p>The third is breach of truſt and
<hi>Confidence,</hi> of which you have plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Authorities in our Books: but
of this, this taſt onely ſhall ſuffice;
and now to come to that which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
which is the preſent practiſe
there, and therein I ſhall not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with the many great Officers and
their fees; which is a very great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
to the Common-wealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that I do believe, that they are
in a way of redreſs.</p>
               <p>But the firſt thing that I ſhall
touch upon, is the multitude of Suits
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115195:37"/>
that are there pending, ſo that it is
impoſſible (without the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were more than men) for them
to receive a convenient diſpatcht. I
do acknowledge their great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
pains in that high and
extraordinarie Judicature, for which
the Common-wealth ſtands very
much obliged to them: yet I know
as men, they cannot exceed their
ſtrength and ability.</p>
               <p>This Court hath received a great
addition, not of Juriſdiction, but
of practiſe, by taking away of the
Court of Wards, that great and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
Court; as likewiſe, by the
fall of that unneceſſarie Court of
Requeſts. So that the buſineſs of this
Court is ſo great, and doth ſo much
increaſe dayly, that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
will in a ſhort time very much
ſuffer through inevitable, not to be
prevented, delay of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115195:38"/>
Beſides; it is not unknown, that
many Suits are commenced there
upon a ſuggeſtion of Equity, meerly
falſe, on purpoſe onely to hinder or
delay the execution of Juſtice at the
Common-Law; this likewiſe much
advances the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ctice there, and is
a very great prejudice to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
by reaſon of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
and cauſleſs vexation. I hope no
man will be ſo unreaſonable as to
miſapprehend me here, or to judge,
that in any thing I have ſaid, I ſhould
lay the leaſt imputation of fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Commiſſioners, no, I do not,
I cannot, I know that all men who
have to do in that Court, do plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
partake of their Juſtice, yet
I muſt ſay, as before, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for them, through the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
multiplicity of buſineſs there,
to give a convenient diſpatch to
all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:115195:38"/>
Again, it ſeems to me, to be a
great grievance and burthen to the
Common-wealth, to have a reſort
in matter of Equity from a Court of
Law, to Chancery. We ſay in Law,
<hi>frustra fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt
per pauciora,</hi> it is vain and idle for a
man to go about, when he may find
a neerer way home. The Law loves
not circuity of action, why then
ſhould men be forced to a Court of
Equity, when the caſe is pending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judges at Law? and why
may not the matter of Equity (if
any) be determined by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuch further trouble or wheeling
about, which is no ſmall charge and
expence to the people? I know not
but that they are in ſuch caſe, the
moſt proper Chancellors; and this
will prevent a very great miſchief and
vexation to the people, which I have
ſhown before, and that is, of reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115195:39"/>
to the Chancery upon pretence of
Equity, whereas in truth, it is onely
to delay Juſtice: a thing, then which,
nothing more frequent and uſual.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is no ſtrange thing for
the Judges to make themſelves
Chancellors too, for I have known
this caſe frequently in practice, that
the Judges, in debt upon a penal
Bond, have, upon a motion, forced
the plantiffe to accept of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
with coſts and damages, and I
am ſure, the penalty in ſtrictneſs of
Law being forfeited, this is judging
and determining according to Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and why they may not do it as
well in other caſes, I underſtand not
further, as I have ſaid before: The
Chancellor may call the Judges to
his aſſiſtance, and peradventure he
will call thoſe (as is moſt proper)
before whom the caſe was pending
at Law: is not this then a ſtrange
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115195:39"/>
circuitie of action? why might not
the matter of Equity have been as
well determined by the Judges, and
ſo this great vexation have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented?</p>
               <p>But to this it will be ſaid, that this
would be a total deſtruction of the
Court of Chancery, and a groſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
of Law and Equity, to
make the Judges judge of both.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that we are
wholly to reſpect the good of the
Common-wealth, and what tends
moſt that way, certainly is moſt
juſt and reaſonable; other relations
ought to be ſubſervient to that; that
is equal and good ought onely to be
look't upon. But further, though
this will much abridge the practice
there, yet, it will not take it away;
and I am certain, the practice there
needs ſome abateme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; or at laſt there
will be an extream failer of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:115195:40"/>
Not deſtroy it, for there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
caſes, which are ſo meerly and
abſolutely equitable, that they have
not the leaſt relation to Law, nor can
any action in ſuch caſe be brought at
Law, as in all your caſes of diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the like.</p>
               <p>So that where the Suit is onely
proper there, and is not, nor cannot
be brought in queſtion at Law, in
ſuch caſe it is reaſon that Court
ſhould have a determining power in
the matter of Equity: and ſuch caſes
onely, I am confident, will find
work enough for the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and this will be a very great
eaſe and benefit to the people.</p>
               <p>For the ſcruple of confuſion, I
know no reaſon, but that Judges of
Law may as well judge of Equity; as
Judges of Equity judge of Law.
Nay more, are they not all Lawyers?
I know it is no ſtrange thing, for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115195:40"/>
others to have been Chancellors;
yea, it hath been common for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
to exerciſe that great place of
Judicature; how proper it was for
them, in relation to their functions,
as alſo to the place of Judicature it
ſelf, I ſhall not diſpute here, as not
proper to that I intend; but certain
I am, none more proper Judges of
Equity, then Judges of Law, nor
can he be a competent Judge of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
that underſtands not the Law:
for Equity is no other but an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law of God, or of the
Law of reaſon, from the general
rules of the Law of man; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is ſecretly underſtood in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
general rule of every poſitive
Law; therefore he that underſtands
not the one, cannot well Judge of
the other.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to urge one thing
more, which I am ſure would very
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115195:41"/>
much abate, and leſſen vexatious and
troubleſome Suits in Chancery, and
that is, that no plaintiffs ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
a Bill, but that he may ſwear
it, as well as the Defendant his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that ſuch untruths as are now
(to the ſhame and ſcandal of our
profeſſion) alledged and preferred in
all, or moſt Bills exhibited, may be
prevented, that men may not lye
(pray pardon the courſneſs of the
Term, ſince the truth is ſo) by tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>To this I know it will be ſaid, that
ſome Bills are meerly for diſcovery
and the like, and ſo not to be ſworn
to; To this I anſwer, that there is
no Bill but hath ſomething poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alledged in it, and that me thinks
ſeems reaſon, that every Plaintiffe
ſhould ſwear to, the rather, for the
Honour of this High Court, that
men may not dare to forge falſities,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115195:41"/>
and to preſent them to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
for ſpecious truths.</p>
               <p>I have one thing more to ſay, and
with which I ſhall conclude; and that
is, that it ſeems very hard to me, that
men ſhould not have coſts of Suit,
in ſome reaſon anſwerable to what
they have neceſſarily expended in
this Court, as well as at Law; ſo that
often the remedy proves as bad, if
not worſe, then the diſeaſe, and ſure
this cannot be agreeable to Equity,
it is not <hi>aequum,</hi> nor <hi>bonum;</hi> neither
good for the Court, nor equal to the
party. And this to my knowledge
hath deterred many a man from
proſecution in this Court. I ſhall
ſay no more but this, judge me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Equity, and then I know
I ſhall not be condemned.</p>
               <p>The next thing I have reſolved to
treat of is, Collateral Warranties,
&amp; in that I ſhall propound this ſhort
queſtion:</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:115195:42"/>
               <head>Whether Collateral Warranty ſtands
with reaſon and conſcience, or no?</head>
               <p>ANd firſt I ſhall let you know
what a collateral Warranty is;
that you may the better underſtand
the reaſon of this queſtion. A col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
Warranty is thus; where a
collateral Anceſtor; as an Uncle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſes
to the diſcontinuee or diſſeiſor
of Lands in tail, with Warranty and
and dyes, this barres the Heir in tail,
becauſe the Warranty deſcended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, who cannot derive any title
from the Uncle; and though the
Warranty deſcends lineally; yet it is
ſaid to be collateral, becauſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor
is collateral to the title.</p>
               <p>But to make the caſe more plain,
I ſhall put one caſe out of <hi>Littleton.
Sect.</hi> 709. If Tenant in tail diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
the tail, and hath iſſue and
dies, and the Uncle of the iſſue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſes
to the diſcontinuee with War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115195:42"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and dies without iſſue, this
is a collateral Warranty to the iſſue
in tail, becauſe that the Warranty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
upon the iſſue, who cannot
convey himſelf to the tail by means
of his Uncle. And you muſt know,
that this Warranty is a barre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any aſſets, or Eſtate deſcended
from him that made the Warranty,
which is the great extremity of
the caſe.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>
gives, why the Warranty of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
having no right to the Land in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed,
ſhall barre the iſſue in tail is,
becauſe that it is preſumed that the
Uncle would not unnaturally diſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
his Lawfull Heir being of his own
bloud, of that right which the Uncle
never had, but came to the Heir by
another mean, except that he would
leave him greater advancement. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
praeſumitur alienam poſteritatem
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115195:43"/>
ſuae praetuliſſe.</hi> No man is preſumed
to preferre anothers poſterity before
his own. And in this caſe he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaith, that the Law will admit
no proof againſt that which the Law
preſumes. And ſo of all other col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
Warranties, for no man is
preſumed to do any thing againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
It is well that my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>
will offer ſome reaſon for it; it is
more than I find in <hi>D. S. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 32.
for he ſaith, it is a barre in Law and
conſcience, becauſe that it is a
Maxim.</p>
               <p>But now let us examine the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it doth ſtand with conſcience,
reaſon, and the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
for my part, I judge
not that to be Law, nor worthy ſo
to be conſidered, that is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
unconſcionable, and againſt the
common good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:115195:43"/>
It is an unreaſonable and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable
Law, that a collateral An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor
who cannot claim any right to
the Land, ſhould have power to
barre me that am the Heir to it by
his releaſe, and this is a caſe much
more extream then that of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
in ſome ſence, becauſe the Uncle
is a meer ſtranger, as to the Eſtate,
and this is againſt the rule of Law,
that Acts done by ſtrangers ſhould
prejudice a third perſon.</p>
               <p>Yes, but ſaith my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> it is
preſumed, that the Uncle would not
disherit his Heir of that, which he
had nothing to do with, nor could
not pretend any right to, except that
he would leave him a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
and no proof muſt be
againſt this preſumption.</p>
               <p>A very ſtrange preſumption, How
many Uncles might a man find in
this age, who for a ſmall ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115195:44"/>
would not care to disherit twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Heirs, if poſſibly ſo many could
be, without the leaſt ſcruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
who neither have, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of any other advancement to
leave them.</p>
               <p>But there is a ſtrong block in the
way; for againſt that preſumption
there muſt be no proof; ſo that if he
leave no Eſtate or other advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is all one as if he did, it is
preſumed he will, though happily it
is known, he neither doth, nor can;
and that is ſufficient to diſherit his
Heir.</p>
               <p>Yet the rule of Law is, <hi>Stabitur
praeſumptioni donec probetur in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi>
the preſumption is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
till the contrarie be preved,
but no longer: and certainly if
ever there were an unreaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to any rule, this may paſs
for one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:115195:44"/>
My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith, that it hath
been attempted in Parliament, that a
<hi>Statute</hi> might be made, that no man
ſhould be barred by a collateral
Warranty, but where aſſets deſcend
from the ſame Anceſtor, but it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
took effect, becauſe ſaith he,
that it would weaken common aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
<hi>Rot. Parliament. 50. E. 3.
Num.</hi> 77.</p>
               <p>This is a reaſon urged in defence
of common recoveries likewiſe, the
Engliſh of it is but this, I may barre
another man of his juſt and Lawfull
right, to fortifie a wrongfull title;
otherwiſe it would weaken common
aſſurances; I know no reaſon, but
mens rights ſhould be as much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
as common aſſurances; an
Heir as much as a purchaſor. To
conclude, I wiſh a ſecond attempt
were made in this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
againſt theſe collateral War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranties;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115195:45"/>
and then I ſhould not deſpair
of redreſs of ſo unreaſonable a Law,
The next thing I am to treat of, is,
Pleadings, and therein I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
this queſtion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether it be conſonant to reaſon or
conſcience, that any mans Plea
ſhould be adjudged nought, and
avoided at any time for any matter
of form, falſe Latine, double Plea,
Departure, or any other defect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
the caſe and matter it ſelf
ſufficiently appearing upon the
Record, for which the Action is
brought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </head>
               <p>FIrſt, that I may clear the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome things doubtfull in
it, I have added to it, at any time,
becauſe in ſome caſes and ſometimes
ſuch defective Pleas are already
helpt by <hi>Stat.</hi> as you will find after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:115195:45"/>
I ſhall not need to inform you
what matter of Form is, the word it
ſelf ſufficiently ſpeaks it. Double
Plea is, when a man in pleading al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
ſeveral things; the one not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
depending upon the other,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Departure is when a man goes
from his former plea, and pleads
ſome new matter, theſe will vitiate
pleadings; and put a man to a new
action.</p>
               <p>But to the caſe it ſelf; M. <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
I remember, ſaith, that pleading
is one of the moſt Honourable and
profitable things in our Law, and
therefore adviſes his Son to bend
his indeavour to the gaining of the
knowledge of it. I believe it indeed
to be one of the moſt profitable
things, (I mean to the Lawyer) but
the Common-wealth ſuffers in it.
For the matter of Honour, I know
not where it lies, except it be in this;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115195:46"/>
that ſuch a one is ſaid to be a ſubtile
Lawyer, a pick-lock of the Law,
one, who can diſcover a flaw or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in any plea preſently, if it be
to be found: and this is the Honour
I believe, to be able to vex and
trouble and undo people by various
Suits; if this be the Honour (though
I hope no man will therefore count
me wholly ignorant of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
becauſe I ſpeak againſt it) let
who will take it for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cook</hi> upon <hi>Litt.</hi> fol. 303. 304. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
that many a good cauſe is
dayly loſt for want of orderly and
good pleading; the more the pittie.
And after he ſaith, when I diligently
conſider the courſe of our Books of
Years, and Terms from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Reign of <hi>E.</hi> 3. I obſerve
that more jangling and queſtions
grew upon the manner of pleading,
and exceptions to form, then upon
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115195:46"/>
the matter it ſelf, and infinite cauſes
loſt or delayed for want of good
pleading, what a groſs ſhame, and
moſt unconſcionable thing is this,
that form ſhould be inſiſted upon
more than matter; and the Clyent
ſhould loſe his caſe, or have it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed,
for formalities. The Clyent
ſues not at Law for to make caſes or
queſtions, or to occaſion ſcruples
about nice formalities, but to have
Juſtice done according to the truth
of his caſe; and this is the end of all
Law, to put an end to controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
in doing right to the parties,
without delay, or regarding any
thing but the truth of the caſe it
ſelf. <hi>Intereſt Reipublicae ut ſit finis
litium,</hi> it very much concerns the
Common-wealth, that ſtrifes be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and not that one diſpute or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
ſhould occaſion another;
much leſs that contention ſhould be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115195:47"/>
about words, the matter layed aſide,
and the party depart, not as he came,
but in a worſe condition, his money
fruitleſly expended, and his right, if
not loſt, ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith again, that it
is worthy of obſervation, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is, That in the Reigns of <hi>E. 2.
E.</hi> 1. and upwards, the pleadings
were plain and ſenſible, but nothing
curious, evermore having chief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to matter not to forms of
words; I am ſure we cannot ſay ſo of
theſe latter times; for I am confident,
they were never more nice and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
than of late.</p>
               <p>Then he ſaid, that in the Reign of
<hi>E.</hi> 3. pleadings grew to perfection,
both without lameneſs and curiouſity.
And that in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 6. the
Judges gave a quicker ear to excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to pleadings, than either their
predeceſſors did, or the Judges in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115195:47"/>
the Reign of <hi>E.</hi> 4. or ſince that time
have done, giving no way to nice
exceptions, ſo long as the ſubſtance
of the matter were ſufficiently
ſhewed.</p>
               <p>I attribute much of Honour and
reſpect to my Lord <hi>Cook;</hi> yet I ſhall
crave that freedom, to deliver what
is truth, and that is, as I have ſaid
before, that pleadings were never
more curious and ſubtile than of
late; and never more nice exceptions
given way to.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here meddle with the
order of pleading, as firſt to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of the Court, Secondly
to the Perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in their due courſe, or you
loſe the benefit of the former. Nor
yet with my Lord <hi>Cooks</hi> rules of
pleading in his inſtitutes, in which he
is very large: I go not about to
teach or inform you of the forms
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115195:48"/>
and ſubtleties of our pleas; though
they are worth the knowing, yea,
and obſerving too, ſo that the Clyent
may not be prejudiced for want or
defect of ſuch forms.</p>
               <p>For the double plea, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
any juſt reaſon why it ſhould
not be allowed; that reaſon which
the Law gives, is, that the Court and
Jury may be invegled by ſuch pleas;
I have inquired exactly into this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but cannot find how, or which
way; and I do profeſs my ſelf one of
my Lord <hi>Cooks</hi> non-intelligents too;
for he ſaid the Law in this point, is
by them that underſtand not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thereof, miſliked; and I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my ſelf of their minds
who ſay. <hi>Nemo prohibetur pluribus
defenſionibus uti;</hi> no man is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
to uſe ſeveral defences.</p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe for the departure,
I know no reaſon that any man
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115195:48"/>
ſhould be barred or concluded from
offering any other or new matter,
but that any man, may at any time
make the beſt of his own caſe; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
Judges ought to have princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
regard to the truth of every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
caſe, that that may be diſcovered,
thereby the better to inable them to
give righteous and true judgement;
not to forms or words; theſe are but
<hi>apices Legis,</hi> the meerbark, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and inconſiderable part of the
Law; and indeed <hi>non ſunt Jura,</hi> they
are not Law.</p>
               <p>The rule that we have in pleading,
that <hi>Parols font plea;</hi> that is, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the truth of his caſe is, that is
his caſe, and that he muſt ſtand to, as
he hath pleaded: and the other rule,
that a mans plea ſhall be taken moſt
ſtrongly againſt himſelf, where it is
doubtfull, theſe ſeem to me very
hard and unreaſonable; it is ſtrange
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115195:49"/>
to conclude any man, where there is
a miſtake in words, from laying open
the truth of his caſe; this, if any
thing, is to invegle the Court, and
make them give an unjuſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and if they be informed of the
miſtake, and yet judge according to
that, I doubt whether a rule of Law,
will another day be a good plea for
them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if a man ſhall but truely
reaſon this caſe, he muſt needs judge
it very unjuſt, that a man ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
through anothers default, which
is contrarie to the rule of Law, for
that ſaith, <hi>Nemo debet puniri pro ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eno
delicto.</hi> Now pray who is it that
draws theſe pleas? why the Clerk or
Lawyer, according to the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he receives from his Clyent; can
it then be agreeable to reaſon or
conſcience, that the miſpleadings, or
formal miſtakes of theſe, whom I
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115195:49"/>
intruſt, as being wholly ignorant
thereof my ſelf, ſhould prejudice me;
again, is it not frequent, for the moſt
learned men of the Law, to erre, or at
leaſt, to differ in judgement, from
the Judges? and yet not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
neither, why then ſhould I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for other mens faults, or defects
in judgement?</p>
               <p>By divers Statutes made in the
reign of <hi>H. 8. E.</hi> 6. Q. <hi>El.</hi> and King
<hi>James,</hi> it is provided, that after iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
tried, after verdict, after demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
(except where the matter of form
is ſpecially demurred to) that the
Judges do give judgement according
to the right of the cauſe, and matter
in Law, and no matter of form, falſe
Latin, or variance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are good laws ſo far as they
have gon, and I hope none that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
theſe will blame me; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115195:50"/>
doubt, the ſame or the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
cauſed the making of
them; that juſtice or right might be
advanced above all punctilioes or
nice formalities. And ſince thoſe are
defective in many things, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
experience teacheth; and the
ſame reaſon that cauſed the making
of them, may, and ought to perſwade
our great Parliament to a total ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
of ſuch immaterial nicities;
I doubt not, in good time, we ſhall
have an Act made, which will fully
anſwer our deſires therein; which will
be much for the good and eaſe of the
people, and no leſs beneficial to
Lawyers. The next thing that
I ſhall treat of, is Conveyances,
and therin propound this ſhort que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether the many ſorts of tedious and
long Conveyances now in uſe, ſtand
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115195:50"/>
with reaſon, and the good of the
Common-wealth or not?</head>
               <p>THere are many ſorts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances
in our Law, and I
doubt too many, to be for the good
of the people; as Feoffements, Fines,
Recoveries, Bargains, and Sales,
Covenants to ſtand ſeiſed to uſes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> moſt of which, are ſo ſwelled
and inlarged with many unneceſſary
covenants, and vain and idle repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and tautologies, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with adviſe and counſel, are an
intolerable charge and expence to
the people. So that he that purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
but a ſmall thing (as happily not
being able to go further) he had as
good, almoſt, be without it, and keep
his money, as under-go the great
charge and trouble in the aſſuring
of it.</p>
               <p>I put a Feoffement in the firſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115195:51"/>
place, as deſerving the preheminence
and prioritie of place, being the moſt
ancient and beſt conveyance. O the
innocencie of former ages, when a
Feoffement onely of ſome few lines
was ſufficient, and ſerved to convey
over the greateſt eſtates.</p>
               <p>Yet I am not in this caſe, to lay
all the blame, if any, upon Lawyers;
for as the innocencie of thoſe times
required not ſo many covenants and
aſſurances to oblige men to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
and making good of their
faith and engagements one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
So the wickedneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of theſe latter ages, are ſuch,
that men muſt be tied and bound,
ſhackled, and fettered like wild and
untamed cattel; ſo that it even puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels
Lawyers to find words enough
to meet with the ſubtle deviſes, and
over-reaching policies of moſt men;
and all little enough to keep them
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115195:51"/>
within the bounds and limits of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and honeſtie.</p>
               <p>But to return to that I broke off
from; <hi>Cook</hi> upon <hi>Litt. fol..</hi> 9. ſaith,
that a Feoffement is the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and neceſſary Conveyance;
(Note that Reader) both for that it
is ſolemn and publick, and therefore
beſt remembered and proved, and
alſo for that it cleareth all Diſſeiſins,
Abatements, Intruſions, and other
wrongfull and defeaſible eſtates,
where the entrie of the Feoffor is
lawfull, which neither Fine,
Recoverie, nor Bargain and Sale
by Deedindented and inrolled
doth.</p>
               <p>And that this kind of Aſſurance
may find the better eſteem and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
I ſhall firſt inform you
what it is, &amp; then ſhew you the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Antiquitie of it; Feoffement is
derived of the ancient word <hi>Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dum,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115195:52"/>
quia eſt donatio feodi;</hi> becauſe it is a
giving of the Fee; for the ancient
writers of the Law, called a Feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Donatio,</hi> of the Verb <hi>do,</hi> or
<hi>dedi;</hi> which is the apteſt word of
Feoffement.</p>
               <p>And now you ſhall have the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of it, out of no other Author,
but Holy Writ; for ſaith my Lord
<hi>Cook,</hi> that word <hi>Ephron</hi> uſed, when
he infeoffed <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, I give
thee the field of <hi>Machpelah</hi> over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Mamre,</hi> and the <hi>Cave</hi> therein
I give thee, and all the trees in the
field, and the Borders round about;
all which were made ſure unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
for a poſſeſſion in the preſence
of many witneſſes, <hi>Geneſis, cap. 23.
verſ.</hi> 11. And when the kinſ-man of
<hi>Elimelech</hi> gave unto <hi>Boas</hi> the parcel
of Land that was <hi>Elimelechs,</hi> he took
off his ſhooe, and gave it unto <hi>Boas</hi>
in the name of ſeiſin of the Land,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115195:52"/>
(after the manner in Iſrael) in the
preſence and with the teſtimony of
many witneſſes, <hi>Ruth; cap. 4. ver. 7, 8.
Deut.</hi> 25. 9, 10. Thus you have the
antiquity likewiſe of a Feoffement;
now this being the beſt, and moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
conveyance, I know no reaſon
it ſhould not be moſt in uſe. <hi>Cook</hi>
upon <hi>Litt.</hi> fol. 6. <hi>a.</hi> ſaith, that there
are eight formal or orderly parts of a
deed of Feoffement, as the <hi>premiſſes,</hi>
the <hi>habendum, &amp;c.</hi> and yet he ſaith,
all thoſe parts were contained in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few and ſignificant words; <hi>Haec
fuit candida illius aetatis fides &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitas,
quae pauculis lineis, omnia
fidei firmamenta poſuerunt.</hi> And a
Feoffement is good, without theſe
formal parts, <hi>fol. 7. a.</hi> for if a man
by his deed gives Land to another
and his Heirs, without more ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
this is good, if he put his Seal
to the deed, deliver it, and makes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:115195:53"/>
I have been the larger upon this
conveyance, by way of Feoffement,
becauſe I would have men in love
with it; and certain I am, it would
be beſt for all men (except Lawyers,
who I hope will be contented to
abate ſomething of their profit, to
ſerve the common intereſt) beſt in
point of ſecurity, and in profit. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
add this to it, that a Law be made,
that it ſhall be a barre (as a Fine
with Proclamations,) if it be inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
&amp; five years paſs with <hi>non-claim</hi>
after the inrolment, and then it will
be a great eaſe and advantage to the
publick.</p>
               <p>But if it ſhall not be thought fit to
alter the Law in point of conveyen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
as it is now ſetled, why then I
ſhall humbly begge this one boon of
the Parliament, in behalf of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick?
and that is, that they would
be pleaſed to make a Law, that no
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115195:53"/>
Scrivener, or other perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
other then Lawyers, ſhall for
the future make or draw any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
or aſſurance in Law what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
which ſhall after happen to
be ſealed and delivered, without the
advice of Counſel thereupon had,
either before, or after the aſſurance
drawn and made, under a good pain
or penalty, if they ſhall do the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie:
and this will be a means to
prevent, many contentious Suits,
which dayly ariſe upon ſcruples and
queſtions out of ſuch conveyances
drawn according to their formal
ignorance.</p>
               <p>The next thing I ſhall diſpute, is
the Law of Baſtardy; wherein I
ſhall ſet down this ſhort doubt.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether it be a juſt and reaſonable
Law, that a Child born before
marriage; and ſhortly after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115195:54"/>
happening, ſhould be a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard,
or not?</head>
               <p>THis is a caſe, in which the
Common-Law differs from
the Civil and Cannon-Laws; the
Common-Law ſaith, that ſuch a
Child is a Baſtard, the other Laws,
that it is Legitimate. I ſhall give
you the reaſons of both ſides, and
then you may judge which is moſt
reaſonable. This very caſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
by <hi>Forteſcue, cap.</hi> 39. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians
ſay, that <hi>maritagium ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens
tollit peccatum precedens;</hi> that
is, that by means thereof, the State
of Matrimony coming in place, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſheth
the former ſin, whereby
elſe the Souls of two perſons ſhould
have periſhed; And it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
ſay they, that they were at
their firſt copulation ſo minded, as
the marriage after declareth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:115195:54"/>
The Canoniſts alſo ſay, that<hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonium
ſubſequens legitimos facit
quod ſacerdotium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Say we, the ſin by the inter-marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is ſomewhat abated; not purged,
or taken away; &amp; beſides this would
be a great increaſe of that ſin, and
an incouragement to it, if ſuch Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſhould be legitimate, and the
parties would be leſs penitent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſo favoured.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Forteſcue</hi> being much for our
Law in this point, puts this caſe; ſaith
he, If a woman ſhould have two
Children of two Fornicators, &amp; the
one marries her, whether of theſe
two children ſhould be by this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Legitimate?</p>
               <p>For my part, I do conceive, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
correction of better judgements,
that the Cannon and Civil Laws
are moſt reaſonable in this point;
though I do not conceive, that the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115195:55"/>
ſin is purged, or taken away by the
inter-marriage, for that cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
than by true repentance for
the ſin committed: for which, this
ſeems to me to be a great ſign,
otherwiſe I doubt whether they
would have married or no. And I
do conceive it ought to be intended,
that they reſolved upon marriage
before, or otherwiſe it is not to be
preſumed that they would have
married after: men uſually hate
thoſe women they have carnally
known, being pricked in conſcience
for the ſin committed and therefore
not likely to marry ſuch, unleſs there
were ſome former tye or obligation
upon them, which mitigates the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and makes them perform their
ingagement: and if it were not ſo,
who in ſuch caſe would ſo marry,
knowing his iſſue to be Baſtard by
the common Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:115195:55"/>
To that that is ſaid, that it would
be an increaſe and incouragement to
commit that ſin, if the Law ſhould
be ſo taken, that the iſſue ſhould in
ſuch caſe be legitimate.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that I rather
conceive the contrarie, that it would
very much leſſen and abate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of that ſin; for it will make
them the rather eſchew it, and take
up reſolutions of marriage; for, as
I have ſaid, men ſeldom marrie that
woman they have carnally known,
eſpecially having iſſue before hand,
being the more frightened from it,
by this hard Law of Baſtardy.</p>
               <p>For that objection, that if ſuch iſſue
ſhould be legitimate, the parties
would be leſs penitent, becauſe ſo
favoured.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, that certainly it
would make them much more peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
when they ſhall live together
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115195:56"/>
in the ſtate of Matrimonie; and put
them more in mind of their former
offence, which certainly they would
leſs think of were they divided; and I
think a greater ſign of penitence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, than the ſubſequent Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</p>
               <p>Beſides, by legitimating of ſuch
iſſue, this great convenience would
follow, that it would much abate
and take off the ſcandal and reproch
of the World, and incourage men
in ſuch caſe to Matrimonie; whereas
otherwiſe they uſually add ſin to ſin,
one Baſtard begets more, ſo that
once having under-gone the reproch
and ſhame, they never conſider the
ſin, but are more hardned in it.</p>
               <p>For the caſe put by <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> of
two Fornicators having got ſeveral
Children by one Woman, and the
one after marrying her, which ſhall
be legitimate. This I conceive may
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115195:56"/>
receive a very ſhort anſwer; for if
the party that got the Child be
known, we may eaſily judge which
ſhall be legitimate.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> upon <hi>Litt.</hi> ſaith,
<hi>fol.</hi> 244. that if the iſſue be born
within a Moneth or a day after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
between parties of full Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
age, the Child is legitimate; by
which we may conclude, that if it be
born ſo ſhort a time after marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
that it is legitimate, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the ſame reaſon for both.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay this, that if we may
go ſo near Baſtardy, and yet be legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
I know no reaſon; that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſo near legitimation, it ſhould
be a baſtard, and this in favour of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation.</p>
               <p>But beſides, the ſins are equal, and
therefore I know no reaſon but the
puniſhment ſhould be ſo too, a day
doth not aggravate the ſin, why
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115195:57"/>
then ſhould a day baſtardiſe the
iſſue.</p>

it is not what we will not do, but

The next thing that I queſtion, is;</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether tryal by Jury, as it is now
in uſe, be agreeable to reaſon, and
for the good of the publick, or not?</head>
               <p>WHen I had ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with my ſelf, how
great a burden lies upon ſuch mens
ſhoulders, who are of a Jury; and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115195:58"/>
of what great importance this way
of Tryal is to all men of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
the lives and fortunes
of all men being ſubject, and lyable
to their verdict and judgement.</p>
               <p>And when I had further thought
with my ſelf, that although this be
the moſt exact and equal way of
Tryal in the World, for men to be
judged by their Peers; and that not
by one or two onely, but by 12 men
of the Neighbour-hood.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſaith my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>
upon <hi>Litt.</hi> 1. a Jurer ought to be
dwelling moſt near to the place
where the queſtion is moved; and
ſuch are preſumed to be beſt conuſant
of the matter of fact.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ought to be moſt ſufficient
both for underſtanding that his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:115195:58"/>
3. He ought to be leaſt ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that is, to be indifferent, as he

in Law, <hi>Liber &amp; legalis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo;</hi>
otherwiſe he may be challenged,
or excepted againſt, and not ſuffered
to be ſworn.</p>
               <p>The moſt uſual way of trial (ſaith
he) is by twelve ſuch men (it were
well if they were) for <hi>ad quaestionem
facti non reſpondent Judices.</hi> And
matters in Law the Judges ought to
decide, for <hi>ad quaeſtionem juris non

this is the moſt equal and juſt way
of Trial.</p>
               <p>For the Inſtitution and right uſe
of this trial by twelve men, and
wherefore other Countreys have
them not, and how this trial excels
others; ſee <hi>Forteſcue</hi> at large, <hi>cap.</hi> 25
and 29.</p>
               <p>Again, the Law hath taken ſuch
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115195:59"/>
care for equalitie and right in ſuch
trials; that the Law hath inflicted a
moſt heavie doom and judgement in
caſe they give a falſe verdict, by
way of Attaint againſt the Jurie: for
which you may ſee <hi>Cook</hi> upon <hi>Litt.

               <p>Yet for all this, when I again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what weak and ignorant Juries
are for the moſt part returned, I
cannot ſufficiently wonder and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that mens lives and fortunes
ſhould depend upon ſuch mens ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts.
That ſuch men (as many of
them are) who have not had ſo much
good literature, as to be able to
read, ſhould be Judges and diſpoſers
(as upon the matter they are) of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens lives and eſtates.</p>
               <p>But here it may be objected by
ſome, that the trials are before the
learned Judges of the Law, who may
direct them, and ſatisfie them in their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115195:59"/>
doubts; and therefore there is no
ſuch fear of injuſtice, as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>This I conceive is ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
before, in that the Law is,
that the Jury are the onely Judges
of matters of fact, and in that, they
may judge according to their own
conſcience; and are not bound in
ſuch caſe, to ask adviſe of the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or if they do, they are not tied
to follow it: nor, in truth, ought the
Judges in ſuch caſe to direct them,
(though in matter of Law, of which
they indeed are the proper Judges,
they may and ought to do it) their
work is onely truly and faithfully to
repeat the evidence on both ſides,
and ſo to leave it to the Jurie.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith, that in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time they were twelve Knights:
and <hi>Forteſcue</hi> ſaith, that the Juries
are very oft made, ſpecially in great
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115195:60"/>
matters of Knights, Eſquires, <hi>&amp;c.
cap. 29. fol.</hi> 67.</p>
               <p>Though this be of as high conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and concernment to the
publick, as may be, yet I ſhall not
deſire, that there ſhould be twelve
Knights, or twelve Eſquires to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Jurie; for ſo in defect of them,
there would be often a failer of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
and beſides, ſome caſes are ſo
ſmall and inconſiderable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that a mean and ordinary Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
may be ſufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>But this I ſhall humbly deſire,
that in all caſes which touch a mans
life, or his eſtate, to any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
value, there may be twelve able
underſtanding Gentlemen returned
of the Jurie, ſuch as are known in
their Countrey to be men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
worth for ſo great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
This would very much
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115195:60"/>
advance right, and determin diſputes
and controverſies; which now fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
are again revived, by reaſon
of the verdicts of weak and unable
Juries. And it were happie for the
publick, if an Act were made to that
purpoſe. The next thing I ſhall
diſcuſs, is the loſs of life in caſe of
Theft, and the forfeiture thereupon.
In which the queſtion is,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether it be conſonant to the word
of God, or reaſon, that a man
ſhould loſe his life for Theft, and
ſhould incur ſo great a forfeiture
and penaltie as loſs of all his estate,
and corruption of his bloud?</head>
               <p>IT is true, there is a commandment
againſt it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal:</hi> but
there is no penaltie inflicted upon
thoſe that do. But by the Judicial
Law, <hi>Exod. 22. verſ.</hi> 1. If a man
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115195:61"/>
ſteal an Ox or a Sheep, and kill it,
or ſell it, he ſhall reſtore five Oxen
for the Ox, and four Sheep for the
Sheep: and <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. If the theft be
found with him alive (whether it be
Ox or Aſs, or Sheep) he ſhall reſtore
the double. So that by that Law,
there ought to be a reſtitution, but
no life was then in danger. But to
this it will be ſaid, that that Law was
given to the Jews onely to obſerve,
and doth not extend to us. To this
I ſay, that had it been an equal and
juſt Law to ſuffer death in ſuch caſe,
without doubt it had been impoſed
upon them to obſerve; for in the
Chapter before, Murder is made
Death; life for life, that is equal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:
but life for any wordly
or temporal ſubſtance whatſoever,
holds not the leaſt equalitie of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion;
for one mans life is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
value and eſteem, than all the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115195:61"/>
treaſure upon the earth.</p>
               <p>Man is the image of God, and
therefore certainly we ought to deal
tenderly with his image. And if
God who hath the ſole abſolute
power and dominion over all his
creatures, thought not fit to give the
Magiſtrate, who is his Vicegerent
here upon earth, ſuch power over
the lives of men, but hath reſerved
it to himſelf (except in caſe of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
how dare then any power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
what ſoever uſurp it?</p>
               <p>The Civil Law (if we may believe
<hi>Forteſcue</hi>) is more agreeable to the
Word of God, for he ſaith, <hi>cap.</hi> 49.
that the Civil Laws do judge <hi>open
Theft</hi> to be ſatisfied by the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of four fold, and <hi>private Theft</hi>
by the recompence of double: ſo not
to ſuffer death by their Law.</p>
               <p>I do not write this to incourage
men in this heinous crime (which is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115195:62"/>
too too common in theſe times) no,
far be it from me ſo to do; for I
know if there be not a ſevere Law
againſt it, there will be no injoying
any thing that a man hath; the Law
of propertie will be of little force;
But that there may be ſome other
way of puniſhment, as by Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſlavery, or the like, which may
be as effectual to terrifie men, &amp; keep
them from it; ſo that we do not take
away the life of man, over which
there is no juriſdiction given in ſuch
caſe by God; we having no precept,
rule, or warrant for it.</p>
               <p>And now to me, the forfeiture
and penaltie in ſuch caſe, is no leſs
unreaſonable, is it not too much to
loſe the life? and yet will not that
ſatisfie; but thereby alſo his bloud
be corrupted; and all his eſtate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited;
ſo that his iſſue is not inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to him; nor to any other ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115195:62"/>
nor can this corruption of bloud
(it is ſo high) be reſtored otherwiſe,
than by Act of Parliament. And if
he were Noble or Gentle before, he
and all his children and poſteritie,
are by this made baſe and ignoble,
in reſpect of any Nobilitie or
Gentrie which they had by their
birth.</p>
               <p>For my part, I think there cannot
be a more rigid and tyrannical Law
in the world, that the children
ſhould thus extreamly ſuffer for the
crime and wickedneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the innocent for the nocent.</p>
               <p>It is true, that as the Apoſtle ſaith
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. that by one man ſin entered
into the World, and death by ſin;
but he goes further, and ſo death
went over all men, in whom all men
have ſinned. We all ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi>
therefore no wonder if death fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:115195:63"/>
God hath the ſupream Soveraign
power over all his creatures, and ſo
may inflict what puniſhment he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
upon them for their ſins, &amp; who
dares queſtion it, or ſay it is unjuſt?
and yet God deals not thus ſeverely
with man; for in the 18. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> he
reproveth the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for uſing this
Proverb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Fathers have eaten ſowr grapes,
and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge;</hi>and ſaith, they ſhall uſe it no more:
for<hi> that Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die;</hi>and after<hi> verſe </hi>the<hi> 20. The ſame Soul
that ſinneth, ſhall die; the Son ſhall not
bear the iniquity of the Father, </hi>&amp;c.
Thus you may ſee the great mercie
of God, whoſe greateſt ſeverity were
but Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Doth not this extreamly condemn
the injuſtice of that Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſo
ſeverely puniſheth the Children for
the tranſgreſſion of the Father, a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115195:63"/>
wicked Father may have a good
Child, and ſhall ſuch a one be ruined
through the wickedneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
his Eſtate wholly loſt, and not
onely disinherited through his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of bloud, as to his Fathers
Eſtate, but alſo made incapable of
taking any thing by deſcent from any
other Anceſtor? a more rigorous
Law certainly was never made.</p>
               <p>But I know it will be ſaid, that the
reaſon of the ſeverity of this Law, is
the more to deterre and affrighten
men from this ſin, which is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
amongſt us; <hi>ut metus ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

paena ad paucos,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that it is not
Lawfull nor warrantable, for men
to make unjuſt and tyrannical Laws
to keep men from ſinning; and to
put them in execution: puniſh the
offending Father, but not the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Children.</p>

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:115195:64"/>
The cuſtom of Gavel-kind is more
reaſonable, for though the Father be
hanged, the Son ſhall inherit; for the
Cuſtom is, the Father to the bough,
the Son to the plough. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it with this, that I hope one
day to ſee this Cuſtom become the
Common-Law of <hi>England:</hi> the next
thing I have in conſideration, is,
touching the debts of Infants under
the age of 21 years; and therein I
propoſe this queſtion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether it be a juſt and reaſonable
Law, that Infants under the age of
21 years, ſhall not be charged with
their debts?</head>
               <p>FIrſt, we are to know what the age
of diſcretion is for Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?
What full age? The age of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
for a woman in judgement of
our Law is 12. for a man 14. full age
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115195:64"/>
is 21. and under that age they are
ſaid to be Infants in Law, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that age they have not power to
diſpoſe of their Eſtates, not are they
liable to pay their own debts; It is
true, that for neceſſaries, as Cloaths,
Dyet, Schooling, &amp; the like, they are
liable, but for thoſe neither they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give a penal bond, a Bill they
may, and it ſhall bind them. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
an Infant may better his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he can not make it worſe; this I
confeſs to be Law, yet it ſeems very
hard to me, that an Infant ſhould not
be liable to pay ſuch debts, as he ſhall
ow for any thing had, or received af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the age of diſcretion; eſpecially,
when I conſider what the Law is in
other caſes of Infancy.</p>
               <p>By cuſtom, he may make a leaſe at
his age of 15. and it ſhall bind him.
<hi>Cook</hi> upon <hi>Littleton</hi> fol. 45. <hi>b.</hi> Nay
further, by cuſtom he may make a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115195:65"/>
Feoffement at 15. years, 5. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 41.
11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 33. Now no cuſtom is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that is not reaſonable.</p>
               <p>And yet further, an Infant of the
age of diſcretion, nay under, may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
death for Murder, or Theft, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more common. 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. an
Infant betwixt 10. and 12. gave a
man ſeveral wounds till he died, and
then he drew the body into the
Corn; forwhich he was convicted?
but it is true, that judgement in that
caſe was reſpited for his tender age,
but many Juſtices that he was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of death.</p>
               <p>Note, an Infant of 9. years killed
another, and it was adjudged, that he
ſhould be hanged, <hi>quia malitia ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet
aetatem.</hi> But execution was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpited
to have pardon; ſee the <hi>Aſsiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Woman Infant within age kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
her Miſtris, and was burnt for it,
ſee likewiſe the <hi>Aſsiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:115195:65"/>
Again, an Infant ſhall not avoid a
marriage at the age of diſcretion,
made, and contracted by him. <hi>Cook</hi>
upon <hi>Litt.</hi> fol. 79.</p>
               <p>Now I argue thus; if an Infant may
do the greater, why is it not reaſon
that he ſhould do the leſs? If he may
be chargeable for things of a much
higher nature, why not for thoſe that
are of a lower? By cuſtom he may
ſell his Eſtate; By Law, he may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
death for Felony: and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
Matrimonie; things of much
greater conſequence to himſelf: why
then in reaſon ſhould he not be liable
to the payment of his debts? my
Lord <hi>Gook</hi> ſaith, that <hi>argumentum a
majori ad minus,</hi> an argument from
the greater to the leſs, is a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in Law.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he is as much obliged in
reaſon and conſcience, to pay his
debts, as a man of full age, why then
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115195:66"/>
the Law ſhould not tie him to it,
I know no reaſon: I mean for
debts contracted after the age of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion:
and if the Law then judges
him to be diſcreet, why ſhould it
not make him juſt &amp; honeſt. Men of
themſelves naturally are too prone
to injuſtice and unrighteous dealing
one with another, therefore very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
that they ſhould receive the leaſt
incouragement to it.</p>
               <p>How frequent a thing is it for
men in ſuch caſe, to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of infancy; and moſt unjuſtly to
couſen their creditors of their juſt
debts, which in conſcience they are
bound to ſatisfie.</p>
               <p>But here it will be objected, that
it is the creditours fault to truſt ſuch
a one who is under age, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if he ſuffer, he may thank him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that though the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115195:66"/>
ignorance of Law will not excuſe a
man, the ignorance of fact will, and
how a man ſhould know ſuch a one
to be an Infant, ſince many, nay
moſt men may, and do deceive their
Judges by their looks; I cannot think
or imagine. And he that ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his cuſtomers age, may ſit ſtill
in his ſhop and blow his fingers, for
any thing elſe that he ſhall have to
do. I ſhall ſay no more but this,
that certainly, that Law is moſt juſt,
that gives the leaſt Liberty or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of fraud or deceit to men.
The next thing I ſhall ſpeak of, and
in that I ſhall be very ſhort, is, <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
and in that I ſhall propound this
ſhort queſtion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether Clergy be agreeable to reaſon,
and Juſtice, or no?</head>
               <p>CLergy is, when a man is convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of Man-ſlaughter, or any
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115195:67"/>
other crime or offence, for which he
may have his Book, and thereupon
prayes his Clergy, that is, that he
may have his Book, which being
granted, the Ordinary, being a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
man, and heretofore in ſtead of
the Biſhop who is the Ordinary,
opens the Book, and turns him to
a place to read, and reading, the
Court demands whether he reads as
a Clerk, if the ordinarie ſaith that
he doth, he ſaves his life by it, and
is onely burnt in the hand.</p>
               <p>We muſt know, that the Original
of this uſe of Clergy, was at that
time when the World was in its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority;
I mean this little World, and
there were but few Clerks, or learned
men; and then in favour, and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of learning, as alſo for
ſupply of places which were deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of men of ſuch abilities, this
Law or Priviledge of Clergy was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115195:67"/>
and approved of for ſaving
of ſuch mens lives in ſome caſes, for
the reaſons aforeſaid; and this was
the reaſon that Women could not
have their Book, becauſe they could
not be Clerks.</p>
               <p>Now I would fain know of any
one, whether the cauſe, or reaſon of
the making of this Law holds to this
day or not? if it doth not, what
reaſon can there be to continue it?
for the rule of Law is, <hi>Ceſſante causâ,
ceſſat effectus,</hi> the cauſe ceaſing, the
effect likewiſe ceaſeth. And that it
doth not, nothing more evident, for
certainly (God be thanked for it)
<hi>England</hi> never more abounded with
learned men, than it doth now: and
therefore no want of ſuch Clerks as
they are.</p>
               <p>That this Law ſtands not with
reaſon, I ſhall offer theſe things to
conſideration; firſt, the ſlightneſs
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115195:68"/>
and inconſiderableneſs (eſpecially as
the caſe ſtands now) of the thing it
ſelf, that reading of a line or two
ſhould ſave a mans life; by which
the crime is no way anſwered or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
for. Secondly, it may prove
very unjuſt, for if ſeveral men be
convicted of one and the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
one may happily read, the
other not, ſo that the one ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſave his life, and the other ſuffer;
which cannot ſtand with Juſtice.
But where they are both equally
guiltie, and ſo have deſerved death;
yet to pardon one may be juſt, for
that the one may have been a more
notorious offender than the other,
and ſo not deſerving the leaſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
but for one to have power to
ſave himſelf, and not the other, that
I judge very hard and unreaſonable.
Laſtly, (if there were reaſon in the
thing it ſelf) the difficultie of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115195:68"/>
Tongue, and in many places, the
Character being an old Letter too,
and ſo hard to be read, makes it very
unreaſonable. So that I may ſafely
ſay, were it not through the favour
of the Court, not one of twentie
could ſave their lives by reading.</p>
               <p>Since therefore there is no ground
for the continuance of this Law (as
there is not for any that wants rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for the ſupport of it) I think it
were better in ſuch caſes, where Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
is allowable, that they ſhould be
onely burnt in the hand, as women
are, and ſo ſet at Liberty; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
I ſubmit to graver judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The next I ſhall write of is
the diſtinction in Law, betwixt Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Man-ſlaughter; and therein
put this ſhort queſtion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether the Law, that a man
ſhall not ſuffer death for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115195:69"/>
be not againſt the word
of God?</head>
               <p>THe diſtinction in Law betwixt
Murder and Man-ſlaughter, is
thus; Murder is, when one is ſlain
with a mans will, and with malice
prepenſed or fore-thought: as where
two falling out one day, appoint the
field the next day, and then meet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording,
and one of them is ſlain, this
is Murder in the other; being done
premeditatedly &amp; upon cool bloud;
and for this a man ſhall not have his
Clergy, but ſhall ſuffer death.</p>
               <p>Homicide, or Man-ſlaughter, as it
is legally taken, is when one is ſlain
with a mans will, but not with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
prepenſed; as where two being
together fall out, and both draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
each other, and one kils the other,
this being done upon hot bloud, is
but Man-ſlaughter, for which he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115195:69"/>
ſhall have his Clergy, and ſave his
life.</p>
               <p>Now, how this diſtinction ſtands
with the word of God, that we are
to conſider, by the Judicial Law;
<hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 12. He that ſmiteth a man,
and he die, ſhall die the death. And
<hi>Numb. 35. verſ.</hi> 16. And if one ſmite
another with an inſtrument of iron
(or with a ſtone, or other inſtrument,
as is ſaid in the verſes following) that
he die, he is a Murtherer, and the
Murtherer ſhall die the death, ſaith
the Marginal Notes, wittingly and
willingly; and certainly in the caſe
of Man-ſlaughter, the man is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
and willingly killed. I could
cite many other places to the ſame
purpoſe, but theſe are ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Now in theſe places it is ſaid, that
he that kils another ſhall die the
death; here is no ſuch qualification,
or diſtinction, as Murder and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:115195:70"/>
It is true that where a man kills an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
unawares, <hi>per infortunium,</hi> as
we ſay in Law, which we call Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddly;
in ſuch caſe, becauſe it was
not done with his will, it pleaſed
God in mercy, to provide ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or Cities of refuge, for ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
to flee unto to ſave their
lives; and the onely puniſhment was,
that they were to continue there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the death of the High-Prieſt.</p>
               <p>So in our law where one is ſlain ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
and by miſadventure, without
the will of him that doth the Act,
he ſhall not die for it, but inſtead of
the Cities of refuge aforeſaid, (that
he may not go altogether unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who was the cauſe of anothers
death,) he forfeits all his goods and
Chattels for it.</p>
               <p>It is plain and evident therefore
by the word of God, that he that
wilfully killeth another, ſhall ſuffer
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115195:70"/>
death for it, whether it were in hot,
or cool bloud, it differs not: How
then can that Law be juſt (be it upon
what politick principles ſoever) that
ſaves the life of ſuch an offender?
other ſatisfaction can be none, and if
God requires that, how dare we do
the contrarie? He that killeth a man
in heat of bloud, deſerves to be
hanged when it is cool.</p>
               <p>And it is a ſad and dolefull thing
to conſider, how many thouſands of
lives this Law hath taken away; by
incouraging others to commit the
ſame offence, conſidering their lives
were not in danger. I ſhall conclude
it, with that in the <hi>Numb. cap. 35.
verſ.</hi> 33. bloud defileth the land: and
the land cannot be cleanſed of the
bloud that is ſhed therein, but by the
bloud of him that ſhed it. The next
thing that comes in conſideration, is
concerning Counſel in Treaſon or
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115195:71"/>
Felony; and in that I ſhall propound
this ſhort queſtion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether it be a reaſonable Law, that
a man ſhall not have Counſel upon
an Indictment of Treaſon or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony?</head>
               <p>THat the Law is ſuch, it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and without diſpute;
and the reaſon that is given for it, is,
that the Indictment being heretofore
at the Suit of the King, the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
nothing but Juſtice with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
and therefore he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
that the Juſtices ſhould help
forth the parties as far as reaſon and
Juſtice may ſuffer; and that in all
things that pertain to the form of
pleading, the Judges ſhall ſo inſtruct
the parties, that they incurre no
damage thereby.</p>
               <p>This reaſon at the firſt aſpect,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115195:71"/>
ſeems very plauſible; but better
dived into, I doubt it will not appear
ſo. Do not we know, that though
the Judges were ſworn to do right
between the King and his people;
that yet they were the more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Counſel of the King? and
though a poor man might happily
find Juſtice, as having nothing but a
life to loſe, I doubt, it did not always
fare ſo with the rich? And therefore,
heretofore, when any Gentleman had
committed any crime for which his
life was in danger, it was uſual to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
in the firſt place, what Eſtate
he had, and if it was anſwered, a good
Eſtate, it was thereupon replied, that
is enough to hang him. Then he had
no ſooner committed the offence,
but his Eſtate was begged of the
King by ſome great Courtier, and
what relation there was then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Judges and the Court, we
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115195:72"/>
very well know, but to ſay no more
but this, ſuppoſe it ſhall ſo fall out,
that the Judge be a weak ignorant
man himſelf, before whom the Tryal
is, (as we have not been wanting of
the like experience in our age) who
then ſhall adviſe the Priſoner? is
not this then a caſe of great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and injuſtice?</p>
               <p>To conclude, in the moſt petty,
ordinary, and inconſiderable action
that is, the Law allowes a man coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel;
why then ſhould it be denied
him in a caſe of the higheſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him that can be, his life?
If he ſhall have Counſel in leſſer
things, why not in greater, where
there is moſt need of it? we ſay, that
life is one of the Laws Favourites,
but it is not ſo dealt withall in this
caſe; but now the Court is gone, I
hope this Law will in time be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The next thing to be conſidered
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115195:72"/>
is, actions for Slanderous words, in
which I make this queſtion;</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether actions for Slanderous words,
being meer contentious Suits, ought
in reaſon or conſcience to be ſo much
countenanced, as they are?</head>
               <p>NEver did theſe actions more
abound, to the great and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
vexation of the people than
they do now. And it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(and certainly never in a better
time than now) that the greateſt part
of them were ſuppreſſed, that words
onely of brangle, heat, and choler,
might not be ſo much as mentioned
in thoſe High &amp; Honourable Courts
of Juſtice. For I profeſs for my part,
I judge of them as a great diſhonour
to the Law, and the Profeſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
eſpecially when I conſider, that
they are uſed onely to promote the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115195:73"/>
malice, and vent the ſpleen of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
jarres, and diſcontents amongſt
men.</p>
               <p>Yet I do not condemn all actions
for words neither, for it is juſt and
equal, that where a mans life, lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
or reputation (which is dearer
and nearer to him than the former)
is much prejudiced and indangered
by ſuch ſcandals, that in ſuch caſe
the Offender ſhould be inforced by
action to make compenſation. But
that a man ſhould flee to the Law
out of malice, and make the Courts
of Juſtice maintainers of every ſmall
and vain brabble, this ſeems to me
utterly unlawfull and intollerable
amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I cannot but take notice of that
which <hi>Wray,</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid in
<hi>Cooks</hi> 4. Book, That though ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and falſe imputations are to be
repreſſed, becauſe that oftentimes <hi>à



<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115195:73"/>
verbis ad verbera perventum eſt,</hi> men
fall from words to blows. Yet he
ſaith, that the Judges have reſolved,
that actions for ſcandals ſhould not
be maintained, by any ſtrained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
or argument, nor any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
extended for ſupportation of
them; And he adds the reaſon of it,
becauſe they do abound more in
theſe dayes, than in times paſt, and
the intemperance and malice of men
increaſes; <hi>Et malitiis hominum eſt
obviandum;</hi> and further adds, that in
our old books, actions for ſcandals
are very rare, &amp; ſuch as are brought,
are for words of eminent ſlander, and
of great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>portance.</p>
               <p>This muſt needs be acknowledged
to be a moſt exact and true obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
for, if I miſcount not I find
but nine reported caſes for words
from <hi>E.</hi> 3. time, (in which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan)
to Q. <hi>Eliſ.</hi> and then they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115195:74"/>
multiplied, and ſo have done
ever ſince, to the great ſhame and
diſhonour of the Law.</p>
               <p>And certainly theſe are very much
againſt religion and peaceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
amongſt men.</p>
               <p>And how much doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> in all
of his Epiſtles decry, and labour to
depreſs as much as poſſibly may be,
all vain brabbles, ſtrifes, debates, and
contentions, which tend to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
of the Common-peace?
and I am confident nothing more
tending that way, than ſuch idle, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
actions as theſe are; and to
thoſe that go to Law for ſcandalous
words (except in extra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>inarie ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)
a man may juſtly uſe the words
of the Apoſtle, that it is ſo, that
there is not a wiſe man among them.</p>
               <p>And it were to be wiſhed, that men
would be more carefull of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of this little, yet unruly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115195:74"/>
member, in which is ſeated either
heaven or hell; this is that which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
proves the greateſt good, or the
greateſt evil to moſt men: which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
diſſentions amongſt men in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
Kingdoms, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths;
wherefore I could wiſh, that
every man would take up the ſaying
of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerve it; I will take heed to my
wayes, that I offend not with my
tongue; I will keep my mouth as
with a bridle.</p>
               <p>But now I beſeech you, give me
leave, and I ſhall in a word inform
you how theſe frivolous contentious
actions may be very much abated, if
not wholly taken away: Let no words
be actionable, which do appear to
have been ſpoken in choller and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
or if actionable, yet let the
Plaintiff recover no more in damage,
than he can upon Oath make appear,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115195:75"/>
that he was really and actually dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by the ſpeaking of them, and
if this were provided by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
theſe actions would be as
ſtrange, and as rarely brought for
time to come, as they were in former
ages; for nothing incourages the
bringing of them more, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable,
unjuſt, and exceſſive da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
uſually recovered by them.
I ſhall conclude with this; Though
the tongues of men be ſet on fire, I
know no reaſon wherefore the Law
ſhould be uſed as bellows to blow
the coals. The next thing that I am
to conſider, is concerning actions that
die with the perſon; and therein the
queſtion is in ſhort but this.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Whether it be a reaſonable Law that
actions ſhould die with the perſon?</head>
               <p>THe rule is <hi>Actio moritur cum

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115195:75"/>
are that ſhall die with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is the thing to be inquired into,
and firſt negatively, <hi>Quicquid oritur
ex contractu vel conventione non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur
cum perſona,</hi> whatſoever ariſes
by way of Covenant or contract
doth not die with the perſon. Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively
all actions that are ſaid in
Law to be meerly perſonal, as Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas,
debts upon ſimple contract, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Words, Debts upon an eſcape
againſt a Keeper of a priſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
ſuch in Law die with the perſon, and
no action can be brought againſt the
Executors.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to me to be a very hard
Law, and a failer of Juſtice, that I
ſhould ſuffer againſt Law, and that
the death of him that doth the
wrong, there being no Act or default
in me, ſhould take away my remedy.</p>
               <p>It is true that the Law in caſe of a
Bond, Covenant, or the like, binds
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115195:76"/>
the Executor, though he be not
named; and what is the reaſon? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Executor repreſents the
perſon of the Teſtator; why then,
upon the ſame reaſon, ſhould not a
perſonal tort of the Teſtators, as
well bind the Executor?</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is a rule in Law, that
the Act of God, (as it is here in caſe
of death) ſhall prejudice no man;
why then in ſuch caſe ſhould it take
away my action?</p>
               <p>Again, there is another rule in Law,
that <hi>Lex non debet deficere conqueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus
in Juſtitia exhibenda;</hi> the Law
ought not to be defective in exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
Juſtice to complainants. But
in this caſe, the Law is defective in
juſtice, if the inevitable fate of death
ſhall take away my action.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe another rule in
Law, that <hi>Lex nulli facit injuriam,</hi>
the Law injures no man; but I ſay in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115195:76"/>
this caſe, it injures me, if it deprives
me of my action by the death of the
perſon. In Fine, where ever there is
a damage, there ought, in reaſon, to
be a ſatisfaction for it, which ought
not to be taken away or otherwiſe
diſcharged, but by my Act that am
damnified, which I ſubmit to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The next thing that I ſhall
debate, is concerning <hi>Paine fort &amp;

               <p>THis Law or Judgement of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

is that which we commonly call
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115195:77"/>
preſſing to death; which is uſed in
ſuch caſe, where a man is indicted
of Felony, upon matter evident and
proveable (for in caſe of an Appeal,
this Judgement cannot be given nor
doth it hold in caſe of Treaſon, or
petit Larceny) and thereupon ſtands
Mute; in ſuch caſe, ſaith the <hi>Statut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

they ſhall have ſtrong and hard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</p>
               <p>By the way I ſhall here obſerve,
that the words of this Law do not
extent to pain, but onely to <hi>fort &amp;
dure,</hi> to hard and ſtrong impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and therefore ſince that Law,
I cannot underſtand the ground or
reaſon of that cruel and heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is given in ſuch caſes;
hard and ſtrong impriſonment may
be inflicted upon ſuch an offender
(according to that Law) without
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115195:77"/>
preſſing, and ſtarving to death by
famine and cold; nor can I conceive
thoſe words to extend to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
admitring the Law were ſuch.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, (that all may underſtand
the reaſon of the Law,) before I go
any further, let you know, what it is
to ſtand Mute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in what caſe a
man may be ſaid to ſtand Mute; and
what the Judgement thereupon is.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in his 2 part of his
Inſtitutes, <hi>fol.</hi> 177. upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<hi>Statute,</hi> ſaith, that a man may
ſtand Mute two manner of wayes;
Firſt, when he ſtands Mute without
ſpeaking of any thing, and then it
ſhall be inquired, whether he ſtood
Mute of malice, or by the Act of
God, if it be found by the Act of
God, then to proceed, and the Judges
to make inquiry and to allow him all
pleas, as if he had not ſtood Mute.</p>
               <p>And the words (of malice) are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115195:78"/>
for it may be, the priſoner
in truth cannot ſpeak, and yet being
not Mute by the Act of God, he ſhall
be forthwith put to his penance; as
if the Delinquent cut out his own
Tongue, and thereby become Mute.</p>
               <p>Another kind of Mute is, when the
priſoner can ſpeak, &amp; perhaps pleads
<hi>Not guilty,</hi> or pleads a plea in Law,
and will not conclude to the enqueſt,
according to the foreſaid Act, or
ſpeaks much, but doth not directly
anſwer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be ſhort, when in the
end he will not put himſelf upon the
enqueſt, that is, <hi>De bono &amp; malo,</hi> to be
tried by God &amp; the Countrey; then
the foreſaid Act is ſufficient warrant,
if the cauſe be evident, or probable,
to put him to his penance; but if he
demurre in Law, and it be adjudged
againſt him, he ſhall have judgement
to be hanged; ſo if he challenge
above the number of 36. he ſhall be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115195:78"/>
hanged, and not have <hi>Pain fort &amp;
dure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not inquire what the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law was before the making the
ſaid <hi>Statute,</hi> whether the priſoner
then ſtading Mute ſhould be hanged,
as ſome held, and as at this day it is,
in caſe of high Treaſon, and, as they
ſay, in caſe of appeal; or whether
then in favour of life he ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have <hi>Pain fort &amp; dure,</hi> nor have
judgement to be hanged, but to be
remanded to priſon, untill he would
anſwer, according to others.</p>
               <p>But the firſt thing I ſhall conſider,
is, what the judgement, which the
foreſaid Act calleth <hi>fort &amp; dure,</hi> is,
and then what the reaſon ſhould be,
that ſo ſevere a judgement is given
in that caſe; and then we may eaſily
judge, whether it be conſonant to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and conſcience?</p>
               <p>The judgement is, that the Man
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115195:79"/>
or Woman ſhall be remanded to the
priſon, and laid there in ſome low
and dark houſe, where they ſhall lie
naked on the bare earth without any
litter, ruſhes, or other clothing, and
without any garment about them,
but ſomething to cover their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
parts, and that they ſhall lie
upon their backs, their heads unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and their feet, and one arm
ſhall be drawn to one quarter of the
houſe with a cord, and the other arm
to another quarter, and in the ſame
manner ſhall be done with their legs,
and there ſhall be laid upon their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
iron and ſtone, ſo much as they
may bear, and more, and the next
day following, they ſhall have three
morſels of Barley bread, without any
drink, and the ſecond day they ſhall
drink thrice of the water that is next
to the houſe of the priſon (except
running water) without any bread,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115195:79"/>
and this, ſhall be their dyet untill they
be dead.</p>
               <p>Well might my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſtile it
(as he doth after) a ſtrange and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
puniſhment, for when I firſt
read it, I was even amazed and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at it, that ſuch a Law ſhould
be tollerated amongſt Chriſtians,
much more amongſt Proteſtants,
ſtrict profeſſors of Chriſtianity, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to death with ſuch aggravations
of torture and miſerie, is rarely to be
heard or read of, except amongſt
Heathens, Turks, and Infidels.</p>
               <p>Here is a dying three manner of
wayes, (though all but one death,
which will at laſt nonplus Tyranny,
and put a period to all ſuch like tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
<hi>Onere, fame, &amp; frigore,</hi> by
weight, famine, and cold; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſaith my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(if it were executed according
to the ſeverity of the Law) ſhould be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115195:80"/>
of all other the moſt grievous and
fearfull.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I have not been an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnes,
nor would I for all the world,
of any mans ſuffering in that kind,
though it be every years experience
of ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s undergoing that death,
and I do believe according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of the Law too, for it lies not
in the power of the Judge, much leſs
of the executioner, any way to leſſen
or mitigate it, after judgement paſt.</p>
               <p>But now for the reaſon of this
heavy and terrible judgement, which
is; according to the foreſaid Act,
becauſe he refuſeth to ſtand to the
Common Law of the Land, that is,
Lawfull and due trial according to
Law, and therefore his puniſhment
for this contumacy, without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
is more ſevere, laſting, &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
than it ſhould have been for the
offence of Felony it ſelf, and for the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115195:80"/>
Felony it ſelf, it cannot be adjudged
without anſwer.</p>
               <p>A very ſtrange thing, that a man
ſhould ſuffer ten fold more for his
wilfull obſtinacy in refuſing to put
himſelf upon a legal tryal, than he
ſhould for his crime or offence, which
is a hundredfold greater; more for
the leſſer, than the greater offence,
more for contumacy, than murder.
The puniſhment ought to agree, and
to hold proportion with the offence,
and not to exceed it. The rule of
Law is, that a man ought to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
according to his offence;
and the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Magna Charta,
cap.</hi> 14. is, that a man ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<hi>ſecundum modum delicti,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the manner of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
but certainly here is not the
leaſt equality or proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the offence and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Contumacy the offence, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and ſtarving to death, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:115195:81"/>
It is true, that God having <hi>Geneſ.</hi>
9. 6. commanded the Murtherers
bloud to be ſhed by man (the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
not the Thiefs) and thereby
enſtated the power of the ſword on
the Supream Magiſtrate, not onely
permits him, and makes it Lawfull
for him ſo to puniſh ſuch malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
but commands and requires
him ſo to do, as his Miniſter to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
wrath; for he ought not to bear
the ſword in vain; but this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is not given to him abſolutely,
&amp; arbitrarily, to uſe as he liſt, though
he may take away the Murtherers
life, yet he hath no rule nor Warrant
to take it away by cruel and exquiſite
tortures and torments; that is <hi>praeter
mandatum,</hi> beſide the command.</p>
               <p>Mercie is one of Gods attributes;
and even the very ſum and body of
the Scripture: therefore Tyrannie
muſt needs be againſt the mind and
will of God, religion &amp; Chriſtianity.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115195:81"/>
Taking away me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s lives by cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
is Diabolical and Heatheniſh;
it is the Divils part to torture and
torment, and it is no ſtrange thing
for wild beaſts to be cruel, but that
<hi>homo homini daemon,</hi> one man ſhould
Act the part of the Divil with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
or that Chriſtians ſhould be
cruel; this is contrary to our educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and profeſſion.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate, for prevention of
ſin and wickedneſs, may ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
and correct, yea, and in ſome
caſe take away the life too; but not
Tyrannically. Barbarity and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
Suits not with Magiſtracie.
The Prophet <hi>David</hi> cals Magiſtrates
Gods; and certainly they approch
then neareſt to the deity, when they
ſhew mercie. Queſtionleſs it was a
high and great aggravation of the ſin
of the Jews in torturing of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviour by that moſt cruel death
of the Croſs. But to this it will be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115195:82"/>
ſaid, that that was wholly unjuſt in
the Jews, not ſo here; becauſe it is
an execution of Juſtice. To this I
ſay, that it is in no caſe juſt, to take
away mans life by lingring and cruel
tortures; this turns the execution of
Juſtice into ſin, and makes the Law
it ſelf unlawfull.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, that it is
the parties own fault that he ſtands
Mute, and will not plead to be tried;
<hi>&amp; volenti non fit injuria;</hi> ſeeing he
will ſo ſuffer, there is no injury done
him; and therefore not to be pittied.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay, let him ſuffer death
for this his obſtinacie, as he ſhould if
he had been tried, and found guilty;
and as the Law was, if we believe
ſome, before the foreſaid <hi>Statute,</hi>
which is a ſatisfaction equal to the
higheſt crime or offence whatſoever
againſt man; but let this cruel and
barbarous Law of <hi>Paine fort &amp; dure</hi>
be taken away, and expunged out of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115195:82"/>
our Books, never to be revived. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
may contract guilt, but ought
not ſo to aggravate puniſhment; and
certainly a mans folly or obſtinacie,
will not excuſe or extenuate the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
cruelty.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, I cannot paſs by
that gracious and mercifull Act of
this preſent Parliament, which hath
taken away that barbarous and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Law of quartering of men
in caſe of treaſon; and doubtleſs, this
Law, if ſtrictly examined, will be
found as Tyrannical, if not more
than the other, and if it ſhall appear
that there is as much reaſon to take
away this, as that, I hope it will not
continue long after it. I ſhall ſay no
more but this; gratious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Laws concludes the Governours
to be men; but Tyrannical, Beaſts.

upon the Sea were immediately for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
to the King, but I rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 3. 33. 135. that there
ſhall be no wreck where the owner
comes and avows the goods to be
his; obſerve there that that is indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
at any time, and that were a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Law. And <hi>Cook lib.</hi> 5. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Henry Constables</hi> caſe, it is ſaid, that
the <hi>Statute</hi> of 3. <hi>E.</hi> 1. was but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the Common Law, then
certainly the Law was the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as it is now by that <hi>Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by that <hi>Statute</hi> of 3. <hi>E. 1.
cap.</hi> 4. concerning wrecks of the Sea,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115195:84"/>
it is agreed, that where a man, a dog,
or a cat, eſcape quick out of the
Ship, that ſuch Ship nor Barge, nor
any thing within them, ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
Wreck, but to be ſaved and
kept by the Sheriff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that if
any ſue for, and prove the goods
his, within a year and a day, they
ſhall be reſtored, otherwiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Law is, that if but a
Dog or Cat eſcape alive out of the
Ship, then not to be adjudged
Wreck, otherwiſe it is. Now to me
this ſeems a very hard Law, that a
man ſhould loſe his eſtate there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no act, or default in him, which
is contrarie to the rule of Law: and
as I have ſaid before, there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
rule in Law, that the act of
God ſhall prejudice no man; and for
my part, I cannot judge an Act of
Parliament made againſt this rule, to
ſtand with reaſon. This is <hi>afflictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115195:84"/>
afflictis addere,</hi> to add affliction
to affliction, and to throw him quite
down that is a falling: certainly there
cannot be any thing more againſt
reaſon and Religion, than for to add
burthen to burthen, ſorrow to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
when the afflicting hand of
God is upon a man, 'tis ſad and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
to meet with ſuch as <hi>Jobs</hi>
friends. For a man in an impetuous
dreadfull ſtorm and tempeſt, to be
toſſed to and fro at Sea, by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and ſwelling billows thereof,
every moment expecting nothing
but deſtruction; and at the laſt, to be
Ship-wrecked and ſwallowed up in
the mercileſs deep, and after all, to
have this further aggravation of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie,
that if nothing eſcape alive, the
goods to be forfeited, or if any thing
eſcape alive, if not a man, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to a year and a day to prove
the propertie, when that it is almoſt
an impoſſible thing for friends to be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115195:85"/>
informed of the ſad misfortune, the
men being all caſt away; this ſeems
to me a very hard and ſtrange Law.</p>
               <p>But to this it may be ſaid, that the
goods may be <hi>bona peritura,</hi> and if
libertie ſhould not be given to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
of them, after ſuch time no
claim being made, they may periſh,
and ſo nobodie be advantaged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay, 'tis true, it may be
ſo; Therefore I conceive it juſt, as in
caſe of Eſtrays, ſo in this caſe, that a
Law ſhould be made, by which it
ſhould be provided, that notice
ſhould be given of ſuch a Shipwreck
and ſuch goods taken up, by way of
Proclamation, in all the Port-Towns
and other chief Cities of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and then if claim be not made
within the ſame time, the forfeiture
may be more reaſonable. And we
ought to be invited to this the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
conſidering it was the hand of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115195:85"/>
God which brought this affliction,
and therefore let us not add forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of eſtate to loſs of life, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
it may be prevented. The next
and laſt thing I ſhall diſcourſe of, is
Wills, and of that onely by way of
adviſe.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Good adviſe in caſe of making laſt
Wills and Testaments.</head>
               <p>THe onely adviſe that I ſhall
give to men in this caſe, is, that
they would make their laſt Wills
and Teſtaments in their health, with
the adviſe of Lawyers, not of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
or Scriveners, who know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but meer matter of form, and
like Carriers horſes keep their rode;
judging their forms to ſerve all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
by which they raiſe infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
and controverſies, and often
undo many men.</p>
               <p>Nor is it a prejudice for any man
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115195:86"/>
to make his Will; ſince that in Law
he may revoke it when he pleaſeth;
for <hi>voluntas eſt ambulatoria uſque ad

               </p>
               <p>I confeſs in the caſe of Wills, the
favour of the Law to be very great,
for that they are conceived generally
to be made <hi>in extremis;</hi> for 'tis a
Maxim of the Common Law, <hi>Quod
ultima voluntas teſtatoris est perim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenda
ſecundum veram intentionem
ſuam, &amp; Reipublicae intereſt ſuprema
hominum teſtamenta rata haberi.</hi> that
is, that the laſt will of the Teſtator
is to be fulfilled, according to his
true intention: and it concerns the
Common-wealth, that mens laſt
Wills and Teſtaments be ratified
and confirmed. The Law is to be
thanked for this care, not themſelves,
and let not this incourage men in the
neglect of that which often cauſes ſo
much debate and diſſention (even to
an irreconcilableneſs) amongſt a

mans Children and kindred; &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

every mans hands, whom God hath
bleſſed with a fortune, that he avoid
that as much as poſſibly may be.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall give you my
Lord <hi>Cooks</hi> directions concerning
making of <hi>Wills,</hi> (which indeed is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
excellent) in his third book <hi>fol. 36.
Buttler</hi> and <hi>Bakers</hi> caſe; where he
ſaith, touching Wills, of which you
have many good matters in the ſaid
caſe, my advice is to all that have
Lands, that you would, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of learned Counſel, by act exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
make aſſurances of your Land,
according to your true intent, in full
health and memorie, to which aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
you may add ſuch conditions
or proviſoes of revocation as you
pleaſe; for I find great doubts and
controverſies from day to day to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,
upon deviſes made by laſt Wills,
ſometimes in reſpect of the tenures
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115195:87"/>
of the Land (which now thanks be
to God is taken away) ſometimes by
pretences of revocations, which may
be made eaſily by word, alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of obſcure &amp; inſenſible words,
and repugnant ſentences, the Will
being made in haſte, and ſometimes
pretending that the Teſtator, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of extreamitie of pain, was not
of ſane memorie, and divers others
ſcruples and queſtions are moved
upon Wills; But if it pleaſeth you to
deviſe Lands by Will;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Make it by good adviſe in your
full memorie, and inform your
Counſel truely of the eſtates and
tenures of your lands, and by the
grace of God, the reſolutions of the
Juſtices in this caſe will be good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to Counſel learned, to make
your Will according to Law, and by
this to prevent queſtions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis good if your Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115195:87"/>
inheritance, to make it indented,
and to leave one part with a Friend,
leſt after death your Will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. At the time of publication of
the Will; take credible witneſſes,
who may ſubſcribe their names to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it may be, let all the Will be
written with one and the ſame hand,
and one and the ſame parchment
and paper, for doubt of alteration,
addition, or diminution.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let the hand and ſeal of the
deviſor be put to it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If it be in ſeveral parts, let his
hand and ſeal be put, and the names
of the witneſſes ſubſcribed to every
part.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If there be any interlining, or
raſure in the Will, let there be made
a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If you make any revocation
of your Will, or of any part of it, do
it by writing, by good adviſe; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115195:88"/>
revocations by Wills, inſue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
ſome of the Witneſſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
of it in one manner, and
others in another manner. Reader,
you may obſerve, that the ſcope of
my labour herein, is to avoid as
much as may be, all unneceſſarie
ſtrifes &amp; debates whatſoever, which
made me add likewiſe theſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning making of Wills;
which if well obſerved and followed,
will prevent many contentious ſuits,
and debates in Law, and much tend
to the peace and good of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
