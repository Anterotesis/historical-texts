         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that miserable is the
state of mankinde in
this life. For we doe
both come into the
world in paine; and liue in cares; and die
with griefe. Our bodies are subiect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde
infirmities; and perils: &amp; our minds
to innumerable vngodlie perturbations.
Our whole life is verie trouble som; &amp; how,
or where, or when we shal depart out of this
worlde, it is vncertaine.</p>
            <p>And although this condition be alike to
the iust, and to the wicked; to the good,<note place="margin">The great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in this world</note> and
to the pure, and to the polluted<note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 9, 2.</note>: yet none do
feele the smart hereof so extremelie as the
vpright dealers in the world, and such as


<pb facs="tcp:27044:3"/>
vnfeinedlie be religious. For theie are for
the most part oppressed, when the wicked
haue fauour; there impouerished, when the
wicked encrease in wealth; theie impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
when the wicked are at libertie; and
theie grieuouslie afflicted, when the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
do triumph.<note place="margin">The troubles of the godlie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maie them sometimes.</note> This good men obserue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie-times,
and it dismaieth them not a litle.
As it did both King Dauid, &amp; also the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Ieremiah, when the one said<note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 73, 2.</note>, My feet
were almost gone, my steps had welnere slipt.
For I fretted at the foolish,<note place="margin">3.</note> when I saw the

bands in their death, but theie are lustie &amp;
strong.<note place="margin">5.</note> Theie are not in trouble as other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
neither be theie plagued with other men.
Therefore pride is as a chaine vnto them,<note place="margin">6.</note>
and crueltie couereth them as a garment.
Their eies stand-out for fatnes;<note place="margin">7.</note> theie haue
more than their heart can wish.<note place="margin">8.</note> Theie are
licentious, &amp; speake wickedlie of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression:

and hath laide-vp vnspeakeable blessings

before the sonnes of men; and in the end too
wil aduance them vnto euerlasting glorie,
honor, and peace<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 2, 10.</note>. The wicked also in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
these things must needes be terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from much wickednes. For the verie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
when theie remember the iudgements
of the Lord do tremble againe<note n="h" place="margin">Iam. 2, 19.</note>.</p>
            <p>Wherefore especialie (for other causes
I haue elsewhere specified in this my booke)<note place="margin">The occasion whie this Booke was written.</note>
both for the comfort of the one sorte, and
for the terror of the other, I haue written
this treatise following, wherein out of the
worde of God I haue proued, not onelie
that God wil (which thing manie Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istes
doe doubt, and manie vtterlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie)
but also that God presentlie doth iudge
this worlde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27044:6"/>
For which causes I haue intitled the same,
<hi>THE GENERAL SESSIONS,</hi> because
there is not a man, whom God doth not; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shal there be anie, whome he wil not
iudge. At which iudgement howe he wil
deale with vs, we are ignorant; what he
maie do in his iustice, we know ful wel.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as that good King, of an
Heathen Prince, Philip of Macedon in his
cheefe prosperitie thought it the readiest
waie to deteine him both from insulting
proudlie ouer his vanquished enimies the
Athenians: and from oppressing tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calie
his distressed subiectes the Grecians, if
he were tolde euerie morning that he was a
man; and as the noble men of Aethiopia
had alwaies whensoeuer there went abrode,
a crosse, and a basen of golde filled ful with
earth born before them, that the one might
put them in remembrance that earth must
be resolued into earth, and the other renue
the memorie of Christ his passion; and as
the Aegyptians at al their solemne ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
had the image of death laide before
their faces, that the sight thereof might
withdrawe them from defiling themselues


<pb facs="tcp:27044:6"/>
with those vices which commonlie doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
after rioting, and bellie-cheere; and
finalie as S. Ierome, whether he did eate, or
drinke, or whatsoeuer he did, seemed to
heare the terrible trompet sounding vnto
iudgement: so the readiest waie to please
God, and to auoide his heauie indignation,
is, in our prosperitie while the euil daies
come not, euerie morning with Philip to cal
into minde that we are men; when we are
abrode with the noble men of Aethiopia to
thinke that we are but earth; in our fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinges
and triumphes, with the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to fore-think what we shalbe; and with
good S. Ierome in whatsoeuer we are doing
to remember that a iudgement there must
be, yea and is neere at hand, at which God
wil bring euerie worke into iudgement with
euerie secrete thing whether it be good or
euil<note n="i" place="margin">Eccles. 12, 14.</note>. For theie which cal into minde what
theie haue bine, haue theie anie grace, wil
blush; what theie are, wilbe humble; what
theie maie be, wil tremble.</p>
            <p>And this treatise,<note place="margin">Causes of this dedication.</note> Right Honorable, I
thinke most meete to come from your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors

that I haue bine bound vnto your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
for manie great wordes of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which it hath pleased you to giue me,

I found at your Honors handes, and that
when I least looked for the same: the Lorde
requite you for it, and make me thankeful.</p>
            <p>Secondlie in respect of the highnes of
your calling. For being, as you are appointed
the chiefest Iusticer vnder God and her
Maiestie in this realme, mee thinkes none
either ought sooner to be a reader, or wil
more gladlie be a patron, of God his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

            <p>Last of al, in respest of their profite, who
are inferior persons both in the Church and
common-weale. For sure I am, the more
your Honor calleth into minde, which thing
your wisedome cannot be ignorant of, the
condition of the godlie in this life, the more
you wil being their special Patron by office
administer both comfort vnto them, which
theie haue neede of; and encouragement,
being manie waies by the wicked, which
make a praie of them, dismaied, while there

beseeching both your Honor in good part to

perished,<note place="margin">7.</note> and ouerflowed with water. But the
heauens, and earth which are nowe, are kept
by the same word in store, and reserued vnto
fire against the daie of iudgement, and of the
destruction of vngodlie men.</p>
            <p>In which wordes among other nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pointes, these are chiefelie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
for this place. First, the speakers,
who they are; secondlie, the arguments
which they do vse; thirdlie, the answere
of the Apostle; last of al, the manner of
the worlds destruction.</p>
            <p>The enimies of this doctrine are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
here to be <hi>mockers,</hi> such as deride
al religion; and <hi>walke after their lustes,</hi> not
according to Gods word. Therfore none
wil impugne this comfortable doctrine,
but such as are meere Epicures for their
leude conuersation, and Atheists for their
diuelish opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One argument which they doe vse, is
this:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Argument.</note> Since the fathers died, al thigns conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:27044:15"/>
alike from the beginning of the creation.
Therefore they shal continue after vs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our posteritie too at one staie, as they haue
done, neither is there anie iudgement to bee
feared, nor resurrection to be hoped for.</p>
            <p>Vnto this vngodlie assertion the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
answereth by an argument taken
from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vndoubted historie of the floud.<note place="margin">S. Peters an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistes.</note>
which historie, he saith, they against their
conscience denie, who be of opinion that
the world shal haue none end. For he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
that euer the worlde was drowned
with water, who denieth that the worlde
shalbe destroyed: yea, he thinketh that
the Raine-bowe, <hi>which is the signe of the
couenant betweene God and vs</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 9, 13.</note>, is but à
toie to mocke men with al. For we are to
thinke, and learne vndoubtedlie by that
great punishment, First, that the worlde
and al therein, was made to serue for the
vse of the godlie and virtuous, not of the
wicked; and that the saincts of God euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastinglie
shal enioie the same, the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
being cast into vtter condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Secondlie we must thinke, that God as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredlie
wil punish wickednes, although
he haue promised, and the Raine-bowe
doth witnes, that he wil not ouerwhelme


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27044:16"/>
the world again with an vniuersal floud,
but consume it with fire. For which cause
he hath set diuers colors in the Rain-bow<note place="margin">Colors of the Raine-bow, and what they signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</note>
as blew principalie, and red: whereof the
one sheweth howe it hath bene drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the other howe it shalbe consumed
with fire.</p>
            <p>At these things, saith Peter, doe these
Atheists and Epicures euen contrarie to
their verie conscience, denie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there needeth none other confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but onelie to laie before them either
the historie of Noahs floud, or the Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe
in the cloudes. For beholding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, they cannot choose but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that the world must haue an ende.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another of their arguments,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Argument.</note> 
               <hi>is this:</hi>
Had God minded to bring the world vnto an
end, he would haue done so before this. But
seing it hath continued these 5500. yeres, &amp;
vpwarde: likelie it is that euermore it shal
endure.</p>
            <p>Thus do they miserablie deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,<note place="margin">Answere.</note>
saith Peter in effect, not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that God being eternal, is not enclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within the compasse of anie time. <hi>For
one daie is with the Lorde as a thousande
yeares</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">2. Pet. 3, 8.</note> 
               <hi>and a thousande yeares, as one daie.</hi>
Therefore it followeth not, because hee


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27044:16"/>
differreth the destruction of the worlde,
that he wil not make an end thereof. <hi>But
hee is patient toward vs, and would haue no
man to perish, but would al men to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
repentance.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Whie the world hath continued to this daie.</note> The cause then whie it is

               <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 2, 4.</note>So did he spare the old world

so haue the wicked polluted this worlde

it must be purged with fire, that it maie

               <hi>God sent not his sonne into the world,

            <p>Against which their allegation I might

of our Sauiour Christ,<note place="margin">A twofold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ.</note> à first, and à se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde;
the first is past, the seconde is to

            <p>The principal cause of his first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming<note place="margin">Whie Christ came in the flesh.</note>

saie: <hi>He affirmeth this present

cleare, and righteous iudgement of God.</hi> By
which I gather, either that their doctrine
is but newlie vp-start, and so afore this
time that God had no Church; or if theie
grant, that it hath from time to time, and
from hand to hand euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
beene deliuered, that the daie of
iudgement was alwaies, which is impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

Let them take which parte theie wil, as
one of them theie must, they shal see how
theie runne into manie, and absurde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</p>
            <p>If their doctrine hath beene from the

from the beginning. For when their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
peeped-foorth, the iudgement ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
But that the iudgement hath bin
alwaie, I thinke theie wil not saie.</p>
            <p>Therefore their doctrine is but newe.
And if it bee but newe, then is not the
same, which the olde Patriarches, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and Apostles preached, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
and wherebie theie were saued. And
being not the same, it must of necessitie

&amp;c. hath bin manifested from the beginning?</hi>
And yet were it shameful and vile here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to saie so. For what godlie man euer
was of that opinion? Or howe by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

but that the lie in his lieng being shoulde
be restored,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3, 13.</note> I finde no mention neither
in the worde of God, nor in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges
of godlie men. And therefore in
my iudgement it is à great error to saie
so.</p>
            <p>And the rather I thinke it, because I
neuer finde that à restoring shalbe made
of things either absolutely good, or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
euil: but of things indifferent. For
neither can virtue bee turned into vice,
nor vice into virtue; trueth cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
falsehoode, nor falsehoode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
trueth. No, theie cannot degenerate
in anie sort from their verie natures. And
therefore à restitution cannot be made of
them, as though theie had changed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into others nature. But man for that
being left in his owne handes to chuse
either good or euil, he left that good was
and followed the contrarie, hee must be
restored vnto his first integritie: and the
creatures which haue serued to the lust
of man, theie shalbe renued.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, and last of al, the end of the
iudgement which theie faine,<note place="margin">3. Ende of the iudgement.</note> is, <hi>That


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:27044:26"/>
the wil of God maie be accomplished in earth
as in heauen.</hi> The grossenes of the former
mer pointes maie palpablie be percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and yet theie wil seeme more blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouslie
wicked, when the impietie
of this last clause is discouered.</p>
            <p>These thinges come to passe, saie the
Familie, <hi>That the wil of God maie be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
in earth, as in heauen.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie,
as I nowe sit, me thinkes theie i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
verie baselie, and grosselie of
the euent of this iudgement. Saint Paul
saith<note n="n" place="margin">1. Cor. 15, 28.</note>, <hi>When al thinges shalbe subdued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him,</hi> (meaning Christ) <hi>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal the sonne
also himselfe be subiect vnto him, that did
subdue al thinges vnder him, that God maie
be al in al.</hi> That God maie be al in al is
the euent of this iudgement, saith Paule:
that the wil of God maie be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in earth as in heauen, saie the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.
Thus are the Scriptures, and the
Familie of Loue cleane contrarie, not in
this point onelie, but in the other points
beside. For the Scripture saith, <hi>That in à
mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the twinkling of an eie</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">1. Cor. 15, 52.</note>, iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
shalbe: the Familie make it either euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
or of long continuance, &amp; saie that
<hi>Now it is.</hi> The scripture testifieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:27044:27"/>
and other creatures shalbe restored: the
Familie restraine it vnto the <hi>Lie in his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eing
being,</hi> and to the truth; of which there
is no mention in the Scripture. The scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
maketh nothing capable of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
felicitie, but the obedient seruantes
and sonnes of God: the Familie make vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
capable both of the same, &amp; of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
too; as though virtue could be
contrarie vnto virtue, that is, Trueth vnto
Righteousnesse, or Righteousnesse vnto
Trueth. Finalie the Scripture proueth
the ende of the iudgement to be, that
<hi>God maie bee al in al:</hi> the Familie wil
haue it, that the wil of God maie be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
in <hi>Earth, as in heauen,</hi> that is,
that theie maie leade à life answerable
vnto the forme which H.N. hath prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in this present worlde.</p>
            <p>For proofe of which my wordes I

            <p>Were it my minde to stande vpon

            <p>Nowe, by what auctoritie of scripture
doth H. N. proue that the iudgement is
nowe (for that would be considered?) His
principal places be taken out of the 24.
and 25. of Matthewe; the first and the
17. of the Actes; the 17. and the 21. of
Luke; the 2. Thessal. 1; and the Epistle
of Saint Iude. In al which places menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is made of the vtter destruction of the
worlde, and of the seconde comming of
our Sauiour vnto the general iudgement:
and proue as wel that the daie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is come as that text, where it is said:

AN hard thing it is to make flesh and

denie it; Samaritanes beleeue it not;
Heretikes saie it shal not be,</hi> And al of them
to proue their vane opinions doe bring
either reason, as theie thinke, or scripture.</p>
            <p>Their reasons are these. Man dieth, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
&amp; is eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-vp of wormes; which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

body so putrifieth, and perisheth, how can
it rise-again? Manie are drowned, and
deuoured of fishes, which fishes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

Howe then shal the whole bodie

which of purpose I ouer-passe,
theie bring-foorth to proue the impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie

which. S. Cyril as in other places christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anlie<note n="b" place="margin">Cyril catech 4, and 14.</note>;
so most diuinelie, in his 18. Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheis
doth answere to this effect:</p>
            <p>Thou which we beleeuest not those things
which are written concerning the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being carnalie minded, look-vpon earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and material thinges, and thou shalt see


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:27044:33"/>
most notable examples of the resurrection.
Beholde the seede which is sowen, how doth
it spring-afresh, and florish if it putrifie! if it
putrifie not, it would neuer spring. Which
seede is created for vs, and our vse, not for
it selfe. Shal therefore that which is made
for man, being euen dead spring-afresh; and
shal not man himselfe rise-againe when he is
dead?</p>
            <p>Looke somewhat higher vpon the trees,
consider them as theie are in the winter sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and consider them as theie are in Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
In the winter theie are dead without
both leaues and fruite: in the Sommer most
goodlie to beholde either with greene leaues,
or goodlie fruite, or with both. For God who
knoweth thine hardnes of heart, euerie yeere
setteth à resurrection before thine eies, that
by thinges without soule, thou mightest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuee
the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of reasonable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which

            <p>Looke higher yet vpon heauen, and thou
shalt finde à most euident proofe of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
The Moone sometime is in the
waine, and sometime at the ful: sometime it
is bright as daie, and sometime red as blood.
Which thing God doth, <hi>saith Cyril,</hi> that
thou man consisting of blood, shouldest not
doubt of the resurrection of the dead; and


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:27044:33"/>
that thou shouldest beleeue that of thie selfe,
which thou seest happen to the Moone in
heauen. <hi>With manie other both strong
and Christian arguments doth Cyril in
that fore-saide place ouerthrow the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe
opinion of fleshlie minded men, the
which, either because I studie to bee
brief, or for that I know these by me now
alledged be sufficient to preuaile with à
man anie whit reasonable, I omit: confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their error, &amp; concluding this point
with an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t place of Irenaeus, which

               <note n="c" place="margin">Irenaeus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersus haereses Valentini &amp;c. lib. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>Theie therefore denie the power of God,
and see not the trueth, who looke vpon the
weakenes of the flesh, and consider not his
power who raised it from the dead. For if
he doe not quicken that which is mortal, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make that incorrupt which is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
God is not almightie. But inasmuch as in
al these things he is mightie, we should think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
and cal into minde our beginning.
For God tooke duste of the grounde, and
made man. And vndoubtedlie more harde,
and incredible is it to make man, yea and à
liuing and reasonable man too of bones, and
sinewes, and veines, and forme which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was before; then to raise-againe that
which sometime was beeing dissolued into


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:27044:34"/>
earth, for those reasons aboue mentioned; yea,
though it returne vnto that, whereof at the
first he made him to be who was not, when he
thought good: much more wil he now, &amp; that
willinglie restore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe sometime were into
that life which he giueth. <hi>Hitherto Irenaeus.
The principal place of scripture wherby
theie would proue that the body shal not
rise-againe, is this</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 15, 50.</note>: Flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdome of God. <hi>Which place
maketh no whit to their purpose. For
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle in that whole chapter wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that text was taken, as no where else

the flesh. What therefore doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
meane by these words,</hi> Flesh and blood
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not inherit the kingdome of God? <hi>Is it that
so manie as are not regenerated by the

that of our Sauiour</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 3, 36.</note>, He that beleeueth
not, shal not see life, but the wrath of God
abideth vpon him? <hi>yes vndoubtedlie. Of
which iudgement Irenaeus is, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in these his wordes</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Irenaeus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersus haereses Valent. lib. 5.</note>: The Apostle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting

of his 2. epistle is wholie in à manner
to proue this article of christianitie. Now
seeing the Prophets, Christ himselfe, his
Angels, &amp; Apostles, who haue not lied
nor deluded men at any time before with
vane prophecies, haue foretold of à iudge
ment to come, the godlie doubtlesse wil
build their faith vpon their wordes, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialie
because theie al haue spoken therof,
moued thereunto by the spirite of God,
who cannot lie. Which testimonies maie
bring much good vnto al mankinde. For
first the godlie herebie in al their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
maie receaue great and vnspeakeable
comfort, considering that their afflictions


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:27044:38"/>
shal not alwaie endure, but that one daie,
when the Lord thinketh good, theie shal
be adorned with euerlasting glorie, and
life, according to his promises. This made
S. Paul to breake into these words<note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 8, 18.</note>: <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that the afflictions of this present time,
are not worthie the glorie, which shalbe shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto vs.</hi> Secondlie, the wicked hearing
these prophecies of the Lorde touching
the last iudgement, maie be terrified fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
displeasing so gratious à God, who of his
mercie hath reuealed what shal betide
the wicked and vngonlie, that theie maie
with heartie sobs and sorowe repent.</p>
            <p>Last of al, both good and bad maie
herebie as in à glasse beholde howe the
world neither is gouerned by chance, nor
shal endure euerlastinglie: but that, as the
old world, the sinnes of men being come
vnto ripenes, was drowned with water:
so the whole world, when iniquitie hath
gotten the vpper hand, shal perish and be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed with fire, Theie also, both good
and bad I meane, ought herebie to learne
so to set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in order by repentance,
that when theie shalbe summoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
at that general Assise, theie maie
boldlie stand in the presence of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Maiestie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:27044:38"/>
But beside these testimonies which I
haue aleaged,<note place="margin">6. From the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God.</note> there be sundrie other great
arguments of the worlds consummation.
For, the present condition of men in this
life is a manifest proofe that this worlde
cannot alwaie endure. For who are in
more prosperitie then the wicked; and
who more afflicted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the godlie in this
life? Therefore of necessitie there must be
a iudgement, where at both the vngodlie
are to be condemned for their wickednes,
and the virtuous to receaue rewardes for
their wel-doing. For euerie good master
to his power, wil prefer his good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants;
and euerie vpright iudge, wil quite
the innocent, and punish malefactors.
<hi>Is this vprightnesse among mortal men,</hi> saith
Cyril<note n="m" place="margin">Cyril. Catech. 18.</note>, <hi>and shal not God the immortal king
reward euerie man according to his workes?
Hee which otherwise thinketh, is in a wrong
opinion.</hi> For, as it is in à certaine Psalme
<note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 5, 4.</note>, <hi>God is not a God that loueth wickednesse,
neither shal euil dwel with him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">5.</note> 
               <hi>The foolish
shal not stande in his sight: for hee hateth
al them that worke iniquitie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">6.</note> 
               <hi>He shal destroie
them that speake lies. The Lorde wil ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
the bloudie man, and deceitful.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seing, though now &amp; then some; yet


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27044:39"/>
al the wicked are not destroied; there
must be à iudgement, at which al the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie
shal perish from the face of the
earth, and be damned. For the Lord nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can, because he is iust; neither wil,
for that he is holie, suffer his seruants, and
holie ones alwaie to be afflicted, alwaie
to be oppressed, to be kept in thraldome
and bondage of the reprobate alwaie.</p>
            <p>Let the wicked then consider that à
daie wil come when <hi>tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
shalbe vpon the soule of euerie man that
doth euil</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 2, 9.</note>. And though either through
policie, or friendship theie escape the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spleasure
of man: yet that they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
the wrath of God. For idolaters,
blasphemers, and al wicked persons God
wil iudge, though man do not: because he
is righteous.</p>
            <p>Further let them note, that though
they suffer, and that deseruedlie in this
worlde: yet if theie die impenitent, the
ende of their life, is but the beginning of
an euerlasting death. For God is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and wil punish most seuerely, vnles
his wrath be turned-awaie by the teares
of Christian repentance.</p>
            <p>Moreouer man punisheth outwarde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences:
but god outward and inward too.


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:27044:39"/>
Man executeth correction for one, or à
few: but God for al sinnes, which either
the heart<note n="p" place="margin">Math. 5, 21. 22. &amp;c.</note>, mouth<note n="q" place="margin">Math. 12, 36.</note>, or any member of
the bodie hath committed<note n="r" place="margin">2. Cor. 5, 10.</note>, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is righteous.</p>
            <p>Againe, the ende whie this worlde was
created,<note place="margin">7. From the end of the worldes creation.</note> is an vndoubted argument, that à
iudgement one daie must come. For it
was created onlie to serue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of the

Epicures. A iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therfore is to come,
whereby the wicked must be cast-into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
torments, that the godlie, and
none beside, maie enioie the creatures of

               <note place="margin">20.</note>

               <hi>from the bondage of corruption into the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

alleage such proofes for the affirmatiue
part, as no cause, I hope, shalbe left of
doubting, whether GOD hath care
of this seruants, or doe iudge mankinde in
this world.</p>

then hath he à fatherlie affection toward

God then doth not forget, naie he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but haue à care of the godlie, because
they are his children. If therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

earthlie fathers wil neglect their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
without extreme folishnesse thou
canst not saie, God neglecteth the godly:
because he is their father.</p>
            <p>Againe, is he their Lord? If thou saiest,


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:27044:42"/>
No, whie dost thou serue him? whie dost
thou feare him? whie doest thou dreade
his displeasure? if thou saiest, yea; then
doth he gouerne; and if he gouerne, hee
doeth iudge. For where à gouernement
is, there is also administration of iustice.
If therefore without great absurditie, it
cannot be denied y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is à Lord; without
foule absurdities thou canst not deny that
he iudgeth: because he is a Lord.</p>
            <p>If thou saiest, he is à Lord but in litle,

            <p>He gouerneth the world, thou wilt say,

listen, can God, thinkest thou, iudge the

Or wil he gouerne things senselesse, and
liuelesse, and neglect reasonable men?</p>
            <p>Againe, if he be à iudge, and yet doe no
iustice, what doest thou make him, but à

            <p>By himselfe the Lord also doth iudge

By this iudgement the Lord both taketh

            <p>Secretelie also the Lorde doth iudge,
when hee toucheth the minde of man
with the feeling of sinne and wickednes.
And this iudgement of God, if the holie
spirite be not assistant, is vnportable. For
herebie diuers haue desperatelie finished
their lines; as Kain, Iudas, and in our age
Franciscus Spira. By this iudgement di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

            <p>Last of al, when the wilful despisers

with Bernard<note n="n" place="margin">Bern. serm. ad milites, Cap. 11.</note>, <hi>It is that the trueth of God

and trueth, man is to die, because he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
that he should, &amp; yet shal rise-againe,

death although it beare not dominion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie:

as sinne although it nowe raigneth not in our

            </p>
            <p>The thirde manner of God his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is both by himself, &amp; by man too.
As when he not onelie suffreth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate

tormenteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minds of malefactors

robbed his owne master of that monie
which with great paines and toile he had
gathered for the reliefe of him and his in
necessitie: but also murthered, to make his
waie sure, first his felowe workman, then
à maide seruant, then his master, next his
mistres, and last of al à poore young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
à maiden childe, and being miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louslie
by God himselfe apprehended at
Ratisbone à citie distant from Vienna 50
Germane miles, deliuered into the hands
of the magistrate, by them conueied to
the place where that horrible fact was
perpetrated, and there, according to the
lawes of that countrie, adiudged vnto à
most bitter death, amid his paines, which
were most greeuous to fleshe and blood,
he openlie confessed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al his bodilie tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
did not so much afflict his flesh, as
the last wordes of the poore infant and
innocent, whome among the rest he had
murthered, did torment his minde. For
when he came with bloodie hands to kil
her, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sweet babe entreated him earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:27044:51"/>
do not thou kil me, and thou shalt haue al my
poppets whensoeuer thou wilt.</hi> Those words
from the time hee had murthered her,
were as corosies at his heart; and at his
death as the paines of hel to his soule: so

whome God in his iustice one waie or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;

conscience, or by casting him of into à re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
minde; either by sickenes, or by

to haue à guiltie conscience, is an heauie

Lorde, and possessed of Satan, is of al the
sorest plague, which can fal-vpon man in
this world; aduersitie also is à grieuous
punishment, but that prosperitie can be à
crosse, that is a Paradoxe in the opinion
of the world. I grant it is so. For so theie
haue alwaies thought. Therefore the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
with Cicero; the enimies of Iob, &amp;
the aduersaries of Paul in their owne eies
were; &amp; the Turks as theie thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
are happie. And why? The Romans
had al the world as it were in subiection,
Iob his enimies liued at their heartes ease,
Paul his aduersaries were not touched
with aduersitie, as theie thought, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turks
doe florish. Wheras contrariwise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes
with Cicero, Iob euen of his friendes,
Paul of the barbarous people, Christians
of the Turkes, are iudged accurssed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:27044:52"/>
But whie? <hi>The nation of the Iewes are van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished,
are carried from their natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie;
are deteined in captiuitie,</hi> said Cicero<note n="a" place="margin">Cicero Orat. pro L. Flacco.</note>.
Iob was in miserie; <hi>And who euer perished
being an innocent? or when were the godlie
destroied?</hi> saide the fained friends of Iob<note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 4, 7.</note>.
Paul had a viper vpon his hande; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is à murtherer, and though hee haue
escaped the sea, yet vengance wil not suffer
him to liue,</hi> saide barbarous people<note n="c" place="margin">Acts 28, 4.</note>. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are but fewe for number, and for
power nothing so mightie as they haue
bene; theie endure much affliction and
trobles in respect of others; <hi>therefore they
are not the sonnes of God,</hi> saith Mahomet<note n="d" place="margin">Azoara 12.</note>.</p>
            <p>These are the rash, and sinister opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the world. When god sendeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
hee loueth; but when aduersitie
doth come, hee hateth. But the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
are of an other minde. For albeit when
such as feare God enioie prosperitie, they
thinke it an argument of his fauor: yet
when the wicked haue the same, in their
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it is a token of his displeasure.
Therefore Augustine in à certaine place
doth saie, <hi>The men of this world are vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilie
happie,</hi> that is, in their wealth theie are
poore; in their health, sicke; and in their
felicity, they are accurssed. For when the


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:27044:52"/>
Lord seemeth not to be angrie at al with
the wicked, he is most displeased. So Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard<note n="e" place="margin">Bern. super Cantic serm. 41</note>,
<hi>when God is not angrie,</hi> as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke,
<hi>he is most angrie.</hi> And this may appeare to
be true both in the Romans, in respect of
the Iewes; in Iob his friends, as they were
called, in respect of Iob; in the barbarous
people in respect of Paul; and in the
Turkes at this day in respect of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
For who were out of God his fauour
more than the Romans; than Iobs friends;
than Paul his aduersaries: and who more
miserable in deede than the Turkes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their prosperitie? And such
is the state of the wicked at al times.</p>
            <p>Then whie doth the Lorde suffer the
wicked in the sight of men to florish?<note place="margin">Whie the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked do florish.</note> and
whie doth hee not in iustice confounde
them speedilie, and vtterlie?</p>
            <p>Sundrie reasons may be giuen hereof.
For either of his wisedome he thinketh
it no due time as yet to punish them;
or of his mercie he spareth them, because
they shoulde repent; or in his iustice hee
hath quite forsaken them. In his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
he spared Sodome, vntil the sinnes
therof were exceeding ripe, and cried-up
to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vengeance<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 18, 21.</note>: in his mercie he
spared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old world an hundred &amp; twenty


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:27044:53"/>
yeeres, that theie might amende g: in his
iustice oftentimes he spareth the wicked
in this present world, because he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them ouer into reprobate minds, and
reserued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer-during torments in
the life to come. So doe good Physicions
suffer such to haue their wils with-out
gaine-saying them, who are past recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
But, as they who are so desperatelie
sicke in bodie, are nigh vnto death: so
they whom God for saketh, and leaueth
to their owne hists, are nigh vnto damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And as calues the fatter they be, the
nigher they are to be killed; and as trees
the bigger there are, &amp; the more vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the nighter to bee hewen-downe: so
the prosperitie of the vngodlie, is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
argument of their destruction at
hande. Which punishment of their shal
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by so much be the more grieuous &amp;
intolerable, by howe much the time was
great before the Lord executed his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Phatao is a notable example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For hee was long spared, but at the
length ouerwhelmed in the red sea<note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 14, 21. 22.</note>.
So is Balthasar,<note place="margin">Psal. 78, 13.</note> who in the middes of<note place="margin">Wisd. 15, 19.</note>
his iolitie came to destruction<note n="i" place="margin">Dan. 5, 29. 30.</note>. But
they which are best knowen, and most

But, for that they haue the feare of God
alway before their eies, and thinke-upon
the valor-both of religion, &amp; virtue, they
chuse rather to be afflicted for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
sake, then either for wickednes to be
aduanced, or that the glorie of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
should be blemished. Herebie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
endure displeasure, which might haue
fauor; manie suffer pouertie, which might
be rich; manie be obscure, which might
be of countenance; and manie are in great
aduersitie, that might doe wel in the

Whereof it is that theie doe, yea it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

as Lactantius noteth<note n="g" place="margin">Lactant. de diuino praemio. cap. 5.</note>. For, it is verie
hard to be holie in this worlde, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie

<hi>theie beate downe their bodies,</hi> that their

            <p>Furthermore, insomuch as the diuel
is for power mightie, in that hee is à
Prince<note n="l" place="margin">Iohn. 14, 30. Iohn. 16, 11.</note>; and his hatred is deadlie, because
there is enimitie betweene his seede and
the godlie<note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 3, 15.</note>; and his crueltie vnsatiable,
being à dracon<note n="n" place="margin">Reuel 20, 2.</note>; and his subtleties ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde,
because he is a serpent<note n="o" place="margin">Ruel. 12, 9. Reuel. 20, 2,</note>: mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
it is not, though the saincts of God

            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:27044:55"/>
Notwithstanding whatsoeuer the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
doth against them,<note place="margin">Power of Satan what.</note> it is because God
doth either sende him, or suffer him. And
therefore although his hatred, be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
his crueltie, extreeme; and his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties,
past finding-out: yet can he doe
nothing to hurt the godlie, without God
permit. So that his wil is nought, but
his power is good. For his wicked wil is
of himselfe: but he hath no power, but
from God. Which power notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Lorde alwaies doth moderate,
that of his malice he cannot afflict, more
than the wil of God is, he shoulde. This
maketh the godlie neither to feare the
power, nor to set à rushe by Sathan for
al his malice. Because he can do nothing
but by sufferance.</p>
            <p>God also himselfe doth bring the
godlie into troubles, and that as afore I
said, partlie of his wisedome, and partlie
of his iustice. In his wisedome he doth
correct them for diuers ends. First to trie
whether theie are such indeede as theie
would seeme to be. For manie doe both
thinke themselues, and are thought also,
to be valiant Christians, who in the time
of tentation are but verie cowardes. And
therefore, as when warre is hot, men are


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:27044:56"/>
proued, whether theie haue hearts or no:
So affliction sheweth who is the faithful
Christian. <hi>For God proueth them, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them meete for himselfe</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Wisd. 3, 5.</note>. <hi>He trieth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as gold in the fornace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; receiueth them
as à perfect fruite offering.</hi> He hideth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
oftentimes, and turneth-awaie
his face, but not in wrath: <hi>It is to trie,
not to destroie them</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Bern. serm. in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</note>. Yet trieth he not
Christians the better to know them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
For he both knew them before
theie were fashioned in the wombe<note n="s" place="margin">Psal. 139, 15. 16.</note>; and
continnalie beholdeth the secretes of
mans hearte<note n="t" place="margin">1. Sam. 16, 7. Psal. 7, 9. Act. 15, 8.</note>. But that both theie
them selues, &amp; others also should see what
theie are.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, to bring them into his
feare. Because in prosperitie euen the
righteous oftentimes forget the Lord: but
in aduersitie theie remember him. For
as the starres do shine in the night, but in
the day time are not seene: so the virtues
of men which in prosperitie appeare
not, in aduersitie are most glorious to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde.
And then theie see both the
frailtie of their owne nature, and theie
acknowledge it; and the vnspeakable
mercie of God, and theie commende it;
and the general miserie of mankinde, and


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:27044:56"/>
theie bewaile the same. This made the
Prophet to saie<note n="u" place="margin">Psal. 77, 2. 3.</note>, <hi>In the daie of my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
I sought the Lorde; my sore ranne, and
ceased not in the night: my soule refused
comfort. I did thinke vpon God, and was
troubled: I praied, and my spirite was ful
of anguish.</hi> Againe<note n="x" place="margin">Isa. 26. 16.</note>, <hi>Lord, in trouble they

               <hi>It is good for

            <p>Thirdly, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they may be like vnto Christ;
and that partelie because he is their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest

               <note n="z" place="margin">Luke. 24, 26.</note>, wherefore the yonger,

               <note place="margin">19.</note> but


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:27044:57"/>
à greate praise is it for seruantes rightlie
to follow the steppes of their Lordes. It
sufficeth the disciple to be as his master;
and for the seruant to be as his Lorde.
And partlie, because theie are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to follow his steppes. For so saith
Peter<note n="c" place="margin">1. Pet. 2, 21.</note>, <hi>Here vnto ye are caled. For Christ
also suffered for vs, leauing vs an ensample
that we shoulde followe his steppes.</hi> And
Paul<note n="d" place="margin">2. Tim. 2, 11 12.</note>, <hi>If we be dead with him, we also shal

liue with him; and if we suffer not after
his ensample temporal affliction, we shal
not reigne with him in eternal felicitie.</p>
            <p>Fourthlie, that both themselues should

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:27044:57"/>
therfore theie persecuted the Prophets,

            <p>Fiftlie, to put them in mind what they

<hi>howe bitter is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

it is to be considered, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saints

By the carnal generation, <hi>their flesh

            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore to conclude mine answere

So long as through patience we hope for the

            <p>
               <hi>Moreouer they reason thus,</hi> It is the
commandement of God,<note place="margin">The Maior.</note> Do this, that is, fulfil
the commandements, and thou shalt liue<note n="u" place="margin">Luke 10, 28. Leuit 18, 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>The saints doe liue, that is, in the eies of
God they are blessed.<note place="margin">The Minor.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo they fulfil the commandementes of
God.<note place="margin">The conclusion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereunto I answere, first the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is false. For it is no good reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> They
should, therefore theie doe keepe the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:27044:64"/>
               <hi>or,</hi> they are commaunded to fulfil,
therefore they do fulfil the lawes of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the commaundementes are
fulfilled two manner of waies; by Christ,
and by our selues. By our selues we could
neuer keepe them; and therefore Christ
hath fulfilled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on our behalfe. For (<hi>that
that was vnpossible to the lawe,</hi> saith Paul
<note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 8, 3.</note>, <hi>in asmuch as it was weake, because of the
flesh) God sending his own sonne in the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of sinful flesh, and for sinne, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned sin
in the flesh, that the righteousnes might bee
fulfilled in vs, which walke not after the flesh,
but after the spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Last of al vnto the minor, I saie, The
saints do liue, but not through any righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
which they haue done, or for
their keeping the Lawe, it is <hi>by their faith</hi>
in the bloude of Christ, for so saith
Paul<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 1, 17. Gal. 3, 11.</note>.</p>
            <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">The Antecedent</note> they obiect, <hi>The saints
be righteous:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo they do not sinne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The consequent.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be meant of the saints
in heauen, it is true: but if otherwise, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the same. For the saints in this world
be righteous, and yet sinners, Righteous,
because God accepteth them for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and righteous, not absolutelie, but in


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27044:64"/>
respect of other men. So was Noah righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
<hi>but in his generation</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 6, 9.</note>, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane
righteous, but <hi>rather than the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 18, 14.</note>,
and the spouse of Christ fairest, but
<hi>among women</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Sal. songe 1, 7</note>. And so the saints in this
world before others, rather than the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
among men, be righteous: but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
without al comparison righteous, or
without sinne they are not. For in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<hi>God onelie is holie</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Reuel. 15, 4.</note>; and <hi>there is none
good but one, euen God</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 19, 17.</note>. For <hi>no man liueth,
that sinneth not</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Eccles. 7, 22.</note>.</p>
            <p>Who then is righteous? Euen hee, as I
said, whom it pleaseth God to accept for
righteous. Who most righteous? He that
hath the greatest faith, and doth least of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.
Finallie to omit the rest of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
thus they argue:</p>
            <p>If the godlie do not obserue the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of God,<note place="margin">The Maior.</note> no man can fulfil them.</p>
            <p>But the commaundements of God may be
fulfilled,<note place="margin">The Minor.</note> because God prescribeth nothing to
be done of man, which is vnpossible to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
or in vane.</p>
            <p>Therefore the godlie do obserue them.<note place="margin">The conclusion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>How this argument hangeth together,<note place="margin">Aunswere.</note>
I wil not spende time to discusse: onelie
vnto the minor I saie, that the laws of god
are to be fulfilled. For both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27044:65"/>
being vnloaden from the burden of
sinful flesh, shal; and Christ in the flesh
hath kept them, not transgressing the lest
precept, nor any iote of them. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that which hee was able to doe,
man cannot do in this world: and yet are
the laws of God prescribed to man, not in
vane. Because manifold commodities do
spring thereof.</p>
            <p>For, first by the Lawe we gather how
there is God.<note place="margin">1.</note> Because it is vnpossible, that
those most true and certaine notices tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the difference of honest and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
thinges, expressed in the law, should
either be knowen, or continue without
the prouidence of some God.</p>
            <p>Againe by the Law we may learne the
disposition of God;<note place="margin">2.</note> as that he is al righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
al holie, merciful, true &amp;c. For, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the seedes and sparcles of those vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are in the mindes of man; and that it
is vnpossible that the cause can be worser
then the effect, it must needes be, that the
virtues commended to men in the Lawe
of God, and glitter somewhat in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
bee most gloriouslie, and singularly
in God himself. Neither may it be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but God by his Lawe doth shewe
himselfe what he is: euen as the ciuil laws


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27044:65"/>
of à countrie declare the inclination of
those men which made them.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">3.</note> by the Lawe of God we maie,
as in a glasse, behold to what end man at
the first was created, or in what à state
of perfection our first parentes Adam
and Euah were. For with such virtues
were they adorned, yea, and with such, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the state of this life, shal the saints of
God be endued withal, as the lawe exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth:
That is, both they did, and we shal,
both knowe God perfectlie, and serue
him zelouslie, and loue him and one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
faithfullie, hartelie, and blessedly.</p>
            <p>Againe, by the lawe we may see howe
filthilie we are polluted, and defiled with
sinne. Wherefore he that would knowe
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manifold spots, wrinckles, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mans nature, let him go vnto the
looking glasse of God his lawe, and he
shal easilie perceiue in the mind, à darke
ignorance of God; in the wil, à declining
from and loathing of true religion; in the
heart vitious affections; &amp; in al the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
an horrible deformitie.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">5.</note> by the Lawe we may knowe
what an ouglie, filthie, and abhominable
thing, sinne is. For saith Paul<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 7, 7.</note>. <hi>I knewe
not sinne, but by the Lawe. For I had not


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:27044:66"/>
knowen lust, except the lawe had saide, Thou
shalt not lust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6.</note> 
               <hi>by the Lawe we are brought
vnto Christ.</hi> For the Lawe, <hi>as noteth Paul</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 3, 24.</note>, was our pettie schoolemaster vnto Christ,<note place="margin">25.</note>
that we might bee made righteous by Faith.<note place="margin">26.</note>
But after that faith is come, we are no longer
vnder a scoolemaster. For yee are al the sons
of God by faith in Christ Iesus.</p>
            <p>The office of a pettie-schoolemaster, or
of an Vsher, as we cal him, is to teach; to
reforme manners; to correct; and to bring
vnto an head-master. Al which the Lawe
doth. For first it teacheth what God is,
and of what disposition; and what we
ought both to do, &amp; to leaue vndone. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie,
it is a rule for the directing of our
life. Thirdly, it correcteth, when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of god against the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent,
and condemneth. And last of al,
hauing laid-open the abhomination of
sinne, and the anger of God, it bringeth
vs vnto Christ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> headmaster, that of him
we maie learne howe to pacifie the wrath
of his almightie father.</p>
            <p>To conclude (for who is able to recite
al the benefits which it bringeth!)<note place="margin">7.</note> by the
Lawe of God, both euerie priuate man
may learne howe to leade à godlie life; &amp;
euerie publike person howe to gouerne


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:27044:66"/>
aright; and euerie state, condition, and
calling of men, how to please God. For
the cause of al enormities both publike
&amp; priuate, is the neglect or forgetting of
the holie commandements of the Lord.</p>

            <p>But whie reasteth the bodie, and goeth
not presently with the soule either vnto
ioie or paine? It is because neither the


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:27044:69"/>
sins of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked, are yet perfectly ripe;
nor the number of the faithful fulfilled.
For neither the wicked which haue died
since the beginning of the worlde shal
preuent those which are to come vnto
them in extreme tormentes: nor any of

            <p>Whie shal the bodie arise at al? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is easilie giuen. That whole man may
be rewarded according to his deserts: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
is, that as neither the soule without the
bodie did anie thing; nor the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the soule while it was aliue: so both
bodie and soule together maie receiue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the reward of wel doing, or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of sinne. For, <hi>we blaspheme with
the mouth; we pray with the mouth; we praise
God with the mouth. We are wanton with the
bodie; and we are chast with the bodie. Wee
pil and poll with the hand: and we giue almes
with the hand. &amp;c. Seeing then,</hi> saith Cyril<note n="d" place="margin">Cyril Catech. 18.</note>,
<hi>the bodie is à doer in al thinges, it shal reape
the fruit of his labour in the time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some wil saie, How are the dead raised

some other.<note place="margin">38.</note> But God giueth it a bodie at his
pleasure, euen to euerie seede his owne bodie.
&amp;c.<note place="margin">42.</note> So also is the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead. The
bodie is sowne in corruption, and is raised in
incorruption;<note place="margin">44.</note> It is sowen in dishonor, &amp; is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in glorie, it is sowen in weakenes, &amp; is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in power; It is sowen a naturall bodie, &amp; is
raised a spiritual bodie. <hi>Wherbie it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
howe the same bodie in substance which
we haue, but not in qualitie shal arise. For
the qualitie shalbe changed of the same.
Hereunto Cyril beareth witnes when he
saith</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Cyril Catech. 18.</note>; This bodie shal arise, but not subiecte
to infirmities, yet this same verie bodie, being
transformed into an incorruptible body.
Euen as iron burned in the fire, becommeth
fire. But more than so as the Lorde rising
knoweth best. This body than shal arise: but
not remaine as it is, but be eternal. It shal
not stand in neede either of meat to liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or ladders to climbe by: for it shal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
spiritual. A certaine glorious thing (<hi>it
shalbe</hi>), such as sufficientlie for theworthines
of the same ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be expressed. The righteous
shal shine as the sunne, as the moone &amp; as the
brightnes of the firmament. And God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
this incredulitie of man, hath giuen
to smale wormes bright bodies in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that therebie theie maie shine, to make
men by apparent thinges to beleeue that


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:27044:70"/>
which through hope we lookefor. For he that
canperforme a part, can also accomplish the
whole; and hee that hath made a worme to
shine with cleerenesse, can much more make
the iust to be glorious. So then we shal be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
hauing eternal, and al like bodies: but he
that is righteous shal receiue à celestial body,
that he maie accompanie the Angels; and he
that is wicked shal take an eternal bodie, by
which he maie suffer the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of sinnes,
and burne in fire, and yet neuer be consumed;
<hi>so Cyril.</hi>

Lymbus puerorum, Purgatorie, and Lymbus
Patrum. Hel, as saith Iauel<note n="i" place="margin">Iauel Philos. Chri. p. 8. Tract. 4. de felicit. Christ. cap. 3.</note>, is the lowest
place, &amp; there such as are damned for actual
and mortal sins, are in torments. Next aboue
that is Lymbus puerorum,<note place="margin">Opinion of the Papistes.</note> which is à place for
infants, that died either vncircumcised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the comming of Christ, or vnbaptized af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his resurrection. Next aboue that is Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,
à place where such are to be purged
as haue not sufficientlie repented in this life.
Next aboue that Lymbus patrum, where the
souls of such as died godli abode in peace, &amp;c.
<hi>Which</hi> Lymbus Patrum, <hi>as testifieth</hi> Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius

               <hi>out of Bonauenture,</hi>
was also called Abrahams bosome, &amp; Hel. It
was called Hel both because it was inferior,
and also for that after à sort it was à place of
miserie. It was called Lymbus, because the
punishment of lacking was there. And it was
called Abrahams bosome, for that there was
an expectation of glorie. And of this opinion is
Petrus de Tharantasia, Richardus de media
Villa, and Thomas de Herfordia. <hi>So Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius
Carthus.</hi> Which foure places, <hi>saith

are kept in à secrete place against the daie
of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: agreeing therin verie much
with the Dormitans aboue mentioned. In
this error also was Pope Iohn 20. But one
of these, which was Irenaeus, seemeth not
to be throghly resolued in this point. For
in another place of the foresaid Booke, he
hath these wordes<note n="o" place="margin">Irenaeus lib. 5. not far from the beginning.</note>: <hi>Wherfore the Priests,

are in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the throne of God, which

there shal my seruant be likewise. But the
Lord is in heauen: therefore the soules of the
faithful, whose bodies haue bine slaine, or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
without slaughter, be no where els but in
heauen.</hi> And afterwarde within three or
foure sentences he saith: <hi>For like as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of Abraham is called the receptacle, &amp;
hauen of saluation, into the which the soules
of them be receaued which had the faith of

which with true faith haue acknowledged

Bullinger. And D. Chytraeus<note n="t" place="margin">D. Chytraeus in 6. cap. Apoc.</note>: <hi>This is the
