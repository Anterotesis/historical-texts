            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving long obſerved that ever ſince we eſcaped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blown up by the <hi>POWDER-PLOT,</hi> we have never wanted <hi>Plots</hi> (by Fears and Jealouſies) to blow up our ſelves; And in ſtead of keeping out <hi>Popery</hi> from abroad, we have lost our <hi>Charity</hi> at home; and when that is gone, what will come in place thereof is a ſad and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal thing to conſider? Or what will at last become of Chriſtianity it ſelf? I did reſolve in the ſhades of ſolitude, (when a man is either <hi>Deus aut Daemon)</hi> to offer to the vulgar part of the world (ſo much now courted at this time, and taught new methods of mutiny and murmur) <hi>An Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to Almighty God</hi> to be made uſe of by them, as their hearts may be moved to it, which God grant.</p>
            <p>And I hope, as is ſaid of Manna, it may be fitted to every man's taſte, ſo eſpecially to ſuch as are ſeaſoned with the precious Balm of true Chriſtian love, which is accompanied always with Peace, Gentleneſs, Meekneſs, Temperance, and all other Chriſtian Graces; which I pray God may fill the hearts of all men.</p>

            <p>O ALMIGHTY and Everlaſting Lord God, the Father of the Faithful, and of their Seed, who lookeſt down from Heaven thy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place, and haſt ſeen the travels of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the weariſome toyl of the ſtock of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Take pity of the Sons of men, and let not the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ways call longer for Vengeance from thy Juſtice; But let thy mercy, Holy and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lord God, breath forth upon the remnant that is left.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42535:3"/>
Let it be known to the World it hath a Saviour, for whoſe ſake thou wilt ſpare it, and not for the ſake of thoſe that dwell therein. Cauſe the fierce waves of advers;ity and perſecution to ceaſe from overwhelming thy Church; and let the calm ſtill voice of thy moſt gracious and holy Spirit inſpire all thy people to embrace the tenor of thy moſt holy and peaceable Goſpel, in loving thee above all things, and their Neighbour as themſelves.</p>
            <p>Lord thou delighteſt not in Sacrifices nor with thouſands of Rams, or Ten thouſand of Rivers of Oyl, art thou pleaſed: <hi>Will I eat the Fleſh of Bulls, ſaith the Lord? or drink the Bloud of Goats?</hi> But thou requireſt of us to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly. This is thy Law which we have all tranſgreſled, and we have given thee in ſtead thereof the Services of ſtrange Fires, the Fruits of <hi>untempered Zeal,</hi> and <hi>uncharitable Perſwaſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We all cry out, <hi>We are thy Children and thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> and yet by our unbrotherly Affections it cannot appear we are the Children of one Father; nor by ſtrange and different Duties that we are the Servants of one Lord. What ſhall then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us, if thou (O Lord) deal with us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our deſervings? The whole Earth is corrupt before thee.</p>

               <hi>There is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> Nation ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom; and the love of all men is waxed cold.</p>
            <p>The Rulers are not ruled by thy moſt Holy Law: The Sun is gone down over the Prophets, who make the People to err, biting with their lips, and cry <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> when War is in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Thy Houſes are laid waſte as a plowed Field, and the holy places of thy worſhip polluted with the ſins of men: The Son diſhonoureth the Father, and the Daughter riſeth up againſt her Mother; and <hi>a man's Enemies are thoſe of his own Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lord into what a Deluge of ſin are we caſt by our vile corruptions, which cry every day (like one deep upon another) for a Deluge of thy Judgments, if in the Days of Vengeance thou didſt not remember Mercy!</p>
            <p>VVherefore (O moſt gracious and merciful Lord God, who didſt preſerve the Ark amongſt the mighty waters, and hadſt compaſſion upon <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family in the midſt of <hi>Sodom)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look down, we beſeech thee, on the Troubles and Afflictions of thy Church, lying under thy moſt heavy Rod.</p>
            <p>Have mercy upon her, and ſuffer not her great and powerful Enemies, the VVorld, the Fleſh and

the Devil, to diſtract or divide her Members from her head Chriſt Jeſus; But let the Doctrine and Example of thy Son, reconcile all differences, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing among all Chriſtian People.</p>
            <p>Let not the variety of mens Minds and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, any more than the variety of their Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Cuſtoms and Manners, break the Bonds of Charity and brotherly Love among Members of the ſame Body, Subjects of the ſame Kingdom, and Brethren of the ſame Houſhold of Faith.</p>
            <p>It is true, O Lord, that thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall come;</hi> but thou haſt pronounced a wo to thoſe by whom they do come.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt foretold thy Church of her calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and that one effect of thy coming ſhould be to ſend a Sword, and not Peace.</p>
            <p>But we acknowledge, O Lord, (and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Face do we acknowledge and confeſs,) That all theſe, even all theſe great Evils are come upon us from the Principle of our moſt vile and corrupt Natures, perverting thy moſt holy word, to ſerve the variable ends of Humane Intereſts and Paſſions.</p>
