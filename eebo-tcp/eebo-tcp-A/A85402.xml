         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the nature of the writing, and upon what terms you publiſhed it, might you not rather have ſtiled it, <hi>A defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr.</hi> Jo Goodwin? I confeſſe I finde a few lines in it, of ſome affinitie with part of a letter, which about ten or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven daies ſince was brought to me by an unknown Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, from a (then) unknown Authour, and who at that time
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117256:3"/>
judged it a point of wiſdom to veile his name (though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after it ſeems he <hi>condemned himſelf of iniquitie, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableneſſe</hi> in judgement, by proclaiming his name upon the houſe top) but ſuch a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> as this unleſſe Charitie in her more then humane exaltation be the interpreter, will not ſave the credit of ſuch a title from the diſparagement of an untruth. Concerning this Letter, you tell me (pag. 5. of your printed paper) that <hi>God did not give me the grace to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the friendly purpoſe of him that ſent it,</hi> (therein expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) <hi>with ſutable friendlineſſe, but ſuffered me to reject it with this ſlighting, if not ſcornfull anſwer, that I would make no anſwer to the letter of an unknown Perſon.</hi> But Sir, upon this accompt I muſt crave leave to tell you (I know not how you and your meſſenger will agree in dividing the ſhame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you) that I <hi>rejected</hi> not <hi>any friendly purpoſe</hi> of yours, nor any other mans, with any <hi>ſlighting,</hi> or <hi>ſcornfull return.</hi> My anſwer to your Meſſenger was to this effect, that if the Gentleman, who ſent the letter, would pleaſe at any time to repaire unto me, I was ready to give him the beſt ſatisfaction I could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that it was contrary both to my minde and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to return anſwers in writing to the letters of unknown perſons, refuſing to truſt me with their names.

not my <hi>Grammar)</hi> you mean, that it manifeſtly contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etth what I affirm herein, ſuffer me in a few words to ſhew you how <hi>vain your rejoycing</hi> is in this behalf: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that I ſpeak nothing in the paſſage, concerning, much leſſe againſt, any judiciarie triall of, or legall proceedings againſt Kings, is cleare; firſt, becauſe in the very firſt words of the paſſage, which lead the ſenſe of the whole, I uſe the expreſſion of <hi>offering violence to the Perſon of a King, or attempting to take a way his Life</hi> [viz. <hi>by violence]</hi> Now the <hi>taking away of the life</hi> a malefactour, by the hand of Juſtice, in a due and regular proceſſe of law, was never (I beleeve) by any man, termed the <hi>offering of violence</hi> to <hi>his Perſon.</hi> Secondly, that unlawfulneſſe of <hi>offering violence to the Perſon of a King,</hi> which I here inſinuate, I oppoſe to the known Doctrine and Practice of the Jeſuites. Now the manner and methord of <hi>offering violence to the Perſons, or of taking away the lives of Kings</hi> which the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> both teach and practiſe, is known to be, not by bringing them to a judiciall tryall, or upon evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of matter of fact againſt them, deſerving death, but by wayes of aſſaſination, poyſoning, and ſuch extrajudiciall and murtherous practiſes. Thirdly, for the proofe of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which I here plead, of <hi>taking away the lifes of Kings,</hi> I mention <hi>Davids conſcience ſmiting him, when he came but ſo neer the life of a King, as the cutting off the lap of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This alſo plainly ſhews, that the unlawfulnes of <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the lives of Kings,</hi> which I here maintain, onely reſpects the fact as perpetrated, or to be perpetrated, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, or out of a courſe of publique Juſtice. For <hi>David,</hi> when his <hi>Conſcience ſmote him</hi> upon the occaſion ſpecified, was a private man. Now for me to argue thus; a private man and without due proceſſe of law, ought to make conſcience of taking away the life of a Malefactor, how worthy ſo ever to die; therefore a Magiſtrate upon evidence of the fact in a legall way, ought to make conſcience of it alſo, were to beat the aire, or to give water inſtead of wine. Fourthly, by the tenor of the objection, whereunto the paſſage under conteſt is reponed by way of Anſwer (in part) the relation and proportion between which, is <hi>ſoon</hi> ſeen in the diſcourſe it ſelf (though it would be ſomewhat <hi>long</hi> here to argue it) it evidently appears that the ſaid paſſage looketh

But Sir, give me leave to ſay, that if thoſe grounds and principles of Reaſon and Religion, which I aſsertin my diſcourſe, and upon which the whole fabrique of it is built, be firſt in themſelves ſolid and cleere: and ſecondly doe with alike ſoliditie and cleereneſs, contradict and overthrow that judgement of yours, which you ſuppoſe to have been ſometimes mine with you; then I have already performed that hard taske, which upon your ſuppoſall of the alteration of my judgemennt, you impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; and have <hi>given you and others,</hi> ſuch <hi>reaſons, which may,</hi> and ought to <hi>ſatisfie all reaſonable men touching ſuch an alteration of judgement</hi> in me.</p>

I aſsert, doe contradict and overthrow that judgement of yours (ſuppoſedly mine <hi>quondam)</hi> this is (in a manner) as unreaſonable, as the former.

If you ſhall yet pretend and ſay, that what you deſire of me to vindicate my ſelfe, is obvious, and eaſie to be done, being no more but this, that I would declare, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I conceive, or apprehend, that ſuppoſed former judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mine concerning the untouchableneſſe of the lives of Kings, to bee conſiſtent with thoſe grounds and principles, which I build upon in my late diſcourſe: I muſt again anſwer, that ſuch a thing as this is indeed eaſie to be done, but no ways honourable or comely, for me in this, nor for any man elſe to doe in the like caſe.
