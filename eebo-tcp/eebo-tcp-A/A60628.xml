         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter the long Night of Apostacy had overspread the Earth, and the gross Darkness of it covered and remained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people, and that none could be found among the Sons of men to lead and deliver out of it; then did the Lord manifest himself from Heaven, and the Light began to spring as the morning, and to give light to such as sat in darkness, and under the shadow of death; and though many travelled in pain, as being soarly opprdssed by the power of darknes; yet when the Lord did manifest his Light, and his Love in it, there were not many could believe that it was he, and so they received him not, though he came unto them for their good, <hi>But to as many as received him to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, even to as many as believed in his Name, which were born, not of Flesh, nor of Blood, nor of the will of man, but of God;</hi> and so the Love of God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in sending his only begotten Son into the World, to be a Light unto the World, that all in him might believe and receive Life; but that which is born of Flesh and Blood, and of the will of man doth not believe that the Light is he whom God sendeth, and therefore receives him not in his Light, when he makes himself manifest; for that nature expecteth some higher or greater ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Christ then in his Light; but as <hi>John</hi> bare witness of Christ to be the true Light, so his appearance is not to be expected after any other manner, or in any other thing; for whatsoever is contrary to that which is true, is false, and there is but one thing true (or Truth it self) and that <hi>John</hi> testifies to be the Light with which Christ enlighteneth every one that comes into the World, and as the Light is true, (or Truth it self) so the expectation is to be drawn off from all other things as being false, and the mind is to turn to the Light as being only true; and though it seem as a low or little thing in its manifestation, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which in it self is true besides it, and therefore most worthy of all things to be loved and obeyed in the least appearance of it;


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52588:3"/>
for who dispises the day of small things cannot come to the day of glory, where the Son ruleth; and here many have suffered loss as to the benefit which in the Light they might have received and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, for not loving and obeying the appearance or breaking forth of the Light in a small measure, it doth not go on in such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect day, but being despised as a small thing, or a thing of no value, it draweth into it self again the manifestation, and then none can see the way unto God, nor walk in the Path of Life; for the Light being dispised, and so withdrawing it self, there is nothing but darkness remains to be the Guide, and such as walks in darkness knows not whither they go, because darkness hath blinded their minds, and this hath been an occasion of stumbling unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who have not loved the Light, but despised it, for in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they stumble, and many times fall, but in the Light, which is the plain Path, there is no stumbling, and they that do not walk in that Path, but dispises it, and stumbles at it, they walk in the broad way, and in that way they cannot have peace; for they that despise the day of small things, they dispise that by which Peace cometh, and none can have peace whilst they despise that by which it comes; for they that would have peace with God must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and entertain the Light, and not dispise it, and though it may appear but as a little thing, yet peace is found in the least appearance of it, as it is loved and obeyed; but the high and softy cannot bow unto it, the birth of Flesh and Blood, and of the will of man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects some higher and greater thing; and when the Light manifests it self by reproof in the Conscience, there is not submission, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dispising, for the broad way is more delightfull to that birth then the narrow; and therefore it is that the broad way is filled with many walkers; and so many may see the Morning, and not come to see the perfect day; for if the Light in its manifestation be not loved and obeyed, there is not a going forward in the Truth, nor any growth and increase witnessed, and so the Light hath manifest it self in many, and they have seen the darkness by the manifestation, but not loving and obeying the Light that it might become their Teacher and Leader, they still abide in darkness, and are not redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and delivered, and that is the thraldom and bondage, where many yet remains who have been visited with the day-spring from on high, they do not love nor obey the Light when it springs and manifests


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52588:3"/>
it self unto them, and so they keep themselves in their own sorrow, and misery by loving and obeying darkness; for if the Light be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in love, as being only true, there is not an abiding in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but a coming to the Light of Life; and so Christ said, <hi>I am the Light of the World, he that followeth me shall not abide in darkness;</hi> which thing is true in him, and in all those that follow him; for in the appearance of his Light the darkness passeth away, and the power of it groweth weaker, and then comes redemption and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of Darkness unto those that love and obey the Light, and so they come out of the pollutions and defilements into that which is pure, and holy, and righteous, and these are only the people which are found to the praise and glory of God; for who have been visited, and do not obey the Lord, they are not found to his praise and glory, but are sound in that by which God is dishonoured; and who have tasted of the good Word of God, and the powers of the World to come, and have seen many great and wonderfull things, and afterwards go from the Light, and lose their stedfastness, they are not found to the praise and glory of God, but dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Name and Truth and People; for they that sometimes did own the Light to be true (or Truth it self) and for a season rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in it, and as Disciples took up the Cross to follow it, and now are grown weary of walking in the narrow way, and so are gone back and follows no further, they cannot be found to the praise and glory of God, but are found to dishonour him, by departing from him, and taking liberty to satisfie the flesh, with the affections and lusts, and that is the birth of flesh and blood, and of the will of man, whatsoever may be pretended of the Birth of God, or of retaining a measure of Light and Truth to wait upon God in their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; that spirit which so draweth back, and causeth any to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Way of Truth, and from the holy Commandment given of God, it is a false spirit, and so an enemy to the true Spirit, and those that follow it and live in it; and though some may say, That to withdraw and depart from that which they have sometimes observed in outward practice, is not to withdraw or depart from the Truth, but rather a growth, and a going forward in it; but that will not hold to be true if tried by the Truth it self; and for want of such a trial many have wronged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for if there had been a true trial, before there had been


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52588:4"/>
such a close joyning, the matter would have appeared otherwise, and the deceiveableness would have been seen under the covering, and all that walked in the Light did see it, and were preserved; for Truth is unchangeable in all its wayes, though in degrees it appears more glorious, and being an immutable unalterable power, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes justifies its own work and order from one degree to another; and they that really go forward in the Truth, and retain it in their particulars to wait upon God, they cannot possibly disesteem or dispise any practise which in the Truth is observed, and in and by which they have often been refreshed; (for mark) <hi>Where the carkass is, thither will the Eagles resort;</hi> and this in the beginning did draw to meet together with a willing mind; for as the Word of Life was ministred by such as God appointed, so the vertue of it caused re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort unto it, and the same thing being yet preserved and continued, and also much increased, according to the power and wisdom in which it did begin, how can any lay a sufficient ground for their withdrawing or departing from it? or how can any truly say, that they are gone forward in the Truth, or that they retain a measure of it to wait upon God in their own particulars? for the Everlasting power of the Lord God doth yet continue amongst those that fear him, and the Word of Life floweth, and is yet ministred in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Righteous, and all the faithfull meeteth with it in a large and plentiful measure; and it yeildeth the same vertue unto refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; nourishment as in the beginning, and keepeth the same judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Transgressors; and hereby it is manifest, that the Power changes not, nor the Word of Life ceaseth not, but some are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to cease from obeying the Truth, and to depart from the holy Commandment given of God, and so it had been better they had never known it, unless they repent and return, but such things are permitted to happen, that they which are reproved may be made manifest, and that the Lord may be magnified in stretching forth his Arm for the recovery of such who in their simplicity have been turned aside: and though some may think that they are gotten above the Assemblies of the Righteous, and the ministration of the power (which is the Gospel) and that they are now more large and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal in their love, yet that power which they dispise, as a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, will bruise the head of that spirit which hath lift them up, and all that abide in that power will live the longer life, and the love


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52588:4"/>
which is in the Light where the Righteous have their fellowship, it will remain when all the pretended universal love is gone; for the love which is universal is in God, and that love is pure, and cannot joyn to any impure thing, to have unity or fellowship with it; for if it were so, then there is no distinction between righteousness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness; but there is a distinction, for as much as righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is always justified, and unrighteousness alwayes condemned, and so it is as possible to joyn the East and West together, as to joyn righteousness and unrighteousness in unity and fellowship, and who walks in the Light in which is the universal Love of God, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have fellowship with the unfruitfull works of darkness, but is made to reprove them; and so the Light is the same now as in the Apostles dayes, and they that live in it are of the same mind as they were, and they could not have fellowship with unfruitfull works of darkness, but reproved them; and the Apostles were in the universal Love of God, and God never loved <hi>Esau:</hi> therefore all such had need consider what they are gone from, and what they are joyned unto, lest they so long withstand the Lord until the day of visitation pass over; for it is certain that all such as have forsaken the Assemblies of the Righteous, and disesteemes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dispises the ministration of the Gospel, that they have filled themselves with high imaginations, &amp; surfets with their own fulness, and so they Ioath the Life and Vertue which is sweeter then the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comb, and with their own fulness they grow wanton, and makes themselves merry above the Witness, and so with the flesh are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting whoredom and uncleanness; but that which is begotten in an unlawfull bed must not inherit the Kingdom of God, that birth is not the Heir of Life, nor cannot have an inheritance with the Saints in Light; (mark) it is the Saints in Light which inherits, it is their lot only which falleth into that ground, and there is none can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their goodly heritage, but who are born of the same Life; for those that are full and wonton, and in their fulness and wonton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness joyns to a harlot, they have no part in the Kingdom of God and of Christ; but as they sow to the flesh, so of the flesh they must reap corruption; and this is a grief unto the righteous, that any who had a beginning in the Light and Spirit should go back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the flesh, and in that state to think they are perfect, and that their perfection is of a higher degree then those who keeps in


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52588:5"/>

and they, that cannot see him and find him there, it is they that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from God, but God is not departed from those that love him and worships him; and that is their joy and Crown of rejoycing, that they are counted worthy to serve the Lord, and to feel his Presence; and notwithstanding there hath appeared great oppositions, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a way of outward Persecution, but also in several other ways and manners, and sometimes from such as once in measure bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Truth, and made a profession of it, yet the Lord hath carried on his own work, and Truth hath prospered from the beginning, by which it is manifest that God is not departed, but is the same unto all, and with all that wait upon him; for there could be no prosperity if God was departed, but there is prosperity, yea, a great increase, and many tender plants are springing and budding, and many are grown to be Trees of Righteousness, of the Lords planting, and in the strength of the Lord they stand as Pillars in his House, and there is no decay nor want in the Family, all the Garners are rich with store, and their Land is a Land of plenty; and all that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the House are gone into Famine, and are decayed as Branches that wanteth nourishment from the Root; and herein the great and universal Love of God is manifest to his People, who hath caused his Light to shine in their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

know that there is not another thing sufficient for that work; and so they keep their faith in it, as in the greatest; and in the very time when darkness came upon some to draw them back, then there was no whither else for them to go, but to that which from the beginning had preserved; for they were come to assurance that he was the Son of God in whom they believed, and they knew that he had the word of Eternal Life; and so they could not forsake him, and depart from him, to go to another, but continued in his Love according to his Command; which, if all had done so, there had not been a going away and departing; but the Serpent beguiled, as he beguiled <hi>Eve;</hi> and though he aimed to deceive the very Elect, yet it was not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because their Foundation was sure, and they were faithfull to it; and upon the Foundation they yet stand, and are not moved, and the Truth is precious in their eye, and the testimony of it lovely in their hearts, and they are not weary of serving the Lord; for his power carries them as upon Eagles Wings, and such are not born of flesh and blood, and of the will of man, but of God, and as Heirs of God they inherit Life and Immortality; and so they rejoyce in their way, and in their portion, and in this good ground their lot is fallen, and they have a goodly heritage, yea a heritage above the Earth, and the glory of it; for in the Seed and Life they have found the heavenly Treasure, and the Pearl of great price; and as their affections are set upon things above, so they do not mind to be in love with things below; and abiding in the Light and Truth, they have a sure Dwelling, and a quiet Habitation; and so in that which is immortal they live with the Lord, and one another, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed in the Lord and one in another; and these are Children which of his own Will he hath begotten by the Word of his Power; [mark] by the Word of his Power these are begotten, and they love the Word of his Power which hath begotten them, and it is Milk unto them as Babes, and Meat as strong Men, and they know the vertue and power of it, and cannot depart from it, and by faith in the power they obtain victory; and so they keep the faith, and do not make shipwrack of it, and by faith they stand, and from the beginning they have kept in the way that is good, and have not cunningly devised Fables, but by the manifestation of Truth have approved themselves unto God; and these are they which of his own Will he hath begotten by the Word of his Power, who love

the Word of his Power that hath begotten them, and by the Word of his Power he upholds them; it is that they lean upon, and cleave unto in all their trials, distress and tribulations, and it hath been, and is their strength from one degree of godliness unto another, and from one degree of faith to another; and so from degree to degree they have followed the Lord in humbleness of mind, and he hath and doth give his Grace unto them, and exalts them into honour, and they are honourable and beloved in his sight; and though some that came out with them be gone from them, yet the Truth is the same, and they are the same in the Truth; for as they have kept in the Truth from the beginning, so they have not wavered nor chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in all things have been found faithfull wherein Truth hath been concerned, and many whose dear and precious lives have been given up as a Testimony to it, and many whose sufferings and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations doth yet remain for the Truth sake; and it is no less in such as now depart from the testimony, and turns against it, then a trampling upon the Blood and Sufferings of the Faithfull, and so a trampling under foot the Son of God, and doing dispite to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace; and such are gone from the Grace of God in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so runs into the liberty that pleaseth the vain mind which cannot bear the yoke; and in that Sea of liberty in vanity the flesh is pleased, and from that Sea cometh all the great swelling words of vanity in the likeness of Truth; but the Sea is bounded, beyond which it cannot pass, and in that which bounds the troubled Seas the faithfull are preserved from being swallowed up; and they that are fallen into this Ocean, they are fallen from the Rock (Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus) who is the beginning and ending, the first and last; and so they are gone from the chief corner stone the Elect and precious, upon which the Building is fitly framed, and groweth unto an holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Lord (so mark) the Building is fitly framed upon the Rock, and not upon the Sea; and upon the Rock the Building standeth and groweth unto an holy Temple; and so the Power of the Rock raiseth the Building which is framed upon it, and there is a perfect union between the Foundation and Building, and a perfect union in the Building; for it is framed and compacted by his hand who is Lord of all, so it is united, and no where out of order; for that which is out of order is not framed and compacted in the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which stands upon the Rock; and though it may appear as

framed, compacted and builded, yet it is not united to the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but the Lord hath pleasure in his own Building: as being his own work, and it grows to be an holy Temple, and he fills it with his Presence and Glory, and besides this Foundation which God hath laid, there is no man can lay another, nor no man can build ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Building to be an holy Temple for him; therefore all founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and buildings which man hath layed and builded must come to nought, for it is only his own Work that must stand and remain; and so he hath been building upon his own Foundation, and he hath framed a Building according unto his pleasure, and he causeth the Building to grow unto an holy Temple for himself to walk in; and so he walks in the Temple, and dwells in the Temple which is holy, and this is his own Work from the beginning.</p>
            <p>For when the Lord appeared to make known his Truth, in this day there was no building framed, but all in several Forms and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions scattered, and he beheld it, and his eye pitied, and then was his Love manifest to the scattered, and with his Light he opened their eye that was darkned, and many came to see that their foundation was sandy, and that their building could not stand safely; and as the Lord was minded in this Morning of Light, or springing of his Day, so more Light brake forth from his fulness, and the day more appeared, and dangers came to be more clearly seen; and when dangers were discerned in the Light, there was a fear came upon many to behold them; for as they saw their foundation to be sandy, so they came to be sensible that it would fail, and their building fall, and that they could not stand in safety, if they did there remain, and in the sence of their danger they were made to cease from building, and to cry unto the Lord for help; for they came to see with the Light that was breaking forth, that the Lord would overturn their foundation and building: and though some had long been working &amp; building, yet they were made willing to give it all up, and to become nothing as to what they had done; and being mindful of the Light which had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their eye, and made them sensible of their danger, and waiting in fear and humbleness of mind, the Lord revealeth a sure Foundation of his own laying, and he called the scattered to come into it; and as his voice was obeyed he stretched forth his Arm and gathered, and with the strength of his Love he made many willing to be at his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; and then he began to work upon their hearts by his Power, and


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52588:8"/>
to frame their hearts according to the nature of his own Foundation, for all were out of order until the Lord began to work by his mighty power, there was not one stone framed fit for his Building, but all were rough and could not be layed and compacted together; and in this condition the Lord found the children of men in this day of his appearance, he did not find them framed, and so fit for building; but he found them as such upon whom the Plain had not gone, and for his Name sake he took the work into his own Hand, and his work reached to the heart which was out of order; and then many came to feel the Lord working in them by his power, and came to know that it was the Lord, which they never knew before; and as they came to know God by the work of his Power in their hearts, so they came to stand in fear before him, and not kowing what the Lord would do by such a manifestation and operation of his Light and Power, they were brought to stand still in silence and to wait for the effect, and then did he open the Treasures of his Love and shewed them his Salvation, and also shewed them his Judgment seat before which they were to stand, and they were made willing to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and to be judged by him; and he caused his Judgment to pass thorow them for the casting out of that spirit which wrought iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for the killing of that life which had pleasure in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and so his Judgments were found to be just, and he was found to be righteous, for he judged nothing but that which was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the purity of his own Life, and was the burthen of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul, and that is for judgment in all where ever it remains; and so he began and prospered his work in the hearts of those that did abide the day of his coming, and they can set to their seal that God is true; and whilst the wicked stood in his sight he was terrible in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and whilst corruption remained he was dreadful to behold, for his Word was as a Fire and a Hammer upon the transgressing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so his Fame hath gone, and his Hammer hath wrought for the purging of the conscience from dead works, and for the raising and bringing forth of life and immortality, and so by his Power he hath squared and framed the hearts of many, and hath made them fit for his building, and he hath fixed and united them to his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which is Christ the Rock) and in him he hath fixed and united them one to another, and so the building and foundation are joyned in one nature, and the building is fitly framed and grows unto an

Power which begets him, and by the Power is alwayes helped in the needful time, and here the Righteous dwell safely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Banner which is spread over them, they do not depart from the Testimony of the Word of Life, neither do they utter words as a Testimony out of the Life, but lives and dwells in the Life as in their Habitation; and they that do not dwell in this Habitation they utter words from a wrong motion, but who keeps their Habitation in the Life, the Life is in their Ministry and Testimony, for such lives in the Word of Life, and so preaches the Word of Life in its own power, and the sound of that Word of Life and Power goes thorow death and darkness and reaches the true and faithful Witness; and this is a joyful sound by which the Captive is made glad, and this sound is gone forth into the World, and the words of it to the ends of the Earth, &amp; many that were in the Graves are raised up by it; the dead hath heard the voice of the Son of God and lives, for it hath quickned and given Life to as many as received the Testimony of it into their hearts, and they that keeps it, and abids in it, they live by it, and such cannot forget it, nor the benefits they have received by it, but estemes it and prefers it above all other things; and so they do not let the benefits slip out of their minds, but retains them in that from which they have received them, and so they keep in the beginning, and goes forward in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for it clearly manifesteth that such as depart from the Way of Truth, and from the holy Commandement given of God, that they have not kept in the beginning, but lost it, and so have lost the sence of benefits which in the beginning they received, and now makes merry above the Witness, and grows wanton upon the Earth, and what can the end of these things be but distress, sorrow and misery; for all that have known the Lord in any measure, and have turned their backs upon him, they cannot lie down in peace, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and therefore that all might mind their own conditions, and not to resist and strive against that which seeks their eternal good, but submit unto it, with a lowly and humble mind, that the vapours which darkens their understanding may be removed, and the night vision cease, and the Word of Life become precious to them as in the beginning; for the Lord hath gathered a Flock which keeps together in his Light, Life, Power and Wisdom, and he is their Shepherd and Bishop of their Souls; and as they abide with him,

glorious Light that is broken forth again through the Night of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, and in which Gospel-meetings are ordered again, as was before the Apostacy, and the Everlasting Gospel is preached again as in the Apostles dayes, and Christianity is known again as was amongst them, and the worship of God is observed again in their Light, Life and Spirit, and the Way of Life and Peace is walked in, as was by them, and so all things are made new by the appearance of Christ, in his Light and Power, and yet nothing new in it self, as to the ground, but only made new by a separation and distinction from the old: for all that man hath constituted, ordained and set up, as to Worship and Religion, it is of the old nature, and so old things, but Christ makes all things new, and yet in himself before all things, and he hath brought forth that again which Darkness hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread since the primitive times, which being so large a time kept under darkness, it now appeareth new, distinctly from the old; and though this be new as to the appearance of it out of the old; yet Christ, who brings it forth in himself, he is the beginning of all; and so he is the first and good Old Way, as in relation to foregoing Ages; and also the last, and new and Living Way, in relation to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages; and he hath gathered a people to himself, who walks with him, as in the new and living Way, and in him they meet and worship God, and enjoys his Presence; and having found the Lord in his own Way, &amp; walking with the Lord in his own Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

God in the Spirit, who is a Spirit; and this is a Gospel-Meeting, and Way, and Worship as in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, and all other meetings, wayes and worships are constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and set up since the primitive times, and they are all to be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forsaken, as having no life in them; for though the Lord might once appear in Meetings, Wayes and Worships which were of a lower degree then that which now he hath revealed, and that the sender in heart did meet with something of God in such Meetings, Wayes and Worships; yet that doth not bind the Lord to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in such meetings, wayes and worships; neither is it a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for any to continue in them now the Lord hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a higher and greater Manifestation of Light; for what any have met withal as from the Lord in lower Dispensations, it was fourth drawing and bringing them higher; not that God would fix himself in that dispensation, or fix any unto it, but only conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended unto low things to bring forward into higher, and so to lead on from that which is below into that which is above, and so to lead on from that which is below into that which is above, and so to the greatest, which is Christ the fulness, who in the appearance of his Light and Life doth swallow up all lower Dispensations, though as to time they might be of God; and so many have seen the goings on of the Lord in his Light, and in his Light have followed him, from the lower into the higher, and so are come to live and walk in that where his Presence remains; and to as many as have so followed him, and abides with him, they know the place of his Rest, and also knows their rest in him; and so they know the Lord to live in them, and walk in them, and that he is their God, and they are his people; and in such a Meeting, Way and Worship the Lord is found, and he abides and continues there in his Love, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Goodness; therefore all below are to come up into it; and all gone from it are to return, if they would walk with the Lord; for there is not another way wherein any doth walk with the Lord, or the Lord with them; but in his Light, Life and Power, and in that to meet and worship him according to his own Appointment and Command; for as the Lord is gathering into himself all lower Dispensations, and gathering in one such as have been scattered in them; so all are to mind the Lords gathering, that in the Light, by which he gathereth, they may come to be made perfect in one, [mark] in one is the perfection, which is Christ the Light, and

Life, and Power and Wisdom of God, in whose Light, Life, Power and Wisdom is the Gospel unity and Fellowship, not in outward Forms and Professions, and lower Dispensations, but in the Light, and Life of Christ Jesus, who is above all, and greater then all; in his Light the Saints had Fellowship, as the Scriptures testifie, and in his Light the Saints have Fellowship in this day; and so by one spirit they are all baptized into one Body, and are one Body under the Government of Christ the head; and this is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal fellowship in the universal Light, where the Spirits of just men, are now known who are gone before, and the spirits of just men now will be known by such as are to come; and so a perfect unity in perfect Light of Christ, by which Light the faithfull are bound in a bundle of Life, and so in the unity of the Light and Spirit the Saints now meets and worships God, and build up one another in their most holy Faith, and edifies and comforts one another accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practise of the holy men and women in times past, and they keep the unity of the Spirit, which unto them is the bond of Peace; and though some may lose the unity by going from the Spirit, and some that may profess the Truth be not in unity, as not walking in the Spirit, yet neither doth weaken or break the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of such as lives and abides in the Spirit, for the Spirit changes not, though some that profess the Truth do not walk in it, or some may withdraw and depart from it, therefore the unity in the Spirit is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and everlasting, and it is the bond of Peace to all that live in it.</p>
               <p>So all are to come unto this Light and Spirit in which the Saints meet and worship God, and in which they have unity and fellowship with God and one another, there is nothing below it will endure, nor nothing exalted above that will stand; for as the Light and Spirit is the beginning, so it is the ending unto all that abides in it; for all truth is only comprehended in the Light and Spirit of God, and from thence received, and there is not any other things, or things, in which true and lasting peace can be found, but in a measure of that Light which comes from God as the Fountain, &amp; they that have fixed themselves below the Light, they must be dis-joyned from that unto which they are fixed, and stand-loose from all things which they have made and set up in Worship and Religion, and mind the Light which is only true, to lead them forward into all truth, for where any are fixed to things below the Light, and will not be dis-joyned and
