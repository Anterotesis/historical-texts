            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was no meruaile that the heathen man Xenophon
willed euerie one <hi>aequalitatem colere,</hi> to honour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie,
ſeeing it ſerueth ſo much to the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a ciuill life, to the managing of common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
to the conſeruing of popular vnitie, which is
ſo excellent in compariſon, ſo generall in comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſo neceſſarie in all actions, that no Common wealth can doe well
without it: yet ſuch is the error of this age, that more are readie to
confeſſe then to expreſſe this equalitie in any of their actions.</p>
            <p>There is no common weale can flouriſh without impoſition of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
for they are as neceſſarie, ſaith Plato, as arteries or ſinewes to
the bodie, but inequalitie in the ſeſſing and rating of theſe charges is
but an enemie to a Commonwealth: for they are as ill as prickes or
thornes to the bodie, euerie one is willing to beare charge reſpectiuely
to his portion, but who can indure to be ſurcharged in no equall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to others? there is a fit inſtance in one Aemilius appliable to
this purpoſe; who beeing complained of vnto Tyberius Caeſar for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall
taxations he impoſed vpon the people, T. Caeſar returned this
anſwer, <hi>Se tondere velle ſuas oues non deglubere,</hi> that he would
haue him to ſheare his ſheepe, but not to flea them. <hi>Bruſon:</hi> this ſaying
is worthy to be obſerued of all ſeſſors, to deale indifferently without
extremitie, and equally without partialitie in common wealth caſes:
ſeeing vnequall rates vnder the title of vnrighteouſneſſe is ſaid to be
abhomination, as well as vniuſt weights and meaſures, Deut. 25. 16.</p>
            <p>As ſinne is aggrauated by circumſtances, ſo is that iniquitie of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie:
for to deale vnequally in priuate callings, is not tollerable,
but to vſe inequalitie in publike caſes is farre more deteſtable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the iniurie is more generall, as the Schoolemen ſay, <hi>quanto ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas
in plures extenditur tanto grauius peccat,</hi> the ſinne is the
greater the more it is extended and diſperſed: and therefore ſuch as
are taken therein tardie, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> in the deede doing, or, as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians

               <pb facs="tcp:17018:3"/>
               <hi>metus fit multorum,</hi> That the puniſhment of one might be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to many; and to this ende S. Paul ſaith, <hi>Them that ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
openly, that the reſt alſo may feare,</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 20. for amongſt
many ſinners ſome muſt be made examples.</p>
            <p>There is no man doubtes but that inequalitie hath ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and continuall current in common ſeſſments, ſome that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee into it, ſuffer it, others that are fauoured in it, wincke at it,
thoſe that are wronged in it, murmure at it, howſoeuer it be, they
muſt with patience take this pill of Virgill <hi>omnis fortuna ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa
ferendo,</hi> learne to ſuffer that they cannot remedie. For this
cauſe hauing ſome obiectes of inequalities offered to my eyes, I could
not forbeare my pen without impietie, conſidering that mellifluous
Father ſaith, <hi>eſt conſentire ſilere cum arguere poſſis,</hi> to be ſecret
where one may ſay ſomething is a ſinne in conſent, and to conceale
veritie <hi>eſt aurum ſepelire</hi> is no better then to burie gould, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagrius
ſaith.</p>
            <p>I ſpleane no mans perſon but his vnequall proceedings, I inuey not
againſt common impoſitions and charges, but againſt vnequall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in the taxing, I ayme not at any one man; becauſe I ſpeaks
generally to all, and it is a principle in all artes, He that ſpeakes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie
ſpeakes to none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Dauid heard the generall report of
the parable; the delinquent (ſaith he) ſhall die the death; he litle
thought it concerned himſelfe, vntill Nathan told him he was the
man. When Iudah heard the common clamor againſt Thamar; let
her be burnt, ſaith he, he did not ſuſpect himſelfe to be criminall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
Thamar ſhewed him his ring, his cloke and his ſtaffe. Gen. 38. ſo
by theſe examples we may perceiue, that generall ſpeeches can detect
none vnleſſe he be named, though they may touch any if they be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with guilt.</p>
            <p>Such as be galled may take reformation by this and conceale it:
for I cannot ſaie he is the man; ſuch as be not guiltie may take infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
by this, to continue ſo; for it is rare to ſee ſuch a man, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
it is pittie that ſo common an euill as inequalitie which
by cuſtome is made no ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould be teſt vp and downe from one to an
other like a tennys ball, and paſſe without any check or reproofe: the
fowles of the aire will bewray. Eccles. 10. 20. the ſtones in the wall
will crie out. Haba. 2. 11. nay the very dumb beaſt will ſpeake rather
then ſinne ſhould paſſe vnreprooued. 2. Pet. 2. 16.</p>
            <p>The greateſt workes are ſometime wrought by the weakeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
<pb facs="tcp:17018:3"/>
as Goliah was ſlaine by à litle ſtone with á ſlinge, when no

be afrighted at the grunting of à pigge, ſo men may ſometime be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
and reclamed by mere trifles, and made true penitentes by the
daſh of à penne, as Peter was ſtroke with ſorrowe at the crowing of
the cocke.</p>
            <p>I deſire nothing but that my penne may be as à pricke to the hartes
of the guiltie to ſee their faults, and that my praier may be as à

ſaid of the Iſraelites in Iudg. 20. 10. they were knit together as
one man, &amp; ſo in affections, when many are of mutuall mindes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17018:5"/>
they are ſaid to be <hi>vnaenimi,</hi> knit together in one minde as the
Apoſtle phraiſeth it. 1. Cor. 1. 10. according to that which is
ſaid of the beleeuing companie in the Acts. 4. 32. <hi>they were
of one heart and of one ſoule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Equalitie is ſometime taken for à paritie or likenes: when
the Apoſtle would haue vs to be equally affected, he willeth
vs to be like minded one to another. Rom. 15. 5. &amp; not to beare
the proud mind of the inſulting Phariſe to ſaie, I am not like
others, or the ambitious mind of Pompey to admit none to
be his equall, but as we are taught to make our ſelues equall to
them of the lower ſort, Rom. 12. 16. (not in titles and degrees
as ſome vrge equalitie, or in poſſeſſions or goodes as many
pretend community where God hath put à difference) but in
lowlines of mind, as one commentes vpon that place, by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him which ſaith, <hi>learne of me I am meeke and lowly:</hi> Math.
11. 29.</p>
               <p>Equabilitie is ſo called of <hi>aequali habilitate,</hi> of equall abilitie;
becauſe it doth moſt properly extend to <hi>Abilities</hi> by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
etymologie of the word.</p>
               <p>What Ability &amp; <hi>Non-abilitie</hi> is in our common lawes, I will
omit, but in the ſcriptures it is moſt commonly take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for à tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
ſtate of liuing, to ſignifie that as there ought to be an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in profeſſion, an vnanimitie in affection, a ſympathy in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
ſo there ought to be an equalitie in outward affaires,
that where me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are of equabilitie or equall value in abilitie, they
ſhould be equiualent in all good actions; both by the preſcript
rule of God. <hi>Let euery one miniſter according to his abilitie.</hi> 1.
Pet 4. 11. and by preſident in the godly, <hi>we according to our
abilities</hi> doe. Neh. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>Thus in ſome tranſparent ſort I haue giuen ſome light and
introduction to the matter: for by the ſundry acceptions of
the word you may ſee that to be euen, all one, equall, &amp; like, are
but ſynonomies or wordes of like ſenſe and ſignification, and
by the deriuation of the word you may perceiue the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſubiect: for as in the beginning Adam gaue names a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the nature of euery creature, ſo in the firſt inuention
of wordes Etymologicians gaue denomination according to the
ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery word, which might be deriued from ſome
language by exquiſite linguiſtes, although now where we want
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17018:5"/>
reaſon to deriue a word, we are inforced to call it primitiue.</p>
               <p>For as much as this is no probleme or diſputable queſtion
to controuert, before I enter into the definition and diuiſion of
this ſubiect, I will firſt (omitting the order of diſputants) illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
and ſet forth the excellencie, generalitie, and neceſſitie
thereof, that it may appeare to be a fit argument for this age, as
an inſtigation to mooue euery one to make more care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of equalitie in all their actions.</p>

               <p>TO beginne with him, who gaue beginning to all, and yet
is without beginning himſelfe, if we enter into that meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall
and diuine miſterie of the Deitie, there appeares to be
an apparent vnion of equalitie: for though there be a trinitie in
perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, there is an vnitie and equalitie in godhead, although the
father is ſaid to be greater, Ioh. 14. 28. then the ſonne, as he was
man.</p>
               <p>In the firſt creation of man, he was a kind of Microcoſme or
little world, not becauſe he is circular or ſphericall, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
hold, but for that there was ſome likeneſſe and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of the Creator reſplendent in the creature, for it is ſaid,
<hi>Let vs make man to our owne image and likeneſſe: behold</hi> (ſaith god)
<hi>the man is become as one of vs,</hi> Gen. 3. 22. Yet none muſt hereby
thinke himſelfe equall to God as Tyrus did, Ezech. 28. 6. leaſt
he become a beaſt, as Nabuchadnezzar was: for God can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
no equall vpon earth, <hi>To whome will you compare or make
me equall?</hi> ſaith God, Iſaiah, 46. 5.</p>
               <p>In the Redemption of mankind, he which was deified and
equall with God, did vouchſafe to be homified, by aſſuming
vpon him, the very fleſh and forme of man, by participating
with man in eating, drinking, ſleeping, talking, walking, beeing
paſſible as man, in hungring, thirſting, watching, weeping; in a
word, he was equall to man in all things ſauing ſinne, as Ioſeph
was to Pharaoh, ſauing the ſcepter.</p>
               <p>In the dignifying of man, God did not onely impart to him
his owne image in puritie of minde, and impoſe humane ſhape
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17018:6"/>
in habite of his perſon, but he doeth further grace and adorne
him with his owne <hi>equall</hi> titles, by tearming of him a God, <hi>eſt
animata imago Dei,</hi> as one ſaith, he is the liuely image of God:
for as Lactantius ſaith, though he be but a man before God,
yet he is a God amongeſt men: it was this that made the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
affirme that man was a terreſtriall God; but yet leaſt he
ſhould haue too ſublimious a conceit of his ſingularitie, it is not
amiſſe to remember what the Cynicall perſon ſaid to Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
though he were a God vpon earth, yet he was but a God
of earth; and as the Phoenix beeing bred of aſhes doth burne to
aſhes, ſo he beeing made of earth muſt yeild to earth.</p>
               <p>In the Diſſolution of man, god doeth ſtill grace him with
his ſmall glorie: for if he dieth well, he will deuide his glorie to
him: Haman thought it was the greateſt honour to man in
this life, to haue the kings royall apparrell put vpon him; to
ride vpon his owne horſe, and to haue his crowne ſet vpon his
head, Eſter, 6. 8. then howe great glorie is it to man in the life to
come, to be made like him that is moſt glorious? 1. Ioh. 3. 2. to
ſit vpon the throne with him that ſhall iudge vs? Apoc. 3. 21. &amp;
to be partaker both of a crowne and a kingdome?</p>
               <p>In the taking of Eue from Adam there is ſhewed a coequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
betweene man and woman; for they were equall euery
way vntill the ſinne made man her ſuperiour, and therefore
ſubiection was one part of her puniſhment, as may appeare in
Gen. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>In the eſtates of men although they be different in reſpect
of proſperitie and pouertie, yet God hath ſhewed therein an
excellent patterne of parilitie: for if he had made all rich, one
would not care for another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if all poore, one could not helpe
another; ſo that rich and poore haue neede one of another, 2.
Cor. 8. 14.</p>
               <p>In the Regiment of a common wealth, God hath ordained
equalitie amongſt many vnequalls: for if all were Rulers, then
it were monſtrous, for one head is enough for one bodie, as
one ſunne is ſufficient for the whole world. If there were no
ruler, then were it confuſed, as it is ſaid of the Iſraelites when
they were without a King, euery man did that which was good
in his owne eies, Iudg. 17. 6. for in extremities it is better to haue
a tyrant (as the heathen man ſaith) then no ruler: and therefore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17018:6"/>
for one to Rule and the reſt to obey is the onely ſquare of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſpeake more of equalitie? ſeeing it is of ſuch
excellencie that the very Ethnickes did honour equalitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it doeth combine the good with the good, ſaith Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,
and doth conſerue cities in tranquilitie, ſaith Ariſtotle,
2. polit. whereas inequalitie is ſaid to be <hi>ſeditionis ſeminarium,</hi>
the verie ſeed of ſedition, as Plutarke tearms it. To end all with
this epiphonema, ſeeing equalitie is <hi>deitatis Idea,</hi> the expreſſe
Idea of the indiuiſible Deitie in heauen, and <hi>vnitatis cauſa,</hi> the
inſtrumentall cauſe of vniuerſall vnitie vpon earth, what is of

               <p>IN the olde lawe <hi>Lex talionis</hi> was ordained to no other ende,
but that an euill action might haue an equall puniſhment, as
an eie for an eie, a tooth for a tooth, life for life; the validitie of
which lawe is in ſome caſes yet recent amongſt vs: for by our
poſitiue lawe, he that of malice prepenſed taketh away another
mans life, looſeth his owne life.</p>
               <p>It is commonly ſeene in this life that where the parents care
not howe they gather their goods togither with the rake, the
children care not howe they caſt them abroad with the forke,
ſo that olde ſaying is iuſtly verified, goods euill gotten are euill
ſpent. Hemingius reports a thing of his owne experience, of
one that was <hi>capax, rapax,</hi> and <hi>tenax</hi> in getting of his goods by
oppreſſion, he afterward left them to his children, who plaid
the prodigal ſonnes, and went vp and downe a begging: ſo true
it is, <hi>ex male quaeſitis non gaudet tertius haeres,</hi> that the third heire

and griping make a gaine, ſhould doe well to remember <hi>non
male lucreris, mala lucra aequalia damna,</hi> that their euill lucre will
haue equall loſſe, ſometime or other.</p>
               <p>It is a generall note in the ſcriptures, that <hi>malum culpae</hi> and
<hi>malum poenae</hi> haue commonly concourſe togither in ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
proportion betweene the malefactor and the miſdeede,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17018:7"/>
according to that olde verſe, <hi>Qualia vir faciet tali quoque fine
peribit,</hi> that which a man practiſeth to others, he ſhall periſh by
himſelfe; whereof there are many examples in the ſcriptures.
Pharaoh cauſed the children to be caſt into the riuer, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
was ouercome in the red ſea. Haman made a gallowes to
hang Mordecai, he himſelfe was hanged on the ſame gallowes:
the Rulers cauſed Daniel to be caſt into the denne of Lyons,
they themſelues were deuoured with the Lyons. Adoni-bezek
did cut of the thumbs and the feete of ſeauentie Kings, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
had his thumbes and feete cut off by others, Iudg. 1. 6. The
prodigall ſonne becauſe he liued in filthineſſe like a ſwine, he
did afterward eate huskes with the ſwine.</p>
               <p>It is the iudgment of the Almightie in the life to come, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
equall puniſhment according to the qualitie of the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and that may be probably collected out of Eſay, 26. 17.
where it is ſaid, <hi>Iudgement will I lay to the Rule, and righteouſnes
to the Ballance.</hi> By the Rule is vnderſtood the euen meaſure
that ſhall be betweene the partie and the puniſhment: and by
the Ballance is ſignified, the equal weight that ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the torment and the ſinner, according to that ſaying
in the Apocalyps, 18. 7. For as much as ſhee (meaning the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian
whore) hath glorified her ſelfe, and liued in pleaſure,
ſo much giue her torment and ſorrowe. We read that Diues
becauſe he would not giue Lazarus a crumme of bread to
quench his hunger vpon earth, he himſelfe could not haue a
droppe of water to coole his tongue in hell.</p>
               <p>To come to a more generall and vniuerſall inſtance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie,
though Pompey would ſuffer none to be his ſuperior
amongeſt men, though Tyrus affirmed that he was a God, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech.
28. 2. though Nabuchadnezzar exalted himſelfe aboue
God, though Kings are as gods vpon earth; yet howeſoeuer
men differ in humors and affections, or in degrees or dignities
in this world, if they come to this <hi>memento,</hi> to conſider in man,
that his creation is of earth, his diſſolution is to earth, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection

in ſinne with Dauid? he is a miſerable ſinner with the
Publican? he is the greateſt ſinner with Paul? 1. Tim. 1. 15. Is
not God father to vs all by faith? Sauiour to vs all by grace? then
what doth this intimate vnto vs all, but a generall Equalitie in

ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>When we ſhall all be arraigned before that great Iudge of

and this generall Eccho ſhall ſound in the eares of al <hi>Ite, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enite,</hi>
what other difference ſhall be there then this? ſuch as haue
wrought in the vineyard ſhall haue all one price, and ſuch as

that is ſuch as haue done well ſhall be coheires in heauen, and
ſuch as haue done ill ſhall be copartners in hell, whether
they be Emperous, kinges, keyſers, beggers, without exception

               <p>The generality of equality is ſo copious that they are not to

there cannot be that perfect Symmetry which is required in

               <p>In the conſtitution and ſtate of mans bodie good propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and equalitie of humors and qualities cauſeth health, and

               <p>In Aeconomicall matters if that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iugiall bond betweene man

neceſſarie.</head>
               <p>CHarge may be ſaid to be a departing from ſomething to
the benefit or vſe of others from the dominion of the owe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and this may be done either as the Lawyers ſay, <hi>in pecunijs
numeratis,</hi> in ready money; or as the Schoolemen ſay, <hi>pecunia
menſurabile,</hi> of that which may be valued for money.</p>
               <p>This Charge is according to the occaſion ſaid to be <hi>impenſae
mitior aut acerbior,</hi> leſſer or greater: it is called a charge of <hi>onus</hi>
which commeth of <hi>ones</hi> an aſſe, to ſignifie that heauie burdens
are fit for the aſſe, but neceſſarie burdens are fit for men: and
therefore heauie burdens are condemned in the ſcriptures.
<hi>You lay heauie burdens,</hi> Matth. 23. 4.</p>
               <p>As there is a logicall neceſſitie in the precepts of Art<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall
neceſſitie in the order of nature, ſo there is a politicall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
in disburſing of charges; to worke vpon the Sabboth if
it be neceſſarie it is tollerable, to giue almes where it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
it is charitable; and ſo to pay charges if they be neceſſarie, it
is profitable, which the heathen man obſerueth when he ſaid, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
non quod opus eſt, ſed quod neceſſe,</hi> Seneca, lib. 14. Epiſt. 34. he
would haue vs to lay out money, not for all things we need, but
for thoſe which are moſt needefull and neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>Charges ought to be neceſſarie for theſe reaſons: It is farre
more difficult, <hi>capere quàm fundere,</hi> to get goods, then to giue
them away, as the Philoſopher ſaith, and therefore it is no leſſe

               <p>The wiſeman ſaith, <hi>the Riches of the godly are pretious,</hi> Prou.
12. 17. and therefore as we will not vſe a pearle like a pebble, ſo
we muſt regard howe we impart our riches, ſeeing they are
ſo pretious, euen as Naboth was loath to depart with his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie,
&amp; we muſt not abuſe them with the prodigall ſonne,

diſcharge for ſuch as impoſe and pay charges, to plead they
were neceſſarie, and that may be inferred from that ſaying in

               <p>The Prince is called <hi>Princeps quaſi Principalis;</hi> becauſe he is

               <p>One demanding of Diogenes what countrie man he was,
ſaid, he was <hi>Ciuis mundi,</hi> a citizen of the world: Paul ſaid he was
no citizen but a ſoiourner in the world; yet commonly we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

it is as it were <hi>natale ſolum,</hi> our natiue countrie: but more
properly it is called our countrie <hi>à patriae,</hi> which is deriued of
<hi>pater,</hi> to ſignifie that in both kinds our Countrie is the father
and the mother of vs all. And this ſhould make vs regard our
natiue countrie, as our naturall parents. Hence it is that Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras
beeing asked howe he ſhould demeane himſelfe to his
countrie; he anſwered, <hi>vt ergamatrem,</hi> as to my mother. And
Phocion ſaid that he would haue a ſonne <hi>tam patriae quam pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri,</hi>
euery way as loyall and dutifull to his countrie as his father:
the examples are infinit of ſuch as haue loſt their liues for their
countrie, it was euer deemed ſo honourable a ſeruice, <hi>pro patria
magnum decus eſt profundere vitam,</hi> ſaith Homer. Nowe ſuch
charges as are for the defence of our countrie, as charges of
chiualrie or ſuch like, are neceſſarie: for we ſhould not inioy
our liues, wiues, or liuings without them. Hereof that melliflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Father ſaith, <hi>Sumptus pro militia honorabilis eſt,</hi> the charge
for warres is honourable.</p>
               <p>The Poore man is called <hi>Pauper,</hi> as one ſaith, <hi>quaſi parum
potens, putans, aut imperans,</hi> becauſe he poſſeſſeth, thinketh, or
commandeth little, yet pouertie is the ſubiect to prouoke mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
when riches are but obiects to procure enuie: therefore one
ſaith, <hi>Viuitur paruo bene,</hi> a man liues beſt of a little, if he can be

               <p>To be poore by Grace, <hi>diuinum eſt,</hi> it is heauenly, which

               <p>To be poore by Follie <hi>belluinum eſt,</hi> it is bruitiſh, as appeares
by the prodigall ſonne; howeſoeuer men come to pouertie, we
are not to diſpute, but to diſpence, becauſe ciuill humanitie (as
Lactantius ſaith) bindes vs to doe good to a man, becauſe he is a
man, Lact. lib. 6. cap. 11. and as the moone ſheweth her light
ſhee receiueth from the ſunne, ſo ſhould men ſhewe their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
of that they receiue from God: but ſeeing all creatures
in their kinde are compaſſionate one to another, and all lawes
in commiſeration prouide for the releife of the poore; I ſhall
not neede to vrge the neceſſitie of this charge by multiplicitie
of arguments.</p>
               <p>There be diuers other neceſſarie charges which for breuity
I forbeare, but all the reſt may be reduced and comprehended
vnder theſe heads: for if the Prince be our father, the Countrie
our mother, and the poore our brethren, we ought to ſupply
their deficiencie in ſuch ſort as may deſigne our natures, and
ſerue their neceſſities.</p>

done to the willing; it were impertinent to ſpeake prolixly of
theſe charges, the rather, becauſe this Charge is more properly
ſaid to be <hi>exhibitio,</hi> then <hi>Impoſitio,</hi> a gift of good will, then a

There be other charges called Compulſatorie, becauſe they
are impoſed by the Magiſtrate of euery Citie, Towne, village,
&amp;c. which charg differeth from the former, for that is done of
beneuolence, this is to be paid <hi>volens nolens,</hi> whether a man wil

becauſe it is impoſed vpon the people by order of <hi>manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
praecept,</hi> commaundement, warrant, or otherwiſe; charges
thus impoſed are to be paid <hi>auctoritatis cauſa</hi> thogh there were
no neceſſity to vrge it, as D. Chytraeus ſaith, for we are taught
to obey the magiſtrate; and he that doth thus pay it <hi>non peccat,

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17018:12"/>
which is impoſed vpon any according to his owne abilitie:

<hi>Reſpectiuely</hi> is that charge which is exacted of any ſortable to

               <p>That portion which is proper to a mans owner eſtate ought
to be taxed in ſome meaſure equall to his eſtate according to
the common courſe and cuſtome of the country, and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a proportion properly, the reaſons followe.</p>
               <p>You ſhall reade that in caſes of redemption the Prieſts were
to proportion the prices according to the eſtate of the perſons,
as appeares in Leuit. 27. 8. where it is written. <hi>If he be poorer
then thou haſt eſteemed him, then ſhall he preſent himſelfe
vnto the priest, and the prieſt ſhall value him according to his
ability,</hi> nowe the prieſt he is called <hi>preſbiter quaſi praebens alijs iter</hi>
of ſhewing others the way, and therefore his action ought to
giue example to others in all charges to make an equall taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in ſome proportion to the abilitie of the perſon.</p>
               <p>It is noted in the people of Hieruſalem that in a generall charge
for the common good they did not preſſe themſelues beyond
their powers: for (ſay they) we according to our Abilities haue
done it. Neh. 5. 8. which is a good preſident to be obſerued of
all ſeſſors to rate men according to their abilities.</p>
               <p>In diſpencing to the poore, men are willed to miniſter but
according to their Abilities. 1. Pet. 4. 11. ſo, it ought to be in
al other charges: men are not to be vrged beyond their abilities:
for in giuing away and in paying away there is no difference in
the worke but in the will: for there is a departing from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in both, ſauing one is a free co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other is a kind

               <p>If the ſaddle be not ſet right on the horſe-backe it will
wring him, if the ballance be not equall in weight, it will wrong
one, ſo if a man be not taxed equally to his portion it will iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him, and that is againſt the word which ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt not

               <p>Men vſe to lade the Camell when he lieth downe as he may
riſe vp with his burden, he that will haue his beaſt to hold out
in trauell muſt not ouerburden him: the like courſe muſt be
taken with men, ſo to taxe them as they may continue in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17018:12"/>
charges, and not to make impoſitions become oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
To this purpoſe Bruſon reporteth a matter of one Aemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
a ruler in Egipt, who beeing complained of to Tiberius
Caeſar by the people for oppreſſing them with paiments, he
wrote to Aemylius <hi>ſe tondere velle ſuas oues non deglubere,</hi> that
he would haue him to ſheare his ſheepe but not to flea them,
meaning thereby that he would haue men aſſeſſed indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and not ſurcharged extreamely.</p>
               <p>In all Taxations euery man ſhould remember this golden
rule <hi>To doe as he would be done to,</hi> that is to taxe others as he
would be taxed himſelfe by others, nowe as the ſtring ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraind
in the lute will neuer ſound well, or cloth too much

conſider what Seleucus the Emperor ſaid, which Gualter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth

Twenty three pound men? what ſhould I dilate theſe

by the ſize of his foote, ſo you may iudge the generall by theſe

nothing: ſo it is noted, <hi>The great men would not put their neckes
to it,</hi> Nehem. 3. 5. but the middle ſort they bare moſt of the
burden, and ſo it is in moſt of theſe rates: as the ſunne mooueth
ſloweſt when it is higheſt in the zodiacke, ſo men are euer
ſlackeſt that are higheſt in eſtate: and as the lighter ballance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
mounteth hieſt, ſo the meaner ſort are commonly taxed
heauieſt.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Inequalitie</hi> is meere iniquitie in the agents that impoſe
it, and manifeſt iniurie to the patient that pay it, and therefore
it is condemned by the example of God himſelfe, and by the
lawes of God and man.</p>
               <p>Inequalitie is condemned by the example of God himſelfe;
for God is equall, and he deales equally with euery man, to the
ende one man ſhould deale equally by another: <hi>vt ſementem fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceris
it a metes:</hi> for ſuch meaſure as we mete ſhall be met to vs.</p>
               <p>Inequalitie is by inference condemned by the word of god,
in this ſort if falſe weights and meaſures which are vnequall &amp;
vniuſt are ſaid to be abhominable, theſe vnequall rates of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
cannot be tollerable: for in both there is but a defrauding
of a due: and therefore it is condemned as well as the other.
Deut. 25. 16.</p>
               <p>Where many of equall ſtate are vnequally taxed, it argueth
partialitie, becauſe there is reſpect of perſons, <hi>tribuere aqualibus
inaequalia &amp; inaequalibus aequalia eſt perſonarum acceptio:</hi> for as D.
Chytraeus vpon the Commandements ſaith, To giue to equall
perſons vnequall things, and to vnequall perſons equall things
is reſpect of perſons, which is a ſinne generally condemned in
the lawe of God.</p>
               <p>Inequalitie is condemned by poſitiue and nationall lawes, if
you haue recourſe to the Statute made in Anno 43. of our late
ſoueraigne Lady of famous memorie, Queene Elizabeth, there
is a clauſe concerning the Seſſement of ſubſidy inſerted in theſe
words, <hi>The ſaid Commiſſioners to whome it ſhall appertaine, ſhall</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:17018:14"/>
Indifferently <hi>ſet, taxe, and ſeſſe themſelues, and the ſaid Aſſeſſors.</hi>
This is ſpoken demonſtratiuely to ſhewe that indifferencie &amp;
not inequalitie ſhould be vſed in all Seſſements to all perſons:
for indifference <hi>eſt quaſi non differens,</hi> that is, there ought to be
no difference in theſe dealings, in regard of perſons, but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one ſhould haue a proportionable penniworth according
to his portion as well as another.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſpeake more of Inequalitie? doe we not ſee
that as Cockes cannot fight well that are vnequally matched, ſo
men can neuer agree wel that are vnequally charged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Equalitie is the cauſe of loue, and is therefore called <hi>vnitatis
nutrix,</hi> the nource of vnitie; this Inequality is nothing els but
the cauſe of diſcontent, and is therefore called <hi>ſeditionis altrix,</hi>
the nource of ſedition: for as wheeles going vpon vnequall
ground will make a rumbling, ſo men preſſed with vnequall
rates will make a murmuring, as appeares by the labourers in
the Vineyard: for if they did murmure in receiuing of money,
becauſe their wages was equall when their worke was vnequal;
what will they doe in departing from money where their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
are equall, if they be vnequally taxed?</p>

               <p>If a leuie be made for a common charge in money, and the

meere iniurie; becauſe that proportion is not obſerued which

but yet this is made but a ſuperficiall and light matter in

impoſe then to pay charges, which that learned man D. Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeus
noted in his time, and therefore he left this ſentence to all

               <p>The rate of the Subſidie is, or ought to be, <hi>aequabilitatis Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam,</hi>
the very rule of equalitie to deriue and direct all other

annuall reuenews two hundred pounds, taxed at two ſhillings,
when another that hath not the tythe of his liuing, laid as much

can there be, that theſe which diſdaine to conſort with the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

               <head type="sub">The probable cauſes and coniectures why men are ſo

               <p>THeſe vnequall proportions are committed by the Seſſors,
either of negligence for want of dutie, or of indiſcretion
for want of iudgement, or of ignorance by way of Apologie,
or of wilfulneſſe by way of affection.</p>
               <p>Theſe inequalities are committed of Negligence for want
of dutie: for there are ſome which rate men vpon rumors and
reports; nowe as it is a maxim amongeſt Philoſophers in <hi>vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalibus
verſatur dolus,</hi> ſo it is a principle of experience in the
world, that generall relations are but common fallations. I will
not ſay but that ſometime <hi>vox vulgatis veritatis eſt,</hi> the vulgar
voice may be verified: but yet as the Phiſition in ſome caſes
ſaith, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rina eſt fallax;</hi> ſo in theſe caſes I would haue men
thinke that <hi>fama eſt mendax,</hi> rumor is but a flatuous eccho of
idle tongues: and therefore Thales Mileſius beeing demanded
howe much trueth did differ from rumors? ſo much (ſaid he)
as the eies are diſtant from the eares, noting thereby that men
ought to be oculer and not auriculer agents, if they wil know
the trueth: for many are blazond to be perſons of great liuing,
which when they come to be founded, it appeares but a falſe
allarum, and thus are many hindred by heare-ſay.</p>
               <p>It was well ſaid of one <hi>melius eſt,</hi> it is farre better to fall
into the hands of the iudge, then into the mouthes of the
common people: for hee will not ſentence any without
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17018:15"/>
examination &amp; proofe, when the other will cenſure euery one
by rumors and reportes.</p>
               <p>If you looke into all our ſtatutes concerning the ſeſment of
ſubſidies and taxes, there is a prouiſion made for the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of certaine perſons with the Conſtables of euery Towne
to be ſeſſors of their neighbours, and this is done to preuent
iniury by reportes that the ſeſſors ſhould by their owne perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
inquiery take inteeligence of euery mans eſtate, &amp; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon relations of others, and therefore this may be one cauſe
why many are wronged by inequality if the ſeſſors neglect
their duties in the order of equality.</p>
               <p>Theſe inequalities are committed <hi>of Indiſcretion for want o
Iudgement:</hi> for as Seneca ſaith <hi>quidam homines duplo plus vident
quàm alij;</hi> ſome men can ſee twice aſmuch as others, &amp; there
be ſome as wiſe as Choraebus that would vndertake to tell the
waues of the ſea, and yet he could not nomber aboue fiue,
thereof came the prouerbe <hi>ſtultior Choraebo.</hi> And this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the ouerſight of the ſeſſors, they can prie into mens eſtates
what they haue to liue on, but they neuer expend their charge
which is to liue of them, and ſo they ayme at men in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as the blind man doth at the crowe.</p>
               <p>The marchant recounteth his charges and detriments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can reſolue what he gaynes by his ware, the vintner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayeth
the loſſe of leckage before he can ſet downe what he
ſaues by his wine, the husbandman reſpecteth the charge of
fowing and reaping before he can ſee what he getts by his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt,
&amp; ſoe ſeſſors ought to looke into the charge of a mans fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie
before they can well tell howe to charge him by his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
for as it is noted in <hi>Summa Angelica, lucrum non dicitur niſi
deductis expenſis,</hi> it is not properly called gaine vntill expences be
deducted, ſo it is to be obſerued in the eſtates of men, vnleſſe
there be conſideration of their charge, there can be no informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their eſtate.</p>
               <p>It is reported by hiſtorians, that in Florence he that was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of fiue children was exempted from all impoſitions; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
the Lacedemonians, he that was father of three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
was freed from watches, he that was father of foure chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
was releaſed <hi>ab omni onere,</hi> of all charges, Amongeſt the
Womans he that was father of three children was neuer inforced
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17018:16"/>
to any ambaſſage, if he were father to fiue children, he was
freed from common charges, but if he were father of thirteene
children, he might challenge immunity from all charge, as Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
ſaith.</p>
               <p>I note theſe examples to this end, not that any ſhould be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged
from charges which are able to pay, but that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
taxations there ſhould be ſome regard of euery mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
by his charge, and to haue the more fauour in reſpect of
his family: as for inſtance where one is worth a thouſand pounds
and hath none but his wife and himſelfe to prouide for, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Man</hi> yet liueth not like a man but feedeth like Diogenes
with a roote, and goeth like Lazarus with a ragge, ſuch a miſer
as this (if he be compared with another of equall portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
hath ſeauen or eight children &amp; maintaines his charge in ſome
ciuill &amp; credible ſort) is to be called to quadruple charge more
then the other, or elſe in all reaſon it can be no equality but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury.</p>
               <p>Theſe inequalities are commonly excuſed by way of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
deduced from the example of the labourers in the Vyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
who beeing male-content becauſe they had equall pay
for vnequall paines, the maſter reprooued them and ſaid, <hi>Is thy
eye euill becauſe mine is good?</hi> Vnder this pretext many doe apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize
inequalitie.</p>
               <p>When any complaine and pleade for equall eaſe of charge
aſwell as others, what is that to you (ſay they) doe you enuy an
others good ſeeing you are taxed but according to your worth,
are you any way wronged? <hi>Maledicta gloſſa quae corrumpit tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
as one ſaith; it is a curſed gloſſe that mars the text, and this
is nothing but a retrouerting of the text for a mans owne turne
as the deuill did wreſt the ſcriptures to ſupply his purpoſe: for
firſt it is not fit to mixe ſpirituall and temporall matters in one
ſence, no more then it was allowed in the ould lawe to weare
lynſey wolſey both in one garment: ſecondly, it was lawfull for
the maſter of the vyneyarde to diſpoſe his owne goodes at his
pleaſure, but it is not lawfull for a ſeſſor to vſe <hi>reipublice bonis</hi> at
his pleaſure: and although the maſter did them no iniury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he compounded for equall ſalarie, yet theſe are offered
wrong which are vſed without equalitie according to generall
proportions, as in the 9. chapter appeareth very pregnantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:17018:16"/>
Theſe inequalities are for the moſt part lead by ſwaie of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
either in loue or hatred, fauour or diſpleaſure: for in
theſe caſes, as one ſaith, <hi>voluntas &amp; amicum &amp; inimicum fait,</hi> it is
the will that doth make equality and inequalitie: for if men
were all beloued a like then ſhould they be charged alike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
their portions, but whether they be loued or hated in
theſe generall actions of inequalitie, the Poets wordes prooue
true, <hi>Sic volo, ſic iubeo, ſtat pro ratione voluntas,</hi> the will beareth
the greateſt ſway amongeſt ſeſſors, who are as skilfull in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction

can as cloſely vent their willes vnder a viſor, as Thamar did

               <p>It is my man (ſaith another) I will ſpare him in reſpect of his

               <p>It is my tenant (ſaith another) I muſt forbeare him becauſe I
am his Landlord: for he had need of an eaſy rate that payes an
hard rent.</p>
               <p>This may well be ſaid to be a <hi>Fauour:</hi> for ſuch as are thus
ſet at a lowe rate in the ſubſidy, are the leſſe ſubiect to priuie
ſeales, to millitarie munition, to multiplicine of charges, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17018:17"/>
came the prouerbe, <hi>vbi amici ibi opes,</hi> where there are frendes
there are riches; yet this is called a <hi>Fauour</hi> but abuſiuely as
Chriſt was called ſinne: for that cannot be deemed gratious
which occaſioneth a double diſgrace both in the ſeſſor and the
receptor.</p>
               <p>That may be ſaid of the ſeſſor which Nehemiah ſaid of ſuch
perſons, <hi>that which you doe is not good;</hi> Neh. 5. 9. for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

goodes they would be as neere as Naball was, loath to part fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a penny; if you will afforde a fauour where you affect, you
ſhould doe well to effect it with your owne: for theſe are
<hi>Reipublicae Bona</hi> and therefore this dooing is not worth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercie,
ſeeing it is rather to be deemed a fault then a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which are thus taxed with <hi>Fauour</hi> it is but an ecclips
to their credites by expoſing themſelues to all opprobrie: for
fleſh and bloude cannot brooke to ſee ſuch as haue wealth and

better then Impoſtors to their prince: for he that is rated moſt
according to his portion is a better ſubiect to his prince then
ſuch an one as exceedes him in common ſeſſements and yet is
taxed far vnder his ſubſtance, as the myte of the poore wydowe
was farre better to the treaſurie then the offerings of the

               <p>As thoſe which are taxed with fauour, it is perceiued by a

themſelues in their owne matters, they will cloake it <hi>ſub officio,</hi>
vnder their office, or pretence of ſome legall or regall buſines;
and becauſe this ſhall not ſeeme to be a paradoxe, I referre you
to ſcripturall inſtances for proofe.</p>
               <p>When the Rulers had a ſpite againſt Daniel becauſe he was
ſeconded by the king, they could no way tell howe to be reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but by ſoliciting the king to make a decree, that by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
thereof, they might worke their wills vpon good Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel.</p>
               <p>When Haman did malice Mordecai becauſe he would not
mooue his hatte, he durſt not openly be reuenged of him, but
by ſuggeſting the king to write letters, that vnder pretext ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he might haue his mind of good Mordecai.</p>
               <p>It is ſo generall a note in the nature of man, that ſuch as haue
their minds cauterized with malice, care not with what wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
they fight, ſo they may haue their wils.</p>

Theſe kinde of Seſſors ſhould conſider this ſaying, <hi>poſſe &amp;
nolle nobile,</hi> it is the part of a wiſeman ſometime to ſequeſter his
will from his power, and in ſome caſes <hi>not to doe, what he might
doe,</hi> is held for a true type of nobilitie; this were a good courſe
to kirbe in men of theſe conditions, that in their taxations they
deale not as their wils and affections carrie them, but as Cicero
ſaith, <hi>quid lex &amp; religio cogat,</hi> what lawe and religion compell
them, and to doe what is meete to be done, and not that which
they may doe: for who knowes not what a man in office may
doe <hi>pretextu officij</hi> by colour of his office, where there is no care
or conſcience in the execution of it?</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher ſaith, <hi>iniquus eſt qui inuidet aut fauet,</hi> that he
is a wicked perſon that doeth enuie or fauour eſpecially in
publique caſes where there ought to be ſome proportion in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie
without reſpect of partialitie: therefore Seſſors ſhould
doe wel to obſerue what a great reproch it is to be reputed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,

a moath to the cloth; and who would be branded for bad dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

world, or by caſting of the blacke ſtone (in ſigne of ignominie)
into the water, as it had woont to be an auncient cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
the heathens, to excuſe or accuſe men by caſting of
white and blacke ſtones into the water, which Ouid reporteth,

               <head type="sub">What perſons are liable and ought to be taxed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
common Impoſitions and
Charges.</head>
               <p>ALL perſons of abilitie as well ſubſidie men as others co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
within any citie, towne, village, &amp;c. are to be taxed
towards common impoſitions and charges.</p>
               <p>Charges are ſaid to be a burden, and we are taught to beare
one anothers burden: for a burden beeing borne by many,
though it be heauie, it will ſeeme light, according to the olde
ſaying, many hands make light worke.</p>
               <p>It is noted amongeſt ſwine, that one hogge will ſuccour an
other that is baited, then amongeſt Chriſtians one man ought
to helpe another that is burdened.</p>
               <p>It is the nature of dogges in fighting, not to reſcue, but to
fall vpon him that is beaten: men doe not differ from dogges,
if they will not releiue him that is vnder a burden, and if a good
man will be mercifull to his beaſt, he is worſe then a beaſt that
will not be mercifull to his brother.</p>
               <p>It is reported of that godly gouernour Nehemiah, howe in
a common wealth cauſe, to animate others, he made himſelfe
the firſt example; <hi>Euen I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doe it,</hi> Nehem. 5. 10. the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
is called <hi>Magiſtratus,</hi> either of <hi>magis</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtratus,</hi> becauſe
he is of more dignitie and authoritie then others; or of <hi>magis</hi> &amp;
<hi>ſtatus,</hi> becauſe he is of greater ſtate and abilitie then others: and
therefore ſuch as be Magiſtrates will rather <hi>addere</hi> then <hi>adime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
that is, they will be as readie to conioyne as to inioyne any
charge; for the office cannot priuiledge any from expence, but
as the Poet ſaith, <hi>Si quaratur honos non fugiatur onus,</hi> if any will
get honour by his office, he muſt not eſchewe the burden: and
ſuch as are readie to command and will not commute with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>eſt onus non honos,</hi> as one ſaith, it is chargeable but not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable:
for as Peter ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Maſter pittie thy ſelfe,</hi> ſo it
will be reported of theſe, they are of Peters minde, they will pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
themſelues though they oppreſſe others, but by reaſon of
authoritie they will not put their neckes to it, as it was ſaid of
the great men of Ieruſalem, Nehem. 3. 5. nay they will not put
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17018:19"/>
ſo much as their finger to it, as it was noted in the Scribes and
Phariſes, Math. 23. 4.</p>
               <p>It is obſerued in the Preiſts &amp; Leuites that in theſe common
charges they were preſidents to the common people: for they
are firſt placed to commend their forwardnes as you may read
in Neh. 3. 1. which is a good memento to all miniſters of the
word: for a miniſter is ſo called <hi>à miniſtrando</hi> of miniſtring, to
ſhew that there is required as well exhibition with the hand, as
exhortation with the tongue, which S. Gregorie noteth when
he ſaith <hi>qui alios ad bene operandum excitat ad bene agendum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum
ligat:</hi> he that exciteth others to welldooing doth bind
himſelfe to the like, otherwiſe as Cato ſaith, <hi>turpe eſt doctori</hi> it is
a ſhameful thing to the teacher if his deedes reprooue his doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
as it was in the Preiſt and Leuit who could ſhew others
the way, &amp; yet themſelues did ſhun the way when they ſhould
compaſſionate the wounded man.</p>
               <p>Thus when the magiſtrate doth <hi>prodeſſe</hi> aſwell as <hi>praeſſe</hi> and
the miniſter <hi>dare</hi> as well as <hi>fari,</hi> it muſt needes be a great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to the common ſort to followe: for ſimilitude and
example doe mooue much, faith Cicero, &amp; S. Auſtine ſaith that
examples are as ſermons to the vulgar people, and therefore as
many horſes which trauell together goe more willingly in the
way, ſo many men participating together, pay the more chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
their charges.</p>
               <p>There be ſome which vnder colour of office doe challenge
a kind of immunity from common charges: for it is a common
practiſe of Conſtables in ſome places in reſpect of their paines
to ſaue their purſes.</p>
               <p>In taking of paynes they doe but their office, the very word
<hi>officium</hi> doth ſignify duty, to teach ſuch as are in office to doe
their duties, which cannot be without paines.</p>
               <p>This duty and paines is required by the lawes of god &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>The word of God commandeth euery one that is in office
to be diligent therein, hereof it is written, <hi>let him that hath an
office waite of it,</hi> Rom. 12. 7. and therefore it is obſerued in
ſuch officers as feare God that they would performe their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with al ſedulitie euen for conſcience ſake without commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
they deemed it ſo odible to ſaue by their office. Neh. 5. 15.</p>
               <p>The lawes of men doe not only compell Conſtables to be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17018:19"/>
diligent &amp; attendant in the execution of their office, as appeares
in the <hi>Statutes</hi> made in the 33. Hen. 8. cap. 10. 37. Hen. 8.
cap. 8. and in diuers others, but there is inflicted puniſhments
vpon <hi>Conſtables</hi> for negligence in their office, in ſome caſes,
with the loſſe of fiue poundes, 14. Eliz. 5. in other caſes with
the loſſe of twenty poundes. 23. Hen. 6. cap. 14, yea and in
ſome caſes with the loſſe of all their goods. 11. Hen. 4. cap. 12.
ſo that paines is vrged as a thing penall.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould reaſon a <hi>pari</hi> by comparing the Conſtables
paines with others that are in office, if you conſider the office
of <hi>ouerſeers</hi> for the poore, they take triple paines to the conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and neglect their owne priuate buſines for a publique be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
and yet they are contributors as well as others, and ſhall
Conſtables be paid for their paines? <hi>de ſimilibus ſimile debet eſſe
iudicium,</hi> I can ſee no reaſon for it in equity or equality.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould reſpect the loſſe of their time, why? in dooing
of their duties they doe redeeme the time, when in their idle
paſtimes and ſportes they doe but miſpend the time, and ſeeing
as Plato ſaith, <hi>Naſcimur pro patria,</hi> how can they better improue
their time then for the common good of their country, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we ought to dedicate our paines, purſes, and perſons if
occaſion conſtraineth?</p>
               <p>In Citties and in great townes where there are many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables,
their paines are the leſſer, but their <hi>ſauings</hi> are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
In a leuie of twenty poundes, if Conſtables may be ſuffered
to reſerue their owne payments, how ſoone may they ſaue
aboue thirty ſhillings according to ordinary rates, which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable?
conſidering it far exceedeth princely allowance: for
the Conſtable or other officer in ſubcoliecting of the ſubſidy
hath but two pence in the pound allowed him, and ſhall the
Conſtables ſaue aboue eighteene pence in the pound for the
collection of all other common charges? <hi>nominatim aliquos re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
poſſum:</hi> I feare there be too too many, I will not maligne
them, but God amend them.</p>
               <p>If you ſearch all the <hi>statutes</hi> you ſhall not find (vnleſſe it be
in the ſubcollection of the ſubſidy) that conſtables are to make
a profit of their paines: for then it were rather an occupation
then an office; and therefore this kind of ſauing is not to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in a common welth: for it is condemned in the ſcriptures
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17018:20"/>
by an argument drawen <hi>à maiori ad minue</hi> from the greater to
the leſſer in this ſort; ſuch as were couetous were not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to office by the word of god Exod, 18. 21. but theſe which
ſaue their owne charges vnder coulour of their office are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
<hi>ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This vnderhand ſauing may by circumſtance be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned
by our poſitiue lawes, in this manner. Sauing is ſecret kind of
getting, he that ſecretly getteth by ſiniſter meanes is no better
then a theefe, and therefore if he be deemed a felon by our
lawes which taketh aboue fiue ſhillings from a priuat perſon
what ſhall we terme theſe that defraud the Common-welth of
ſo much mony in a publique charge? It makes me remember
that pretie alluſion of M. Cato ſitting to this purpoſe, <hi>fures te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues</hi>
the leſſer theeues (ſaith he) are reſtrained with ſhackells &amp;
linckes of iron about their legges, but the greater theeues, doe
<hi>geſtare in colo Catenas aureas,</hi> iett vp and downe with chaines
of gould about their neckes, and coſtly induments vpon their
bodie. I pray god theſe kind of ſauers be not ſuch, if they be
they are no better then caterpillers to a common-welth.</p>
               <p>There be others that plead a priuiledge from common
charges; becauſe they are out of the Subſidy booke; if they
be of any competent ability, this is rather a reaſon of ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis
to make them capable of other charges: for ſeeing they
neither pay ſubſidy, or finde armor as others doe which are in
the ſubſidy, they may the better contribute to other charges.</p>
               <p>Who knowes not that many are ſpared out of the ſubſidie
for many reſpectes and yet they are (or ought to be) lyable
to the charge of puruey for the prince, prouiſion for the
poore, impoſitions of a towne? the widowe gaue her myte, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
as others that gaue more, he liueth like a hogge that doth
no good while he liueth, nay as Seneca ſaith, <hi>Non viuit qui ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini
viuit</hi> he liueth not at all, that liueth for none but himſelfe.</p>
               <p>He that will haue the roſe muſt away aſwell with the pricke
as the ſauour, the philoſopher could ſay <hi>qui ſentit commodum
debet ſentire onus,</hi> he that receiueth profit muſt not refuſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:
for ſuch as cohabit together to reape a benefit, muſt be
coadiutors together for eaſe of a burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, otherwiſe they deſerue
not the name of a neighbour, but are fit to be ſecluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſocietie.</p>
