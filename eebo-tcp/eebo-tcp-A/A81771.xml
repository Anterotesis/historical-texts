         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>IN thoſe cold Regions which no Summers chear,</l>
            <l>When brooding darkneſs covers half the year,</l>
            <l>To hollow Caves the ſhivering Natives go;</l>
            <l>Bears range abroad, and hunt in tracks of Snow:</l>
            <l>But when the tedious Twilight wears away,</l>
            <l>And Stars grow paler at th' approach of Day,</l>
            <l>The longing Crowds to frozen Mountains run,</l>
            <l>Happy who firſt can ſee the glimmering Sun!</l>
            <l>The ſurly Salvage Off-ſpring diſappear;</l>
            <l>And curſe the bright Succeſſour of the Year.</l>
            <l>Yet, though rough Bears in Covert ſeek defence,</l>
            <l>White Foxes ſtay, with ſeeming Innocence:</l>
            <l>That crafty kind with day-light can diſpenſe.</l>
            <l>Still we are throng'd ſo full with <hi>Reynard</hi>'s race,</l>
            <l>That Loyal Subjects ſcarce can find a place:</l>
            <l>Thus modeſt Truth is caſt behind the Crowd:</l>
            <l>Truth ſpeaks too Low; Hypocriſie too Loud.</l>
            <l>Let 'em be firſt, to flatter in ſucceſs;</l>
            <l>Duty can ſtay; but Guilt has need to preſs.</l>
            <l>Once, when true Zeal the Sons of God did call,</l>
            <l>To make their ſolemn ſhow at Heaven's <hi>White-hall,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The fawning Devil appear'd among the reſt,</l>
            <l>And made as good a Courtier as the beſt.</l>
            <l>The Friends of <hi>Job,</hi> who rail'd at him before,</l>
            <l>Came Cap in hand when he had three times more.</l>
            <l>Yet, late Repentance may, perhaps, be true;</l>
            <l>Kings can forgive if Rebels can but ſue:</l>
            <l>A Tyrant's Pow'r in rigour is expreſt:</l>
            <l>The Father yearns in the true Prince's Breaſt.</l>
            <l>We grant an Ore'grown Whig no grace can mend;</l>
            <l>But moſt are Babes, that know not they offend.</l>
            <l>The Crowd, to reſtleſs motion ſtill enclin'd,</l>
            <l>Are Clouds, that rack according to the Wind.</l>
            <l>Driv'n by their Chiefs they ſtorms of Hail-ſtones pour:</l>
            <l>Then mourn, and ſoften to a ſilent ſhowre.</l>
            <l>O welcome to this much offending Land</l>
            <l>The Prince that brings forgiveneſs in his hand!</l>
            <l>Thus Angels on glad Meſſages appear:</l>
            <l>Their firſt Salute commands us not to fear:</l>
            <l>Thus Heav'n, that cou'd conſtrain us to obey,</l>
            <l>(With rev'rence if we might preſume to ſay,)</l>
            <l>Seems to relax the rights of Sov'reign ſway:</l>
            <l>Permits to Man the choice of Good and Ill;</l>
            <l>And makes us Happy by our own Free-will.</l>
