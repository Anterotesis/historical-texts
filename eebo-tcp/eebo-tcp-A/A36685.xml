            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>FOols, which each man meets in his Dish each day,</l>

               <l>Like yolks of Eggs, a dozen beat to one.</l>
               <l>Observing Poets all their walks invade,</l>
               <l>As men watch Woodcocks gliding through a Glade:</l>
               <l>And when they have enough for Comedy,</l>

                  <speaker>Sir Mart.</speaker>
                  <p>Lord! what luck is that now! well Sir, it happen'd, one of her Gloves fell down, I stoop'd to take it up; And in the stooping made her a Complement.—</p>

                  <p>The Devil cannot hold him, now will this thick-skull'd Master of mine tell the whole story to his Rival—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir. Mart.</speaker>
                  <p>You'l say, 'twas strange Sir; but at the first glance we cast on one another, both our hearts leap'd within us, our Souls met at our Eyes, and with a tickling kind of pain slid to each others breast, and in one moment setled as close and warm, as if they long had been acquainted with their lodging. I follow'd her somewhat at a distance, because her Father was with her.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Mart.</speaker>
                  <p>Sawcy Rascal, avoid my sight; Must you tutor me? So Sir, not to trouble you, I enquir'd out her Father's House, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whose knowledge I did Court the Daughter, and both then and often since coming to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> I receiv'd many proofs of her kindness to me.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Well remember'd i'faith, I thank thee for that, I had forgot it I protest! my <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> whom you see here with me, grows me acquainted with her Woman—</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Mart.</speaker>
                  <p>In fine Sir, this Maid being much in her Mistresses favour, so well sollicited my Cause, that in fine I gain'd from fair Mistress <hi>Millisent</hi> an assurance of her kindness, and an ingagement to marry none but me.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>A most pleasant Relation I assure you: you are a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man Sir! but, What occasion brought you now to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</hi>

                  <speaker>Sir Mart.</speaker>
                  <p>That was in expectation to meet my Mistress here; she writ me word from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> she and her Father shortly would be here.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Sir Mart.</speaker>
                  <p>So I will Sir, without your bidding: her Father and she are come up already, that's the truth on't, and are to lodge by my Contrivance in you House; the Master of which is a cunning Rascal as any in Town—him I have made my own, for I lodge there.</p>

               <l>AS Country Vicars, when the Sermon's done,</l>
               <l>Run hudling to the Benediction;</l>
               <l>Well knowing, though the better sort may stay,</l>
               <l>The Vulgar Rout will run unblest away:</l>
               <l>So we, when once our Play is done, make haste</l>
               <l>With a short Epilogue to close your taste.</l>
               <l>In thus withdrawing we seem mannerly,</l>
               <l>But when the Curtain's, down we peep and see</l>
               <l>A Jury of the Wits who still stay late,</l>
               <l>And in their Club decree the poor Plays fate;</l>
               <l>Their Verdict back is to the Boxes brought,</l>
               <l>Thence all the Town pronounces it their thought.</l>
               <l>Thus, Gallants, we like <hi>Lilly</hi> can foresee,</l>
               <l>But if you ask us what our doom will be,</l>
               <l>We by to morrow will our Fortune cast,</l>
               <l>As he tells all things when the Year is past.</l>
