            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I haue done eny good hit is of God / and

Kuke sayng / when ye haue done all the

say ye / we be vnprousitable servauntes / 
we haue done but oure dutye. And thys
is the verey Christen humylite / as in this
present boke shalbe more pleynly declared
And if we can thus repute all oure good
workes for sinne / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in theym to have no
maner of trust and then ageyn beleve that
we shalbe saved by the promyses of god / 
we be the children of Abraham / of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
all the scriptures bere witnesse that by
his faith he was iustified / and gat helth.
And for that cause he is called the father of
belevers and of the feithfull. And this ys
the fayth wherof I wryte here i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this boke
to thintent that all parsones myght come
to knowledge and knowe whate ys the
Christen sayth. Of the whyche all the sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riptures
do speake / and namely the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
after S. Iohn / and the epistles of S.
Paule / for heryn do these two apostles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

all other scripture.</p>
            <p>And for bicause that it behoueth that
the parson beleve that his faith iustifieth
him / and not his workes I haue shortly
compyled here and declared howe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yth
doth iustifie vs / and howe we be the
children of God / and howe we must ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
oure father by charite / and howe that
we shalt nothyng doubt of oure helth by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the wordes of God. And when
a parson getteth thys hope he learneth to
bere pacyenly all tribulacyon and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.
For he knoweth that this lyfe ys not
hys lyfe / and hath greate desyre aftrr the
other lyfe / and holdeth not this lyfe for
hys. And this maketh the fayth the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
ys alwayes affectuously attendaunte
after Christ oure espouse. But he that
hath not this fayth is all desolate when he
hath mysfortune / and yf to hym yt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
well he gyveth hym silfe to voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osite
and sinne. And for bicause he hath
no hope of the everlasting life he thinkes
in him silf I will vse this life as long as it
is le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me / And that he doth bicause he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
not whate oure feith is / &amp; whate our

God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14850:5"/>
To thintent therfore that none gyue
him silfe to sinne by desperacion I have
shortly compyled in this present boke / ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
that we be iustified with out oure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
For when eny parson hath done
his best with all his power / as I haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yd / 
then let him say yet / that he is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proufitable
servaunt. And the humble her
te wherby he knowlegith his imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
maketh that his sinnes / his evell tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ughtes
and the fragilite of his flesshe to
him be pardoned of god and that lytell th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
he hath / god gyveth it him of him silfe /

maketh him rightuous, for Iesu christ ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>th
satisfied for vs vnto his heve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father / 
for to come in socoure to oure infirmite.

in the first epistle vnto the Corinthyans / 
and saynt Iohn in the seconde chaptre of
his first epistle. And of this mater treateth

            <p>The last part of this boke sheweth ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we

is not to refourme all estates aswell espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituell

howe we shulde lyve if we wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
lyve according to the gospell / to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
that every man may knowe / howe farre

the children of the devell bicause of the

            <p>There were sumtyme .ij. Adams / as

Adam (that ys to sey Iesus Christ)
hath bought vs agayn / and hath put vs

Nowe then when we be baptised we

betoken / I say / that we will dye as vnto

by baptesme into deth. So that we shall
not lyve after the lyfe of the world nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

as the children of god. And oure lyfe shal
be hyd befor the world and also hyd with

we shall not repute this life that we haue

            <p>This life here is of the world and of

that be estraungers to God that haue no

You be not of the world / but I haue
chosen you from the world. And agayn.
The world shalbe ioyons and you shalbe

<pb facs="tcp:14850:10"/>
but all those that lyve after the flesshe
whiche desyre not here to dye with Iesu

with God. All suche whatesoever they
be are worldly be he monke or chanone / 
nunne or Syster / nobill or vnnoble grete

of theym whiche apperteyn to God is here

they be hated of the world / for they be

if they were of the world / the world sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

for as moche as they (accordyng to theyre
promyse made at the font of baptesme) do
applye theym silves to renounce the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

in killing of the desyres of the flesshe / and
also are strongly ageynst the appetites of
the flesshe in other by ensaumple of theyre
good lyving therfore be they persecuted of
the world.</p>
            <p>And hereby may we alweyes knowe

            <p>So shuld we all lyve here / as though

abide oure life before God / and we may
do none other thing in this life but fight.
Ageynst oure evell desires / and learne to

And Iesus Christ hath aswell suffered
deth for the comon housholder / as for the

            <p>Therfore it is very nedefull that the

            <p>It were also very necessary that every

that euery one might vnderstond it / and
they preached in latyn / and the prophetes

And in that tyme there were many la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyes

So is it nowe of greate necessite th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at

He beleveth in god that putteth all his

certeynly that god will hold to hym
that he hath promysed remission of sinnes

Neverthelesse he beleveth that he

Of a truth I perceyve that god is not per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyall / 
but in all people he that feareth hym
and worketh rightuousnesse is accepted
with him, for god nedeth not oure works

            <p>This loue comith in vs (as I haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id)

that he is the childe of God. It nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th
not that suche a parsone be constreyned

For the love of god dwelling yn

               <pb facs="tcp:14850:40"/>

Suche a love or charyte bryngeth a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

a parsone vnto suche a love / or to suche a
faith &amp; trust in god. These workes spring
out of feith and not feith out of these wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes.
for as I haue seid feith bringeth loue
and loue bringeth good workes.</p>
            <p>Lyke as though there were a riche ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with out children or heyres which might
take a poore beggar out of the strete and
make hym his heyre of his goodes. This
poore man beyng this made greate and ry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
if he wold be thankefull (as becomith
hym to be) shuld serve hys lorde or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
(whiche had thus exalted hym &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
him ryche) truely and with greate loue
Ye and if he ones might knowe the wil of
his master / he wold not deferre the doing
therof till he were commaunded: But he
wold do all thinges by and by of his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
courage for the charyte or loue that he
<pb facs="tcp:14850:40"/>
hath toward his master without comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undement.</p>
            <p>Behold this poore man so exalted hath
not deserved by hys workes nor by hys
service that this riche man shuld so make
him his heyre / but the riche man hath ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
him his heyre of hys owne goodnesse
without that the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had in eny ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner

this poore man doth afterward comith
of loue and kyndnesse. For he knoweth
and beleveth surely that he is heyre of the
godes of his lord bifore that he do any ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vice.
And for bicause that he beleveth that
the ryche man will kepe promyse wyth
hym / he beginneth to love him by the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
of this faith. And so when he loveth
hym / he doth to him willingly and wyth
good hert / all the service he can / and fulfil <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

ioyfully his commaundementes and
all by love. And the more laboure &amp; servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
that he can do for his good master the
more grete pleasure he taketh.</p>
            <p>So is it of a good Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he
was yet enemye of god by the sinne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam /

eny maner wise deserved it. Thus hath
god made vs his children and heyres wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hout
oure deserving. Then when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leve
this stedfastly this faith bringeth lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue

so greate and excellent. And when we so

by loue and do all thinges with good wil
As saieth Christ in saint Iohn:<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> He that lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>veth

And so kepe we all thinges and suffre all

saint Paule:<note place="margin">Ro. 5</note> we reioyce in tribulacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

doing the workes comprysed in the

For God will have the hole hart a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d will

this stonding that with an entier hert

for god abideth alweyes one. All the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>I haue many tymes seyd that fayth
bringeth Charyte / and charite good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.
For if thy feith induce the not to do
good workes: then hast thou not the right
fayth. Thou doest but onely thinke that
thou hast it. For saint Iames sayeth that
faith without workes is dede in it silf.<note place="margin">Ia. 2</note> He
feith not that it is lytell or feble but that it
is deed. And that that is deed is not. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ore
<pb facs="tcp:14850:52"/>
when thou art not moved by feith vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
the love of god / and by the love of god
vnto good workes / thou hast not the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yth / 
but the feith is deed in the. for the spri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
of god that by feyth comith into our her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes

loveth as moche as he hopeth.<note place="margin">Iohn. 3</note> As wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Saint Iohn / he that hath this hope
that he is the sonne of god purifyeth hym
silf as he is pure. He seith not he that puri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyeth
him silf hath this hope. for the hope
must come byfore / proceding from the feith
as it behoveth that the tre must first be
good whiche must bring forth good frute.
The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it behoveth to know first that ye are
the children of God and afterward to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure.</p>
            <p>But whate shall we do? we shall do
and lyve so with oure christen bretheren / 
as Christ hath lived and done with vs th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>at

            <p>Whate we shuld do for oure Christen
bretheren teacheth vs like wise saint Pau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
sayng. Serve ye one an other by love &amp;
bere ye one an others burthen. For christ
commaundeth vs to exercyse the workes
of mercy wherof he shall hold his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
All other workes that men do at th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>is
day in the churches be rather found by
auarice then commaunded of god / except
the prayers whiche may in no wise be do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
to get money / but alonely by loue yn
praying one for an other.</p>
            <p>Behold nowe seest thou well howe
grete occasyon thou hast to do good. For
thou hast alweyes occasion to mortyfie
thine evill desires to serve thyne neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure /

In suche loue towardes oure neygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boure
for the loue of God lyeth all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
and the prophetes (as sayeth Christ).
Ye and all the verey Christente / and nat
in fasting / keping of halydayes / watching
praying and synging long prayers / dayly
<pb facs="tcp:14850:54"/>
and all day hering of masses / setting vp of
candels / runnyng on pilgremages / and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suche thinges / whiche aswell the ypo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chrites / 
proude people / envious / and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
to all wikked affections doo: Ye a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
many tymes enforce theym silf more there
vnto then the good christen. But so to ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ve
and socoure the one the other by verey
love can none do but they that haue true
faith and the verey love of god. And who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soever
so loveth his christen brother he is
alweyes ioyfull in his conscience. For he
knoweth surely that he is the child of god
and that God is his good father / and is
well content in his courage of all that god
sendeth vnto him. But he that hath not
this love is alweyes sory / full of anguis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>she
and woteth not whate to do to deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
more / he fasteth / he kepeth halydayes / 
nowe of one saint / nowe of an other. He se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yth
his prayers nowe bifore one altre / no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we
bifore an other. He renneth on pilgre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
nowe here nowe there and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come vnto the rest and quyet of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>science.
For suche workes make no man
sure / but make rather ypochrites trustyng
in theyre workes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14850:54"/>
But the verey faithfull cleveth to god / 
for he knoweth that he may never satisfie
nor do ynough to deserve the everlasting
life. And therfore he putteth hys trust yn
god &amp; beleveth stedfastly that he hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
for vs / &amp; that he hath iustifyed vs.
And therfore it is all one to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whate thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g

is the Christen feyth.
Chaptre .xiij.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His present Chapitre (bycause
I haue moche spoken of faith / &amp;
that scarcely of a thousand one
knoweth not this feith) teacheth
of how many maner feithes there is made
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the holy scripture / not as do now
<pb facs="tcp:14850:55"/>
the doctours whiche have founde many
maner of feythes. I will onely speke of
iiij. maner of feithes whiche are most comu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nely
fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in the holy scripture. The first
faith is this whiche the marchauntes hold
one to an other and feithfull frendes / wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
they kepe promyse and fidelite the one
to the other:<note place="margin">Eccle. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd. 27</note> wherof speketh the wise say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
possesse or kepe feith with thy frende / 
in his povertye: to thintent that in his we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lth
thou mayst be ioyfull. And ageyn he
that discloseth the secret of his frende / lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his faith. And in the Proverbes: He
that gyveth his faith for a straunger shall
be vexed with evell. And this is the faith
wherof the worldly people complaine sey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
there is no feith in the worlde.</p>
            <p>The seconde feith is when we beleve
that a thing is to come / and suche thinges
as we here or rede: as we beleve that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
is a Cytie in Italye / or that Cartage
was destroyed of the Romayns / and this
we beleve although we haue not sene yt.
Also we beleve that Iesu Christ hath he
relyved on erth and that he hath preached
and that he is d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed for vs / and that he hath
done many other thinges. when we bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
<pb facs="tcp:14850:55"/>
these thinges after the story we beleve
that this is oure christen faith / The sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
people aloneli doth not beleve this but
also many doctours in Theologye which
are taken for wise. Ye the devell hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
this faith / as sayeth saint Iames: The
devels beleve and tremble.<note place="margin">Ia. 2.</note> for (as we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
seyd byfore) the devell beleveth that
god is god / and that Iesus Christ hath
here preached / that he was deed / buryed &amp;
rysen. This must we also beleve / but yet
this is not the faith wherof speaketh the
gospell and saint Paule.</p>
            <p>The third faith is that we beleve that
god may all thinges / and that he is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous / 
good and holye. This faith haue
also the devels and Iudas had it also / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
other disciples that did miracles in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of Iesus but they were therfore never
the better. for when they bosted theym sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
and were ioyfull that by theyre faith
they expulsed the devils in the name of
Iesus.<note place="margin">Lu. 10</note> Iesus Christ hath reproved them
saying: Ioy not you that the spretes be
vnder your power / but reioyce bicause yo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ure
names be writen in heven.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> Of this fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yth
writeth saint Paule vnto the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
<pb facs="tcp:14850:56"/>
saying: If that I had all feith so
that I coude move mountaignes oute of
theyre places / and yet had no love I we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
nothing.</p>
            <p>The .iiij. faith is oure Christen fayth / 
wherof so moche speake Iesu christ / saynt
Paule and saint Iohn / and sey that it ys
the foundacion of christendome. And this
is the feith wherof I speake in this boke
None hath this faith but they that put all
theyre trust / hope comfort / refuge and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
all theire helth in god alone serching
all these thinges in him and loking for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of him / and not of theyre deservinges or
good workes. Of this feith speaketh saint
Paul saying: whosoever call on the name
of god shalbe saved.<note place="margin">Ro. 10</note> And the prophete Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>remye / 
Blessed is that man that trusteth
in the lord god.<note place="margin">Iere. 17</note> And Christ in the Gospell
To thinient that none that beleve in him
shuld periss he but shuld haue everlasting
life.<note place="margin">Iohn. 3</note> And in the boke called Paralipomeno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Beleve in your lord God and you shalbe
assured and without thought.<note place="margin">Pa. 20</note> Beleve his
Prophetes and all happy thinges shal co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me
vnto you. And almost all the Psalmes
all the prophetes and all the leves of the
<pb facs="tcp:14850:56"/>
holy Byble teache vs that we must bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
and hope in God by a sted fast fayth.
wherof speaketh so moche Saynt Paule
the apostle / and whiche he prayseth so mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
in all hys epistles. And (as we haue
abundauntly sayd in the Chaptres by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
none may comprehend thys fayth / 
but he that considereth whate was the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yth
of Abraham: As wryteth saynt Pau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
vnto the Galathyans saying: Abraham
beleved God and yt ys rekened to hym
for ryghtuousnesse.<note place="margin">Ga. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> For by hys fayth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th
he obteyned that he ys called oure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and we be called hys children yn the
holye scripture / that ys to sey / we be the
childern of the fayth. For by the meane
of oure fayth we be saved / as Abraham
was iustified by his fayth and hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by hys fayth that all they that shall
haue suche fayth may lyke wyse be iusty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.
For this cause whosoever hath
not the fayth of Abraham / nothing can
come vnto hym of that whiche Abraham
beleved. That ys to say / when
God ys not thy hope and thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte / 
when thou abydest not wyth a
<pb facs="tcp:14850:57"/>
stedfast trust vppon God when thou art
not redy to suffer and endure all thinges / 
namely also the deth for the loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of god: And also to lose all that thou
hast in the world thou art not the childe of
Abraham. For Abraham was redy to all
thinges wherunto god wold send hym.
Suche was Iob when he sayed:<note place="margin">Iob. 13</note> Albeit
that he kill me I will put my trust in him
And the wise saieth.<note place="margin">Pro. 12</note> Whatsoever thing co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me
to the rightuous let him not sorowe.
And saint Pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le saieth who shall separat

as saint Petre saieth:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> who is he that may
hurte you if ye be haunters and folowers
of goodnesse. For all that ever comyth vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
the when thou hast this feith be it of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
or of the devell all comyth to thy proufit.
As saieth saint Paule vnto the Romains
To theym that love God all thinges be
helping and avauncement to good.<note place="margin">Ro. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And therfore pray we alweyes that the
will of god be done. For as he is not here
come (as he seyd him silf) to do his will / <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note>
but the will of his hevenly father / So sh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all<note place="margin">Iohn. 5</note>
not the good Christen desyre that hys
<pb facs="tcp:14850:57"/>
owne will be done / but the will of God.
And therfore shalt thou bere al thinges pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciently
as did Abraham with a stedfast fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yth
knowing surely that god will not for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sake
the for god is thy father and thou art
his childe. And it behoveth that he do
with the what him pleaseth. For seyng
that he is all good he will nothing but thi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
helth.</p>
            <p>None can have suche a feyth if he haue
not therwith the love of god. And he that
hath the loue of god / hath fulfilled the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
for all the scriptures teache vs none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing but that we loue god with all
oure hartes and oure neyghbour as oure
silf / as it is writen in saint Mathewe.<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
is a true christen but he that hath this
loue. All other be rather ypochrites then
Christen. For all good workes which be
not done by charyte / and of good will are
all synne byfore God as saieth saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styn:
He that doth good ageynst his will / 
he doth evill albeit that that that he doth
be good. For all that I do ageynst my
will I hate it. And when I hate the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement
I hate also him that hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded
it. And as long as the parsone
<pb facs="tcp:14850:58"/>
ys suche he may not be rightuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
may be rightuous but he that kepeth &amp;
fulfilleth the commaundementes of God
by charyte / and with a ioyfull hart. And
this is a singular grace of god. And therfo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
may none be proude of it / for he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not
haue it of him silf. So hath a man nothing
of him silf wherwith he may exalt him silf
For without God can we do nothing.<note place="margin">Iohn. 15</note>
As Christ him silf sayeth / wit out me ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ye do nothing / No not ones haue of your
silf one good thought as sayeth saint Pau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4</note>
whate hast thou that thou hast nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved
wherfore there is no wey more su<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
to come to everlasting life then to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him silf byfore God / and to pray hym
humbly of mercy nothing trusting in hys
good workes / but with a ferme trust for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
him silf to knowlege alweyes to
god his imperfection. For we can come to
nothing by oure good workes if we put
eny trust in theym. For they are nothing
eis but sinne / and stinking byfore God / 
when God helpeth vs not by hys grace.<note place="margin">Esai. 64</note>
As saieth the prophete Esaie. We are all

            <p>Of suche life was also saynt Martyne

and povertie they haue forgetten.
And by suche meanes is the life of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
come vnto voluptuousnesse and vnto
all vanyte by thabundaunce of richesse.
Thus haue they begonne to be ydell / and
wold not get theyre expences by laboure
of theyre hondes / as it was ordeyned at
the beginning. Thus by ydelnesse are thei
come vnto all evell and perversite and by
grete hepes be they fled out of theyre cloy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sters
Monkes and Nonnes. Then
was it ordeyned (as it semith) that bifore
saint Bernardes tyme the monkes did ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
professyon.</p>
            <p>After that the life of monkes was so
corrupted came saint Bernard to cloyster
<pb facs="tcp:14850:66"/>
and then were the monkes refourmed.
Then did they ageyn diligently take they<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
astate and began ageyn to charge they<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
ordre with profession and promesse and
haue made many statutes after the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
they mought live / and wherby they
might compell men therto for the willing

            <p>After this is comen the .iiij. secte of
monkes. As Norbertus / saint Dominyk

But the gretter that the nombre of mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

whiche of theyre ordres were most ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
and better then other and many other

            <p>After this haue the mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> popes
and cardynals of theyre relygion. And
also they haue purchased and gotten to

<pb facs="tcp:14850:77"/>
And the more he doth of suche wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
the more great ypochriste he becomyth
And so abideth he alweyes a merchaunte
with god for he serveth for wages. But
if thou wilt entre into religion thou must
do it for the love of God bicause god hath
made vs his children for to thanke him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyn
and to fle the synne whiche reyneth
emong the worldly. For he that doeth th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
he thinketh that he can never do servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

He laboureth not for to get the eternall ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe

to give thankes of the goodnesse that
god hath done vnto him alredy bycause
that he beleveth and knoweth of trouth
that he is the childe of God and his heyre.</p>
            <p>And therfore when eny hath the feith
wherof we haue bifore spoken he is to be
praysed that by thankfulnesse doth separa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
him silf from the worlde for to fle the da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ungyers
therof. For the worlde hath a th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ousand
occasyons to synne / principally for
yong people. Wherfore this is not a thing
to be dispraysed that a parson yelde him in
a good religion to amend his lyfe. But if
<pb facs="tcp:14850:77"/>
one fynde nowe in the Monasteryes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

hatred / envye and ypochrysye then in
the worlde it were moche better to abyde
out / ye or if one be entred to voyde out ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to lerne there to haunt suche life.
For one must go thider to amend his life / 
not to waxe worse.</p>
            <p>But thou mayst saye: I haue made
profession and promesse: I must abide. I
haue seid bifore that none is bounde to hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de / 
ye that none ought to hold eny promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
that is contrary vnto his helth. Herken
to this that saint Paule sayeth:<note place="margin">2. Tessa. 3</note> We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde

when eny yong woman promysed chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te

bicause there were then no monasteries su<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
virgins kept theym silves in the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

One might lightly knowe them by the clo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the

            <p>After this Marcella and Paula did en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpryse
to bilde a monastery at Rome for
that suche virgyns did not lyve without

get theyre expences by the laboure of they<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
hondes. They sang not as do Nonnes
nowe a dayes but red psalmes working.
Thus served they God in all obedience /

Theyre rayment was simple to dispyse
the world. Theyre hedes were covered

            <p>Thou shalt also teche theym the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten

to sey / howe they haue an other father in

seke nothing in al this life / in all oure wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes

            <p>And howe that his will can be but good / 
and helthfull. Finally howe that aboue
all worldly thinges they be myndfull of
the contentes of this prayer / and set most

to passe that so fewe come chast to the state

               </gap>wo sortes of people in the worlde.
The first belong vnto the kingdome of
god. The other to the kingdome of the
worlde. They that belong vnto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God be all true faythfull people
in Iesus Christ and vnder him.</p>
            <p>For Christ is king and lord in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God / As techeth vs the secunde
Psalme / and also all the olde and newe te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
He came also in to the worlde to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyn
and to lest vp the kingdome of god in
the worlde. Therfore saide he to Pylate:
My kingdome is not of this worlde.</p>
            <p>And whosoever is of the trouth hereth
my voice.<note place="margin">Iohn. 18</note> And in saint Marke sayeth he
that the tyme is fulfilled and the kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of God shall approche.<note place="margin">Mar. 1.</note> And in Saynt
Mathewe sayeth he.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> Seche first the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God. He calleth the Gospell a gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell
of the kingdome of god / bycause the
Gospell teacheth / governeth and kepeth / 
the same kingdome. Then they that are
stedfast in the faithe &amp; in the love of god yf
they obey vnto his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes have
nought to do with the swerd of iustice nor
of the seculer power to make theym righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.
And yf all the worlde
<pb facs="tcp:14850:105"/>
were true and verey Christen (that is to
sey) veri feithfull there nede no governou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
king lord sworde nor iustice. For wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
shulde they sarve seyng that all true
christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shulde haue the holy goost whiche
governeth and teacheth theym to do no
wronge / to love all the world / to suffre / 
and endure the evell and iniurye of all the
worlde willingly and ioyfully / ye also the
deth. And where as all persones are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
willingly to suffre wrong and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye.
And where as there is none that doth
wronge nor iniurye / but where as all per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sones
do ryght / there is no dyscord hatred
envie nor other discencion. And there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no ryght nor punycyon.</p>
            <p>Wherfore it were i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>possible that the swerd
of iustice shuld haue ought to do emong
the verey true christen / seyng they do mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
more of theym silves then eny man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>commaunde
theym or then eny lawe or
worldly doctrine can teche theym. As
sayth sai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Paule vnto Timoth. vnto the
ryghtuous there is no lawe sette / but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the vnryghtuous.<note place="margin">1. Tim. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> And this is thus bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the iugement and ryght of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey
true christen fordereth and avaunceth
<pb facs="tcp:14850:106"/>
more then all other ryghtes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d lawes: for
it procedeth from the holy goost whiche
possesseth and inhabiteth the hart of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey
christen. But the vnryghtuous do
ryght to no man / therfore they haue nede
of ryght and of lawes wherby they be tau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ght
and constreyned to do well. A good
tree nedeth not that one teche hym to bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng
forth good frute for his nature gyveth
it without ony reching. Likewise are all
the verey true christen natured by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
goost and saith that they do all thinges
well and as it aperteyneth more then eny
man can commaunde theym by all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes
in the worlde. And for
theym silves haue they no nede nether of
lawe nether of ryght.</p>
            <p>But some man myght axe whye then
hath god gyve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto men so many comma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>undementes / 
yn the olde and newe testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
I answerethe. Saint Paule seith
as it is sayde byfore vnto the ryghtuous
there is set no lawe: but to the vnright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
that is to sey to theym that are not
yet true christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And forbicause that none
is true and verey christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or good of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re / 
but be all synnars and evill: As wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesseth
<pb facs="tcp:14850:106"/>
the prophete sayng: God hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
from heven vppon the children of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that he mought se if there be eny vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonding<note place="margin">Psat. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

or seching god. All are fallen and
are become abhominable there is none that
doeth good no not one. Therfore god re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freyneth
the malice of the people by the la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we
that they dare not accomplisshe hit out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardly
by worke and dede according to
theyre evill will.</p>
            <p>Mereover saint Paule gyveth vnto
the lawe an other office / that is that it let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth
vs to knowe oure synnes / by the
whiche knowelege a man is made meke / 
and yeldeth hym silf to the faith / and
vnto the mercy and grace of god as is bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seyde.</p>
            <p>Fourthly all they that be not yet christen
belong vnto the kingdome of the worlde
and be vnder the lawe. In this nombre
are all the evill christen whiche seke nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght
elles but all worldly pleasure and are
called christen but they are not so.</p>
            <p>Seyng then that there be so fewe good
Christen and so many evill people god
hath gyven vnto the same evill out of the
Christen astate and out of his kingdome
<pb facs="tcp:14850:107"/>
an other regyment and governaunce / and
hath put theym vnder the swerde that is
to sey vnder the seculer power and cyvill
ryght to thintent that they may not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisshe
theyre malice when they wolde As
a myschevous wylde best is tyed with
chaynes and bondes that he may nether
bite nor stryke after his nature albeit that
he wolde saine acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plisshe hys evel nature
whiche is not nedefull vnto a gentill tame
best / for without the cheynes and without
bondes he doth noue evill to no man.</p>
            <p>If it were not thus (bicause that there be
many m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> evill persones yn the worlde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
good / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the good do not resist evill)
the one wolde devoure and put the other
to destruction / yn suche facyon that none
shulde be abill to kepe nether wife nor chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren
nether yet be abill to maynteyn hym
silf. And by suche meane shulde the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
yn contynuaunce become wast a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with
out inhabitauntes. For this cause hath
god ordyned these .ij. governeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. The
spirituall the whiche maketh christen and
good persones by the holy gost vnder the
king of that kingdome Iesus christ. And
the seculer gouernaunce the whiche <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyneth
<pb facs="tcp:14850:107"/>
the evell parsones to kepe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace and to be tame ageynst theyre
will.<note place="margin">Rom.</note> Thus teacheth vs saint Paule / to
vnderstond the swerd and seculer instice
saying the prynces / are not to be feared to
theym that be good but vnto theym that
be evill.</p>
            <p>Nowe if eny man wold governe the
world (that is to sey the evill) only after
the gospell and cause to cease all worldly
lawe and iustice saying that they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
and christen to whome the swerde
of iustice nedeth not. Unto theym may be
answered. Hit is of a truth that the true
christen haue no nede of ryght nor of the
swerde for theyre iustifying. But do your
dyligence to fulfill the worlde with true
christen bifore that you governe theym
christenly a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d after the gospell whiche shal
be verey hard for you to do. For the worl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
is all gyven to synne and starcely can
they abide good christen. They are not all
christen that are baptised and called chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten.
Therfore it is not possible vnto the
worlde to observe and kepe a comon chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
governaunce / namely also yn the iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
of a grete comonte / for the evill are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weys
<pb facs="tcp:14850:108"/>
more yn nombre then the good feith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full.
For this cause to governe a cuntrey
after the gospell without the swerde of iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stice
is as though a man wolde put togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yn a stable / heries wolves lyons she<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pe
and other lyke / and to suffre all these
bestes to be conversaunt togyther the one
with the other / howe long I pray you
shuld they haue peace to gyther the one
with the other? Ye howe long shuld the
poore shepe lyve / we therfore must nedes
haue here bothe these governementes.</p>
            <p>The spirituall or eva<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gelye all bicause
it iustifieth a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bryngeth helth. The other
bicause it entreteyneth and holdeth peace
The one is not sufficient in the worlde
without the other. For without the spiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuall
governement of Iesus christ can no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
be saved nor iustified bifore god by the
worldly regyment. So may ye perceyve
that the rule or governeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of christ hath
not lordship over all persones. For the
true christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be alweys lesse yn nombre a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
be yn the middes among the not christen / 
as a rose emong the thornes. Then where
as the worldly governaunce reyneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where alone / there can be none other
<pb facs="tcp:14850:108"/>
thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g but ypocrysye. For without having
the holy goost yn the hert can none be ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
ryghtuous nor saved. Lykewyse whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
the spirituall governaunce reyneth eve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
where alone / there is perversite vnbry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deled

all malice for the worlde ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
the spirituall governaunce bicause that it
fyghteth onely by the swerde of the spry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / 
whiche is the worde of god. And vseth
none other swerde. Nowe seest thou well
whate the wordes of onre savioure christ
meane (whiche we haue recyted bifore) w<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>here
he sayeth that the christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall drawe
noma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yn to iustice / and that they shall not

theyre hertes / nor they do not according

vnto the other seculer governaunce wher
by the not christen be constreyned to kepe

            <p>For this cause hath not Iesus christ <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So was saint Iohn Baptist none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing but as a man that abateth and
cutteth of from a pece of timber the most
gretest knotres. He doth it not to thintent

it more smothe with a large fine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot.
Likewise did saint Iohn by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching / 
he did but onely abate and cut of
the grete knottes / that is to sey / the grete
sinnes. And yet they were not clene taken

els but a voyte crying in the deserte

            <p>He was not the light as saieth saint Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hn

            </p>
            <p>He was but onely a voyce a foregoar and
a shewer whiche made redy the wey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
the coming of Christ.</p>
            <p>And for this cause did Saint Iohn sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
his disciples to Iesu Christ / when he
shulde die to thintent that they might ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the full perfection of him. For he had
but onely made them redy for to come vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
christ. for this cause &amp; reason it is al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that saint Iohn hath not preised the
warre by these wordes / but hath rather
forboden it: As teacheth all the gospell. for
as it is a thing evill agreing that the ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de

evell agreing and grete sinne that one
Christen warre ageinst the other.<note place="margin">Ro. 12</note> For
we are all bretheren and membres of one
body / the body is Christe / whiche in all
his life preached peace and concorde to all
theim that he taught.</p>
            <p>Saynt Iohn in his fyrst epistle saieth:<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:14850:121"/>
He that hateth his brother is an homicide
We may hate noman / we must love oure
enemyes / we must pray for theym and do
good vnto theym that persecute vs. How
can it then be possible after the gospell that
we may warre without sinne? wherin so
many people lose theyre livis and wherby
so many parsones come to wildenesse ryot
and evill life. There be textes in the canon
lawe that suffre some warres. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehing
of Christ forbiddeth all warres.</p>
            <p>It is a thing horrible and daungero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
for body and soule to enterpryse &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
a warre. For all malice reyneth in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

is invaded or a towne beseged &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the comon peace is troubled / and grete vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence

theym to punysshe the evyll / and to
put hys lyfe yn ieoperdy for hys subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes.</p>
            <p>But he must alweyes beware that he
do it not to revenge his owne wronge / or
for to enlarge his londe and lordship / but
onely to defende his subiectes. And so may

he vse the horrible businesse of the warre / 
charitably and christenly.</p>
            <p>But if it were possible to agre for gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
