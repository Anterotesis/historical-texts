            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his workes he might not be saved. For if
I haue done eny good hit is of God / and
not of me / for. I haue done it by the grace
of God / and therby I deserve no reward

trust in my good workes / for I haue no

And when the person so distrusteth

Kuke sayng / when ye haue done all the
thinges whiche to you are commauded
say ye / we be vnprousitable servauntes / 
we haue done but oure dutye. And thys
is the verey Christen humylite / as in this
present boke shalbe more pleynly declared
And if we can thus repute all oure good
workes for sinne / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d in theym to have no

we shalbe saved by the promyses of god / 
we be the children of Abraham / of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
all the scriptures bere witnesse that by
his faith he was iustified / and gat helth.
And for that cause he is called the father of
belevers and of the feithfull. And this ys
the fayth wherof I wryte here i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> this boke
to thintent that all parsones myght come
to knowledge and knowe whate ys the
Christen sayth. Of the whyche all the sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riptures

all other scripture.</p>
            <p>And for bicause that it behoueth that
the parson beleve that his faith iustifieth

oure father by charite / and howe that
we shalt nothyng doubt of oure helth by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the wordes of God. And when
a parson getteth thys hope he learneth to
bere pacyenly all tribulacyon and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.
For he knoweth that this lyfe ys not
hys lyfe / and hath greate desyre aftrr the
other lyfe / and holdeth not this lyfe for
hys. And this maketh the fayth the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
ys alwayes affectuously attendaunte
after Christ oure espouse. But he that
hath not this fayth is all desolate when he
hath mysfortune / and yf to hym yt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
well he gyveth hym silfe to voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osite
and sinne. And for bicause he hath
no hope of the everlasting life he thinkes
in him silf I will vse this life as long as it
is le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t me / And that he doth bicause he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
not whate oure feith is / &amp; whate our

God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14850:5"/>
To thintent therfore that none gyue
him silfe to sinne by desperacion I have
shortly compyled in this present boke / ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
that we be iustified with out oure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
For when eny parson hath done
his best with all his power / as I haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yd / 
then let him say yet / that he is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proufitable
servaunt. And the humble her
te wherby he knowlegith his imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
maketh that his sinnes / his evell tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ughtes

him be pardoned of god and that lytell th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at

<pb facs="tcp:14850:8"/>
the children of the devell bicause of the

God by baptesme. As saith Saynt Paule
Christ hath healed vs by the bath of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacyon
and renovacyon of the holy

by his greate love / And thys shalt
thou vnderstond in this maner.</p>
            <p>There were sumtyme .ij. Adams / as
writeth saint Paule. The first Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> was
oure first father. The seconde and newe
Adam was Iesus Christ. For the sinne
of the olde Adam we were all children
of the devell made hys owne and subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto hym by oure synne. The secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
Adam (that ys to sey Iesus Christ)
hath bought vs agayn / and hath put vs
yn lybertie / and hath made vs of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of deth / children of everlastynge ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe,
and of the chyldren of wrathe children
of grace: For Iesu Christe hath by hys

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14850:9"/>
Nowe then when we be baptised we
be made partakers of this grace / and so is
it come to oure proufit that Iesu christ dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
for vs. For (as I haue nowe sayed) the
baptisme hath his vertue of the deth of Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>su
christ. Then when we be baptised / we
betoken that we will dye with Christ / we
betoken / I say / that we will dye as vnto
the lyfe passed as touching oure sinnes &amp;
evill concupiscences: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d that / as saieth. S.
Paule / we must walke in a newe lyfe.<note place="margin">Ro. 6</note>
And therfore be we plonged vnder the wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter:

wryteth saint Paule vnto the Romayns<note place="margin">Ro. 6.</note>
Bretheren / sayth he / Esteme ye that ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
deed as concerning sinne but alyde vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to

the same place: Ye are buryed with Christ
by baptesme into deth. So that we shall
not lyve after the lyfe of the world nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the lyfe of the flesshe but we must lyve
as the children of god. And oure lyfe shal
be hyd befor the world and also hyd with
Christ in god / as wryteth saint Paule sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying:<note place="margin">Col. 3</note>
Yf ye be mortified and your life ys

that Iesu christ oure life shall shewe hym

oure life shalbe made open: but as long as

we shall not repute this life that we haue

            <p>This life here is of the world and of
worldly thinges that is to sey of theym / 
that be estraungers to God that haue no

also called the world in the holye scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.
As sayeth oure lord Christ in saint Io<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hn.
You be not of the world / but I haue
chosen you from the world. And agayn.
The world shalbe ioyons and you shalbe
sory: Nowe call we all theym wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ldy
whiche be not monkes. Oure lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
a distinction bytwene the world &amp; hys

<pb facs="tcp:14850:10"/>
but all those that lyve after the flesshe
whiche desyre not here to dye with Iesu
christ / and to be hydden here after to lyve
with God. All suche whatesoever they
be are worldly be he monke or chanone / 
nunne or Syster / nobill or vnnoble grete
or small. For (as I have sayed) the lyfe
of theym whiche apperteyn to God is here

they be hated of the world / for they be
not of the world / as sayeth the Gospell in
this maner. They be not of the world / for
if they were of the world / the world sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wolde love theym as his owne.<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> But
for as moche as they (accordyng to theyre
promyse made at the font of baptesme) do
applye theym silves to renounce the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the world and to dye with chryst
in killing of the desyres of the flesshe / and
also are strongly ageynst the appetites of
the flesshe in other by ensaumple of theyre
good lyving therfore be they persecuted of
the world.</p>
            <p>And hereby may we alweyes knowe
the disciples and children of God: yf they

they lyve not here after the life of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rld

if they do not repute this lyfe for a life / but
abide with a ioyfull hart the coming of ou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re

            <p>So shuld we all lyve here / as though
this life were not oure life. For we must
abide oure life before God / and we may
do none other thing in this life but fight.
Ageynst oure evell desires / and learne to

And Iesus Christ hath aswell suffered

            <p>Therfore it is very nedefull that the

            <p>It were also very necessary that every

he speaketh in thactes of thappostles.
Of a truth I perceyve that god is not per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyall / 
but in all people he that feareth hym
and worketh rightuousnesse is accepted
with him, for god nedeth not oure works
when he thus hath oure hertes albeit that

            <p>This loue comith in vs (as I haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id)
by faith / when the parson beleveth su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
that he is the childe of God. It nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th
not that suche a parsone be constreyned
to doo good workes by any commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.
For the love of god dwelling yn

               <pb facs="tcp:14850:40"/>

but reioyseth in the truth / suffreth al thing
beleveth all thinges / hopeth all thinges / 
Suche a love or charyte bryngeth a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

a parsone vnto suche a love / or to suche a
faith &amp; trust in god. These workes spring
out of feith and not feith out of these wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes.
for as I haue seid feith bringeth loue
and loue bringeth good workes.</p>
            <p>Lyke as though there were a riche ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
with out children or heyres which might
take a poore beggar out of the strete and
make hym his heyre of his goodes. This
poore man beyng this made greate and ry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
if he wold be thankefull (as becomith
hym to be) shuld serve hys lorde or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
(whiche had thus exalted hym &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
him ryche) truely and with greate loue
Ye and if he ones might knowe the wil of
his master / he wold not deferre the doing
therof till he were commaunded: But he
wold do all thinges by and by of his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
courage for the charyte or loue that he
<pb facs="tcp:14850:40"/>
hath toward his master without comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undement.</p>
            <p>Behold this poore man so exalted hath
not deserved by hys workes nor by hys
service that this riche man shuld so make
him his heyre / but the riche man hath ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
him his heyre of hys owne goodnesse
without that the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> had in eny ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
wyse deserved it. And the service th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
this poore man doth afterward comith
of loue and kyndnesse. For he knoweth
and beleveth surely that he is heyre of the
godes of his lord bifore that he do any ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vice.
And for bicause that he beleveth that
the ryche man will kepe promyse wyth
hym / he beginneth to love him by the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
of this faith. And so when he loveth
hym / he doth to him willingly and wyth
good hert / all the service he can / and fulfil <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

ioyfully his commaundementes and
all by love. And the more laboure &amp; servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
that he can do for his good master the
more grete pleasure he taketh.</p>
            <p>So is it of a good Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he
was yet enemye of god by the sinne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam /

               </gap>esyred it: and byfore that he had yn

eny maner wise deserved it. Thus hath
god made vs his children and heyres wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hout
oure deserving. Then when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leve
this stedfastly this faith bringeth lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue

so greate and excellent. And when we so

by loue and do all thinges with good wil
As saieth Christ in saint Iohn:<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> He that lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>veth
me kepeth my commaundementes.
And so kepe we all thinges and suffre all

saint Paule:<note place="margin">Ro. 5</note> we reioyce in tribulacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

But the verey faithfull cleveth to god /

maner of feythes. I will onely speke of
iiij. maner of feithes whiche are most comu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nely
fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>de in the holy scripture. The first
faith is this whiche the marchauntes hold
one to an other and feithfull frendes / wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
they kepe promyse and fidelite the one
to the other:<note place="margin">Eccle. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd. 27</note> wherof speketh the wise say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
possesse or kepe feith with thy frende / 
in his povertye: to thintent that in his we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lth
thou mayst be ioyfull. And ageyn he
that discloseth the secret of his frende / lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his faith. And in the Proverbes: He
that gyveth his faith for a straunger shall
be vexed with evell. And this is the faith
wherof the worldly people complaine sey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
there is no feith in the worlde.</p>
            <p>The seconde feith is when we beleve
that a thing is to come / and suche thinges
as we here or rede: as we beleve that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
is a Cytie in Italye / or that Cartage
was destroyed of the Romayns / and this
we beleve although we haue not sene yt.
Also we beleve that Iesu Christ hath he
relyved on erth and that he hath preached
and that he is d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>

done many other thinges. when we bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
<pb facs="tcp:14850:55"/>
these thinges after the story we beleve
that this is oure christen faith / The sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
people aloneli doth not beleve this but
also many doctours in Theologye which
are taken for wise. Ye the devell hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
this faith / as sayeth saint Iames: The
devels beleve and tremble.<note place="margin">Ia. 2.</note> for (as we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
seyd byfore) the devell beleveth that
god is god / and that Iesus Christ hath
here preached / that he was deed / buryed &amp;
rysen. This must we also beleve / but yet
this is not the faith wherof speaketh the
gospell and saint Paule.</p>
            <p>The third faith is that we beleve that
god may all thinges / and that he is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous / 
good and holye. This faith haue
also the devels and Iudas had it also / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d
other disciples that did miracles in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of Iesus but they were therfore never
the better. for when they bosted theym sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
and were ioyfull that by theyre faith
they expulsed the devils in the name of
Iesus.<note place="margin">Lu. 10</note> Iesus Christ hath reproved them
saying: Ioy not you that the spretes be

saying: If that I had all feith so
that I coude move mountaignes oute of

nothing.</p>
            <p>The .iiij. faith is oure Christen fayth / 
wherof so moche speake Iesu christ / saynt
Paule and saint Iohn / and sey that it ys
the foundacion of christendome. And this
is the feith wherof I speake in this boke
None hath this faith but they that put all

all theire helth in god alone serching
all these thinges in him and loking for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

wherof speaketh so moche Saynt Paule

in all hys epistles. And (as we haue
abundauntly sayd in the Chaptres by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
none may comprehend thys fayth / 
but he that considereth whate was the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yth
of Abraham: As wryteth saynt Pau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
vnto the Galathyans saying: Abraham
beleved God and yt ys rekened to hym
for ryghtuousnesse.<note place="margin">Ga. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

he obteyned that he ys called oure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and we be called hys children yn the

childern of the fayth. For by the meane
of oure fayth we be saved / as Abraham
was iustified by his fayth and hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by hys fayth that all they that shall
haue suche fayth may lyke wyse be iusty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.
For this cause whosoever hath
not the fayth of Abraham / nothing can
come vnto hym of that whiche Abraham
beleved. That ys to say / when
God ys not thy hope and thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte / 
when thou abydest not wyth a

stedfast trust vppon God when thou art
not redy to suffer and endure all thinges / 
namely also the deth for the loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

hast in the world thou art not the childe of
Abraham. For Abraham was redy to all
thinges wherunto god wold send hym.

saint Hierome / saint Heliodore / and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
other holy parsones that then were in
the world as a man may perceyve in the
bokes of saint Iohn Chrysostome.</p>
            <p>Of suche life was also saynt Martyne
with his bretheren. They were not ydell
but writing of bokes and labouring with
theyre hondes for to get theyre expences.
They made no vowes nor profession.
Every one mought eate fast &amp; reade whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
he wolde like as did the seculers. They ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me
many tymes to gyther to communyon
and prayer. They had no certeyn masses / 
nor houres to syng dayly. And when yt
was noyous vnto theym they mought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyde
out of the company / for they were
not constreyned there to abyde by any pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fessyon.
And when a Bisshop or an herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
dyed they toke custumably one of the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
monkes for a newe Bisshop and herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man / 
for they were then holy and lettered
parsones.</p>
            <p>After theym came the thyrde secte of
monkes / of the whiche was saint Benet / 
Montanus / Gregory / and other monkes / 
<pb facs="tcp:14850:65"/>
of the ordre of saint Benet. In that tyme
was the life of monkes sum whate char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with a certeyn nombre of Psalmes / 
with certeyn prayers / with one certeyn
habite and ordre and with other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes.
Neverthelesse saint Benet dyd not
so charge his ordre / but submitted all vnto
the discrecyon of the Abbot to dispence cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>unge
and do all thinges accordinge as he
shuld thinke it best convenient after the ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me.
And bicause they were men of holye li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe
the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ytesins toke of theym to theyre pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stores
&amp; bisshopes. So came it afterward
to passe that the princes and grete parso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
haue had favoure a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d love vnto the
cloysters / and haue gyven theym moche
goodes and possessions / and haue founded
newe monasteryes / so that they be thus
multiplied in the worlde / as thou mayst
see. And bicause that to moche goodes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d
possessions haue be gyven vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
good discipline and life is by lytell and
lytel brought to nought and corrupted by

to make sumpluous bnyldinges / costly ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stmentes / 
and haue begonne to eate and

<pb facs="tcp:14850:66"/>
vessels / chalices / and other ornamentes in
theyre churches. So haue they enterpry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to lyve / not as monkes but as lordes
By these thinges here is coled the spryte
and love of God. Thus loving the sprite
they haue taken the flesshe ordeyning all
theyre holynesse yn foreyn / and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thinges / and ceremonyes / as in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
theyre houres / in singing / in kne<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>g
in habytes and many other ceremonyes.
But humilite / contemptibilite / sobriete / pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyens
and povertie they haue forgetten.
And by suche meanes is the life of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
come vnto voluptuousnesse and vnto
all vanyte by thabundaunce of richesse.
Thus haue they begonne to be ydell / and
wold not get theyre expences by laboure
of theyre hondes / as it was ordeyned at
the beginning. Thus by ydelnesse are thei
come vnto all evell and perversite and by
grete hepes be they fled out of theyre cloy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sters
Monkes and Nonnes. Then
was it ordeyned (as it semith) that bifore
saint Bernardes tyme the monkes did ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
professyon.</p>
            <p>After that the life of monkes was so
corrupted came saint Bernard to cloyster
<pb facs="tcp:14850:66"/>
and then were the monkes refourmed.
Then did they ageyn diligently take they<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
astate and began ageyn to charge they<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
ordre with profession and promesse and
haue made many statutes after the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
they mought live / and wherby they
might compell men therto for the willing

            <p>After this is comen the .iiij. secte of
monkes. As Norbertus / saint Dominyk
saint Fraunceys. And of theym are nowe

            <p>After this haue the mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>kes gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> popes

also they haue purchased and gotten to

<pb facs="tcp:14850:77"/>
And the more he doth of suche wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
the more great ypochriste he becomyth
And so abideth he alweyes a merchaunte
with god for he serveth for wages. But
if thou wilt entre into religion thou must
do it for the love of God bicause god hath
made vs his children for to thanke him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyn
and to fle the synne whiche reyneth

he thinketh that he can never do servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

He laboureth not for to get the eternall ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe

to give thankes of the goodnesse that

that he is the childe of God and his heyre.</p>
            <p>And therfore when eny hath the feith
wherof we haue bifore spoken he is to be
praysed that by thankfulnesse doth separa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
him silf from the worlde for to fle the da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ungyers
therof. For the worlde hath a th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ousand
occasyons to synne / principally for
yong people. Wherfore this is not a thing
to be dispraysed that a parson yelde him in
a good religion to amend his lyfe. But if

one fynde nowe in the Monasteryes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

the worlde it were moche better to abyde
out / ye or if one be entred to voyde out ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to lerne there to haunt suche life.
For one must go thider to amend his life / 
not to waxe worse.</p>
            <p>But thou mayst saye: I haue made

haue seid bifore that none is bounde to hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de /

Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> was carefull for his sonne Isaac

to passe that so fewe come chast to the state

this is most the faute of the parentes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
be more carefull for the bodyes of thei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re

therfore they will in no wise that theyre

for to make theym haue good tymes they
make theym many tymes prestes or rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.

He came also in to the worlde to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyn
and to lest vp the kingdome of god in
the worlde. Therfore saide he to Pylate:
My kingdome is not of this worlde.</p>
            <p>And whosoever is of the trouth hereth

they obey vnto his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tes have
nought to do with the swerd of iustice nor

And yf all the worlde
<pb facs="tcp:14850:105"/>
were true and verey Christen (that is to

governeth and teacheth theym to do no

            <p>Wherfore it were i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>possible that the swerd

it procedeth from the holy goost whiche

or seching god. All are fallen and
are become abhominable there is none that
doeth good no not one. Therfore god re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freyneth
the malice of the people by the la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we
that they dare not accomplisshe hit out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardly
by worke and dede according to

            <p>Mereover saint Paule gyveth vnto
the lawe an other office / that is that it let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth

whiche knowelege a man is made meke /

            <p>Fourthly all they that be not yet christen
belong vnto the kingdome of the worlde
and be vnder the lawe. In this nombre
are all the evill christen whiche seke nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght

called christen but they are not so.</p>
            <p>Seyng then that there be so fewe good
Christen and so many evill people god
hath gyven vnto the same evill out of the

an other regyment and governaunce / and
hath put theym vnder the swerde that is

ryght to thintent that they may not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisshe
theyre malice when they wolde As

            <p>If it were not thus (bicause that there be

vnderstond the swerd and seculer instice
saying the prynces / are not to be feared to
theym that be good but vnto theym that

            <p>Nowe if eny man wold governe the
world (that is to sey the evill) only after
the gospell and cause to cease all worldly
lawe and iustice saying that they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
and christen to whome the swerde
of iustice nedeth not. Unto theym may be
answered. Hit is of a truth that the true
christen haue no nede of ryght nor of the
swerde for theyre iustifying. But do your
dyligence to fulfill the worlde with true
christen bifore that you governe theym
christenly a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d after the gospell whiche shal
be verey hard for you to do. For the worl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
is all gyven to synne and starcely can
they abide good christen. They are not all

            <p>So was saint Iohn Baptist none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing but as a man that abateth and
cutteth of from a pece of timber the most
gretest knotres. He doth it not to thintent
that it shulde abide so. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the knot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes

master carpenter that planeth it &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it more smothe with a large fine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot.
Likewise did saint Iohn by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching / 
he did but onely abate and cut of
the grete knottes / that is to sey / the grete
sinnes. And yet they were not clene taken
away <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He was but onely a voyce a foregoar and
a shewer whiche made redy the wey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst

            <p>And for this cause did Saint Iohn sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
his disciples to Iesu Christ / when he
shulde die to thintent that they might ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the full perfection of him. For he had
but onely made them redy for to come vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
christ. for this cause &amp; reason it is al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that saint Iohn hath not preised the
warre by these wordes / but hath rather
forboden it: As teacheth all the gospell. for
as it is a thing evill agreing that the ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>de

evell agreing and grete sinne that one
Christen warre ageinst the other.<note place="margin">Ro. 12</note> For
we are all bretheren and membres of one
body / the body is Christe / whiche in all
his life preached peace and concorde to all
theim that he taught.</p>
            <p>Saynt Iohn in his fyrst epistle saieth:<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:14850:121"/>
He that hateth his brother is an homicide
We may hate noman / we must love oure
enemyes / we must pray for theym and do
good vnto theym that persecute vs. How
can it then be possible after the gospell that
we may warre without sinne? wherin so
many people lose theyre livis and wherby
so many parsones come to wildenesse ryot
and evill life. There be textes in the canon
lawe that suffre some warres. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehing
of Christ forbiddeth all warres.</p>
            <p>It is a thing horrible and daungero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
for body and soule to enterpryse &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
a warre. For all malice reyneth in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of warre. Neverthelesse when a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

the comon peace is troubled / and grete vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence

theym to punysshe the evyll / and to
put hys lyfe yn ieoperdy for hys subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes.</p>
            <p>But he must alweyes beware that he
do it not to revenge his owne wronge / or
for to enlarge his londe and lordship / but
onely to defende his subiectes. And so may

charitably and christenly.</p>
            <p>But if it were possible to agre for gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

And also saint Petre saieth in hys

feare vnto your lordes not onely vnto the

be froward. For it comith of grace if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
