            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Gods poore haue

and that first of

daily sinne. Secondly,
they know when they
see Gods iudgements,<note place="margin">Zach. 11. 11.</note>
that it was the word of

they tremble at Gods
word,<note place="margin">Esay 66. 2.</note> and feare his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
while it yet

goodnesse of Gods
mercy;<note place="margin">Psal. 109. 20.</note> when a man is

can say with <hi>Dauid,
mercie is good.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 109. 21.</note> Fifthly,
they are sensible of
their owne mortalitie:
they haue feeling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
condition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are
thankfull, and that for
lesser mercies; a poore
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18912:20"/>
man is glad of a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
whereas a rich man

Gods poore will praise

crums that fals from

are more poore and

               <p>Thirdlie, they are
teachable, and willing
to bee appointed and

signe a mans heart is
not humble, when he

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18912:20"/>
trueth, or disswaded

greedie after the

for Gods poore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18912:21"/>
liue by begging, if hee
be poore, hee will crie
vnto God.</p>
               <p>The second is <hi>Abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:</hi>
for this poore
man, renounceth his
owne merits, hee seeth
no good will be had by
deseruing; for hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
nothing but
Gods curse in al things
hee forsaketh also the
world, both in the lusts
of it, and in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the wicked, and
all earthly things, as not
hauing the chiefe good
in them.</p>
               <p>The third is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in Gods worke;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18912:21"/>
yea Gods poore are
willing to do the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and hardest worke
God will be pleased to
set them to: so as they
may finde fauour in

but they would bee

they could with their
best desires and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>

poore,<note place="margin">Pal. 11. 14</note> commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

to let God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

               <p>Fifthly, The last is

sorts of sinnes, for les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
sines, as well as grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Esay 6. 5.</note>
for sinnes of our
calling, for secret sins
as well as open, for sins
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18912:23"/>
that presntlie trouble
vs, as well as for sinnes
past:<note place="margin">Rom 7.</note> for the sins fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and the corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for beeloued,<note place="margin">Esay 1. 16</note>
gainefull and pleasing
sinnes, finally for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
of our good works
as wel as for euil works.
Now there are two
notes of great vse, in
triall of sorrow for our
sinnes; the one is, that
wee must sorrow for
sinne as it is sinne; and
the other is, that a man
should not easily satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himselfe in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
till he can mourne
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18912:24"/>
as much for sinne, as
he was wont, or now
would for losses. The
Prophet <hi>Zacharias</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceth,<note place="margin">Zac. 12. 10. 11.</note>
when he saith;
the spirit of God, shold
cause them to mourne
as in the familie, as one
would mourne for the
losse of their onely
sonne, or as in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
would doe, for
the losse of a most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Prince. He menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth
their sorrow for
<hi>Iosiah,</hi> yet wee must
know that teares are
not of necessitie, and
specially in such na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18912:24"/>
as are voide of
teares, for anie other
causes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in asmuch
as sorrow may be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
euen for iudgements
wee must vnderstand
that herein our triall
wil be,<note place="margin">Psal. 4<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

temporall: and among
the rest, if we can feele,
and bewaile hardnesse
of heart,<note place="margin">Esay 63. 17</note> mourning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>notmourne
as we ought, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if we can be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
as well for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of God as for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:18912:25"/>
Thirdly, a christian
is principally stirred vp
in true sorrow, by the
sence of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
so as nothing
doth more fire him to
a desire to abase him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and to humble
himselfe, euen in the
verie dust, in the sence
of his owne vilenesse,
then to feele and finde
the gracious goodnes
and readinesse of God
to shew mercie.<note place="margin">Hos. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>He fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the Lord and his
goodnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as godlie sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is raised by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18912:25"/>
meanes and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
so it is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaged
onely by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
meanes, those sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
that can be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by sports, merrie
companie or the like,
are much like the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decines
vsed to helpe
them; but in godlie
sorrow,<note place="margin">Ho. 6. 1. 3.</note> the same God
that wounded them
must heale, and a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
desires helpe from
the same word that
pierced him.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Thus of the causes.</head>
               <p>THere are foure
properties of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18912:26"/>
sorrow which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest, we must
labour after, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
haue true assistance,
that our sorrowes are
right.</p>
               <p>First, it is inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
it is a hard thing
to make sorrow silent,
and hee that is truelie
pricked in his heart,<note place="margin">Ior. 50. 4. 5</note>
cannot with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
smother his
doubts, hee will aske
the way to Sion, and
cannot rest till he haue
knowne what to doe
to be saued,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 37.</note> those that
finde so little to aske,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18912:26"/>
and can be so silent in
the presence of Gods
seruaunts, by whom
they might bee direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
may suspect their
sorrowes.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, it must
not rest in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
or probabilities,
or hopes, or others
good opinions, or the
mending of manie
things: but a Christian
that is truelie humbled
will repent stil,<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 19</note> though
he haue turned, that is,
he is so fearefull of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deceiued, through
the corruption of his
owne heart, and the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18912:27"/>
wils of Sathan, that he
will constantlie hold
on to confesse and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
his sinnes, till he
may finde assured rest
vnto his soule.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, it will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nothing against
God, but it makes a
man condemne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
rather then God;
when <hi>Dauid</hi> lay in that
mournfull plight, that
he could finde no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
night nor daie,<note place="margin">Psa. 77. 1. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> for
a long season, and that
the question, was to be
debated whether God
had forgotten to bee
mercifull, &amp;c. Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solues,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18912:27"/>
the fault was
in himselfe that it was
his infirmitie, and that
his soule refused com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, it will not
rest without cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
godlie sorrow is
not water, but washing
nor euery washing, but
such as maketh cleane:<note place="margin">Esay 1. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>
worldlie sorrow may
haue much water, but
cleanseth nothing, but
godlie sorrow greatlie
desireth and loueth
puritie.</p>
               <p>Thus of the causes
and properties concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the concomitants
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18912:28"/>
there are diuerse things
doe accompanie god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
sorrow, by which it
is discerned; for,</p>
               <p>First it is ioyned with
a secret trust in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptation
of God, so
as no miserie can beate
them from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and inward
affiance of hope of
mercie, in the verie
disquietnesse of the
heart the desire of the
soule is to the Lord,<note place="margin">Psa. 38. 9.</note> &amp;
before his presence
though a childe of
God, be neuer so much
cast downe, yet hee
waits vpon God, for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18912:28"/>
the helpe of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce,<note place="margin">Psa. 42. 5. 11.</note>
and in some
measure condemnes
the vnbeliefe of his
owne heart, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
himselfe with
the hope of the neuer
failing compassions of
God:<note place="margin">Tam 3. 21</note> thus it differs
from the sorrowes of
<hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Iudas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondlie, it is ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a wonderfull
loue of God for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of praier, it is most
deepelie affected with
euerie mercie of God
felt in praier; <hi>Dauid</hi>
loues the Lord,<note place="margin">Psa. 116. 13.</note> because
he hath heard his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18912:29"/>
at that time when
his sorrowes was as the
paines of hell.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie,<note place="margin">Psa. 119. 20. 82. 33.</note> it is ioined
with a longing after the
word.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, it is ioined
with a constant desire
to glorifie God by a
fruitefull profession, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
one that truelie
mourneth in Sion,<note place="margin">Esay. 61. 2 3.</note> is a
tree of righteousnesse,
the planting of the
Lord, that he may bee
glorified.</p>
               <p>Fifthlie, it is ioined
with a spirit of suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
sorrow that is
after God, will teach a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18912:29"/>
Christian to pray, that
could neuer praie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
the spirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,<note place="margin">Zac. 12. 10</note>
is a spirit of
supplication.</p>
               <p>Lastlie, our sorrowes
must be tried by their
effects, for godlie sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>First, driues vs to a
dailie and serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of sinne in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
without hiding
anie sinne.<note place="margin">Psa. 38. 17</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondlie, it breedes
a tender sence of the
burthen of sinne; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
doth a Christian
feele the heauie loade
of sinne as it is sinne,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18912:30"/>
till God hath softned
his heart by his spirit.<note place="margin">Psal. 38. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdlie, It workes
a mindefulnesse of
God and his presence,<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 6.</note>
and a deepe impression
and thought of good
things.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie,<note place="margin">Psa. 51. 17</note> it causeth
a man to sacrifice and
deuote himselfe to
God.<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthlie, it breedes
sensiblenesse &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
for all sorts of
mercie.<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 22 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Lastlie, the Apostle

                  </gap>
that is, such as cause
the heart of man, to
burnewithn him, with
some measure of zeale
for Gods glorie, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
at sinne, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
affection in Gods

at least are either dull
and cold, or transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the wrongs, ends
to the fauouring of
sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, they are
constant: both because
they are renued dailie,
as the metaphors of
hunger and thirst doe
import; as also because
they are alike carried
to the eternall fruition
of the things desired, as
to the present enioying
of them, Gods seruants
desire the fauour of
God, the abolishing
of sinne, the possession
of grace, not to serue a

for looke how the man

commit them, with a

to thinke that at anie

such a contrarie desire

truely called, they so
desire not to sinne, as it
is their griefe to thinke

               </p>
               <p>Thirdlie, they are
not idle, which may
appeare three waies.

                     </gap>.</note> because
they are attended with
a resolution to doe any
thing that their desires
may bee accomplished:<note place="margin">Acts 2, 37<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

they aske what should

they doe to be saued?
as taking it for graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that they must bee
industrious in Gods

but they would
endeuour to doe it, so
the Lord would bee
mercifull vnto them to
graunt them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
yea when they
haue done all, they still
are humbled because
they can doe no more,
nor no better. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
they cannot rest till

               <p>Thirdlie, holy desires
are accompanied:</p>

of sauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
for this feare of

               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:18912:74"/>
First, it is sincere, for
he that truelie feares
God.</p>
               <p>1. Feares Gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
aswell as pnnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

the threatning of it,<note place="margin">Psa. 119</note>
then by the threatning
of anie mortall man,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18912:75"/>
and will obey the voice
of Gods seruants,
whatsoeuer comes of

               <p>Secondly, it is filiall,
not seruile, which may
appeare in fiue things,
for first it is ioined with
the loue of God,<note place="margin">Deu. 10. 12. 20</note> and
so is not the feare of

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18912:75"/>
it is not compelled
by feare or sence of

by the sence of
