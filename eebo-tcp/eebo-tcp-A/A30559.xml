         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The first General Epistle, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>FOrasmuch as in these our days, the God of Truth hath
made manifest his Name and Truth in the hearts of
his People, and hath gathered the minds of thousands
into it, to worship him in the Spirit and in the Truth,
in which he is accepted; and of this Truth (which is but
<hi>one,</hi> and there is not another) are we made Witnesses and
Ministers of, and have the Testimony in our selves that we
are of God, and are a good savour unto him, in them that
believe, and in them that perish; and we have the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<hi>That he that is of God heareth us,</hi> and we know the whole
world lies in wickedness; and who are in the Truth, in the
Light, and in the Life, have fellowship one with another, in
Holiness and Righteousness, in that which comprehends the
world, and condemns all the works thereof, which are evil;
and this Truth, Worship and Fellowship stands in Christ
Jesus the <hi>second Adam,</hi> whose Kingdom and Rule is not of
this world, but from Heaven, who according to his Promise,
in his Counsel hath made known his Power, to the raising up
a Righteous Branch, a Royal Priesthood, and Peculiar People,
zealous of his Name, to shew forth his Praise and Glory, in
Justness and Righteousness, in Love, Mercy and Peace, and
works of Purity, having our Conversation in Heaven; and
since that day of the manifestation of this Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Peace and Salvation, which is the same now as was
in the beginning, which is in Christ Jesus the Light of the
world, who is the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, and
changeth not; I say, since that very day hath the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered
his Truth, to the renewing of many into his Image
and Likeness, and to the turning of many from darkness to
Light, and from Satan's power to God, by the mouth of his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58251:3"/>
Ministers, and through great sufferings, and tribulations,
oppressions, afflictions, and labours, hath the Lord honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Name and his Truth in Nations, and given it a
praise among all that fear him, and hath honoured it, and
exalted it in the sight of the Heathen, to the confounding of
the wise and mighty, and to the bringing out of the captivity
of darkness, sin and death, wherein in times past all have
walked, while strangers from the Life of God, so that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
who have received the Truth, are established in it, and
cannot be moved nor shaken, but are built upon the sure
Foundation, their Faith standing in the Power of God, with
whom the Arm and Presence of the Lord God is, defending
and preserving continually; and unto such the Truth is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and the Way of the Lord, his Name, and Honour
is dear, yea, more than life or liberty, or any other thing
which passeth away; who for the Truths sake, as it is in
Christ Jesus, do daily give up themselves to suffering, and to
reproach (for well-doing, and not for evil) and love not
life unto death, that the Lord God and his Name and Truth
may be honoured; so that in that Truth which is received
and learned of the Father, daily do we walk, in all purity and
holiness of life, answering the Mercy and Love of the Lord,
in the exercise of a pure Conscience both towards God and
man, in patience, long-suffering and wisdom towards all,
to the putting to silence of gainsayers, rendring love and
mercy towards our Persecutors, and are set in our hearts to
fulfill the Will of God in all things: And now whereas
(that the Scripture may be fulfilled) some may and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the Truth, which once was received and loved, to the
making shipwrack of Faith and of a good Conscience, abusing
the Mercy and Grace of God which to them appeared, and
follow the counsel of their own hearts, and not of the Lord;
having lost the feeling of the Spirit of the Father, and are and
may be separated from us (in the self-separation) through
an evil heart of unbelief, that it may be made manifest they
are not of us, though they arise from among us, and may by
disorderly walking contrary to the Truth, cause the Truth to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58251:3"/>
be evil spoken of, giving occasion thereby to the Enemies
of God to blaspheme his Name and Truth in the Earth, and
may be a stumbling to the weak, and an offence to the Way
of the Lord before the simple, thorow their Disorders and
Confusions, raising the rage of the Wicked against the
Lambs of Christ, being not led in the Wisdom of God, but
in Confusions, taking liberty to their own hearts desire, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
the will thereof, without the Fear of God, above the
Cross of Christ, in the Nature uncrucified, and speaking high
words in the presumption, and not in the Light and Power
of God, and acting in the vanity of the mind (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Truth and the moving of the Spirit) such things as
Truth and the Children of it, who are guided with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
cannot justifie, but is judged, and denied, and cast out
from among the Children of Light, who walk in the Truth,
and do try the spirits whether they be of God. Therefore in
the Fear of the Lord God this is written, to go abroad among
Friends and others, to inform and shew unto all, that the
Truth, and we that are in it, Ministers of it, do stand clear
from all such, who act and speak out of the Truth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it, in the disorder and confusion, and not in the Fear
and Counsel of God; and with the Truth such are judged,
and denied, and fellowship with them we have not, nor their
works do approve; though such once owned us, and were
convinced of the Truth, and received the Seed of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
into the unprofitable ground, yet being separated from
us, and gone out from the Truth, are not subject to it and
its Government, but are unruly and disorderly; We and
the Truth do such deny, and the spirit that rules them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not the Spirit of Christ Jesus; and such have done evil
against their own souls, and against God, and are troublers of
the righteous Seed, and have and do dishonour the Lord and
his Truth, in the sight of the Heathen, causing the <hi>right Way</hi>
to be reviled, and reproached, and evil spoken of, through
the offence by them; to the making sad the hearts of some,
whom God hath not made sad; and even more especially,
in that they pretend to the <hi>Truth</hi> in their words and works,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58251:4"/>
and professes to be in it, yet secretly condemning, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reviling the Ministers of Righteousness, which God hath
blessed, and doth daily bless with his Eternal Power, to the
turning many unto God, and to the strengthening of the
weak and feeble, which we with many do witness, to be the
Ministers of Life and Reconciliation, and there is no other,
and are established in it, and cannot be moved by the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Devil, though the Wicked-one may revile
for a moment, to winnow some, and to try them, and to draw
the hearts and minds of others into a snare, out from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to Christ Jesus, which do become mockers, and
despisers and subverters of the simplicity of the Gospel of
Peace, and of the Ministers and Ministry thereof, which is
<hi>the Power of God unto Salvation, and there is no other,</hi> though
some harden their hearts through unbelief, and blind the
eye till they be past feeling, through rebellion against the
<hi>Truth,</hi> which they hold <hi>in unrighteousness,</hi> and <hi>not in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God,</hi> having made the <hi>offence of the Cross to cease,</hi> yet
boasting in the liberty of Christ while they are unmortified,
having run from the Judgment, and not truly come thorow
it, in the finishing of Condemnation; and that spirit that
goes out of the Cross is subverted, and seeks to subvert others
from the Truth <hi>as it is in Iesus,</hi> and that spirit is denied fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with, though it have conformity in the hypocrisie:
Wherefore this is the Word of the Lord God unto you, that
erre after that spirit, Be awakened, be awakened, remember
and repent, and come to your first work, to that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
you, lest the Lord by his Hand of Wrath and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon you, make you an example of Misery and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to all that shall hereafter deny the Lord and his Truth.
Hear and consider, to the Light in you all I speak; have you
another <hi>Truth</hi> than that which hath been known and declared
from the beginning? is there any other way to <hi>Life,</hi> than
which we have been Witnesses of, who have not handled the
Word of God deceitfully among you, nor sought yours, but
you, nor preached <hi>our selves,</hi> but <hi>Iesus Christ?</hi> and hereof
we have the Witness in our Consciences, in the holy Ghost.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58251:4"/>
And is there any other Salvation than that which God hath
manifested, which is <hi>Christ Iesus the Light of the World?</hi> Be
awakened and consider; Wherefore then do you separate
your selves disorderly, and resist the Word of Life, which
once begot you towards the Lord? Consider what you are
doing, and whither you are walking, the end of your way is
perdition, and that is accursed which preacheth another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
how do you dishonour the Lord in the sight of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
before whom you discover your nakedness, and your
shame doth appear, having put off and cast aside your armour
and weapon of <hi>Truth,</hi> whereby you might have been defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
but scorners and fools take occasion through your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and confusions, to blaspheme the Name of the Lord,
and it is through you: Oh be stirred up and consider, and
search your hearts, and come to the tryal, ye that vex the
Lord's Soul and grieve his Spirit, lest it cease to strive with
you, and you be wholly given up to fulfill wickedness, till
there be no place nor time of repentance found. And this
is a Warning to you all in the presence of the living God,
that you may return to your first love, to fear before the Lord,
and to walk in his <hi>Truth,</hi> if there may be mercy, and to
fulfill his <hi>Will,</hi> which is the Light which you are lighted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
by <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> who is the Lamb of God, <hi>the Way, the
Truth,</hi> and <hi>the Life,</hi> the <hi>author and finisher of Faith,</hi> and <hi>there
is not another;</hi> and know this, <hi>you that deny Him,</hi> who is given,
yea unto you all, <hi>he will deny you before his Father;</hi> and of all
your blood I am clear thus far, whether you resist or receive,
who am the lover of your souls, sometimes loved of you,
while you were lovers of the <hi>Truth;</hi> and am now a Witness
for the Lord and his <hi>Truth,</hi> and against that spirit which
leads you in the rebellion against the Government of <hi>Christ,</hi>
which is <hi>Order and Peace,</hi> out of which you have erred, to the
piercing of your own souls; and though you now exalt your
selves against me, and the <hi>Truth,</hi> and boast your selves as
though you reigned, yet in the Day of the Lord, shall the
Light in you all, which now is darkened, bear witness to me,
and of my faithfullness in reproving you; and the <hi>Truth</hi> is for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58251:5"/>
ever dear to me, and my soul delights no less in it, though you
rebel against it, in the heady, exalted, presumptuous, high,
wilful spirit, which is not subject to the Government nor
Authority of the Ministry of Christ; but <hi>Truth</hi> is over you all,
and the <hi>Mountain</hi> of the Lord is established above you all,
and all your words, and works, and boastings, and feigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and disorder, are denied, and in them we have not
fellowship, but the contrary; and do in the Authority of the
Lord, even by the same Authority which hath begotten us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and called us, and carried us in his Work unto this
day, deny you all, in that ground and state wherein you stand,
till repentance and returning from whence you are fallen, to
the Light which Christ hath lighted you withal.</p>
            <p>And all faithful Friends, this is the Word of the Lord God
to you; Hear and fear, walk in the <hi>Truth</hi> which ye have
heard, and learned, and received of the Father, in it dwell
and live, and know there is no other than that which is made
manifest, which is sure to you all, and cannot deceive nor be
deceived; and be not shaken in mind nor troubled, though
some deny the Lord, but let their fall be a warning to you, to
be more watchful, to be kept to the Lord, lest you be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and dwell in the <hi>Mountain of Holiness,</hi> which no Beast
can touch, where is a hiding-place to preserve you in the
time of tryal; and I charge you all in the presence of the
living God of Life, let your minds be setled, and hearts
stayed in the <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the Foundation of God, and
know the Armour of God to gird you up to God, where no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is taken against Christ, nor against the way of <hi>Truth,</hi>
but the Power of God doth remove that which would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and tramples upon that which gives the offence,
and in this you will be preserved until the day of Salvation;
and be aware of that spirit which boasts above the measure,
and of that which makes the offence of the Cross to cease,
for there hardness of heart and unbelief enters, and so ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is followed than the Light, and another joyned to than
Christ Jesus, and there is the way to perdition; who go from
the <hi>Light within</hi> them, they deny God and his Truth, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58251:5"/>
follow the imaginations of the foolish heart, and run in
rashness and in the frowardness, and that ground receives the
unclean spirit in again, with seven worse, <hi>and the laiter end is
worse than the beginning;</hi> and this <hi>Truth</hi> doth not change,
which is the begotten of the Father, but is <hi>the same for ever:</hi>
So in it all be faithful and fruitful to the Father in your places

dwell in that which discerns spirits; and if any say, <hi>Lo here,</hi>
or <hi>Lo there is Christ,</hi> go not after them without you, for you
have not been so taught; but know the <hi>Christ of God,</hi> the <hi>Lamb
of God within you,</hi> and follow him, and obey his Voice; and
be established all of you, on this <hi>sure Foundation,</hi> whom God
hath laid, &amp; no man can lay any other, and if you build there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and thereby, you shall never suffer loss, but your work shall
abide the fire, and in the Father's house your bread you shall
receive, and never shall hunger nor thirst, but the Life will be
refreshed and encreased daily, and your Lamp will alwayes
shine, and you shall never be darkned, nor stumble; for that
which stumbles is out of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the ground stands to
receive the seed of Satan, who is a devourer of the simplicity,
and the betrayer from the <hi>Truth;</hi> Therefore I charge you all
in the presence of the living God, that you hold fast the Faith
and Hope which you have received through the Gospel, that
you may never be moved from the Grace of God, and from
the Love that hath abounded in you, but may be found watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the door, with your Light shining when the Bridegroom
cometh; and, <hi>behold he cometh quickly, and his Reward is with
him; blessed are they that tarry for him.</hi>

Second GENERAL EPISTLE,
to all the SAINTS whom God
hath called.</head>
            <p>TO all the Children of Light every-where, who fear
and love the Lord, who are begotten of God, and
unto whom he is known in the Spirit and in the
Truth; this is a Testimony of the Father's Love
unto you. Grace, Mercy, and Peace from him that liveth
for ever. The God of Light and Life be multiplied in you
all, that you may daily be renewed in strength, and girded
with Truth, and armed with the whole Armour of God, and
may be kept by his Power until the day of Salvation, to walk
in the Government and subjection to Jesus Christ, witnessing
the Power and Presence of God in you, and amongst you,
giving you power to fulfil his Will in all things; and that in
all Righteousness, and out of all Evil you may be led, and
preserved unto the end, and in the end, to shew forth the
praises of God in this Generation, as a People called of him,
and redeemed by him for his Glories sake; even so <hi>Amen,</hi>
and <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dearly Beloved, be not ignorant, but this know, This is
the Message which came unto you, which is true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and everlasting, <hi>That the true God is Light, and in him
is no darkness at all;</hi> and this is the Message of Peace and
Reconciliation, and of Glad-tydings unto all that have sought
the Lord, which we received of him, and you have heard,
and there is not another to be declared; and all that have
received it, are gathered up to God, and are in Covenant
with him, and one with another, and are in that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58251:6"/>
and joyneth unto Christ Jesus, the Husband and
second <hi>Adam,</hi> who is the <hi>Lord from Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Prince of
Peace,</hi> the <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Deliverer,</hi> who is made manifest
in Power, and condemneth the Transgressor, and slaveth the
Enmity, and raiseth the Life out of Death; and this is he
<hi>who kills and makes alive,</hi> even the God who is Light, who
brings down one, and sets up another; who makes War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Mighty, and gives Peace to the Poor, and besides
him there is none; he searcheth mans heart, and tryeth the
reins, and knoweth the thoughts, and every creature is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in his sight, who gives to every one according to his
doings; and this is he who standeth in the Congregation of
the Righteous, even in the midst of us, and sitteth Judge
among the gods; unto him must all the gods of the Earth
bow, and the inhabitants of the Earth must tremble before
him, and unto him every tongue shall confess, and the light
in every man shall answer when he ariseth to Judgement,
who is a swift Witness to condemn or justifie all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men upon the face of the Earth.</p>
            <p>This is the God of Truth whom we worship, and who will
be worshipped in spirit and in truth; who is the God of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
and his seed for ever, and with him there is no change
nor shadow of turning; and he hath made known his Name
and his Power, and his wonderful works in this his day, and
hath caused his Voice to be heard in the Earth; and the dead
have heard, and now live.</p>
            <p>And his Name is exalted on high amongst all that fear him
and obey his Voice; and he hath given his Son a Covenant
of Light, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world
with the true Light of Life, or Condemnation; that all who
receive him may come to the knowledge of the Father, <hi>whom
to know is life eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the Christ, the Saviour, in whom we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and which we preach, who is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and
the Life,</hi> the Foundation of God which cannot be moved;
<hi>The Word of God</hi> is his Name, and there is no other Name
given for Salvation: <hi>This is she that was dead, and is aliue,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58251:7"/>
and lives for evermore,</hi> and there is no other to be looked for;
if any preach any other, let him be accursed; and if any bring
any other Message, let them not be received.</p>
            <p>And all you who have believed in this Christ Jesus, who
is the Light of the World, and who have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of this God, who is Light himself, and that searcheth
your hearts, I exhort you, and warn you all in his presence
that lives for ever, to wait upon him, and to fear before
him, and to walk with him for ever in uprightness of heart,
which is of great price in his sight, and forget not his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judgements which he hath made known, lest you wax
fat through mercies, and rebel against him, and become dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
and gainsaying, and so be destroyed from being a
People; but be stayed upon the Lord, and let your hearts be
established with Grace, and be not tossed nor shaken with any
wind of the Doctrines of men, which is not from the Life of
God, nor reaches to the life in you, but begets into Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to worship other gods than he who is Light; and be not
troubled at temptations nor sufferings, nor at reproaches, nor
any other thing, but stand in the Counsel of God, and in his
long-suffering, and wait patiently upon him in your own
measure of the Grace of God received, which is sufficient to
preserve you, that Victory over Death, and over him that
hath the power over it, you may receive, to trample upon
all that which is contrary to the Life of God within you, and
without you; neither be you troubled nor offended in Christ
if any among you deny the Lord, and backslide from his pure
Way through an evil heart of unbelief, and so become dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
children, and vex the righteous Soul; such shall
bear their own burden and condemnation in the day of the
Lord; and know, that Truth changeth not, but is the same
for ever, though the deceitful hearted through unbelief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from it, and choose their own wayes, and despise the
Counsel of the Lord, to their own destruction; but be ye
more watchful, faithful, and valiant for the Truth upon Earth
unto the end, that you may be found faithful Witnesses un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Name of the Lord in this crooked Generation, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58251:7"/>
may receive the fulfilling of the Promise of God, and may
witness God with you, the <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> the <hi>Saviour, God with
us;</hi> and this is the whole Salvation, and there is no other
to be expected or witnessed than this, That God dwells in us,
and walks in us, according to his Promise; and all that know
this, need not go forth to the right hand or to the left, but
Salvation is come unto us, he that takes away sin, and saves
from it, and from condemnation; and they who witness this,
are begotten by the Word of God, and born of the immortal
Seed, and are new Creatures; and there is now no Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but the reward of Righteousness and Peace unto us,
who are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; and here we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the Lord is our God, and we are his People, and he
sees no sin in us who are born of him, nor remembers ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
but his Covenant is with us, and <hi>the Kingdom is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Lords,</hi> and his dominion is set up, where God is all
in all, where the Prince of darkness is cast out; and this is
the end and substance of all Ministrations, which we bear
witness of: And I do exhort all you who are called of God
every where, patiently to wait in the Way of the Lord, and
in his Judgments to receive this, and to possess it within you,
that you may be worshippers of God, and doers of his Will,
and may have the Witness that you are accepted of him,
and may know your Calling and Election sure, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that defileth can enter, but that may be taken away and
removed; and Him you may feel and witness, which <hi>Satan</hi>
hath nothing in, who is the <hi>second Adam,</hi> and cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
but is greater than the <hi>first Adam</hi> who was overcome
(though innocent) and is lost from the presence of God;
but he in whom there is no sin, and who cannot transgress,
comes to seek and to save that which was lost in sin, and to
bring back that which was driven away by sin; and He is
greater than Innocency, and overcometh the Devil, and is
called the Son of God; and to him that overcometh, who is
the Light of the World, is all Power given of the Father;
And know Him in you all to be the greatest, who is not of
the world, nor cannot bow to the Devil, to give you domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58251:8"/>
and authority over all the World, and the powers of
Hell and Death, even He who sealeth up the old Dragon in

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ceive, or be
deceived; and as every one of you have received Him who
is the Lord from Heaven, so let your Faith stand in Him,
and walk in Him; and let all your conversations be ordered
by Him, in all pure and blameless walking in the sight of your
Enemies, that it may be manifest that you are branches in
Him, and that you have received power to become the Sons
of God, and that you are Heirs of the Inheritance which
shall not fade away. And all you that witness this, your eye
is opened to see God, and you are cleansed from sin by the
Word of God, and you have received the Peace with God,
and glad-tydings from him in your own souls; and this is
Salvation by the <hi>second Adam:</hi> herein be established and
setled, and look not for another; for there is not any besides
this Saviour and this Salvation, but if any preach another,
believe them not; and if any cry, <hi>Lo here,</hi> and <hi>Lo there is
Christ without you,</hi> go not after them nor follow them, but
know him <hi>within you,</hi> which is greater than all; yea, if we
our selves, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other <hi>Iesus</hi>
than he which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,
or any other Salvation than God with us, let us be accursed;
for this is the Gospel of our Salvation, <hi>Christ Iesus within us
the hope of Glory, the Power and Wisdom of God to rule and reign
in us, by which we are changed from Death to Life, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
from the power of Darkness into the Kingdom of his dear
Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now all Friends and Elect of God, who are called
and faithfull, you that have received this Testimony which
God hath given of the Son, and which the Son hath given of
the Father, which in faithfulness hath been testified in this
generation, I exhort you all in the fear and counsel of the
Lord, take heed to that which you have believed, and heard,
and learned of the Father, which is the Truth as it is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and shall abide forever; and be not removed from your
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58251:8"/>
hope, nor given to change, but mind the Life of God in
you all, which is immortal, and is but one, and it answereth
to the Lord in Judgments, and in Mercies one to another in
that which is righteous and just, and witnesseth against all
the works of the world, which are evil, and not wrought in
God.</p>
            <p>Ye that know this which is of the Father in you, dwell in
it, and walk in it, and be not shaken out of it, nor removed
from it, for it is the Way of Peace unto Everlasting Rest,
where there is no sorrow, but Righteousness, Peace and
Joy in the holy Ghost; and every one in particular have Salt
in your selves to savour withal, that you may resist the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked-one
in all his temptations, and may not joyn to any thing
which is out of Union, and contrary to the Life of God, and
to the Truth which you have received; that you may never
be betrayed of your hope, nor of the simplicity which is in
Christ Jesus, in which the Father is well-pleased; and let
the Light of the World guide you in all things, that your
works may be wrought in God, never to be condemned, nor
you to suffer loss; knowing this first, That none are justified
by him but them that are led and guided by him; and to
whom he is a Saviour, he is also a Teacher, and he is given
to teach in all the wayes of Truth.</p>
            <p>And now let your fellowship be in the Power and Life of
God, and know not one another in words onely, and in
shews, and in outward appearance, but witness one another
in the Spirit and in the Truth, and have communion there
in breaking the Bread of Life, that <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> may be seen
to be the Head in you, and you Members to serve him, and
one another, all receiving Wisdom from the Head, and
Vertue from the Vine (<hi>Christ Iesus</hi>) that you may abound
in Love, Mercy and Peace, and all the fruits of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto the Father, and dwell in the Fear and Counsel of
God, and be subject to his Will, not despising the Cross which
is the Power of God, which slayes the birth that is born
of the flesh, which is not heir of the Promise; but walk in
the Cross daily, that your understanding may be kept open
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58251:9"/>
to try and discern all spirits, whether they be of God; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not every spirit, for lying spirits may arise among your
selves, and go forth from the Light, who are not in the Truth,
but in the feignedness and hypocrisie, with false visions and
lying imaginations, handling the Word of God deceitfully,
corrupting and perverting the pure Way of God, having the
<hi>Form,</hi> but not the <hi>Power,</hi> having left the Power, and gone
from the Light; and such utter the words of Truth without the
Life, and is but as the Chaff to the Wheat, and they are to
be denyed and resisted, and not joyned to, lest Innocency and
Simplicity be betrayed, and your Faith made void, and so
you be destroyed from the Life of God, and Death surprize
you, and Darkness enter into your dwellings, and so Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
Doubtings, Murmurings, and Lustings after Evil arise
in you, and you be perverted from the Worship of the true
God, and grieve his righteous Spirit by bowing to Idols, and
following of other Lovers, and so the true God, which hath
brought you out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and made manifest his Power in
you, be forgotten, and the Faith of his Son made shipwrack
of, and your latter end be worse than the beginning, and the
Name of the Lord be dishonoured by you; and then wo be
unto you, his Wrath shall suddenly break out against you:
Wherefore hear, and fear, and hearken unto the Word of the
Lord, He hath caused his Light to shine forth, and his Voice
to be heard; He hath proclaimed his Name among you, and
hath caused his marvellous Light to approach, when you sate
in darkness in the Land of the shadow of death; when you
were lost, he sought you; and when you were driven away
and scattered, he found you, and brought you home; when
you were in your blood, and no eye pittyed you, he had mercy
upon you, and bound you up, and healed you; when you were
dead, he said unto you, Live, and it was so; when you were
led captive by the Devil, under the power of Death, he brake
the Chains, and set you free; and when there was none to
help and to save, his own Arm brought Deliverance and
Salvation, and the Way of Life and Peace he set before
you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58251:9"/>
And now all this hath his own Arm accomplished, that you
should be a praise unto him for evermore; and if you walk
in the way which he hath set before you, and keep his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which he hath made with you, and fulfill his Will, and
walk in Righteousness, in Love and Unity, in Meekness,
Lowliness, Humbleness, and in Soberness and Watchfulness,
and in Fear of his Name; then shall his Presence never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
you, nor his out-stretched Arm cease to defend and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
you, but he shall go before you, and be your reward;
and he shall be your God, and you shall be his People; and
you shall dwell in him, and he shall be your hiding-place;
and he will be to you a Father, and you shall be his Children,
and his Blessing and Peace shall remain in your habitations
for ever and ever: but if any of you turn aside for a thing of
nought after vanity, and deny the Way of Righteousness,
and forget the Lord, and kick against him, and follow the
way and counsels of your own hearts, and worship other gods,
and joyn your selves to strangers, and commit Adultery
with other Lovers, and make the Cross of Christ of none-effect,
and turn from the Light of Christ <hi>within you,</hi> and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
your own wills, and the desire of your own minds, and go
out of the Fear of the Lord into the liberty of the flesh (which
is not the Liberty in Christ Jesus) and so seek your selves,
and strive for mastery to be one above another, and so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
evil one against another, and the bond of Peace be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and vain contention and strife appear; then shall the
Rod of God smite you, and his Wrath be suddenly kindled
against you, and you shall not prosper, but his Countenance
shall be hid, and the Terrors of the Lord, and Lamentations
shall possess you, and Peace shall flee far from you, and such
shall be cast out of the Camp of the Lord, and shall have no
part in the Inheritance, but the Blessing shall depart, and the
Curse shall enter till utter destruction; yea, and if any of you
deny the Lord, unto whom his Way is made manifest, he will
deny you, and you shall have no part in him, but Vengeance
in flames of fire will he render upon the disobedient, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
more than if his Love and way of Peace had not been
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58251:10"/>
made manifest to you, and the Light of the World is your
Condemnation for evermore, if you turn from it.</p>
            <p>And in the presence of the living God, I warn you all, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not that spirit, neither follow it, which brings any other
Message than what hath been declared from the beginning;
believe not him which cryes, <hi>Lo here,</hi> or <hi>Lo there is Christ
without you,</hi> or that draweth from the measure of <hi>Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you,</hi> to hearken to, or to be taught by any other thing; for
that spirit is not of the Father, which preacheth any other
Christ, than he that is the Light of the World, and lighteth
every man that cometh into the World, and which bringeth
any other Message than that God is light in himself, and
hath given his Son a Light into the World: And this is the
true Testimony of the Father and of the Son, and he that
testifieth any other Message, is to be judged and denyed;
he is not a Worshipper of the true God, but out of the
Truth, and in the Errour, and a Deceiver, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>Again;</p>
            <p>Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which ministers
to others that which it hath not learned of the Father, but
hath the words without the Power, and lives not in the
Power of what it ministers forth in words, nor is not what
it declares, but is in the outward shews, in the hypocrisie
and feignedness, and reacheth not the Life of God, but
vails and covers it; and that spirit is not of the Father,
but is to be denied and judged, and not received nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
            <p>Again;</p>
            <p>Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the flesh, and makes the Offence of the Cross to cease,
which is exalted out of the Fear of the Lord, in the liberty
of the earthly, which crucifies the Life, and darkens the eye;
and that spirit will boast of Joy, and Peace, and experience,
and knowledge, and speak high words in the airy mind, and
that would lead you out of your conditions to glory above
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58251:10"/>
the Cross, till you be past feeling of the Life; and that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
begets into feignedness and hypocrisie, and into the love
of the world which passes away; and beware of that spirit,
for it is not of the Father, but to be condemned.</p>
            <p>Again;</p>
            <p>Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is hasty,
and forward, and rash, for that goeth out of God's Counsel,
and betrayes the Just, and strives to be greatest, and to be
above the weak, and despiseth him, and would be Master,
and not a servant, and would rule, and not be ruled in the
meek and lowly Government of Christ, and that spirit will
judge out of thoughts rashly and unsavourily, and condemn
another in secret in what it self is guilty of; beware of that
spirit, for it is not of God, but to be judged with the Life
of God.</p>
            <p>Again;</p>
            <p>Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which seeks it self
to have praise of men, and to be accounted, and would beget
into divisions, and would have parties to it self, and respects
persons, and glories in gifts, and knowledge, and parts, more
than in the Giver, and admires men more than He that gives
the encrease, and feeds of the knowledge in that nature
which is to be famished, and glorieth in what hath been done
by it, as though it had not received power from the Lord, and
is exalted as though it bare the root, not knowing that it is
born of the root; and that spirit spends its treasure which it
received in the Father's house, amongst harlots, and despiseth
the poor, and seeks occasion to glory over the weak, that
it may be renowned; beware of that spirit I charge you all,
for it is not of the Father, nor to be followed, but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and resisted unto death.</p>
            <p>Again;</p>
            <p>Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which preacheth
not from the measure of God received, and to be manifest to
it in you, and approved by it only, but speaks above the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and reaches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to the measure of the Grace of God;
that spirit leads after words and outward shews, and cryes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58251:11"/>
Peace to the Rich, and Judgment to the Poor, and the Word
of God is not divided aright, but heals up falsly, and daubs
with untempered mortar, and cryes Peace where God speaks
War; and cryes War where God speaks Peace; and that
spirit is a deceiver and a betrayer, and feeds but the ear,
and not the Life, and darkens the Counsel of God by words
without knowledge, and is not of the Father, but of the world,
and to be denyed and condemned.</p>
            <p>Again;</p>
            <p>Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to rule and order, and is not meek and diligent, and
long-suffering, but heady, high and untoward, seeking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
against the Just, and watcheth for evil; that spirit
will not bear reproof, but is idle, sloathful and careless,
surmising evil, and backbiting, and conforms in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
making a fair shew, but it is not unto God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
unto man; and that would go, and is not called;
and will not go when it is called; and seeks for the praise
of men more than God; and that is fruitless ground, and
brings forth bryars and thorns in secret, which choaks the
Seed of God: beware of that spirit, it is a lover of this
world; have no fellowship with it, for it is not of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but a deceiver, and is to be denyed.</p>
            <p>Again;</p>
            <p>Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is tossed
and unsetled, and is given to change, and is not established
with Grace; that is an Adulterer, and hunts for the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life, and seeks by flattery to beguile the Innocent; that
spirit is zealous for a moment, but is soon overcome, and is
stony ground, and brings not forth fruit to perfection, but
withers, and its latter end is worse than the beginning. That
spirit is exalted into presumption, and in peace, and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
desperation and trouble, and the double-mind lodgeth in
it, and it is unstable in all its wayes, and is a ground for the
seed of Satan, and to it there is no peace from God; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of that spirit, for it is not of the Father, but to be
condemned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58251:11"/>
Again;</p>
            <p>Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
than knowing, whose <hi>zeal is without true knowledge,</hi> and
stands in that which is corrupted; that flourisheth for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but cannot endure for ever; it hath no root in it self,
but is furious and passionate, and not long-suffering; that
spirit knows not it self, but would devour its adversary with
bitterness, and not gain'd by long-suffering; that is not the
Spirit of the Father, but must be denied in all.</p>
            <p>Again;</p>
            <p>Believe not that spirit which draws back into the world,
into its lusts, liberty, and fashions which passe away; that
spirit forgets God, and draws back, for his soul hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in it, but is vexed with it, where the Cross is made of
none effect, and the false liberty is walked in, which mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Life; that spirit is of the Devil, and is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
            <p>And now all Friends of God every-where, who know him
and are known of him, whom he hath gathered out of this
untoward Generation; be diligent in your Callings, and
keep your Meetings in faithfulness, waiting upon the Lord,
that you all may receive of his Fulness to be filled with it,
and may be nourished up unto himself, as Trees of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
the planting of his own right-hand, to spread forth
his Name and Glory, as a People saved by him, and unto
whom there is none like besides. And this know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that spirit is not of the Father which confesseth not the
Son to be come in the flesh, who destroyes the works of the
Devil, and takes away sin; and that Spirit believe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
which condemns sin, and destroyes it, and takes it away,
and so gives Peace with God in your own Consciences, and
leads you into all Truth, and keeps you from all Evil: and
you that witness this, the Son you know, and the Father you
know to dwell with you, and in you; and this is the <hi>first</hi> and
the <hi>last;</hi> believe in him, and follow him, and look not for
any other; and in this the Father of Life and Glory, whose
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58251:12"/>
Dominion is without beginning and end, stablish you, and
preserve you, <hi>Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I a beloved Brother, and a Companion unto all the
Saints in suffering, and in rejoycing, who have
received this Testimony from the Father, do
with it in this Epistle salute the whole Church in
the Love of the Father, as moved of Him by his
Eternal Spirit, who beareth witness to me that we
are of God, and the whole world lies in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that all that are of God heareth us. And
this Testimony I give of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Truth, and of the Salvation of
which I am made a Witness, and against all that
ever shall deny it, or turn from it: And this is thus
far the words of my Testimony by the Spirit of the
Father, not knowing when the time comes it may
be finished, and the night may come when no man
can work:</p>

            <p>FOrasmuch as many who are partakers of the Father's
Love, manifested in his Son in measure, in whom these
Epistles have found greeting, With the same Love in the
upright-hearted, to which it is a sure Testimony of Love
from Life it self, to the quickning, strengthning, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and arming of all such as have in the Love, Life and
Power, heard, received and believed the Truth, as it hath
been declared, and is in Iesus, in whom our Faith is stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
which Faith worketh by the Love shed abroad in our
hearts, wherein we are reaching after each other in the
sameness of Love, which is the bond of our Unity, wherein
we are called together to be joyned in the purity, power and
life of one Faith and Love, therein to bear Testimony (as
we have in our measures received) to, and of the Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Truth; wherein finding these Epistles of such manifold
service to the whole Body, both for instruction, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
strengthning and forewarning, whereby there is or
may be a safe arming against all deceit and deceivable spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
Hence it is from the earnest love and desire stirred
up in many here among us that are faithful, whereby this
they put in print, that thereby the service may reach unto
all who are worthy thereof in these Nations, for to them
is it sent, who are called of God; Therefore in the Fear of
the Lord let every one of us, to whom this comes, walk
worthy of the Fathers Love, Grace, Mercy and Peace,
whereinto we are called in one Body, of which Christ is
Head.</p>
