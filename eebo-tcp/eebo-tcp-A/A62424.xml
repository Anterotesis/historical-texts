         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>CAIUS CORNELIUS TACITUS,</hi>
whom we commonly find mentioned
with the <hi>Praenomen</hi> of <hi>Publius,</hi> descended
not from that Noble <hi>Cornelian</hi> Family,
so Celebrated in the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate and Story, but
from another House of the same Name, though
of less Note and Quality. The time of his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50009:5"/>
Birth, so far as I am able to Iudge, must have
been about the latter end of <hi>Ti. Claudius</hi> his
Reign. Whether his Father and Grandfather bore
publick Offices, or raised themselves to any of
the Honourable Posts in the <hi>Roman</hi> State, is a
Matter too dark and distant for me to be posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in; but, if I may be allowed to interpose
my private Opinion, it seems to me more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
that he<note n="a" place="bottom">Monsieur <hi>Bayle</hi> hath truly observed, that in this, <hi>Lipsius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himself; for in his Note on those Words, <hi>Dignitatem a Vespasiano, &amp;c.</hi> Hist. Lib. 1. he makes the Procuratorship of <hi>Gallia Belg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ca</hi> mentioned here shortly after to have been conferred by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> not upon <hi>Tacitus</hi> himself, but upon his Father. To which I add, That the Circumstance of his being near <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Age makes it highly improbable, that <hi>Vespasian</hi> should employ him in such a Trust. For if <hi>Pliny</hi> were but 18 when his Uncle died, that is, in the 2d of <hi>Titus;</hi> and if <hi>Tacitus</hi> were no great matter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lder than he, at what Age must we suppose him made by <hi>Vespasian</hi> Procurator of <hi>Gallia Belgica.</hi> Now, if his Father had this Post, then it is plain, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> was not the first Man of Quality in his Family, that Office being, as himself styles it in the Life of <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola, Equestris Nobilitas:</hi> But whatever <hi>Lipsius</hi> hath taken away from <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Birth, <hi>Morcry</hi> hath made up, who by a mistake in the other extreme, represents him as a Branch of the Noble <hi>Cornelian</hi> F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mily.</note> was the first Man of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in his Family. His first Rise was under
<hi>Vespasian,</hi> who (as <hi>Pliny</hi> acquaints us) advanced
him to the Procuratorship of <hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> and
made him Superintendant of that Province. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he had the Office of
Quaestor conferred upon him, (if I mistake not)
by <hi>Titus:</hi> Thus much at least is out of Dispute,
that he, in his own Books of History, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
the Dignity to which <hi>Vespasian</hi> had first
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50009:5"/>
promoted him, to have received such Accessions
from <hi>Titus:</hi> And what Advancement this could be
except the Office of Quaestor, or that of Aedile,
is not easie to determine, since we are well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
he did not attain to the other of Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
till the Fourteenth Consulate of <hi>Domitian,</hi>
which (by the way) shews us the mistake of a
certain Learned Person, who will needs make
<hi>Tacitus</hi> to have been Praetor in the Ninth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulate
of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and the Second of <hi>Verginius
Rufus.</hi> For <hi>Tacitus</hi> himself is express in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh
of his Annals, that he,
as one of the Quindecimviri,
(whose Business it was to see the
the Rites and Religious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
duly observed, and at the
same time Praetor too, was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
carefull in ordering the
<note n="*" place="margin">A Solemnity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly repeated but once in a hundred years, instituted by <hi>Valer. Publicola,</hi> celebrated by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> after long intermission, then by <hi>Claudius</hi> out of time, and now by <hi>Domitian,</hi> compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from those of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and the seventh from their first Institution. See <hi>Alex. ab Alexand. Lib. 5. C. 24. &amp; Lib. 6. C. 19.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Ludi Saeculares,</hi> exhibited by <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian.</hi>
Now these were celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Eight Hundred and
Forty First year after the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Rome;</hi> which Computation
falls Five years later than <hi>Vertru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
hath placed them. But of this
Account Antiquity hath left us
Evident Proof, there being still extant several
Coins with this Inscription: IMP. CAES. FLAV.
DOMITIANUS. AUG. GERM. PONT. MAX.
TR. POTEST. VIII. COS. XIV. LUD. SAEC.
FECIT.</p>
            <p>After this it was a great while before his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
to the Consulship, which happened under
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50009:6"/>
               <hi>Nerva,</hi> in the year of <hi>Rome</hi> Eight Hundred and
Fifty, he being chosen into the place of <hi>F. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginius
Rufus</hi> deceased; The same Person, who
with such an inflexible firmness of Mind disdained
the Offers of the Empire made him by the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Legions, and whose Funeral Oration was
spoken by <hi>Tacitus</hi> himself. Some have pretended,
that he was Banished under <hi>Domitian;</hi> but this
surmise I am apt chiefly to charge upon the
Temper of the common People, which being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
given to amuse the World with some ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
remarkable Events attending the Lives of
Great Men, thought <hi>Tacitus</hi> too considerable to
pass without something of this kind. For good
Authority to countenance this Opinion I meet
with none. The utmost my Reading furnishes
me with, is only an Account of his being absent
from <hi>Rome</hi> for some years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this was at the
very time of his Father-in-Law <hi>Iulius Agricola</hi>'s
Death, when <hi>Pompeius Conlega</hi> and <hi>Cor. Priscus</hi>
were Consuls: But that absence seems to have
been the effect not of Necessity but Choice; no
Exile imposed, but a Retirement of a Person sick
of Trouble and Business, and desirous to be quiet,
and yet rid of a bad World. And as for that
other Fancy of the same Authors, That <hi>Domitian</hi>
was at last prevailed upon to recall him from a
Ten years Exile, it is Fiction all over: Nor can
I think how this particular term of Ten years
came to be fixed upon, except their Heads were
full of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, and so applied the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of that to the matter then before them: For
every Man awake and in his Senses, must know,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50009:6"/>
that after those <hi>Ludi Saeculares,</hi> (at which time <hi>Tacitus</hi>
was undoubtedly Praetor and actually in <hi>Rome) Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
lived but Seven years, for in the Eighth he
was Murdered by the Conspirators. And this is
the Account of <hi>Tacitus</hi> with regard to his Publick
Character.</p>
            <p>As for his private Capacity; we find, that in
the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> Eight Hundred and Thirty, he
Married the Daughter of <hi>Agricola,</hi> then Consul
with <hi>Vespasian,</hi> with whom he lived many years
in great Affection and constant good Agreement.
There is little doubt to be made of his leaving
Issues, for from him I am very apt to believe, <hi>M.
Claudius Tacitus</hi> sprung, who many Descents after
was called Emperor; (for so the Coins name him,
and not <hi>P. Annius Tacitus,</hi> as we commonly find
him called.) And this Person, <hi>Flavius Vopiscus</hi> says,
used to speak of our <hi>Tacitus</hi> as his Ancestor.</p>
            <p>The former part of his Life was employed in
publick Pleadings and the Practice of the Law,
but when he grew into (<hi>b</hi>) years he betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Writing his History. From some Passages
in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Epistles we may plainly perceive, that
<hi>Tacitus</hi> was esteemed one of the best Orators of
those times, and that several Orations of his were
published. He was Contemporary with <hi>Quintilian,</hi>
both the <hi>Pliny</hi>'s, <hi>Iulius Florus, Secundus, Maternus,
M. Aper, Eprius Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>Vipsanius Messalla.</hi>
The first Compositions of this kind were certainly
his Books of History, beginning at <hi>Nero</hi>'s Death,
and continued down to the Reign of <hi>Nerva.</hi>
After these, he wrote his Annals, reaching from
the Death of <hi>Augustus</hi> to the end of <hi>Nero,</hi> of both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50009:7"/>
which Undertakings, how much and what Parts
are lost, I shall have occasion to observe hereafter.
<hi>Fulgentius</hi> mentions some Books of Ingenious Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
attributed to him, of which he produces this
small Fragment, <hi>Caesi itaque morum eclogio in filiis
relicto.</hi> The exact time of his Death I pretend
not to determine, though I think I am not mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in that of his Birth, for the computing of
which, <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger hath given one hint
sufficient in the Seventh Book of his
Epistles,<note place="margin">Epist. 20.</note> where he says, That he was
near upon the matter as old as <hi>Tacitus;</hi>
and he declares, that he was in<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Epist. XVI. and XX. Lib. VI.</note> his Eighteenth
year when that Eruption of <hi>Vesuvius</hi> happened, in
which his Uncle was lost. Now that Burning of
the Mountain happened in the Second year of
<hi>Titus,</hi> and therefore <hi>Pliny,</hi> according to this reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning,
was certainly born in the Year of <hi>Rome</hi>
Eight Hundred and Sixteen; <hi>Memmius Regulus</hi> and
<hi>Verginius Rufus</hi> then Consuls. But now <hi>Pliny</hi> hath
told us in the same Epistle, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
the Elder of the two, so that he must needs
have been Born about the latter end of <hi>Claudius,</hi>
or more probably the beginning of <hi>Nero,</hi> and he
lived, as I conceive, till the time of <hi>Adrian.</hi> It
is observable that he began not to compose his
History till <hi>Nerva</hi> was dead: This is abundantly
manifest from the Title he gives him in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the First Book. For <hi>Divus Nerva, Nerva
of Blessed Memory,</hi> is an Appellation of Honour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

            <head>AN
ACCOUNT
OF
C. Cornelius Tacitus,
FROM
F. de la Mothe de le-Vayer,
IN HIS
Iudgment of the HISTORIANS,
Both Ancient and Modern.</head>
            <p>THE Reason why all the Impressions of
<hi>Tacitus</hi> now extant place his Annals
before his History, is, I presume, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they begin higher, and are drawn
down from the latter end of <hi>Augustus,</hi> to that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50009:8"/>
of <hi>Nero,</hi> (though even of his Reign the two
<note n="*" place="margin">So it should be <hi>deux</hi> not <hi>ouze.</hi>
               </note> last years are wanting) whereas
the History sets out from the Death
of that Monster of a Prince, and
was continued to the Auspicious Government of
<hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Trajan.</hi> But notwithstanding this
Order in the Book it self, there is no doubt,
but in Time, the History had Precedence. This,
as nearest to his own Knowledge, was his first
Composition, and accordingly in the Eleventh
of his Annals we find it quoted by himself, and
the Reader referred to what he had formerly
Written concerning <hi>Domitian,</hi> whose Actions he
no where concerns himself to give any account
of that we know, except in that part of his
Writings only, which are published under the
Title of his Histories. Of these we have now
but Five Books remaining, though I believe <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
does not guess much amiss<note n="c" place="bottom">In all probability there must have been many more; for the Times treated of in the Parts that are lost seem equally fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of matter, and indeed the term is much longer than what we find here mentioned: From the Death of <hi>Nero</hi> to that of <hi>Domitian</hi> being 28 years and 3 months. <hi>Nero</hi> died the 10th of <hi>Iune, An. V. C.</hi> 819. and <hi>Domitian</hi> was killed in <hi>Septemb.</hi> 847.</note>, when he
thinks that Ten at least have been lost. And
indeed, any Man who considers, that from
<hi>Galba</hi> to <hi>Nerva</hi> and<note n="d" place="bottom">His Design in this Piece was laid no farther than <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Death, <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Trajan</hi> being set aside as an Argument for a fresh Undertaking. <hi>See Note (b).</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Trajan</hi> contains the
space of One and Twenty years at least, will
find little difficulty to persuade himself, that by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50009:8"/>
much the greater part of this Work is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when he reflects, that the Matters contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Five Books we now have were most,
if not all, transacted within the compass of one
single year. The Style of this Part is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more Copious and Florid than that of his
Annals, which are written in a close dry way,
as the Subject indeed required. Though the
Truth is, the particular Talent of <hi>Tacitus</hi>
throughout, is a Grave Majestick manner of
Writing, a sort of Eloquence not very different
from that strength and sublimity of Expression,
which the Masters of Rhetorick have observed,
as the constant Character of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> and that
wherein his Excellency consisted.</p>
            <p>Among the many Criticks, who take upon
them to find fault with <hi>Tacitus,</hi> those are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
question most to be excused, who complain
of his being dark and difficult to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
This proceeds very frequently from a
way he hath of giving short Hints, and leaving
his Narrations abrupt and imperfect. But some
part no doubt of this Fault belongs not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to the Author as to the Errours of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Copies, and Corruptions of his Original Text,
which make him much more intricate. This
Reflection was in Iustice but his due, since in
other Passages which have escaped those Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
we can easily give our selves a toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Account of his Meaning. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

come to Worship there; so there are a sort of
Readers, who think a rough dark Style an
Advantage, because this awakens the Attention
more powerfully, raises the Mind, and keeps it
fixed, thus giving occasion for many Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which a Man would never take the time
or pains to make upon an Author, whose Sense
is easie and obvious.</p>
            <p>As for those who have the Confidence to
Blame <hi>Tacitus</hi> for not Writing good Latin, I
look upon them as Men not well in their
Senses, and therefore rather in a Condition for
Pity, than a Serious Answer. And yet two
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50009:9"/>
great Lawyers, it must be confess'd, have been
of this Opinion. <hi>Alciat,</hi> who pretends that
the Expression of <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi> was much to
be preferr'd before the Thorny Phrase (so he
terms it) of this ancient Historian; and <hi>Ferre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
who condemns <hi>Tacitus</hi> likewise for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which he can by no means think good
Roman. Than which Objection, nothing was
ever more ridiculous; and the just Indignation
raised by so unreasonable a Censure, provokes
me to say, That in all appearance, the very
meanest Cook or Groom belonging to <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
spoke better Latin than either <hi>Alciat</hi> or <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>
who, allowing them the Commendations due
to their great Skill in the Law, were yet by
no means competent Iudges of the Matter now
before us. For <hi>Tacitus</hi> is not presently to be
run down for an ill Writer, because he hath
not all the Beauties of <hi>Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Cicero.</hi> Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is not confin'd to one particular manner;
several sorts of it are commendable in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Ways; and the Latin Tongue, we
know, flourish'd in all, though not in all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
down to the Time of <hi>Adrian,</hi> which is
since <hi>Tacitus:</hi> And he in his own Time had
acquir'd such Reputation, that the Principal
Orators contemporary with him, made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficutly
to give him Precedence in their own Art.
Of these I reckon <hi>Pliny</hi> the Younger one of
the most considerable; and he in several of his
Epistles declares, that he bore a great Regard
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o <hi>Tacitus,</hi> as one of the most Eloquent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50009:10"/>
in that Age. In the Twentieth of the First
Book, he refers himself to his Iudgment, for
determining a Dispute depending between him
and an Eminent Lawyer, whether copious and
long Orations, or short and concise ones, were
more proper for Pleadings at the Bar. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, describing the whole Solemnity of
<hi>Verginius Rusus</hi> his Funeral, he observes, as the
last and chief Instance of the Good
Fortune which befell him,<note place="margin">L. 2. Ep. 1.</note> that the
making his Funeral Oration, fell
into so Masterly a Hand as <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s. In the
account given his Friend <hi>Arrian,</hi> how the great
Action entred against a Proconsul of <hi>Africk</hi> for
cheating the Publick had succeeded,
he observes,<note place="margin">L. 2. Ep. 10.</note> that <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi>
replied upon the Defendant's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
with wondrous Eloquence and Skill, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
with that Gravity and Weight so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
in all his Way of expressi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g himself.
When <hi>Pliny</hi> was desirous to provide a Publick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
for Instructing the Youth of his
own Country at <hi>Como,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 4. Ep. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Tacitus</hi> was the
Person thought fittest to be applied
to, as One whom all the Wits of the Age affected
to be known to, and most capable of chusing
an Undertaker of so considerable a Charge. I
forbear the particular Descriptions he gives him

That your Histories will last

both his own and the general Esteem all <hi>Italy</hi>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50009:11"/>
there I have the rather inserted it, because it
may be of some use to inform us more exactly
concerning the Age of these two Learned Men.</p>
            <p>It is needless to alledge more Proofs of the
mighty Reputation <hi>Tacitus</hi> was in, even in his
own Time, and amidst so many Great and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Contemporaries: And for the following
Ages, every body knows what Honour and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
have been all along paid to his Labours;
some Testimonies whereof I shall alledge, before
I shall dismiss this Subject. In the mean while, is
it not a prodigious thing, that he should at this
time of day meet with such contumelious Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from Barbarians? (For <hi>Alciat</hi> and <hi>Ferret</hi>
are no better, when compar'd with the Old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>)
Men who have the Hardiness rashly to
pronounce, that an Author of this Character
was not a competent Master so much as of his
own Mother-Tongue? In good Truth, such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
as these, require a Brow of Brass, and a
heated Brain to advance them. For my own
part, though I should observe a thousand things
in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> which I could not tell how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove;
yet I would suspect the Weakness of my
own Iudgment, the Corruption of the Copy, or
any other Defect, which might be no Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the Author himself, rather than ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to give all Antiquity the Lye, by cherishing
any Imagination so singular and unworthy, as
this I have now been con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50009:11"/>Another Fault laid to <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s Charge, is
Want of Truth; and one of the Principal who
prefer this Accusation against him is <hi>Vopiscus.</hi> But
I beg it may be observ'd upon what occasion this
Allegation is brought: 'Tis only to excuse in this
general Assertion, That the mixture of some Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
with Truth, is what the best Historians
that ever wrote have never been able to avoid.
And now methinks <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Reputation is not
very much concern'd; nor need he apprehend
any mighty Danger from such a Complainant;
especially since I have elsewhere shew'd, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Persons have pleas'd themselves with
maintaining the same Proposition. And <hi>Dion
Chrysostomus</hi> (I well remember) pretending in one
of his Orations to prove, That we know nothing
as it really is, does not only averr, that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Troy</hi> by the <hi>Graecians</hi> is a mere Fable, and
that the <hi>Persians</hi> gave a Relation of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s and
<hi>Darius</hi>'s Expeditions against <hi>Greece,</hi> very different
from what the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves do; but he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
his Point farther; and, as an Instance how
little any History can be depended upon, he
tells you, That of the most Eminent <hi>Greek</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
some make the Sea-Fight of <hi>Salamis</hi> to have
been before that of <hi>Platea,</hi> and others place it
after.</p>
            <p>Now it were, I think, a sufficient reply to all
this Objection, if a Man should urge, That some
Falshoods there, are very reconcileable with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Infirmity; and such as (according to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50009:12"/>
Distinction of the Schools) though not true, are
yet no Lyes, because they are utter'd in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of the Man's Heart. But then, as for
the Impostures charged upon <hi>Tacitus</hi> by <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
and the Reproach of one of the most Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and Profligate Authors extant, cast upon
him by <hi>Bud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us;</hi> their true Meaning is, not to load
him with such Accusations of Falshood, as simple
Ignorance, or Inadvertency, might acquit or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him in, or the too easie Credit given to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
generally receiv'd might be alledg'd in
mitigation of: But their Intention was to expose
his impious Misrepresentations of the Christians,
the Scoffs and insolent Railleries against our Holy
Religion; attack'd by him in its very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
laid in the Old Testament; his ridiculing
the Miracles of <hi>Moses,</hi> and reviling the <hi>Iews</hi> with
Worshipping the Image of a Wild Ass. And these,
I acknowledge, are Calumnies full of true Pagan
Venom, and such as no Man can be too severe in
condemning. But then I must take leave to urge
withal, that if this Author must be thrown aside
in resentment for what he hath said to traduce the
True GOD and the Christian Worship, he must
be banish'd in a great deal of Good Company:
For the same Rule will oblige us to burn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the Heathen Authors, very few of whom
are clear of endeavouring to blacken us by such
kind of vile Aspersions.</p>
            <p>The same Reply may serve to take off that
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50009:12"/>
who in his Preface to <hi>Polybius,</hi> affirms the
Reading of <hi>Tacitus</hi> to be the most dangerous
Study that Princes can employ themselves in, by
reason of the many ill Characters to be met with
in his Works. There is indeed a very ill Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
to which <hi>Casaubon</hi> is too much addicted;
That, I mean, of never bestowing a Man's Pains
upon any Author, without lowering the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of all besides, to gain more Credit and
Authority to that One; and however he might
think fit to treat <hi>Tacitus</hi> upon this occasion; we
know that at other times he hath not been spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in Commendations of him. 'Tis true, his
History now extant relates the Actions of the
Worst and Wickedest Princes that perhaps ever
were; and it is our great Misfortune, that those
other Books of it, which contain'd the Reigns of
Emperours as eminently Good, such as <hi>Vespasian,
Titus, Nerva,</hi> and <hi>Trajan</hi> are lost. But at this
rate, no History in the World, no not even that
of the Bible it self, can escape Censure, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Ill Examples to publick View must be
thought to deserve it: For all treat of Bad as

and Care to distinguish between that part
of the Account which ought to be imitated, and
that which ought to be avoided. I cannot abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
deny, but in the Times of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> there
might be reason to apprehend some Danger from
the bitter Invectives of Pagan Writers, because
the World was not then cleansed from Errours, as
now (blessed be God) by his Grace it is. But
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50009:13"/>
I can by no means be brought to think, that any
Mischief is capable of being done by them now;
when every body sure is proof against such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
and not in a condition to receive ill Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions

the general Esteem of his Works being more
than enough to bear down all the Authorities
we have been considering, though no Arguments
from the Reason of the thing had been brought to
confute them. But if it were necessary to balance
one Authority against another, besides the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Consent and Approbation of Learned Men,
I am able to produce Two, of weight sufficient
to cast the Scale clearly on the other side: The
first is that of <hi>Tacitus</hi> the Emperour, who, in
that highest Elevation this World is capable of,
did, at Two hundred Years distance after this
Historian's Death, glory in the same Name, and
valued himself upon his Descent from so Great
and Worthy an Ancestor. As Marks of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
he bore to his Memory, Statues of him were
by his Order set up in the Libraries, and Ten

Year, that so they might be preserv'd, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50009:13"/>
handed down from one Age to another, as we
find they are now to ours. The second is, the
Great Duke <hi>Cosmo de Medicis,</hi> whose Memory will
always live in Honour, as long as Politics and
Good Government (to speak in the Language of
his own Country) continue to be cultivated and
respected. This Prince singled <hi>Tacitus</hi> out from
the rest of the Historians, as the Person most
capable at once of forming his Iudgment, and
giving his Curiosity the most solid Satisfaction.
But to the Suffrage of Princes and Emperours, we
may indeed add the general Voice of Mankind;
For what can be a greater Testimony in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
than the Pains all Nations have taken to
translate <hi>Tacitus</hi> into their own Language?</p>
            <p>Besides his <hi>Annals</hi> and <hi>History,</hi> he hath left us
a Treatise concerning the different Sorts of People
who inhabited <hi>Germany</hi> in his Time, and their
respective Manners and Customs; as also the
Life of his Father-in-Law <hi>Agricola.</hi> Som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> there
are who father upon him the little Tract
concerning the Causes of the Corruption and
Decay of Latin Eloquence; which others ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think to be <hi>Quintilian</hi>'s: But <hi>Lipsius</hi> seems to
go upon better grounds, when he thinks it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
belong to either of them. As for the little
Collection of <hi>Facetiae,</hi> which <hi>Fulgentius Planciades</hi>
quotes under <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Name, they are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
supposititious, that scarce any body but
that wretched Grammarian was ever impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by them. The genuine Compositions of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50009:14"/>
do very easily distinguish themselves both
by their Matter and their Form: By the former
of which, in agreement with <hi>Scaliger,</hi> I am to
understand the Diction, or Manner of the
Author; and by the latter, the Substance of
Things treated of. He is particularly remarkable
for inserting Speeches upon all occasions; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
only obliquely, and hinting the principal
Arguments; sometimes directly, and in form?
but always aptly and judiciously, suitable to the
Occasion, the Place, and the Party concern'd.
Though his Stile be extreamly concise, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
the thing he seems chiefly to affect, yet does
he frequently interweave with his main Business
many entertaining Digressions, such as that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the God <hi>Serapis</hi> in the Fourth Book of his
History, and that other strange one concerning
the Iewish Religion, and their Lawgiver <hi>Moses,</hi>
which we had occasion to pass our Censure on
before. He thought, it seems, very truly, that
as no Traveller would grudge sometimes to go a
little out of his Way, for the sight of a Place
extreamly well worth his Pains, or somewhat pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the Country he is passing through; so
these little Excursions, which please and refresh
the Reader, are no Transgressions of the Laws of
History, when seasonably indulged.</p>
            <p>Even <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Salust</hi> are not more Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
than he; which yet is so artfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd,
that there is no appearance of Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but every Maxim he lays down, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lows na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50009:14"/>
from the Subject he is treating of; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles
that Lustre and Beauty of the Stars, which
are said to be made out of the very Substance of
that Firmament they adorn. Here you see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
foreign, nothing affected, nothing forc'd or
far-fetch'd, nothing superfluous; but every Thought
so pertinent, so well fitted, that no Man can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the Right it hath to that Place, or think
any other would better become it. And which
is still more, here you do not learn barely the
Events of Things, but the very Reasons and
Progress of those Events; the secret Springs of
each Action, and all the Motives and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
by which it was carry'd on. And here a
Man may say with great Reason, with regard to
History, what the Poet does in the case of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry:
<q>
                  <l>Faelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.</l>

And if the Notion some Philosophers have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd

much greater evidence, that a History which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents

to either the Pleasure or the Profit, which arises
from a Discovery of the mysterious Causes, and
the several Counsels and Debates upon which
each Action mov'd. This reaches the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Matter; and every Man can justifie
the vulgar Proverb here, That the deeper you go,
the sweeter and more delicious you find the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
            <p>But one particular Character there is, which
raises the Merit and Reputation of <hi>Tacitus</hi> above
other Writers; that I mean of ordering Matters
so, that a Man may oftentimes receive as much
Information from what he does not say, as from
what he does. This instructive Silence is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
which others have observ'd before me:
And a very peculiar one it is, when (to speak in
Terms of Arithmetick) his very Blanks are as
considerable as his greatest Summs. So that here
you are directed to form a Notion of Men every
way; because whether he give Characters, or
whether he give none, all is done with mature
Consideration, exact Iustice, and accurate Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

himself to Writing: For we ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

A Testimony, saith <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel, Discourse l. 1. c.</hi> 34. that it was rather the Name of Consul that they hated, than the Authority of the Consulship. And this Custom lasted about 80 Years, not in a continu'd Succession, for there was sometimes of Consuls, and sometimes of Tribunes. <hi>Tacitus</hi> says nothing here of the Tribunes of the People, who held notwithstanding a considerable Rank in the ancient Common-Wealth, as having been instituted to moderate the Power of the Consuls, and to protect the meaner sort against the Insolence of the Great ones; besides, their Persons were Sacred and Inviolable. They were instituted fifty years before the Creation of Military Tribunes, when the People jealous of the Power of the Nobles, and weary of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults, retired to the <hi>Crustumerin</hi> Hill, call'd afterward the Sacred Hill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the happy accommodation of this quarrel.

after the Battle of <hi>Actium,</hi> and the Elder sort, during
the Civil War, few were now remaining of those which
had seen the times of Liberty; all things had another
face. Nothing of the Form or Force of the Ancient
Government was left. Equality and Freedom were at

and serve the Prince, at least, before he grew subject to
the Decays of Age, and cou'd attend with Vigour to
the Cares of Government, and to the Fortunes of his
Family. But when he was infeebled with Years and
Sickness, and his end was visibly approaching; the
Minds of Men were alter'd by the prospect of a Change.

the Titles of the Laws which had been Instituted by him,

by <hi>Lucius Arruntius.</hi> But <hi>Messala Valerius</hi> adding, that
the Oath of Fidelity to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> should be annually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd;
<hi>Tiberius (interrupting him on the sudden</hi>) ask'd,
if it were by his Order, that he had thus spoken? And
<hi>Messala</hi> replying, that it was of his own head, adjoin'd
farther, that in all things which concern'd the Publick
Good, he would never take any Man's opinion but his
own, though in so doing he should make <hi>Caesar</hi> himself
his Enemy. This was the only remaining kind of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.

that the Imperial Corps should be carried to the Pile on
their Shoulders only. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> dispens'd with that

publish'd an Edict to the People, warning them not to

Persons that are too quick, lose it by their Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, because they scarce see the Shadow of it; but they run to catch it. They who are slow, miss it also; for as in its Nature it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in motion, they are not able to take notice of it at the moment it passes before them; nor to lay hold on it at the very instant that they do take notice of it. There is Understanding required to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see it, and Patience to wait for it, till it comes. If Things depended only on Fortune, or only on our Wills, there would be no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in managing them, because Chance, or our Choice, would be our Guide; but when there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of joining Fortune, Art and Will together, there is need both of Patience and Iudgment to make them act in Concert, which renders them twice stronger. We may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make use of Art and Will when we please, but not of Fortune, with which we must absolutely comply, in observing the Seasons of her good Humour, without ever exacting of her what we see she obstinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses us, or drawing back when she gives us Encouragement to hope for what we desire. <hi>His History, l.</hi>

which they offer'd to their Vengeance;) they pull'd
them down, and beat them afterwards to Death with
Cudgels; Sixty of them at once assaulting one, to equal
the Number of the Centurions, which were Sixty to

A terrible Affright suddenly seiz'd those Soldiers, who

his Son is at the Mercy of as many Enemies, as he has
Soldiers? Ah, my once dear Fellow-Soldiers! why
did did you snatch away that Sword, which I was
plunging into my Body? He, of your Number, was
my best Friend, who presented me his own. I had
now been dead; I had not been a Witness of so many
Crimes, with which you have stain'd your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

blotting out that foul Disgrace, and of turning their
Swords against our Enemies! And you, in whose al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd

that you will pay your Emperour the Obedience
which you owe to him; and to the Senate, to their

<hi>Germanicus</hi> was silent while this was passing; so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being done by his Command, the whole Hatred

how long he had serv'd; what Actions he
had done in War; and they, who had been honour'd
with any Military Presents, shew'd them. In short, if
any Legion, or any Tribune, gave a good Account of
their Probity and Diligence, they were continued in
their Stations; and, on the contrary, he degraded those
who were accus'd by common Fame, either of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
or of Cruelty: And in this manner the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was appeas'd.</p>
                     <p>XXXVIII. But what was yet remaining on his Hands,
in reference to the Fifth and Twenty-first Legion, was
not of less Importance. Those Legions had their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quarters Sixty Miles from thence, in a Place call'd

resembled this. It was not in Battle, nor by the Hands

themselves the Trouble to stop their Fury; the common
Soldiers had all manner of Freedom to exercise their
Vengeance, till they were tir'd with killing. <hi>Germanicus</hi>
soon after enter'd the Camp, and beholding so many
Corps extended on the Ground, said with many Tears,
That this was not a Remedy, nor the breathing of a
Vein, but a Butchery; and commanded the Bodies to
be burn'd. While their Minds were in this Ferment, the
Soldiers cried out to be led against the Enemy, as if the

no other way, than by exposing their impious

and behind, with a strong Palisade: Both their Wings
were cover'd by huge Trunks of Trees which they had
fell'd, and which serv'd them for a Barricade. From
thence, traversing thick Forests, they held a Council,
which way they should bend their March: The shortest,
and most frequented; or that which was farthest about,
and more difficult to pass; but where they thought the
Enemy would not attend them. The Reasons for the
longer Way prevail'd, but all the rest was perform'd
with haste; for their Scouts brought back Intelligence,

that the <hi>Germans</hi> solemniz'd a Feast that Night with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

all Incumbrances. The Legions follow'd at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
the Night was clear and calm, and favourable
to the March. They enter'd the Village of the <hi>Marsi,</hi>
which they encompass'd with Corps-de-Guard. They
found the <hi>Germans,</hi> either asleep in Bed, or laid along by

their Neglect. They thought themselves secure of War,
yet it was not properly a state of Peace, but rather
a stupid Debauch, and a Lethargick Rest.</p>

The Enemy mov'd not, till they saw the main Body
enter'd into the Wood; then they began a light Skirmish
on the Front and Wings, pouring with their Gross upon

A little
farther might be seen, the Retrenchments half in Ruine,
inclos'd with a Ditch, now choak'd up, and almost

The middle of the Field was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

others pil'd on heaps; by which might be observ'd,
whether they receiv'd their Death in flight, or fell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in manly Resistance to the last. Every where were
found their broken Pikes, and Iavelins; the Limbs of
Horses, and their Iaw-bones; and the Heads of Men,
which were fix'd to the Trunks, or hung on the Branches
of the Trees. In the Woods about the Field were seen
the Altars, where those <hi>Barbarians</hi> had executed the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
and Captains of the first Orders<note n="o" place="bottom">That is to say, three Cohorts. For they rise from Cohort to Cohort, according to their Merit, or the time of their Service.</note>. They who
had escap'd from this Battel, or afterwards from their
Captivity, related many Particulars of that dreadful
Day. On this Place, said they, were slain the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
of the Legions; and there it was we lost our
Eagles. Here <hi>Varus</hi> receiv'd his first Wound, and a little
farther he fell upon his Sword, and perish'd by his own

But this pious Office to the Slain was nothing pleasing to

LVII. In the mean time, <hi>Germanicus</hi> pursu'd <hi>Arminius,</hi>
who retir'd into Places unfrequented, and inaccessible;
when at length he had join'd the Enemy, he commanded
his Cavalry to advance, and dislodge him from the Post
he had possess'd. <hi>Arminius,</hi> with his Forces drawn up
in close Order, march'd along the Forest, and suddenly
wheeling, fac'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> giving the Signal to those
Soldiers, whom he had laid in Ambush in the Wood.
The <hi>Roman</hi> Horse, amaz'd at the sight of these new
Enemies, was put into disorder; and the Cohorts
coming up to their Assistance, being incumber'd with a
Croud of those who fled from the <hi>Germans,</hi> and press'd
upon their Ranks, were forc'd to open as they could,
and make a Passage for them: In this Confusion, and
general Affright, the Enemy, who knew the Country,
were driving our Men headlong on the Morass, from
whence it was impossible to disingage themselves, if <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus</hi>
had not with timely foresight drawn up the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
in <hi>Battalia:</hi> This gave Terrour to the <hi>Germans,</hi>
and restor'd the Courage of our Soldiers, so that both
Sides retir'd without Advantage. Soon after this, <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
march'd back his Army to <hi>Amisia,</hi> where he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
the Legions, to return in the same manner as
they came. One part of the Cavalry were order'd to
draw towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> still coasting the Ocean in their
March. <hi>Cecina,</hi> who led back his Cohorts, was advis'd,
That though he was well acquainted with the Way which
he had taken, yet he should make all imaginable Haste to
get over the long Bridges<note n="r" place="bottom">It is a Causeway, made upon Piles with a great deal of Sand, above a League long. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have made a Fort, by which they pass as they go into <hi>Friseland.</hi>
                        </note>. That way is narrow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
on either hand with Marshes, over which these
Bridges, or rather Causeways, were formerly laid by
<hi>Lucius Domitius.</hi> The rest is all either miry Ground,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50009:88"/>
or glewy Clay, cumbersom to the Feet, or uncertain,
with scattering Rivulets; round about are rising Woods,
which, with a gentle Descent, reach even to the Plain.
In this place, <hi>Arminius</hi> had lodg'd a great Number of
his Soldiers, having by long Marches, and by shorter
Ways, got before our Men, who were loaden with
their Arms and Baggage. <hi>Cecina,</hi> not knowing how to
repair the Causway, now decay'd, and at the same time
to repulse the Enemy, took a Resolution to incamp in
the same place; that while one part of his Army was
employ'd in repairing the ruin'd Passage, the other
might be in a readiness to fight.</p>
                     <p>LVIII. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> made a strong Effort to push
our Corps-de-Garde, and afterwards to have pour'd
upon the Workmen; they charg'd our Men, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
on one side, and sometimes on the other, harassing
them with continual Attempts, and endeavouring to
break in upon them. The Cries of those who were
employ'd in working, were confusedly mix'd with theirs
who sought: All Things conspir'd against the <hi>Romans,</hi>
the depth of the Morass, the slipperiness of the Ground,
on which they could neither march, nor scarcely set a
Foot, without danger of falling; the weight of their
Armour; and the height of the Waters, which dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
their force in lanching their Iavelins. On the
other side, the <hi>Cherusci</hi> were accustom'd to engage in
marshy Ground, where the height of their Stature gave
them a manifest Advantage, as also their long Pikes, with
which they push'd to a great distance. The Night alone
was the apparent Safety of our Legions, which began
already to give Ground before the Enemy. But the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
by their good Fortune made indefatigable<note n="s" place="bottom">

they had already made, and increase the Difficulties of
their new Labours. <hi>Cecina,</hi> who for the space of Forty
Years had exercis'd the Trade of War, either as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

prosperous and adverse Fortune<note n="1" place="bottom">To be a great Man, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessary to have had the Trial of both Fortunes.

Insomuch, that had he remained Bishop of <hi>Luson,</hi> or Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, he had been able as well to defend the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which he in part inclines to towards the close of the same Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, where he thus speaks: <hi>I am not afraid to say, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this particular to keep to the Usage of</hi> France, <hi>than to imitate that of</hi> Spain, <hi>which nevertheless <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I conclude therefore agreeably with him, That since <hi>Countries remote from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence of their Princes require change of Governours, because continuance for Life may make them have a mind to throw off the relation of Subjects or Subordinates, and set up for Supream, and Masters of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi> the Custom of <hi>Spain</hi> will become absolutely necessary to <hi>France,</hi> if she go on to extend her Frontiers.</note> in the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

Various Reasons are assign'd for this: Some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,

Thus plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Places is as opposite to the true Interest of the Prince, as plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Benefices is to that of the Church. I shall here remark by the way, That the principal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Regal Authority in <hi>France</hi> is the great number of its Officers.

Some have believ'd, that as he had a quick and piercing
Wit, so his Iudgment was always in suspence; for as he
could not suffer the Extremities of Vice, so neither did
he love extraordinary and shining Virtues: Being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of his Authority, he fear'd great Men<note n="3" place="bottom">A Person of ordinary Parts, and a moderate Capacity, is more likely to make his Fortunes with Princes, than one of a sublime and great Wit. For all Superiority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ungrateful to them, and they being ambitious to be accounted Chief and Best at every Thing, will never love, nor consequently prefer a Man, whose Understanding seems larger, and more penetrating, than their own. The Letters of <hi>Anthony Perez</hi> contain a great deal to this purpose. Among others, there is one directed to a <hi>Grand Privado,</hi> wherein he thus speaks, when the Holy Spirit says, <hi>Seem not wise in the Presence of a King;</hi> he meant not to say, <hi>Be not wise,</hi> but, <hi>Seem not to be so;</hi> as if he had used these Words, <hi>Conceal thy Parts, and thy Prudence, shew not thy Intellectuals.</hi> Prince <hi>Rui Gomez de Silva,</hi> the greatest Master in this Art that has appeared for these many Ages, told me, he learned this Rule from a mighty Favourite of the Kings of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and that in all the Advices he gave, and in all the Consultations he at any time had with his Prince, he took care to carry himself with all the Wariness and Circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he possibly could ... He further added, That he so contrived the Matter, that the good Success of his Counsels might seem to be only the effect of Chance, and not the return of any Care he had to please him, or of an intent Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to his Business, but he seem'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

On this Subject, continued he, the same Prince related to me, what passed one day between <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and Count <hi>Lewis de Silveira.</hi> The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received a Dispatch from the Pope, composed with great exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, sends for the Count, and commands him to draw up an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, whilst he himself was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another, for he had a strong inclination to be an Orator, and indeed was so. The Count obeys, but first declares his Reluctancy to enter Competition with his Master, and the next day he brings his Paper to the King, who, after he had heard it, was loth to read his own; but when the Count had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him to read it, the King acknowledging the Count's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to be the better, would have that sent to the Pope, and not his own. The Count, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, orders two Horses to be saddled for his two Sons, and went immediately with them. And when he was in the Fields, he saith to them: <q>My Children, seek ye your Livelihood, and I mine, there is no farther means of living here; for the King knows, that I am wiser than himself.</q> Don <hi>Iuan Antonio de Vera,</hi> who relates the same thing in the First Discourse of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, seems to say and believe, that it is a Fable; but be it so or no, it is still very Instructive.</note>; and as he
was jealous of his own Reputation, and of the publick
Honour, he rejected those who pass'd for Scandalous, or
Insufficient<note n="s" place="bottom">These three Reasons, says <hi>Scipio Amirato,</hi> preceeded from his Vices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The first, from Laziness; the second, from Malice; and the third, from a mixture of Laziness and Folly.

Commines</hi> says, All crafty Princes are jealous, that all great Princes are so, and particularly, wise ones, and such as have made many Enemies, and injured many, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> had done. <hi>Ch. 7. l. 6. of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs.

to Hazards and Treachery in Provinces where he was a
Stranger. But the more he was hated by his Uncle and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50009:111"/>
loved by the Soldiers, the more he endeavoured to put
an end to this War by a Decisive Battel, in order to
which, he consider'd well with himself the Methods of
Fighting, and what had succeeded well or ill with him,
after three years War in this Country. He found that
the Germans were always beaten in pitch'd Battels, and
on even Ground; that their advantages lay in Woods
and Marshes, in short Summers and early Winters;
That his Soldiers were more troubled at their long marches
and the loss of their Arms, than for the Wounds they had
receiv'd; That the <hi>Gauls</hi> were weary of furnishing Horses;
That his long train of Carriages, was much exposed to
the Enemy, and not easily defended. Whereas if they
went by Sea, where they were Masters, and the Enemy
Strangers, they would be Earlier in the Field; the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
together with their Provisions, the Horsemen and
their Horses, would be all safely carry'd through the
Mouths and the Chanels of the Rivers, into the very
Heart of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VI. He resolves therefore on this Method, and whilst
he dispatcheth <hi>P. Vitellius,</hi> and <hi>C. Antius,</hi> to receive the
Tribute from the Gauls, he appoints <hi>Silius Anteius,</hi> and
<hi>Cecinna,</hi> to provide a Fleet. A thousand Ships were judg'd
sufficient, and they were soon Equipp'd; some of them
were short with a narrow Poop and Stern, and a wide
Belly, that they might better endure the Waves; others
with flat Bottoms, for the conveniency of landing in
shallow places; several with Sterns at both ends, that
with only changing the stroak of the Oars, without
turning the Vessel, they might advance or retire; many
were cover'd with Bridges for the carrying of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
with conveniencies also for Horses and Provisions,
and all of them were made both for Sailing and Rowing,
and the eagerness and shoutings of the Soldiers, added
much to both to the shew and the terror of the Fleet.
The Isle of <hi>Batavia</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="bottom">Holland.</note> was appointed for the place of their

order'd his Lieutenant, <hi>Silius,</hi> with a Flying Army to

XII. When <hi>Germanicus</hi> had pass'd the <hi>Weser,</hi> he was
informed by a Deserter, that <hi>Arminius</hi> had chosen the
Place of Battel; that other Nations had joyned him in a
Forrest consecrated to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and that they designed
to Storm our Camp by Night. He gave credit to this
Intelligence, and the rather because their fires were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
and the Scouts who had been sent out brought back
word, that they heard the Neighings of Horses, and a
confus'd Noise like that of a Numerous and Undisciplin'd
Army on their march. It being like to be a Decisive Battel,
and this the critical time of Danger, <hi>Germanicus</hi> thought
it fit to try how the Minds of the Soldiers stood affected,
but how to be assur'd of this was not so easie; He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
that the Tribunes and Captains used to give ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acceptable than true Accounts; that the Freemen
were of slavish Tempers, and that Friends were too
prone to flatter. That if he should call a Council of
War, nothing was more common than for all the rest to
applaud that Advice, which happen'd to be approv'd by
a Few at first<note n="1" place="bottom">In such a Council, saith <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> there are a great many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are only Ecchoes to others, without scarce understanding the Matter, and desire to shew their complaisance to some Person, who hath spoke and who is esteemed to be in authority, <hi>Lib. 2.

was confirmed by the Auspices<note n="c" place="bottom">The Auspices were taken from the Flight of Birds.</note>, he calls an Assembly,
wherein he proposes the Measures which he had resolved
on for the ensuing Battel. <hi>The Romans,</hi> said he, <hi>with
good Conduct, can fight as well in Woods and Forests, as on
the Plains, for the Unweildy Targats, and the long Pikes of
the Enemies are not so easie to be manag'd amongst the Trunks

The Germans have neither Breast-plate nor Helmet,
and their Bucklers are not strengthened with Iron or Cords,
and are made only of</hi> Osier <hi>Twigs, or of thin Painted Boards.
Their foremost Ranks indeed are armed with a sort of Pikes,
but the rest have only Stakes hardned in the fire, or short Darts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And although they are terrible in their Looks, and vigorous in

wounded, but run away without any concern for their own
Honour or their General's Safety. They are utterly dispirited

                     <hi>XV. Neither was</hi> Arminius <hi>and the rest of the German
Nobility wanting to encourage their Men, telling them, that</hi>
these were the fugitive remains of <hi>Varus</hi>'s Army, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell'd
to avoid the fatigues of War, of whom some having
shameful Wounds on their Backs, others their Limbs disabled
by storms at Sea, were now again exposed to their incens'd
Enemies, without any hopes of success, the Gods being against
them. Although they had gotten a Fleet, and taken the most
unknown ways of the Sea, that none might meet them as they
came, nor pursue them after they should be defeated; yet when
they joyn'd Battel, they should find that Oars and Winds would
prove but little succour to a routed Army. Let the Germans
only remember the Avarice, Cruelty, and Pride of the Romans,
and resolve either to defend their Liberty, or die with it.</p>
                  <p>XVI. The Germans thus encourag'd, and eager to
fight, <hi>Arminius</hi> draws them down into a Plain call'd
<hi>Idistaviso,</hi> which winds with an uneven space betwixt the
<hi>Weser</hi> and the <hi>Hills,</hi> as the Course of the River gives way
to it, or the Hills jet upon it; behind it grew a Wood
of high Trees with spreading tops, but with void spaces
betwixt their Trunks. The Barbarians<note n="e" place="bottom">Those, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> said, joyn'd <hi>Arminius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

only the <hi>Cherusci</hi> kept the Hills that they might fall

Auxiliaries were in the Front, follow'd by Archers on
Foot, next to whom was <hi>Germanicus</hi> himself with four
Legions, two Praetorian Cohorts and the Flower of the
Cavalry: After them as many Legions more, with Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50009:116"/>
Soldiers and Archers on Horse-back, and the rest
of the Confederate Troops, all of them being very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to march in order of Battel.</p>
                  <p>XVII. <hi>Germanicus</hi> perceiving the <hi>Cherusci</hi> to advance

Encamp on a Wet-piece of Ground, having a River on

with a deep Marsh, except in one place, where the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grivarii</hi>
had cast up a large Work to separate themselves
from the <hi>Cherusci.</hi> The Infantry were posted in this Place;
the Cavalry cover'd themselves in an adjoyning thicket,
that they might fall upon the Rear of our Legions, as
soon as they were entred the Wood.</p>
                  <p>XX. <hi>Germanicus</hi> was ignorant of none of these

Designs<note n="1" place="bottom">There is nothing more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor more useful to Generals of Armies than Spies, whom <hi>Strada</hi> had reason to call the Ears and Eyes of Princes.

own Stratagems on themselves to their ruine. Having
given his Lieutenant <hi>Sejus Tubero</hi> the Command of the
Cavalry, with orders to draw them up in the Plain, he
divided the Infantry, that one part of them might enter
the Wood where the Ground was even, whilst the other
part forced the Works which the Enemy had thrown up,

himself<note n="2" place="bottom">When a General undertakes the most dangerous part himself, the Officers and Soldiers very chearfully do all the rest.</note>, and left the other to his Lieutenants.
They who were to gain the Even Ground, easily brake

as much resistance, as if they had been to scale a

made a stout Resistance. They were shut in by a Morass

XXI. The Germans were not inferior to the Romans
in Courage, but their disadvantage lay in their Arms and
in the Manner of the Fight; for they being very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and couped up in strait Places, had not room to
wield their long Pikes, nor was their Agility of Body of
any use to them, when they were forced to a standing
Fight, without moving scarce a Foot: Whereas our Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who were armed with Breast-plates, and who had
their Hands guarded with the Hilts of their Swords, made
terrible thrusts at the large Bodies and the Naked Faces of
the Enemy, and opened themselves a way by the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that they made. <hi>Arminius</hi> now began to flag, being

At last, after he had marched twenty Leagues, he Embarked his Troops at the Cape of <hi>Metafuz;</hi> and when there remain'd not a sufficient Number of Ships to receive them, he caused all the Horses to be thrown into the Sea, which increased the general Grief, every one being troubled to see these poor Creatures swim, and as it were, beg help from the Men who abandon'd them; for, according to the Proverb, a Man ought to have Humanity even for the Beasts that serve him. <hi>In the Epitome of the Life of C.</hi> V. <hi>Cabrera</hi> recites a Consolatory Letter, which his Son <hi>Philip</hi> wrote him upon this Disaster, wherein he said to his Father, <q>That to return from difficult Enterprizes, without Victory, never took from Kings nor Great Captains that Glory, which is always due to Martial Valour; the most Prudent and most Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous having lost as well as won; that he ought so much the more to comfort himself, because he had yielded to nothing but the Force of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which had conspir'd with the Elements against his Prudence and Greatness; that he ought never to be angry with accidents, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended purely on Chance; that one hath acquitted himself well, when he has projected and ordered things well; that the good Fortune of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> and that of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Grandfather to his Imperial Majesty, by the Mother's side, appeared prodigious; and that nevertheless, if we compare their Successes with their Misfortunes, it is hard to say, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Fortune was a Mother or a Step-mother to them,</q>

brought several whom they had ransom'd from some of

in an adjacent Wood, and but slightly guarded<note n="o" place="bottom">I have already observ'd, that the Romans reverenc'd their Eagles, as their Tutelar Gods. So that we need not wonder that <hi>Germanicus</hi> was so much concern'd to recover that Eagle which <hi>Malovendus</hi> gave intelligence of. For as it was ignominious to lose the Eagles, it was Sacrilege and Impiety, not to rescue them out of the Enemy's hands, when an occasion offer'd it self. It was for this Reason, that <hi>Augustus</hi> reckon'd it amongst his most glorious Actions, that he had obliged that Parthians to restore the Eagles, which <hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Marc-Anthony</hi> had lost amongst them, <hi>Sueton in his Life, and Paterculus, Cap. 91.

Party was immediately sent out to attack the Enemy in
the Front, and by light Skirmishes to draw them from
their Posts, whilst another detachment was to wheel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
behind them, and open the Earth where the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
lay, and both succeeded. Wherefore <hi>Germanicus</hi>
advances farther into the Country, which he lays waste,
and presseth upon the Enemy, that durst not give him
Battel, or whenever they did make resistance were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

under greater Consternation. For they now said, that
the Romans were invincible, and to be broken by no
Misfortunes, who after such a loss of their Fleet and of
their Arms, after the Shores had been cover'd with the
Carcasses of their Men, and of their Horses, fought with
their wonted Courage and Vigour, and as if their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
had been increased.</p>

rejoycing that they had repair'd their Losses at Sea,
by this prosperous Expedition, and <hi>Germanicus</hi> with his
Bounty increas'd their Ioy, by making up to every one of
them what loss they had receiv'd; And there is no doubt
but that the Enemy was brought so low, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to sue for Peace, and that the next Summer would
have put an End to the War. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> by repeated

Right to accuse him; but when they could not agree
amongst themselves, and <hi>Libo</hi> came without an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
<hi>Livius</hi> declar'd, that he would exhibit the several
Crimes wherewith he was charged. Of which one was,
That he had consulted with the Astrologers, whether he
should ever be rich enough to cover the Appian way from
<hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Brundusium</hi> with Money, and the rest were
much of the same nature, Ridiculous and Pitiful. Only
there was a Writing in <hi>Libo</hi>'s hand, upon which the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
insisted very much, wherein were the Names of the
<hi>Caesars,</hi> and of some Senators, with Dangerous and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious

<hi>That the Empire being enlarg'd, the Wealth of Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

There was quite another manner of living in the Age of the</hi>

both suitable to the Condition of the Common-Wealth at those

That the Laws had made a Distinction betwixt the Revenues

was betwixt them, but that those who were in the greatest

                     <note n="1" place="bottom">It is but just, that Princes who have so great Cares, and such labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Employs, should have Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in proportion to their Toyls, that there may be such a Consort betwixt the Mind and the Body, that one might not be a Burthen to the other. The nature of Affairs of State, saith <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> so much the more requires an unbending of the Mind, as the weight thereof is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than that of all other Affairs; and the strength of the Mind and the Body being limited, continual la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour would in a little time exhaust them.

the Courts of Iudicature; of the Insolence of Advocates;
who menac'd People with Accusations; protesting that,

and drawing together all those whom he knew to have an

had the best Right, if it were to be decided by Law,

draws up his Troops in order of Battel before the Fort,
on a Steep and Craggy Hill; the rest being environ'd
by the Sea. Opposite to them were ranged our <hi>Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>

One side had the advantage in Soldiers, and the other
side in Ground; But <hi>Piso</hi>'s Soldiers wanted Courage

the Ashes, the Banners were rolled up, and with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed

there was sometimes a profound Silence, and at others,
great Lamentation, the Streets full of People, and the

Arms, the Magistrates without their Habits, the People
ranked by their Tribes, cryed out, All was lost beyond

he was sent with <hi>Germanicus</hi> to govern the East. They
were impartially to judge, whether he had provoked
the young Prince by his Disobedience and Disputes, if
he rejoyced at his Death, or was the Cause of it. For,
says he, if he exceeded what was committed to him,

There are two Vessels, one small and full, the other large and almost empty; The full Vessel is like a Man in an Employment suitable to his Abilities; Those who see him carry himself so well in it, conclude he would do the like in a Greater, not taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that his Vessel is as full as it can hold, and if more be put in, it will run over. So <hi>Galba,</hi> while a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man, seem'd much greater than he was. The large Vessels, almost Empty, or at least not Full, are the Men of great Capacity, who having neither Estates nor Employments suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Merit, are not much esteem'd, whether it is that they use not all their Diligence or Exactness in what they do, or not being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate, we cannot judge what may be expected from them.

            <p>I. IT has been usual heretofore to transmit the
Deeds, and Manners of famous Men to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
neither is it omitted in our Times,
tho' the Age is very careless of its own Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as often as any great, and noble Virtue proves
so transcendent as to ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fle Envy, and prevent Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
Vices equally common to great, and little
Cities. But as our Predecessors were apparently
more prone to Actions, worthy to be recorded,
so every celebrated Wit was induced, by the
meer Reward of doing well, to an impartial Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of their Virtues: Nay, many have thought
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it to be their own Historians, not through Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
but a just Assurance of their good Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
Neither is it any Discredit, or Objection to
the Memoirs of <hi>Rutilius,</hi> or <hi>Scaurus,</hi> that they
were written by their own Hands; so highly is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50009:219"/>
Virtue esteemed, when frequently practised: But
I, who am about to write the Life of a dead Man,
have need of Pardon, which I should not crave,
were I not to write in Times so malignant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Virtuous.</p>
            <p>II. We have read of <hi>Arulenus Rusticus,</hi> and
<hi>Herenius Senicen</hi> made Capital Offenders; the one
for praising <hi>Priscus Heluidius,</hi> the other, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<hi>Petus Thrasea;</hi> nay, the Books as well
as the Authors were executed: A Triumvirate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appointed to burn those Monuments of famous
Men, in the Publick Assembly, and in the open
Market, believing by their Flames, the Peoples
Freedom of Speech the Liberty of the Senate,
and the good Conscience of Mankind would be
destroyed. And by the Expulsion of Wise Men,
and the Banishment of honest Arts, Goodness it
self would be extirpated. We have given ample
Proofs of our Patience; for, as the former Age
saw the End of Liberty, so we have the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Servitude, being deprived, by frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions,
of the Commerce of the Ear, and
Tongue; so that we had lost our Memory with
our Voice, could we as easily forget, as be silent.</p>
            <p>III. Now at last our Spirits are revived: But
if in the beginning of this blessed Age, <hi>Nerva Caesar</hi>
has reconciled two former Opposites, Liberty and
Sovereignty; and <hi>Caesar Trajan</hi> daily increases our
Happiness under Kingly Government; so that we
have not only fair Hopes, and a longing Desire,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50009:219"/>
but a strong Assurance of the Publick Safety: Yet,
such is the Infirmity of Human Nature, Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
work slower than the Disease. And as our
Bodies, that grow by degrees, quickly perish; so
it is easier to suppress, than restore Wit, and
Learning, there being a kind of Charm in Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that makes Sloth, which was at first trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
turn to Delight. What, if for fifteen Years,
a large Space of Human Life, many have fallen
by Accident, but the more Eminent by the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Prince? Yet some of us have not only
survived our Contemporaries, but, if I may so
speak, our selves, so many Years being substract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the middle part of our Age; in which, if
young, we grow old, if old, we're passing in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the last Period of our Lives. But I shall,
without Regret endeavour, tho' in a rude Style,
to relate our past Misery, and our present Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And I hope this Account, being dedicated
to the Memory of my Father-in-Law, <hi>Agricola,</hi>
will, for its Piety, merit Pardon, if not Praise.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Cnaeus Iulius Agricola</hi> was born in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Famous <hi>Colenny</hi> of <hi>Forium Iulium:</hi> Both
his Grandfathers were Procurators to their Prince:
the noble Imploy of a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Iulius Graecinus</hi> was a Senator eminent for
Wisdom, and Eloquence; good Qualities that
provoked the Rage of <hi>Caius Caesar,</hi> who put him
to death, for refusing to implead <hi>Marcus Silanus.</hi>
He, being bred up under the Wing of a tender
Mother, <hi>Iulia Procilla,</hi> a Woman of a singular
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50009:220"/>
Chastity, pass'd his Minority in acquiring Virtues
sutable to his Age. He was not only guarded
from the Allurements of the Vicious by a natural
Probity, but by having, in his tender Years, <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silia</hi>
the Seat, and Mistress of his Studies; a Place
that had exactly temper'd a Provincial Parsimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
with a <hi>Graecian</hi> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ability. I well remember,
he frequently would relate how eagerly he was
bent in his Youth, on the Study of Philosophy,
and the Law; more then was allowed a <hi>Roman</hi>
Senator. But his Mother's Prudence corrected
this irregular Heat. His high Spirit made him
more vehement, than cautious in the Pursuit of
Glory, and Renown: But Age and Experience
made him more temperate; but, what was most
difficult, he continued to bound his Desires with
Discretion.</p>
            <p>V. He made his first Campaign with great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
under <hi>Suetonius Paullinus</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> a
diligent, and good-natur'd General, who did
him the Honour to choose him for his Comrade.
<hi>Agricola</hi> did not, like other Gallants, make War
the Business of Love, and Courtship: He was not
addicted to Rambling, and Pleasure, so as to have
the Title, without the Skill of a Tribune; but
spent his time in discovering the Country, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himself known to the Army, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the Skilful; still following the Brave;
never attempting any thing out of Ostentation, or
declining any Attempt for Fear. Never were Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in <hi>Brit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in</hi> more desperate: Our old Souldiers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50009:220"/>
slain, our Colonies burnt, our Army intercepted;
and we forced first to fight for Safety, and then
for Victory. These Exploits, by which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
was recover'd, tho' acted by the Advice, or
Conduct of another, were the General's Glory;
and made our young Souldier more emulous, as
well as more experienced, his Soul being fired
with an Ambition of Military Fame, which was
very disagreeable to those Times; in which, to
be Eminent was to be suspected; a great Name,
and an ill one being equally dangerous.</p>
            <p>VI. He went hence to <hi>Rome</hi> to commence a
Magistrate; and married <hi>Domitia Decidiana,</hi> a
Lady of a Noble Family, which Match was not
only a Credit, but an Advantage to his Rise:
They mightily agreed, and lov'd; mutually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
each other; a Point of no great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
only a good Wife is as great an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as a bad one is a blemish to her Husband.
'Twas his Lot, as Questor, to have <hi>Asia</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and <hi>Salvius Titianus,</hi> Pro-Consul, but he
was corrupted by neither; tho' a greedy Pro-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
and a wealthy Province, a fit Prey for the
Avaricious, might easily have made way for a
mutual Connivance. Here his Family, to his
great Support and Comfort, was recruited with
a Daughter, having lost his Son a little before.
The time between his being Questor, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune
of the People, nay, the Year of his Tribune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
he past in Ease, and Quietness; well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Temper of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Court, where, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50009:221"/>
do nothing was Policy; the same was the Course,
and Silence of his Pretorship: He executed no Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Office; he managed Plays, and other pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Vanities, by a Temper of Reason, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality;
the farther from Excess, the nearer to
Credit. He was appointed by <hi>Galba</hi> to Revise the
Gifts, and Riches of the Temples; who by a
diligent Scrutiny preserv'd the Commonwealth
from being sacrilegiously pillaged by any but
<hi>Nero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. The next Year severely wounded him,
and his Family: <hi>Otho</hi>'s Fleet, loosly roving along
the Coasts, wasted <hi>Intemelium,</hi> a part of <hi>Liguria,</hi>
and killed his Mother at her Farm, which they
spoiled, and plunder'd of its Wealth; the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of her Murder: Going to perform his last
Act of Piety, <hi>Agricola</hi> was acquainted, by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
that <hi>Vespatian</hi> pretended to the Empire,
with whom he immediately sided. At first <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi>
was at the Head of Affairs, and governed
the City, <hi>Domitian</hi> being very young, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no use of his being the Son of an Emperor,
but to live licentiously; <hi>Mutianus</hi> sent <hi>Agricola</hi> to
take <hi>Musters,</hi> which he did with Integrity, and
Courage. And, understanding that their present
Lieutenant behaved himself seditiously, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e gave
him the Command of the Twentieth Legion,
which was hardly brought to take an Oath to
<hi>Vespatian.</hi> A Legion formidable, and too much
for the Lieutenant-Generals, but wholly ungover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
by their own: Tho' 'twas a Question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50009:221"/>
he was too weak, or they too stubborn. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola</hi>
was elected for his Successor and Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
but he, with rare Moderation, wou'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seem to find than make them good.</p>
            <p>VIII. At this time <hi>Vectius Bolanus</hi> was Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Britain,</hi> who was of too mild a Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for so fierce a People. <hi>Agricola</hi> check'd the
Ardor of his aspiring Spirit, fearing it should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
for he had learned perfect Obedience, and
to act honestly to his Advantage. In a little time
<hi>Petilius Cerialis</hi> was Lieutenant-General here:
Now he had Space and Opportunity, to give fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Proofs of his Courage and Conduct. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialis</hi>
first made him Share of his Toyl, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then of his Glory. Oftentimes, for an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
letting him Command a small Party, and,
as he came off, a greater. <hi>Agricola</hi> never boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his Performance, but ascribed all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Action to his Superior Officer. Thus
by a vertuous Submission, and a Modesty in
speaking of himself, he lived without Envy, but
not without Praise.</p>
            <p>IX. Returning from being Lieutenant of the
Legion, <hi>Vespatian</hi> made him a Patrician; and with
the Hopes of being Consul, which was design'd
him, gave him the Government of <hi>Acquitane,</hi> a
Command of the first Rank and Dignity. It has
been the Opinion of many, that Military Wits
are not so refined, and polished, Martial Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
being more coarse, and blunt; rather the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50009:222"/>
Work of the Hand, than Head; not using the Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Subtility of Civil Courts. Yet <hi>Agricola,</hi>
bred a Souldier, by a natural Prudence, lived easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fairly with those Sharpers of the Law. Now
he had set times for Business, and Diversion;
when he was on the Bench, and to give Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he was grave, intent, severe, but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tenest
merciful, if consistent with his Duty: Afterwards
there was no Sign of his Authority, for he put off
his Austerity, State, and Rigour; and, what was
seldom to be met with, his Kindness did not abate
his Power, nor his Severity, the Love of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
I should injure the Character of this Great
Man, should I tell how free he was from Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
or Bribery. He never would purchase
Fame, which good Men are fond of, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lie Arts,
or confident Boasting: He neither emulated his
Collegues, nor contended with the Procurators,
knowing to be overcome was a Shame, and to
conquer no Honour. He continued three Years
in his Government, but was recalled with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of being Consul, returning with the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all, that he was designed for <hi>Britain,</hi>
because he was most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it; not that any thing that
dropped from him could occasion the Report.
Fame does not always mistake, but sometimes
makes a good Choice; during his Consulship he
was so kind, as to promise me his hopeful Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and when it was ended, our Marriage was
consummated: He was immediately made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Britain,</hi> to which was annexed a Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Dignity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50009:222"/>
X. Many Writers have described the Situation,
and Inhabitants of <hi>Britain,</hi> which I shall do; not
to vie with them in Wit and Care, but because it
was now first totally subdued: That, which our
Predecessors adorned with their Eloquence, I shall
faithfully relate. Of all the Islands that are known
to the <hi>Romans, Britain</hi> is the largest: Its <hi>Eastern</hi>
Parts lie towards <hi>Germany,</hi> its <hi>Western</hi> towards
<hi>Spain,</hi> its <hi>Southern</hi> against <hi>France;</hi> there is no
Land to be described on the <hi>North,</hi> but an open and
wide Sea, that continually beats upon the Shoar.
<hi>Livy,</hi> the most Eloquent of the Ancient, and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
Rusticus</hi> of Modern Authors, have compared
its Figure to an Oblong Dish, or an Ax. That is
its Shape indeed, of this side <hi>Caledonia,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Fame has applied it to the whole: But there
is a vast enormous Tract of Land, that, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
grows narrower and narrower, like a
Wedge; the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet first doubling this Point,
affirmed <hi>Britain</hi> to be an Island, and at once dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
and conquered the Isles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> 'till that
time unknown. <hi>Thyle</hi> too, at a distance, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried,
hid hitherto in Snow and Winter. The
Sea here is said to be sluggish and stiff to the Oar,
not subject to be agitated by Winds: I suppose,
because the Continent is far off, and the Mountains
upon it but few, which are thought to be the
Source and Nurseries of Winds and Tempests:
Whereupon so continued a Mass of deep Water, is
difficult to be put into Motion. To enquire into
the Nature of the Sea, and Tides, is not my Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50009:223"/>
it being done by others; but this I shall say,
The Empire of the Sea is no where more absolute,
proudly carrying Rivers of Water hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and doth not only ebb and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low, but forces
its passage into the Land, and climbs up to the
Tops of Mountains, as if they were its proper
Road and Channel.</p>
            <p>XI. Whether the first Inhabitants of this Island
were Natives, or imported Strangers, is hardly to
be found in this, or any barbarous Nation. We
may conjecture at their Original, by the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Fashions of their Bodies: They that live in
<hi>Caledonia,</hi> are red Headed, big Limb'd, which
speaks them of a <hi>German</hi> Extraction. The Swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of the <hi>Silures,</hi> and their curled Hair, would
induce one to believe, by their Situation over-against
<hi>Spain,</hi> that the <hi>Iberi</hi> had heretofore failed
over, and planted themselves in these parts. They
that are Neighbours to the <hi>French,</hi> are like them,
either because the Qualities, and Strength of their
Progenitors, continue in them; or, because, in
Countries bordering upon one another, the same
Climate createth the same Complexion: But 'tis
generally believed, the <hi>French</hi> first Peopled those
Parts. You may guess at their Religion, by their
superstitious Opinions. Their Speech differs but
little; with equal Boldness they challenge Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and with equal Fear decline them when they
come: The <hi>British</hi> Fierceness has the Preference,
being not at present softned by a long and a slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish
Peace. The <hi>French</hi> were formerly brave, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50009:223"/>
invaded by Sloth and Idleness, they lost their
Courage and their Liberty. The same Fate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the <hi>Britains</hi> heretofore. The rest remain
such as the <hi>French</hi> were.</p>
            <p>XII. Their greatest Strength lies in their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Some Nations use Chariots in War; the
greatest Men drive them, and their Dependants
defend them. They were formerly governed by
Kings; but now they are divided into Faction,
and Parties, by some Ring-Leaders. That which
contributed most to our conquering these Warlike
Nations, was, their having no Common Council;
seldom above two or three Cities, at a time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
Methods of repelling the Common Foe:
So that whilst they fought singly, they were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
overcome. They have a dropping, and
a cloudy Sky; the Cold here is not sharp; the
Days are of a greater Length than ours; the Night
is clear, and in the Extream Parts short; so that
you scarce distinguish the Beginning from the
Ending of the Day. They affirm, if the Clouds
did not interpose, the Rays of the Sun would be
always visible; and, that he does not rise and set,
but glide by; because the Extream and Plain
Parts of the Earth, project a low and humble Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
which makes Night hang hovering under
the Stars and Sky. The Soil will bear all sorts of
Grain, besides the Olive, and the Vine, and such
as love a hotter Climate. It is very fruitful, and
every thing springs quickly, but ripens slowly;
which is the effect of moist Grounds, and showry
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50009:224"/>
Heavens. This Country produces Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and other Metals, which defray the Charge
of their Conquest. The Sea breeds Pearl, not
very Orient, but pale and wan: Some suppose it
want of Skill in those that pick them up; for in
the Red Sea they are plucked from the Rock alive,
and breathing; but in <hi>Britain,</hi> they are gathered
as they lie about in the Sea: But, I believe, there
is more want of Worth in the Pearl than Skill, <hi>viz.</hi>
Greediness in them who gather 'em.</p>
            <p>XIII. The <hi>Britains</hi> suffer patiently the Levying
of Men and Money, and faithfully discharge all
Publick Employments imposed on them, if so be
they are not abused thereby, which to them is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
being at present subdued to Obedience,
but not to Vassalage. <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> altho' he first
made a Descent with his Army, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>righted the
People with a successful Battel, yet he possessed
himself of nothing but the Shoar, and seem'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to shew, than deliver them to Posterity. Now
the Civil Wars of <hi>Rome</hi> turned the Great Mens
Swords upon the Common-wealth, and <hi>Britain</hi>
was forgot, during a long Peace. <hi>Augustus,</hi> but
especially <hi>Tiberius,</hi> termed that Oblivion, State-Policy:
But 'tis certainly known, <hi>Caius</hi> had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to attack <hi>Britain,</hi> had he not been of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to resolve suddenly, and as suddenly to alter
his Resolution; or, had he not been disappointed
by the bad Success his Arms had in <hi>Germany;</hi> 'twas
<hi>Claudius</hi> who first effectually prosecuted its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
transporting Legions, and Auxiliaries, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50009:224"/>
taking <hi>Vespatian</hi> in to the Enterprize, which was
a Prelude to his future Greatness: Now it was,
that Countries were reduced, Kings captivated,
and <hi>Vespatian</hi> made known to the World.</p>
            <p>XIV. The first Lieutenant-General,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was <hi>Aulus
Plautius;</hi> the next, <hi>Ostorius Scapula,</hi> both great
Commanders: By degrees, the nearest Parts were
brought into the Form of a Province, where a
Colony of old Soldiers was planted. Some Cities
were bestowed on King <hi>Cogidunus</hi> (who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
faithful, even within our Memory), according
to an Ancient Practice of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who made
Kings the Instruments of the Peoples Slavery.
What others acquired, <hi>Didius Gallus</hi> preserved;
and by erecting a few Castles farther up in the
Country, sought to gain the Reputation of having
extended his Trust. <hi>Verantius</hi> followed <hi>Didius,</hi>
and died in a Year's time. After that, <hi>Suetonius
Paullinus</hi> was very successful for two Years, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
Nations, and fortifying Garisons; upon
Confidence of which, he was resolved to make an
Attempt on the Island <hi>Mona,</hi> that still furnished
the Rebels with fresh Supplies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XV. But this turning of his Back, gave the</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<hi>a fair Opportunity, whose Fear left them
with the Lieutenant-General; they had now lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to consider the Mischiefs of Bondage, and to
compare their Miseries, and be inflamed by their
reflecting upon them:</hi>—What was the Effect of
their Patien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, but to have heavier Burdens laid upon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50009:225"/>
their Shoulders, as if they were ready to bear any
thing? They had heretofore, but one King at a time,
but now they had two; a Lieutenant to be lavish of
their Lives, and a Procurator to make havock of their
Fortunes. Their Governour's Discord, or Concord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was equally pernicious to the Subject; vexed by the
Soldiers, and Centurions of the one, and the Force,
and Contumely of the other; nothing was exempted
from their Luxury and Lust: The Brave in Fight
should plunder, but now their Houses were become a
Prey to base ignoble Cowards, their Children forced
away, and Soldiers required of them, as if they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to die for their Country. If the <hi>Britains</hi> would
but Number themselves, they would find, how few of
their Soldiers, compared to them, had been brought
over: The <hi>Germans</hi> shook off their Yoke, who had
not the Ocean, but a River only for their Defence:
And, that they had the juster Cause of War, their
Country, Parents, and their Wives; whereas, their
Enemies had no pretence, but Avarice, and Luxury:
Would they but emulate their Ancestors, and not be
daunted at the Event of one or two Battles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that Men in Misery are apt to make the braver
Attempts, and to go on with the greater Perseverance,
they might make these their Enemies as hastily return,
as their Ancestors did their first Invader, <hi>Iulius,</hi>
by calling away the <hi>Roman</hi> General, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
him, and his banish'd Army, in another
Island, they had vanquished the greatest Difficulty,
which was to Consult; to which it may be added,
that it is more dangerous to be taken Plotting, than
Fighting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50009:225"/>
XVI. Having provok'd each other, by such
Discourses, and made <hi>Voadica,</hi> a Woman, their
Chief, no Sex being excluded the Government,
they, by Consent, made War together, pursuing
those dispersed in Garisons, taking their Forts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
their Colonies, as the Seat of Slavery and
Oppression: Neither did these conquering and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
Barbarians, omit any sort of Cruelty. If
<hi>Paulinus</hi> had not been acquainted with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
of the Province, and speedily sent help, <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
had been utterly lost; but the Success of one
Engagement, reduced it to its former Obedience
and Patience. A great many kept their Arms in
their Hands, being conscious of their own Guilt,
and fearful of the Lieutenant-General; who, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a Great Man, to revenge this particular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
behaved himself cruelly towards the poor
People that surrendred. <hi>Petronius Turpilianus</hi>
was sent, a Person more exorable, and less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with their Crimes, which made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Penitent with greater Mildness. When
he had composed these Differences, he delivered
up the Province to <hi>Trebellius Maximus;</hi> who being
a less active Man than his Predecessors, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Knowledge in Military Affairs, maintained his
Province by a gentle way of looking after it. The
<hi>Britains</hi> were so civil, as to pardon an Error so
grateful, and so easie to themselves. A Civil
War breaking out, gave just Excuse to his Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
But the Army began to mutiny; which,
having been used to Enterprize, now grew Loose
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50009:226"/>
for want of Action. <hi>Trebellius</hi> avoided their Fury
by Flight and Concealment, but lost his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
being forced to Govern precariously, as if it
had been agreed between him and the Army, that
he should live safely, provided they might live li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiously.
This Sedition cost no Blood. <hi>Vectius
Bolanus</hi> came in his room, but the Civil Wars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing,
he could not maintain Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
in <hi>Britain,</hi> the Army being alike careless of
the Enemy, and troublesome to the Superiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
in the Camp; but being a harmless Man, and
not having incurr'd any Ill-will by reason of any
Offence, he obtained Respect, instead of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>XVII. But now <hi>Vespatian</hi> having won the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of the World, and <hi>Britain,</hi> his Captains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Great, his Armies Famous, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Hopes little: <hi>Petilius Cerialis</hi> struck them
with a present Terror, by assaulting the City of
the <hi>Brigantines,</hi> which was esteemed the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
of the whole Province. And after many
sharp, and bloody Conflicts, he reduced and
wasted the greatest part of the Country. The
bright Reputation of <hi>Cerialis</hi> was enough to ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
the Diligence, and Glory of a Successor;
but <hi>Iulius Frontinus,</hi> a Man as great as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
would permit, sustained the Charge with
Honour, and Renown, overcoming the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Defiles, and Passes, and the Courage of
the Enemy; he subdued the stout and fighting
Nation of the <hi>Silures.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50009:226"/>
XVIII. <hi>Agricola</hi> passing over, in the middle of
Summer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound Affairs in this Posture, and these
to be the various Turns of War: The Souldiers
living securely, as if the Business of the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were over; and the Enemy as intently
watching all Advantages. The <hi>Ordovices</hi> just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his coming cut to pieces almost a Squadron of
Horse that lay in their Borders, with which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the rest were so elevated, that some, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of War, approved of the Example; others
staid to see the new Lieutenant's Resolution. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola,</hi>
tho' the Summer was almost spent, and
his Men dispersed up and down in the Country,
the Souldiers dreaming of nothing less than Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which things mightily cross'd, and retarded
his Warlike Designs: Nay, many thought it more
advisable, for the present, to guard the Places
suspected, resolved to meet the Danger, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together the Ensigns of the Legions, and some
few Auxiliars; the <hi>Ordovices</hi> not daring to come
on even Ground, he placed himself at their Head,
to inspire them with the same Courage, exposing
himself to the same Hazard, and made the Army
march and destroy almost the whole Nation;
knowing very well, that now was the time for
gaining a Reputation; for as things happen at the
first, so they continue, most commonly, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
He therefore was very intent upon the
Reduction of the Isle of <hi>Mona;</hi> which, as I have
related, <hi>Paulinus</hi> was forced to quit upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Defection of <hi>Britain.</hi> But as in dangerous
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50009:227"/>
Adventures, something is always wanting; so
now they had no Ships to transport their Men:
But <hi>Agricola,</hi> by his Contrivance, and Constancy,
carried them over. After they had laid aside
their Baggage; he chose the best, and most expert
of the Auxiliars, who understood all the Fords, and
were admirable Swimmers, and could manage
their Arms, themselves, and their Horses at once;
and in this manner poured them on their amazed
Enemies, who thought to have seen a Navy, and
Ships crossing the Sea, and not a War brought in
to their Country so miraculously: So that they
concluded nothing was difficult, or impregnable
to such bold Adventurers. Whereupon they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
supplicating for a Peace, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Island, <hi>Agricola</hi> began to be esteemed
a great, and valiant Commander. At his first
entring upon the Government, he applied that
Time, to Labour and Hazard, which others spent in
Shew and Complement: He did not let his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
prove fruitless; neither would he call, the
keeping the Vanquish'd in order, an Expedition,
or a Victory; he did not crown his Letters of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
with Laurels, but encreased the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Arms, by taking no notice of it, while
Men weighed with themselves, how great a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
he must have of Things to come, who was
so regardless of great Things already done.</p>
            <p>XIX. Being well acquainted with the Genius of his
Province, and having learnt, at other Mens Cost, that
Arms avail little towards the setling of a Peace,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50009:227"/>
if Injuries are permitted, he was resolved to root
out all Occasions of War: And what was to
some as difficult, as the Government of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
beginning with himself and Family, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his own House; he allowed no Bond or
Free Man to share in the Management of Affairs;
he let no Souldiers immediately attend his Person,
that were privately recommended by Friends, or
by the Praises, or Entreaties of the <hi>Centurions;</hi>
but he esteemed the best Souldier always the most
Faithful: He would be informed of all things,
tho' he did not punctually exact their Execution;
he applied Pardon to small Faults, and Punishment
to great Ones; he prudently chose those Officers,
that were likely to prove inoffensive, rather than
be put to the ungrateful Trouble of condemning
them, when Offenders: The Augmentation of
Tribute and Corn, he mitigated by an equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning
the Burden; and cut off all Extortion,
which was more grievous than the Imposition;
for they made a Iest of the poor People, who
were forced to wait at the Granaries, when lockt
up, and to buy Corn, which they must sell at a
Price: Several ways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and far distant Places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were
enjoyned by the proud Purveyors, that the Cities
should carry their Provisions, not to the nearest,
but farthest Camp, which was out of the way,
till that which was ready, and at hand for all, was
made the Advantage of a few.</p>
            <p>XX. The rectifing these Matters, in the first
Year of his Government, mightily recommended
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50009:228"/>
Peace, which before, by the Connivance, or Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of his Predecessors, was as dreadful as
War. As soon as it was Summer, he drew his
Army together, commended those that marched
orderly, but checkt the Straglers; he chose the
Places for encamping, and in Person, tried the
Bogs and Woods; he gave the Enemy no rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
never free from Incursions, and Ravage; when
he thought he had scared them enough, then he
would hold his hand, forbearing Acts of Hostility
to sweeten them to a Peace. These Methods of
proceeding, wrought so upon many Cities, which,
till that time had stood upon equal Terms with
him; that they, laying aside their Animosity, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
submitted, giving Hostages, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Garisons and Forts, to inviron them;
which was done with so much Care and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that no part before of the <hi>Roman</hi> new
Conquest in <hi>Britain,</hi> was free from the frequent
Insults of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>XXI. The ensuing Year was spent in wholesome
Councels, to bring this Rough and Warlike Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
living dispersed, and ready to take Arms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Occasions, to Peace and Quietness, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the Pleasures thereof: In order to which,
he privately exhorted, and publickly joyned with
them to build Temples, Houses, and Seats of free
Iustice, praising the Forward, repremanding the
Backward; which bred in them such an Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Honour, that did as much as Compulsion.
Then he took care to have the Sons of the Princes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50009:228"/>
instructed in the Liberal Arts and Sciences; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
their Wit, and Capacity, before the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of the <hi>French:</hi> So that they, who just before,
scorned the <hi>Roman</hi> Language, now studied their
Eloquence, and had their Garb in Esteem, the
Gown being frequently worn; by degrees, they
past to the Softness of their Vices, erecting Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico's,
costly Baths, and making sumptuous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments;
which sad and certain Badges of
Slavery, the Ignorant termed good Breeding.</p>
            <p>XXII. The third Year of the Expedition dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
new Nations, wasting the Country as far
as an Arm of the Sea, called <hi>Taus,</hi> which so inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated
the Enemy, that they did not dare to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
an Army, harass'd with Tempests; which
gave the <hi>Romans</hi> time to build Forts and Castles,
as they pleased. The best Iudges of War, made
it their Observation, that no General chose his
Ground with more Prudence, or built Castles bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
secured, than <hi>Agricola;</hi> never any being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
or delivered up upon Capitulation, or deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Fear; they made frequent Incursions, and
were furnished with yearly Provisions, to sustain
a Siege; the Winter-Quarters were secure, every
Garison being its own Protection: The Enemies
endeavours were so frustrated, that they despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as formerly, by Reprizals in Winter, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
their Losses in Summer; for they were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repulsed in both Seasons. <hi>Agricola</hi> never poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intercepted the Glory of an Action, due to an
inferior Officer, but faithfully attested his Merit.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50009:229"/>
Some thought him too bitter in rebuking; but as
he was severe to the Bad, so he was mild to the
Good: He never was malicious, tho' angry; there
was no fear of his Reservedness, or Silence; he
thought it was more honest to offend, than hate.</p>
            <p>XXIII. The fourth Summer was passed in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
what he had acquired: And if the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of the Army, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Glory would
have permitted, this had been the Bounds of their
Conquest in <hi>Britain. Glota</hi> and <hi>Bodotria,</hi> two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Arms of the Sea, being carried up into the
Continent, are only separated by a Neck of Land,
which was then guarded by a Garison; so that
the <hi>Romans</hi> were absolute Lords of all on this
side, driving the Enemy, as it were, into another
Island.</p>
            <p>XXIV. <hi>Agricola</hi> passed over in the first Ship,
and after several prosperous Encounters, subdued
Countries never before known. In that Part of
<hi>Britain,</hi> that looks towards <hi>Ireland,</hi> he quartered
his Forces, not out of any apprehension of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but hope of Advantage; <hi>Ireland</hi> lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and very commodiously
for <hi>France,</hi> would have united the strongest Parts
of the Empire, to their mutual Convenience. If
you compare <hi>Ireland</hi> with <hi>Britain,</hi> 'tis much less,
but far bigger than any of the Islands of our Sea:
The Climate, the Nature, the Fashion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
are not much differing from the <hi>British:</hi>
Their Ports are commodious, and their Entrance
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50009:229"/>
secure; very well understood by Trading Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.
<hi>Agricola</hi> entertained a petty Prince of
that Country, driven out of his Dominions by his
rebellious Subjects: He kept him fast with him,
under Pretence of Friendship, but it was indeed,
to serve his own Turn upon occasion. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
heard him say, That with one Legion, and a
moderate Force of Auxiliars, all <hi>Ireland</hi> might
easily be reduced; and that it would be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
against <hi>Britain,</hi> to have it sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounded by
the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms, and its Liberty out of sight.</p>
            <p>XXV. In the Summer of the sixth Year of his
Imployment, being apprehensive of a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of all the Kingdoms beyond <hi>Bodotria,</hi>
and suspecting all the ways to be infested by the
Enemy, he examined all the Ports with his Fleet,
which was now made part of his Military
Strength; and following, made a gallant Shew,
at once a War coming upon the Enemy by Land,
and Sea: The Horse, and Foot, and Mariners
frequently incamped together, and mixing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and Mirth, would alternately boast their
Exploits, and Adventures; the Land-men telling
what tall Woods they had pass'd, and high
Mountains they had climb'd; the Sea-men, how
they had been toss'd and shatter'd by Waves and
Tempests; one vaunting their Victory over the
Earth, and Man, the other over the proud Ocean.
As I have been informed, the <hi>Britains</hi> were quite
dejected at the Sight of our Fleet; we having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
them of the last Refuge of the Vanquished,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50009:230"/>
by discovering their Sea, hitherto unknown. The
Inhabitants of <hi>Caledonia</hi> resolving upon Arms and
War, with great Preparations, and greater Noise,
Things unknown being more in report than real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and assaulting our Castles, began to make us
afraid of them, as Men us'd to be of Aggressors;
the Fearful to cover their want of Courage, gave
prudent Advice, perswading him to retreat to the
other side of <hi>Bodotria,</hi> rather than be forced: But
being informed, the Enemy would fall on him,
in several Parties, he marched with his Army, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into three Bodies, that he might not be
enclosed by their Superior Numbers, or disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged,
by their better Knowledge of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>XXVI. Which, when the Enemy perceived,
they suddenly changed their Designs; and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Night, broke in upon the Ninth,
the most feeble Legion, killing the Centinels, and
surprizing the Camp; the Men being all asleep,
or amaz'd with fear; and now the Fight was
brought within the Trenches: But <hi>Agricola</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
learned by his Spies, which way the Enemy
marched, followed them at the Heels, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the foremost of the Horse and Foot, to
fall on their Rear: The whole Army was to
make a general Shout; and at Day-break, the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Ensigns appeared. In this Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lict, the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
Courage abated, and the <hi>Romans</hi> returned,
not fighting for Safety, but Glory and Honour.
Now the <hi>Romans</hi> were Aggressors; there was a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50009:230"/>
cruel Fight in the narrow Gates of the Camp, 'till
the Enemy was routed, one part of the Army
contending to bring Succour, the other fighting,
to shew they did not want it: If the Fens and the
Woods had not hid them in their flight, we had
ended the War, by gaining this Victory.</p>
            <p>XXVII. Upon the fighting this Battle so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
and the winning of it so bravely, the
Army grew fierce and bold, presuming nothing
could resist their Courage: They cried out, to be
led into <hi>Caledonia,</hi> that by a continued Series of
Victories, they might be brought to the utmost
Limits of <hi>Britain:</hi> And our late cautious, and
wise Counsellors began to speak big, and to be
very daring, now the Danger was over. This is
the unjust Condition of War, that all claim their
Share in good Success, but bad is imputed but to
one: The <hi>Britains</hi> supposing themselves defeated,
not by the Courage of their Adversaries, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of their General, who had watched his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
abated nothing of their Arrogance,
but listed the stoutest Men they had, and carried
their Wives and Children to Places of the greatest
Security. The Cities con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ederated together, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
frequently, and by Religious Rites, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
up Sacrifices, confirmed their Associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And thus both Armies parted with equal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimosity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50009:231"/>
XXVIII. This Summer there was a horrid, but
memorable Fact, committed by a Troop of <hi>Vsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi>
raised in <hi>Germany,</hi> for our Service in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi>
who having slain the Centurion, and some
Souldiers, put over their Parties, and mixed with
them for their Example and Government, they
seized three small Vessels, compelling the Masters
to execute their Office; but only one discharging
his Duty, they kill'd the rest, as suspected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
It not being yet discovered, they miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
set out; but by and by, they were toss'd
hither and thither, and had several Encounters
with the <hi>Britains,</hi> who defended their own, in
which they sometimes were worsted, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
had the better; but at la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to that Extremity, that they had no Food
to sustain them, but the Infirm; when they were
spent, they cast Lots who should be kill'd, for
the Provision of the Rest. Thus roving about
<hi>Britain,</hi> they lost their Ships, for want of Skill to
sail them, and being taken for Pirates, they were
first intercepted by the <hi>Suevians,</hi> and the <hi>Frisans,</hi>
and were bought and sold, till at last in Tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fick,
they came on our side of the River, which fully
discovered the whole Adventure. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Summer, <hi>Agricola</hi> had a severe Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in his Family, the Loss of his Son, born
the Year before; he did not, like some Great Men,
vent his Sorrow vain-gloriously, or express his
Concern in an effeminate Lamentation, but made
War the Diversion of his Grief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50009:231"/>
XXIX. Therefore sending his Fleet before,
which plundred many Places, the Enemy was
struck with a great and perplex'd Fear; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Army ready, to which he had joyned the
bravest, and by a long Peace, well assured <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
he marched to the Hill <hi>Grampius,</hi> which
the <hi>Britains</hi> had possessed; who were not in the
least daunted with their former Defeat, knowing
now they had nothing to expect but Revenge, or
Slavery; and having learned, that Common Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was to be repulsed by Concord: The Cities,
by sending Ambassadors, had united their Force,
and entred into a strict League of Defence: Now
they had an Army of about Thirty thousand
fighting Men, and the Youth of the Country dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
came in to them, with such Old Men as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
lusty and strong, every one telling his old
and past Exploits: But <hi>Galgacus</hi> was preferr'd for
his high Birth, and great Virtue, who made a
Speech to this vast Multitude, earnestly desiring
Battle:</p>
            <p>XXX. <q>As o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ten as I revolve in my Mind, the
Cause and Necessity of this War, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that this Day, and your unanimous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
will be the beginning of the <hi>British</hi>
Liberty. We are all sensible of Slavery, we
have no Land, or Sea, left secure, the <hi>Roman</hi>
Fleet riding on our Coasts. To take Arms,
and Fight, as it is honourable for the Brave, so
it is safest for the Coward. Our former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50009:232"/>
with the <hi>Romans</hi> were various in their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
yet we had Hopes, and a Reserve still in
our own Power: For we, the Flower of the
<hi>British</hi> Nation, and therefore seated in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost
Recess, never beheld the slavish Shoars,
nor had our Eyes violated with the Prospect of a
Foreign Government: For this little Corner has
preserved us the small Remains of our Country
and Liberty: But now the Bounds of <hi>Britain</hi> are
discovered, and to attempt what is unknown,
is reputed great. We have no Nation behind
us, but a raging Sea, and sensless Rocks: The
<hi>Romans</hi> are in the Bowels of our Country, whose
Pride you vainly seek to evade, by Modesty and
Submission. They are the Rapparees of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse;
when Lands are wanting, they ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le
the Ocean. If their Enemy is rich, they are
covetous; if poor, ambitious: So that neither
<hi>East</hi> nor <hi>West,</hi> can satisfie their unruly Passions:
They are the only greedy Men, that with equal
Avarice, make Wealth and Poverty their Prey:
To kill, plunder, bear-away, they call by the
false<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Name of Empire, and Desolation they
term a setled Peace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>XXXI. <q>Nature commands us all to hold our
Children and Relations dear; these are pressed,
carried somewhere to be Slaves. Our Wives
and Sisters are not ravished in a hostile Manner,
but they are deluded and debauched, under the
specious Pretence of Frienpship and Hospitality.
Our Estates are wasted in paying Tribute, our
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50009:232"/>
Corn in supplying the Army with Provisions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Our Bodies and Hands are worn out, partly by
Stripes, and partly by Contempt, while we are
set to work on Bogs and Woods. They that
are born Slaves, are sold but once, and then
maintained at the Charge of the Purchasers; but
<hi>Britain</hi> daily buys and maintains its own Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
As in a private Family, new Servants
are always a Laughing-stock to the old; so in
this old Family of the Universe, we being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovered, and vile, are sought out for Scorn
and Destruction. There are no Fields, no Mines,
no Ports, for which we may be reserved to Till,
to Dig, to Trade in. The Gallantry of Subjects
is very distasteful to their Lords; and yet Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and Privacy, as it is most safe, is more
suspected. Having lost all Hopes of Pardon,
let us act as Men that hold their Liberty, as
well as their Glory, dear. The <hi>Brigantes,</hi> led
by a Woman, burnt their Colony, and took
their Forts; and, if Success had not made them
careless, had broke their Yoke. We are, as
yet, entire, unsubdued, born to be free, and
not the Vassals of proud <hi>Rome.</hi> We'll let them
see at our first Meeting, what Men <hi>Calidonia</hi> has
reserved 'till last.</q>
            </p>
            <p>XXXII. <q>D'ye think, the <hi>Romans</hi> Prowess in
War, equals their Licentiousness in Peace? No,
they are made great by our intestine Discord and
Dissentions; they make their Enemies Faults,
the Glory of their Army, composed of several
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50009:233"/>
Nations, which Prosperity keeps together, and
Adversity will disband; unless the <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Germans,</hi> and, what I blush to say, some <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
too, are foolishly lavish of their Blood, to
establish Usurpation. It cannot be conceived,
that Enemies will continue longer Faithful and
Affectionate than Servants, the feeble Bonds of
their Love, are Fear and Terror; if they are
once removed, they'll streight begin to hate
those they cease to dread. All the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Victory are on our side; the <hi>Romans</hi>
have no Wives to raise their Courage, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to upbraid their Flight; they have either
no Country to defend; or, if they have, 'tis ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
These few, but fearful Men, distracted
by their Ignorance, casting their Eyes on our
strange Heavens, Earth, and Woods, the Gods,
at last propitious, have, in a manner, delivered
into our Hands, pent up, and bound. Ne'r
fear the gaudy Terror of their glittering Gold,
and Silver, that neither can defend or hurt.
We shall have Troops marching, even, in their
very Army. The <hi>Britains</hi> will remember,
sure, their Country's Cause; nor can the <hi>French</hi>
forget their former Liberty. Like the <hi>Vsipian</hi>
Cohort, the <hi>Germans</hi> will desert. We have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to fear; their Garisons are drained;
their Colonies are made up of Old Men, some
refusing to Obey, and others Commanding ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically,
while their Towns are at Difference
and Discord among themselve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Here is the
General, and the Army, their Tribute, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50009:233"/>
Mines, with other sorts of Miseries, the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Slaves, which you must suffer for ever,
or revenge on this Spot; therefore going to
fight, remember your Ancestors, and pity your
Posterity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>XXXIII. They received this Speech with Ioy,
Singing, and Shouting, and making different
Noises, according to the rude Custom of their
Country. And as the Troops came together,
and the glittering Armour appeared, some of the
Hottest advanced forward, and both Armies were
putting in Order. <hi>Agricola,</hi> altho' his Soldiers
were very joyful, and scarce to be restrained
by Advice, supposed it best to say something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they engaged:</p>
            <p>
               <q>In eight Years time, Fellow-Soldiers, by your
Pains, Fidelity, and Valour, and the auspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Fortune of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, you have
conquered <hi>Britain.</hi> In so many Expeditions
and bloody Battels, there was need of your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Patience to encounter opposing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as well as Resolution to resist the Enemy.
As I do not repent my having you for my Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
so, I hope, you do not your having me
for your Leader. I have surpassed the Limits
of our ancient Generals, and you the Bounds of
preceding Armies. We do not possess the End
of <hi>Britain</hi> by Fame and Report, but have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
seized it with our Arms and Pavilions: <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
is found and subdued. I have often heard
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50009:234"/>
the Brave cry out, when you were fatigued with
Bogs and Hills, and Rivers, in your March,
When shall we have an Enemy? When shall we
fight? They now appear forced from their lurking
Holes, and you enjoy your Wish, and a fit Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
for your Valour. All Things will be prone,
and yield to us, if Victors; but cross, and adverse,
if vanquished: For, as to have finished such tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Iourneys, to have evaded such great Woods,
and crost so many Arms of the Sea, is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and becoming, if we go on; so if we turn
our Backs, that which was our Advantage, will
prove our Danger. We have not their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Country, or the same Provisions for
the Army: But we have Swords and Hands,
and in them we have All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am very well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
Flight is neither safe for the General, nor
the Army; an honourable Death far excels a
mean ignoble Life; Safety and Honour dwell
together. But it cannot be inglorious to fall on
the utmost Confines of Earth and Nature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>XXXIV. <q>If you had new Nations, and an
untried Foe, I would make the Deeds of other
Armies an Argument for your Courage: But
now reflect on your own Exploits, interrogate
your own Eyes; they are the same, who by
Stealth, and under the Covert of the Night, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
the Ninth Legion, and were routed by
a blast of your Breath; they are the most apt to
run of all the <hi>Britains,</hi> for which Reason, they
are now alive. When we Travel the Wild Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50009:234"/>
we chase away the sturdy Monsters of the
Wood, with Force and Violence, but the Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Herd flies at the Noise of every Passenger;
so the most daring <hi>Britains</hi> are long since dead,
these are but base, ignoble Numbers, whom
you have found, not because they have resolved
to fight, but because they are the last you have
overtook; their Bodies are fixed with excessive
Fear to the Ground, o'er which you'll gain a
fair and signal Victory. Put an end to your
Expeditions, and let this Day finish the Work
of fifty Years, convince the Commonwealth,
that neither the Length of the War, nor any
Excuses for not making an end of it, can be
charged upon the Army.</q>
            </p>
            <p>XXXV. Whilst he was speaking, their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
was visible; when he had ended, they freely
vented their Ioy, running to their Weapons. As
they were thus fired, and rushing forwards, he
put them in order; Eight Thousand Foot he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the Middle, and Three Thousand Horse
in the two Wings; the Legions he placed before
the Trenches, thinking it would mightily add to
his Glory, if he could gain a Victory, without
the Effusion of <hi>Roman</hi> Blood; or at least keep
them as a Reserve, in case of a Repulse: The <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
drew up their Army on the higher Ground,
most for shew and Terror, but so as the foremost
Battalions stood on the Level, the rest rising one
above another with the Hill; the Chariots and
Horsemen fill'd the middle part of the Field with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50009:235"/>
their din and clatter, whirling up and down. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola,</hi>
perceiving their Numbers to be Superior,
that he might not be charged at once in Flank and
Front, widened his Ranks, so that his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more thin, as well as more extended: Some
advised him to make the Legions advance; but
he, being always ready to hope, and resolute in
Danger, alighted from his Horse, and placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Foot before the Ensigns.</p>
            <p>XXXVI. The Fight began at a distance, which
the <hi>Britains</hi> managed with great Constancy, and
Cunning, avoiding, or putting by whatever was
cast at 'em, with their short Bucklers, and great
Swords; but poured upon us a Shower of Darts,
till <hi>Agricola</hi> encouraged three <hi>Batavian</hi> Cohorts,
and two Tungrians, to bring them to Sword's
Point, and Handy-blows, which they were well
verss'd in, being old Soldiers: But that was
no way of fighting for the <hi>Britains,</hi> who wore
little Shields, and great Swords, without Points,
so that they were not fitted for a close, or open
Fight. Whilst the <hi>Batavians</hi> dealt Blows, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them with the Bosses of their Bucklers, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and bruising their Faces, and thrusting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
aside, who upon even Ground opposed their
Passage, advanced up the Hill; the other Cohorts,
with a joynt Emulation and Force, slew all near
them; but many times, to hasten the Victory,
they left Men half dead, others untouched, behind
them: In the mean time, the Horse fled, and the
Chariots mingling with the Foot, gave a new
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50009:235"/>
Terror, but their Carier was stopped by the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Ground, and close Ranks. It did not in the
least look like a Horse-Fight, for keeping their
Ground, they bear down all before them, by the
Weight of their Horses; wandring Chariots with
frighted Horses, but no Drivers, over-run Friend
and Foe, as they through fear cross'd, or met
them.</p>
            <p>XXXVII. The <hi>Britains,</hi> who were on the Tops
of the Hills, and had not yet any Share in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
being free, and at leisure, disdained our
small Force, and began to descend by degrees, and
had enclosed our prevailing Troops, if <hi>Agricola,</hi>
suspecting the Design, had not detached four
Squadrons of Horse, which were kept for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
to oppose them; who made them flie as
fast as they came to assault; so they were caught
in their own Trap: Some Squadrons, who fought
in the Front, were commanded to leave the Fight,
and to pursue those that were put to flight. There
was a dismal Spectacle in the open Plains, where
you might see our Men following, wounding, and
taking some, killing others, when fresh offered
themselves: Now, whole Regiments fled as they
thought most convenient, and turned their Backs
to a far less Number of their Pursuers: Some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and disarmed, rushed on the Sword's Point,
and offered themselves voluntarily to Death: All the
Field was strewed with Weapons, and Limbs, and
dead Bodies, and the Earth was dyed with Blood;
many, tho' expiring, retained their Fierceness and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50009:236"/>
Courage. As soon as they approached the Woods,
they turned and encompassed their forward Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers,
wholly ignorant of the Ways: And if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola,</hi>
who was always present, had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the stoutest, but lightest Cohorts, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass
them like a Tyle, making some of the
Horse dismount, to search the thickest, whilst the
rest scoured the thinnest parts of the Wood, they
had suffered extreamly by their Confidence: But
as soon as they perceived they were followed by
our Men, marching regularly, and in good order,
they all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led, not in Troops as before, having an
Eye to each other, but separate and dispersed,
every one taking such Path or By-way for his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
as his Fear directed; 'twas Night and
Weariness ended our Pursuit: The Enemies Loss
was computed to be Ten thousand, ours but
Three hundred and forty Men, amongst whom
was <hi>Aulus Atticus,</hi> a Captain of a Cohort, who
by his youthful Heat, and unruly Horse, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into the midst of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>XXXVIII. The Night was joyful to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
full of Booty and Gladness; the scattered
<hi>Britains,</hi> Men and Women, dragged along the
Wounded, called upon the Unhurt, and Strong,
left their Houses, and burnt them in a Rage,
then they sought Hiding-places, and as soon quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them: Sometimes they consulted together,
and began to have fresh Hopes; now and then
they were dejected at the Sight of their dear
Pledges, but more frequently enraged; so that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50009:236"/>
many, to express their brutal Kindness, to their
Wives and Children, slew them out of pure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.
The next Day made a fuller Discovery
of our Victory; all Things were silent, the
Mountains desolate, the Houses burning, and
smoaking, afar off, and our Scouts met No-body
when they were sent out, or descried any thing,
but the uncertain Track of their Flight; the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
appeared no-where in Companies; and the
Summer being spent, we could not extend the
War: Therefore <hi>Agricola,</hi> led our Men into the
Borders of the <hi>Horrestians,</hi> where receiving Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages,
he commanded the Admiral of the Fleet
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ail round <hi>Britain;</hi> some of his Men going
aboard, and the Terror of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding.
<hi>Agricola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> marched the Horse and Foot
gently through the new Conquest, that the
slowness of his Motion might strike them with a
Fear; and so he put his Army into Winter-Quarters;
and his Fleet having a good and a
happy Voyage, arrived at the Port <hi>Trutilensis;</hi>
from whence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ailing along the nearest side of
<hi>Britain,</hi> returned thither again.</p>
            <p>XXXIX. <hi>Agricola,</hi> by Letter, certified the
true State of Affairs, without any vaunting Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
or pompous Words; which <hi>Domitian,</hi>
according to his Custom, received with a sad
Heart, and a joyful Countenance: He was
conscious of his own ridiculous sham Triumph
over <hi>Germany,</hi> his Captives being the Purchase
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50009:237"/>
of Money, not of Blood, and were trimmed and
and cloathed artificially for the Mock-Solemnity:
But here was a Victory celebrated by the whole
World, and obtained by the Slaughter of many
thousands. It was a terrible Mortification to see
his Glory eclipsed by a Subject: He had in vain
laid aside the Study of Eloquence and Political
Arts, if a private Hand snatched from him the
Military Laurel, other Disgraces might easily be
dissembled, but this was an Ornament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it for no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
but a Prince to wear; being continually vexed
with such Thoughts, he was often alone in his
Closet, a shrewd Sign of some intended Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
but he judged it best to sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
till <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Fame, and the Armies Love
was abated. <hi>Agricola</hi> was still Governour of
<hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XL. Therefore, he ordered some Triumphal
Ornaments, and the Honour of an Illustrious
Statue, and commanded in the Senate, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was usual to compleat, and set forth a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
should be appointed. And all this he did
in the highest Strain of Complement: He made all
People believe, that <hi>Syria</hi> should be <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
then void by the Death of <hi>Rufus</hi> the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and always reserved for the best Men. Many
believed, that his freed Man, who used to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his most secret Commands, was sent to him
with a Commission for <hi>Syria,</hi> with this Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That he should deliver it, if he found him in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50009:237"/>
               <hi>Britain,</hi> and that meeting him, as he was cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Sea, he neither delivered that, or his
Message, but returned to <hi>Domitian:</hi> But it is
doubtful, whether this be a Truth, or a Report
cast abroad by the Artifice of the Prince. <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,</hi>
in the mean while, gave up the Province
quietly to his Successor: And that his Entrance
might not be remarkable for the Resort, or Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of People that came out to meet him,
he avoided the Civility of his Friends, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
according to Order, to the City and
Court by Night, where he was received with a
short Salutation, and no Discourse, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
retired into the Herd of Attendants. Now,
to the end that he might lessen his Military Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
a thing uneasie to the Slothful, with other
good Qualities, he allowed himself more Ease and
Quiet, being sober in his Garb, familiar in his
Speech, and never going, but with one or two
of his Friends; so that many, who were wont
to judge of Great Men, by their Pomp and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
were at a loss, being mightily disappointed
when they saw <hi>Agricola,</hi> few understanding the
Secret of his Management.</p>
            <p>XLI. In those Days he was often accused and
absolved when absent: His Crimes were not the
Cause of his Danger, nor the Complaints of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured;
but a Prince displeased with his good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the Honour of the Man, and the worst of all
Enemies, his Commenders. Now there ensued such
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50009:238"/>
unhappy Times, that would not permit <hi>Agricola</hi> to
pass his Life in Silence: For so many Armies had
been lost in <hi>Mesia, Datia, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Pannonia,</hi> by
the Temerity, or Ignorance of the Generals; so
many Cohorts, and gallant Men, defeated and
taken, that 'twas not the Bank of a River, or
the Limits of the Empire, but even our Winter-Quarters,
and what we were in possession of,
that was in a dangerous Condition: Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a continued Series of Misfortunes, and
every Year being signalized by some Calamity,
or Destruction, <hi>Agricola</hi> was call'd for to be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
by the common Voice of all, comparing
his Constancy, Vigour, and Military Experience,
with the Ignorance, Pusillanimity of others. 'Tis
certain these Discourses frequently reached <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>'s
Ears, 'till his best Friends, out of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the bad out of Envy and Malice, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up their Prince, of himself prone to make
the worst of Things: So that <hi>Agricola,</hi> by his
own Virtues, and the Vices of others, was hurried
to Glory.</p>
            <p>XLII. This Year, a new Pro-Consul of <hi>Asia,</hi>
and <hi>Africa,</hi> was to be chosen, <hi>Civica</hi> being lately
slain. <hi>Agricola</hi> did not want Advice, nor <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
an Example: Some who were acquainted
with the Prince's Mind, came to him, and asked
him, If he would accept of that Province? And
at first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aintly commended a private Life, then
proffered him their Service to get him excused;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50009:238"/>
but at last no longer palliating the Matter, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
perswading, sometimes threatning him,
they pull'd him to <hi>Domitian;</hi> who, with a Set
Hypocrisie, and Majestick Arrogance, hears his
Request, and Excuse; to which, when he had
yielded, he graciously suffered himself to be
Thank'd, never blushing at so abusive a Favour.
But the Salary usually offered to Persons of that
Quality, and granted to many Others, he never
gave to <hi>Agricola;</hi> either being angry 'twas not
requested, or being sensible, that he should look
as if he had paid for what he was against. It is
the Property of Human Nature, to hate those
they injure; but <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Nature, prone to
Anger, which the more concealed, was the
harder to be appeased. <hi>Agricola,</hi> made Mild and
Gentle by his Prudence and Moderation, for he
never by Contumacy, or a vain Ostentation of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought Fame, or tried his Fortune; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let those know, who are fond of Things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
that Good Men may live under Bad Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and that Modesty and Submission, joyn'd
with Vigour and Industry, will acquire that
Glory, which Others seeking by indirect Ways,
not in the least serviceable to the Commonwealth,
grow only famous by that Death, which their
Ambition brings them to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:50009:239"/>
XLIII. <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Death was lamentable to his
Relations, sad to his Friends, and a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to Strangers, and Persons unknown. The
Common People, and such as were here upon
their Diversion, wou'd visit his House, and speak
of him in all Publick Meetings: Neither did any
body that heard of his Death, either rejoyce at it,
or soon forget it; but that which increased their
Commiseration, was a Report of his being poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd,
which I cannot affirm: But it is certain, all
the time of his Sickness, <hi>Domitian</hi>'s chief Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and most trusty Physician, came to him
oftner than is usual for a Prince to send him, as
from himself, on a Visit, which was great Care,
or Inquisitiveness. On the last Day of his Life,
every Moment he was expiring, was signified by
Posts, laid ready for the purpose; and No-body
thought they were in haste to hear that News, for
which they would be sorry. But <hi>Domitian</hi> put
on a sad Countenance, and being free from what
he hated, he found it an easier Matter to dissemble
his Ioy now, than formerly his Fear: But it is
certain, when <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Will was read, in which
he made him a Co-heir with his Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he rejoyced exceedingly, as if it had been an
Act of Iudgment and Respect, being so blinded
by continual Flattery, as not to know, a Good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
never made any Prince, but a Bad one, his
Heir.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:50009:239"/>
XLIV. <hi>Agricola</hi> was born on the Thirteenth
Day of <hi>Iune, Caius Caesar</hi> being the third time
Consul, and died on the Twenty-fourth Day of
<hi>September,</hi> in the Fifty-sixth Year of his Age, <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lega,</hi>
and <hi>Priscus,</hi> Consuls. If Posterity would
have a Description of his Person, he was well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd,
but not tall; in his Countenance was
nothing of Fear, but a great deal of Sweetness, so
that you would easily guess him a Good Man, and
as readily a Great Man. Tho' he was snatched
away in the midst of the strongest part of Man's
Life, yet by reason of the Honour he had gained,
he lived to a great Age; for he had arrived to the
true Worth, which consists of Virtuous Actions;
and having been Dignified with Triumphal and
Consular Ornament, What cou'd Fortune give
him more? He did not desire immoderate Riches;
but he had a plentiful Estate. In this he was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
that he had a Wife, a Daughter, and in that
he escaped future Calamities by his Death, at a
time when his Honour was untainted, his Name
flourished, and his Relations and Friends were all
prosperous: For, as he did foretel, and desire to
live in this Happy Age, and to see <hi>Trajan</hi> Prince,
so he had this great Solace, of his sudden Death,
that he avoided the Last Times, in which <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
not by Intervals, or short Pauses, but, as it
were, at one continued Blow, destroyed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:50009:240"/>
XLV. For <hi>Agricola</hi> did not see the Senate-house
beset, the Senate encompass'd with Arms, a great
many of Consular Dignity massacred, and Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of honourable Women, forced to Flight
and Banishment, by the same Outrage. <hi>Carus
Metius,</hi> yet, had obtained but one Victory; <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salinus</hi>'s
Sentence only made a Noise in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>Albana;</hi> and <hi>Messa Bebius</hi> was but then
accused: But by and by, we carried <hi>Helvidius</hi> to
Prison; the Sight of <hi>Mauricius,</hi> and <hi>Rusticus,</hi>
wounded our Hearts; and <hi>Senecio</hi> sprinkled us
with his Blood: <hi>Nero</hi> withdrew, and would not
behold those Cruelties he commanded. But the
chiefest part of our Misery, was to see, and to be
seen, under <hi>Domitian,</hi> while our very Sighs and
Groans were Registred, and while he was able to
behold the Paleness and Fear of so many Persons,
with a stern Countenance, and Face Red against
all Shame and Blushing. O, <hi>Agricola!</hi> thou art
happy, not only in a famous Life, but a well-timed
Death! As they tell us, who heard your
last and dying Words, You with great Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Willingness, submitted to your Fate, and
did all that you could, to bequeath Innocence to
your Prince: But that which increases mine, and
your Daughter's Grief, besides the sharp Affliction
of the Loss of you, her Parent, is, that we did
not attend you when sick, cherish you when
fainting, and satisfie our longing Eyes and Arms,
in beholding and embracing you. Had we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50009:240"/>
your Commands, they had been for ever
imprinted in our Minds; this is the greatest
Wound, the most pungent Grief, that by a long
and unhappy Absence, we lost you four Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you died. I do not doubt, but the tenderest
Mother, the most loving Wife, who constantly
attended your sick Bed, supplied you with all
Things proper for your Quality; but you was laid
out with fewer Tears, and your closing Eyes seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to want some desired Object, they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have taken in with their last Glance.</p>
            <p>XLVI. If there is a proper Seat for the
Good, and as Wise Men tell us, Great Souls do
not perish with their Bodies, may you enjoy an
undisturbed Rest, and recal us of your Family
from weak Desires, and effeminate Lamentations,
to contemplate your Virtues, not to be celebrated
by Weeping and Wailing: This is the truest Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
your nearest Relations can shew you; this
I would enjoyn your Wife and Daughter, the one
to honour the Memory of her Husband, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of her Father, by a frequent Revolving in
their Minds his Noble Acts; not that I would
prohibit the use of Brass or Marble Statues,
which are as frail and mortal as Men; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Form of the Mind, cannot be enjoyed,
or represented, by gross Matter, or human Art,
but by copying it out in one's Life; whatever we
loved, or admired in <hi>Agricola</hi> remains, and will
continue in the Minds of Men, as long as Time,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50009:241"/>
or Fame, shall last. When many of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
below the Dignity of a Memorial, are
buried in Oblivion, <hi>Agricola</hi> shall survive in
Story.</p>

OF
GERMANY.</head>
            <byline>By CAIUS CORNELIUS TACITUS.</byline>
            <p>ALL <hi>Germany</hi> is separated from the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the

                  </gap>ans,</hi> by the Rivers <hi>Rhine</hi>
and the <hi>Danube;</hi> from the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
by a mutual Dread of Invading each other, or
impassable high Mountains: The rest of it the Sea sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds,
containing spacious Bays and vast Islands; and
'tis but of late that some Nations and Kings have come
to our Knowledge, which the War discover'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rhine</hi> rises from an inaccessible and steep Pick of
the <hi>Rhoetian Alps,</hi> with a small bowing inclining to the
<hi>West,</hi> intermixes with the <hi>Northern</hi> Ocean. The <hi>Danube,</hi>
gushing out from the easie and gently-rising top of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50009:243"/>
Mountain <hi>Abnoba,</hi> passes through many Countries, till
it discharges itself in six Branches into the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea;
the seventh is swallow'd up in the Marshes.</p>
            <p>I should fancy the <hi>Germans</hi> to be Natives, and not all
intermix'd by the Arrival and Entertainments of other
Nations; because those who formerly transplanted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were not convey'd by Land, but by Shipping; and
moreover, the immense and opposite Ocean, as I may
call it, is touch'd upon with few Ships from our
World; for, who, besides the Danger of a rough and
unknown Sea, abandoning <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> would
inhabit <hi>Germany,</hi> a shapeless Land, the Climate unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
melancholy to the View, and uncultivated, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
his own Country?</p>
            <p>They celebrate in ancient Poesie, (which is the only
Method of the Records and Annals amongst them) That
the God <hi>Tuisto,</hi> sprung from the Earth, and his Son <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
were the Original and Founders of that Nation. To
<hi>Mannus</hi> they ascribe three Sons, from whose names those
bordering upon the Ocean are stil'd, <hi>Ingaevones;</hi> those of
the Midland, <hi>Herminones;</hi> the rest, <hi>Istaevones.</hi> But some
taking License from Antiquity, affirm, That more are
descended from that God, and, that there are more
Denominations of that Kingdom, the <hi>Marsi, Gambrivi,
Suevi, Vandali;</hi> and, that these are the true and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Names; but, that the word <hi>Germany</hi> is new, and
lately given, because those who first pass'd the <hi>Rhine</hi>
and expell'd the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ls,</hi> were but now term'd <hi>Tungri,</hi> and
then <hi>Germans:</hi> So that the Name of a Party, not of a
whole Country, by degrees prevail'd, that all at first,
for fear of the Conqueror, presently after having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
a Name, were from themselves call'd <hi>Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They report, That <hi>Hercules</hi> had been amongst them,
and that he was the most valiant of all Men. They
advance singing into the Battel. The Verses they call
<hi>Barditus,</hi> which in rehearsing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ame their Courage,
and by that very Tune they foretell the Event of the
approaching Engagement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:50009:243"/>
They terrifie and are terrified, according to the noise
the Army makes: Nor does it appear so much a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
of the Voice, as of their Valour: The roughness
of the Sound is the most affected, and a confus'd Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,

            <p>Some conjecture, that <hi>Vlysses,</hi> in his long and fabulous
Wandrings was carried into this Sea; that he landed in
<hi>Germany,</hi> and that <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

on the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and at this day inhabited,
was founded by him, and nam'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
That an Altar, consecrated to <hi>Vlysses,</hi> with the
Name of his Father <hi>Laertes,</hi> was formerly found in
that place, and that there are some Monuments and
Tumulists yet extant, inscrib'd with Greek Characters,
in the Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ines of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Rhoetia:</hi> Which I'm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
neither by Arguments to confirm or confute; let
every Man, as he pleases, either credit or discredit.</p>
            <p>I assent to their Opinions, who observe, that the
People of <hi>Germany</hi> are tinctur'd with no foreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
but continue a peculiar and unmix'd Nation,
only like themselves, from whence the shape of their
Bodies, altho' in so great a number, has the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance;
their Eyes blue and fierce, their Hair yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and only powerful upon an Assault. They're
impatient of Work and Labour, can in no wise under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
Thirst and Heat; Cold, and want of Provisions,
they are accustomed to, from the Climate and Soil.</p>
            <p>The Land, altho' it sometimes varies in Form, for
the generality, in rough with Woods, or stinks with
Marshes; as far as it looks to <hi>France</hi> more humid, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Noricum</hi> and <hi>Pannonia</hi> more windy. It is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
fertile, but improper for Fruit-trees; abounds
in Cattle, but, for the most part, stock'd and runtish;
nor are their Herds beautifully headed: They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with their Numbers, and those are the only
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50009:244"/>
and most acceptable Riches. I very much doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the propitious or angry Gods have denied them
Silver and Gold; nor would I a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>irm, that no Vein of
<hi>Germany</hi> produces Silver and Gold; for, who has made
the Tryal? They are not so much as affected by the
Propriety and Use of them; yet there is to be seen
amongst them Silver Vessels, presented to their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
and Princes, but no more esteem'd than those
which are made of Clay, although their Neighbours,
for the Advantage of Commerce, set a Value upon
Gold and Silver, and own and make choice of some
Coins of our Mony; the Inland People, without trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and as formerly, exchange their Commodities.
They approve most of Old Mony, and what has been
long known, especially the <hi>Serrati</hi> and <hi>Bigati.</hi> They
prefer Silver before Gold; not out of any Love
to it, but because the Pieces of Silver are more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to those who buy cheap Wares.</p>
            <p>They have no great Plenty of Iron, as may be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er'd
from the make of their Darts. Few use Swords or large
Launces; they carry Spears, or, according to their own
expression, <hi>Fram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as;</hi> the Iron narrow and short, but so
pointed and adapted for use, that with the same Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
as they see occasion, they fight at hand, or at a
distance; and the Horseman is very well satisfied with
a Shield and a <hi>Framea.</hi> The Foot cast Darts, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them a considerable number, and throw
them a prodigious way, and are either naked, or only
covered with a short Iacket. They don't value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon their Furniture: Their Shields are only
distinguished by select Colours: Few have Coats of
Male; scarce any of them have either Headpiece or
Helmet. Their Horses are neither remarkable for
their Shape or Speed, nor are they taught the Manage
according to our manner; they are made dexterous at
their Career, or in single Wheeling, so clos'd in the
Ring, that all stand even. Weighing all things, their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50009:244"/>
chiefest Strength is in their Foot, and therefore they
fight intermix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, the Swiftness of the Foot suiting and
agreeing in the Engagement of the Horse, who, pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of all their Youth, they place in the Front of
the Army; and the Number is limited, a Hundred
out of every Town, for so they're called amongst
themselves; and that which was at first but a Number
has now gained a Name and a Reputation. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
drawn up in form of a Wedge; they look upon
it to give ground when press'd, so they rally again, to
be more of Conduct than Fear. Their Bodies they
carry off in doubtful Battels: It's the greatest Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
to relinquish their Shield; neither is it lawful for
those who have forfeited their Honour, either to be
present in their Religious Duties, or to go to Council;
and many, who survive the Wars, put an end to the
Disgrace by the Halter.</p>
            <p>They make choice of their Kings for their Noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
their Commanders for their Courage: nor have
their Kings a boundless and unlimited Power. Their
Captains they prefer more for Example than Command,
if active, if of Presence of Mind, and behave themselves
well at the head of the Army; but it's not permitted to
reprimand, nor put in Chains, nor indeed chastise, to any
but to the Priests; not as if it were for a Punishment, or
by Orders of the Captain, but as if their God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, who they believe assisting in their Engagements.</p>
            <p>They carry the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, and certain Banners taken
down from the Groves, into the Battel: And what
is the chief Incitement to their Courage, is, not Chance,
nor a fortuitous Embodying, which composes the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
or pointed Battel, but their own Family and
nearest Relations; and hard by ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their Children,
from whence the Lamentations of their Women, and
Cries of their Infants, may be heard; these are the
most sacred Witnesses, and the highest Applauders of
every Man's Bravery. To their Mothers and Wives
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50009:245"/>
they declare their Hurts; nor are they afraid to suck
or number their Wounds: They carry Provisions to,
and animate them when they're fighting. It's record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That certain Troops beginning to stagger, and
giving Ground, were made to rally again by the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
by their Importunities, the exposing of their
own Breasts, and demonstrating their approaching
Captivity, which, upon the account of their Women,
they bear with much more reluctancy; so the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those Cities are the most effectually secur'd, to
whom, amongst their Hostages, the Noblest Virgins
are committed. Moreover, they suppose there's some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
sacred in them, and that they can foretell Events;
neither do they reject their Counsel, or neglect to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their Advice.</p>
            <p>We have seen <hi>Velleda,</hi> under the divine <hi>Vespasian,</hi> long
ador'd among many as a Deity: Yet also, in time
past, they reverenc'd <hi>Aurinia</hi> and divers others, not with
Flattery, nor as if they would make them Godesses. They
adore <hi>Mercury</hi> most of all their Gods, to whom, upon so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Days, they judge it justi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iable to offer up Human
Sacrifices. <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> they pacifie with lawful
Creatures. Part of the <hi>Suevians</hi> also sacrifice to <hi>Isis;</hi> but
I'm in the dark what was the Cause and Original of this
strange Sacrifice, unless her Image, fashion'd in the
shape of a Galley, instructs us, that their Religion
was adventitious. They're of an Opinion, from the
Magnitude of the Celestial Bodies, that the Gods can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be confin'd within Walls, or be represented in any
Human Shape. They consecrate <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Groves,</hi>
and call that <hi>Privacy,</hi> from the Names of their Gods,
which only in their Worship they behold. Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by Birds, and Chances, they most of all others su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously
observe.</p>
            <p>The Custom in managing their Lots is plain
and inartificial. A Branch pulled from a Fruit-bearing
Tree they cut into Slips, and at a venture,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50009:245"/>
and casually, scatter them, being distinguish'd by
some Marks upon a white Vestment; if it be a publick
Concern, the Priest of the City; but if private, the
Father of the Family praying to the Gods; and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to Heaven thrice, takes up every one apart, and
being held up, gives an Interpretation, according to
the former Mark; if they discourage, there's no more
consulting about the Affair that day; but if favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
yet the Credit of the Success is further requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
And this also is more notable, they argue upon
the Notes and Flying of Birds. Its peculiar to that
Nation, to experiment the Presages, and Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Horses: They are publickly fed in those
Woods and Groves, white and polluted by no Human
Labour, who being put in the Sacred Chariot, the
Priest, or King, or the Governour of the City attends
upon 'em, observing their Neighings and Whynnyings:
Nor is there greater Credit given to any Divination;
not only amongst the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> but the amongst the
Nobility and Priesthood; for they believe themselves to
be the Attendants, and these the Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idents of the Gods.</p>
            <p>There is also another Observation of their Sooth-saying,
whereby they explore the Events of their
greatest Battles: They engage a Captive, that some
how or other has been surpriz'd, of that Nation, with
whom they're at War, with a pick'd Man of their
own, both arm'd after their Country Fashion; and
who gains the Victory, its look'd upon as ominous to
the other side. Of little Affairs, the Princes; of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
all in general advise: So, notwithstanding, that
those things, whose Arbitration is in the Power of the
Populace, are fully canvass'd amongst the Princes.</p>
            <p>They assemble on certain Days, either upon a New or
Full Moon, unless any thing accidental, or unexpected,
falls out; for in transacting Business, they believe this
juncture of time the most auspicious: Neither do they
reckon by Days, as we do, but by Nights; so they make
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50009:246"/>
their Agreements; so by a common Consent their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments:
The Night here seems to guide the Day.
This Error proceeds from the Liberty they take, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do not meet all at once, or upon Command;
both the second and third Day is wasted by the Delay
of their convening: They sit down arm'd, if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
approves on't. Silence is commanded by the
Priests, in whom there is lodg'd then the Coercive
Power: By and by the King or Prince, according to
every one's Age, their Quality, Reputation gain'd in
the Wars, or Talent in Rhetorick, are heard, more
by the Authority of Perswading, than the Power of
Commanding; if the Opinion displeases, its rejected
by a Murmuring; if it pleases, they clash their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons:
Its the most honourable Manner of Assent, to
applaud it with their Arms. It's also lawful to accuse,
and arraign before the Council. The Difference of
the Punishment, is from the Nature of the Crimes;
Traytors and Revolters they hang on Trees; the
Sloathful, Timerous, and Sodomitical they drown in
Mire and Marshes, throwing Hurdles upon them. The
Diversity of the Punishment respects this, that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,
when punish'd, ought to be expos'd, Scandals
conceal'd: But for lesser Faults, being convicted, for
the Manner of their Penalty, they are fined such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Horses and Cattle; part of the Mulct goes to
the King or City, part to him, who is injur'd, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
amongst his Relations: Persons of the best
Quality are also elected with those Councils, who do
Iustice to the Towns and Villages: A hundred Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates
are assistant to every one of them, out of the
Commonalty; together with their Advice and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
They act nothing of private or publick Business
unarm'd; but its not the Custom for any one to go
arm'd, till the City has adjudg'd him qualified: Then
in the Council-Chamber, some one of the greatest Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or his Father, or his Relation, equips him with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50009:246"/>
a Buckl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r and Sword. This amongst them is their
Gown, this is the first Honour of their Youth; but
before this they seem only part of the Family, but now
of the Commonwealth. A noble Extraction, or the
great Deserts of the Fathers, recommend these young
Men to the Favour of their Prince. They associate
with others that are more robust, and long since ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd:
Neither do they blush to be seen amongst
their Companions; although he has his Post in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
at his Discretion, whom they follow. There's a
great Emulation amongst them, who shall be chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
to their Prince; and amongst the Princes, who
shall have the most, and the bravest Followers. This
is their Grandeur, these their Forces, to be encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
with a great Guard of select Youth, their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in Peace, and their Defence in War. It gives a
Name, and a Reputation to every one, not only in his
own Country, but also amongst their Neighbouring
Princes, if the Associates excel in Number and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
They're also apply'd to in Embassies, and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Presents; and for the most part, by their very
Fame, dispatch their Wars. When they come into
the Field of Battle, its dishonourable to the Prince to
be overcome in Bravery; and for his Retinue too not
to equalize the Courage of their Prince: But above all
things, its infamous, and during Life reproachful, to
flie, and survive their General slain. Their principal
Oath is to defend and protect him, and attribute all
their valiant Actions, to his Conduct and Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
Princes fight for Victory, their Adherents for their
Princes.</p>
            <p>If the City, in which they were born, grows
stiff and unactive, by a long Peace and Repose, most
of the young Noblemen go Voluntiers into those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which are then engag'd in War; because, also
Quiet is ungrateful to that Nation, and with the more
Facility they grow Famous amongst dubious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50009:247"/>
nor can they maintain their great Attendance,
unless by Violence and War. They obtain from the
Liberality of their Prince such a War-Horse, and such
a bloody conquering Sword.</p>
            <p>As to Banquets, although homely, yet a plentiful Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
they allow instead of a Salary. The Supply of
their Munificence proceeds from War and Rapine.</p>
            <p>Nor can you so easily perswade them to Till the
Ground, and wait for a good Year, as to challenge the
Enemy, and receive Wounds; for it looks lazy and
dispirited, to acquire that by hard Labour, which may
be compass'd by Blood. When they have no War,
they pass not their time so much in Hunting, as Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
being much addicted to Sleep and Gluttony: The
most Valiant and Warlike doing nothing at all, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the Care of their House, Gods, and Fields,
to their Women and Children, and to the most in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irm
of the Family. They have a wonderful Contrariety in
their Nature; for those Persons, who take such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in Idleness, have an aversion to Quiet.</p>
            <p>Its the Custom in those Cities, for every Man freely
to bestow on their Princes, either of their Herds or
Fruits, which is taken for a Favour, and besides sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
their Necessities. They take great Delight in
the Presents of Neighbouring Nations, which are not
only sent from particular Persons, but from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
as choice Horses, large Armours, Trappings and
Chains: And we have been inform'd, they now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Money. Its very well known, that Cities ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
not inhabited by the <hi>Germans;</hi> nor do they indeed,
suffer Houses to be join'd together. They plant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
separately and divided, as the Spring, Field, or
Wood, pleases them best. They found their Villages
not according to our Manner, with connex'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
Buildings: Every one leaves a Space about his
House, either as a Remedy against any Accident of
Fire, or from their Unskilfulness in Building. They
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50009:247"/>
use no Tyles or Mortar amongst them; but make use
of in all things a shapeless Stuff, without either Form
or Delight: Some Places they curiously parget with an
Earth, so pure and shining, that it imitates a Picture,
or the first Draught of Colours. They are wont to
open Subterranean Caves, and those they cover with a
great Quantity of Dung, which serves as a Refuge in
Winter, and a Granary; and when the Enemy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
he ravages the open Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But those things
which are conceal'd, or lie hid under Ground, they
are either ignorant of, or for that Reason are deceiv'd,
because they are to be search'd for.</p>
            <p>Their Cloathing is a loose Coat, join'd together
with a Button; but for want of that, with a Thorn:
Being uncover'd as to any thing else, they lie basking
whole Days upon the Hearth by the Fire. The most
wealthy are distinguish'd by a Garment, not flowing
like the <hi>Sarmathians</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> but close, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
every Ioint: They wear also the Skins of
wild Beasts; those next the Sea-side with less Curiosity;
but those that are higher in the Country are more
nice, as having no other Attire by Commerce. They
make choice of the Beasts, and having taken off their
Hides, spot them with the Skins of those Monsters,
which the outermost Ocean, and the unknown Sea
produces. Nor have the Women any other Habit
than the Men, unless that the Women are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cloath'd in Linnen Garments, and those they
checquer with Purple, and part of the upper Dress is
not made into Sleeves; their Arms are naked, and
their Bosom lies bare.</p>
            <p>However, their Marriages there are very strict;
neither is there any part of their Customs that's more
commendable; for they are almost the only People of
the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that are contented with one Wife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
except a very few, who not for Lasciviousness,
but out of State are surrounded with many Wives.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50009:248"/>
The Wife does not profer a Dowry to the Husband,
but the Husband to the Wife: The Parents and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are by, and approve of the Presents; Presents
not contriv'd for Womanish Toys, nor by which the
New-married Bride may be adorn'd, but Oxen, a
Horse bridled, a Shield with a Partisan, and Sword:
Upon these Terms the Wife is receiv'd; and she
in her Turn brings some Arms to her Husband.
This is the greatest Tye, these the Sacred <hi>Arcana's,</hi>
these they deem the Conjugal Deities; and lest the
Woman shou'd think herself exempted from the
Thoughts of Bravery, and the Hazards of War, she's
reminded from the beginning of the solemniz'd Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that she's now become a Partner of his Toyls
and Dangers, and that she will run the same Risque in
Peace and War, as he himself does: This the yoak'd
Oxen, this the equip'd Horse, this the presented Arms
declare; so they must live, so they must die. Those
Things which she receives, she restores uninjur'd to her
Children; what's put into the Daughter-in-Laws Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody,
they return to their Nephews. They therefore
behave themselves with the strictest Modesty, being
debauch'd with no alluring Objects, with no Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
in Banqueting.</p>
            <p>The Men, as well as the Women, are equally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Mysteries of Learning.</p>
            <p>In so populous a Nation, Adultery is rarely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
for which there's a present Punishment, that's
left to the Discretion of the Husbands. The Husband
having cut off her Hair, turns her out of his House na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
before her Relations, and whips her through the
whole Village. There's no Pardon for violated Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
neither can her Beauty, Age, nor Wealth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
her to another Husband. No one there
makes sport with Vices, nor is the Age said to corrupt,
or be corrupted. Those Cities do still much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably,
in which Virgins only marry, and where it's
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50009:248"/>
transacted with the Hopes and Desire of being but once
a Wife; so they receive one Husband, as they do one
Body, and one Life; nor is there a Thought beyond
that, nor a larger Desire; not as if it were the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
but as the Marriage-State that they affect.</p>
            <p>It's look'd upon as the highest Enormity, to stint the
Number of Children, or to kill any of their Kindred.
Their good Morals avail more there, than in other
places good Laws. In every House going naked and
dirty, they shoot out into those vast Limbs, and those
great Bodies we so much wonder at. Every Mother
gives suck to her own Child; neither are they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Care of Maids, and Nurses.</p>
            <p>The Masters, and Servants, are not to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
by the Niceties of Education; they live amongst
the same Cattle, on the same Ground, 'till Age distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
the Free-born, and their Courage signalizes
them.</p>
            <p>The Amours of the young Men begin late; for
which Reason their Youth is not impair'd: Nor are
the Maids too soon put upon Marriage; their Age is
the same, their Stature alike. Those that are equally
match'd, and strenuous, Inter-marry, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
resemble the Vigour of their Parents.</p>
            <p>There is the same Respect paid to the Sisters Sons,
by the Uncle, by the Mother's-side, as by the Father:
Some think this Tye of Blood is more sacred and
strict; and in receiving of Hostages, they rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it; as if they kept the Mind the more confirm'd,
and the Family the less reserv'd.</p>
            <p>The Heirs and Successors to every Man, are his own
Children, and therefore they make no Will: If he
has none, the next Relations, as the Brothers, Uncles,
by the Father's, or Mother's-side, take possession; and
his Age is esteem'd proportionate to the Number of his
Kindred and Affinity. Nor are they respected who
are without Issue. They are obliged to espouse, as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50009:249"/>
well the Enmities, either of a Father, or Relation, as
their Friendships; neither do they continue implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
For Homicide is atton'd for at a certain Number
of Beasts and Cattle, and the whole Family receives
Satisfaction advantagious to the Publick, because Feuds
are pernicious to Liberty.</p>
            <p>Not any Nation is so profuse in Entertainments and
Hospitality: It's held the highest Crime, to turn any
one out of Doors; every one treats answerable to his
Fortune. When the Provisions are all spent, he which
last entertained, is a Guide and Companion of his
Guest, and tho' uninvited, they go to the next House;
nor is it ill taken. They are receiv'd with the same
Civility, no one distinguishes the known and unknown,
as far as relates to the Right of Hospitality. It's the
Custom for him that's going away, to give, if any
thing's requir'd: And on the other hand, there's the
same Freedom in demanding. They take delight in
being presented; nor do they charge to Account
what's given, or think themselves oblig'd by what's
receiv'd. The Entertainment of their Guests is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable.</p>
            <p>As soon as they rise from Sleep, which, for the most
part, spins out the Day, they are wash'd oftentimes in
warm Water, the Winter there lasting long; having
done washing, they go to Dinner: Their Seats are at
a distance, and every one has a Table to himself; they
go arm'd alike to their Business and Feasts. It's rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
no Disgrace, to hold out a Day and Night in
Drinking. Those frequent Broils amongst those who
are addicted to Wine, are seldom past over with ill
Language, but oftner by Death and Wounds: But
they consult of reconciling Enemies, and contracting
Marriages, chusing their Princes, and of Peace and
War, for the most part, in their Banquets: As if at no
time, the Mind was more open to unbiass'd Thoughts,
or warm'd to greater Enterprizes. This Nation being
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50009:249"/>
neither crafty, nor cunning, by reason of the Priviledge
of the place, discovers the hitherto unreveal'd Secrets
of the Heart; therefore, the Mind of all being naked
and detected, the next Day it's spoken to anew, the
Reason of both times being weigh'd. They debate
when they know not how to dissemble, resolve when
they know not how to err.</p>
            <p>Ale is their Drink: Those who are next the Sea-Coast,
traffick for Wine. Their Diet is simple, wild
Apples, fresh Meat, or Curds; without making Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
without Dainties, they expect Hunger. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Thirst there's not the same Temperance; if thou
wilt indulge their Drunkenness, by furnishing them
with as much as they covet, they'll as easily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
by Wine, as by Arms.</p>
            <p>The Manner of their Shows is one and the same, in
all their Meetings; naked young Men, to whom it's a
Diversion, throw themselves amongst Swords, and
deadly Weapons: Frequent Exercise begets Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Experience Gracefulness; but this notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not done for Profit, or Reward; tho' the Prize
of this daring Wantonness, is the Pleasure of those
which behold it. Dice (which you'd wonder at) the
soberest Persons play at, amongst their weighty Affairs,
and with that rashness of winning or losing, that when
all's gone, they set Body and Liberty upon the last
Throw; he that loses, enters into a voluntary Vassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
altho' younger and more robust, suffers himself
to be bound and sold. Obstinacy in this ill Cause, they
stile Faith. Slaves of this Condition, they deliver up,
by the way of Commerce, that they may absolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Reproach of the Victory. They use
the rest of their Servants not after our manner, by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
them their Offices in the Family; every Man
governs his own House, and domestick Affairs. The
Master enjoyns the Payment of a Proportion of Corn,
or Cattle, or Cloathing, as to his Farmer, and so far
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50009:250"/>
the Slave complies. The other Offices of the House,
the Wife and Children manage. It's very uncommon
to beat a Slave, or to punish him with Fetters, and hard
Labour. They are wont to kill them, not by Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and Severity, but out of Passion and Anger, as
they wou'd an Enemy, and that without Impunity.

            <p>They are Strangers to Usury, and the making Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
by Interest, and therefore it's more observ'd,
than if it had been prohibited.</p>
            <p>The Fields, according to the Number of the Tillers,
are cultivated by Turns; which they divide amongst
themselves, according to the Credit of the Persons:
The largeness of the Plains, makes the Division less
difficult. The plough'd Lands they change annually,
and let the Ground lie fallow; neither do they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
by their Labour, for an Improvement, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of their Soil; so that they may plant Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,
enclose Meadows, and water their Gardens;
Corn only they expect from the Ground. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they don't divide the Year into so many Parts:
Winter, and Spring, and Summer, have their Names
and Significations: The Name and Benefit of Autumn
they are alike ignorant of.</p>
            <p>They are not ambitious of pompous Funerals; this
only is observ'd, that the Bodies of Illustrious Persons
are burnt with particular sorts of Wood. They heap
not up the Pile with Garments, nor Odors; his own
peculiar Arms, and the Horse of some of them is also
superadded, to the Fire. Their Tombs are rais'd with
Turf. They despise the lofty and costly Magnificence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50009:250"/>
of Monuments, as only burthensome to the Dead. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
and Tears, they refrain quickly; Grief,
and Sorrow, slowly. It's commendable in Women to
lament, in Men not to forget.</p>

and <hi>Maenus;</hi> the <hi>Boii</hi> the furthermost parts; and both
Nations were <hi>Gallican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Name of the <hi>Boiemi</hi> is yet extant, and signifies
the ancient Remembrance of the Place, altho' the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants

hitherto they use the same Language, Customs, and
Manners, is uncertain; because in Times past, from
the like Scarcity and Liberty, the same Convenience,
and Inconvenience accru'd to those who inhabited the
Banks on both sides.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Treveri,</hi> and <hi>Nervii,</hi> are over and above ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of affecting a <hi>German</hi> Genealogy; as if by this
Honour of Blood, they were distinguish'd from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance,
and Sluggishness of the <hi>Gauls.</hi> Undoubtedly
the People of <hi>Germany</hi> were the <hi>Vangiones, Treboci, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who inhabited the Bank of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The <hi>Vbi</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:50009:251"/>
also, altho' they deserv'd to be a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, are
asham'd of their Original; and who more willingly
wou'd be call'd <hi>Agrippinenses,</hi> from the Name of their
Founder, having formerly pass'd over, and out of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of their Fidelity, were planted upon the
Bank of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that they should expel their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
not that they themselves should be guarded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Batavians,</hi> of all these Nations, are the most
couragious: They inhabit not much of the Bank, but
an Island of the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> formerly the Nation of
the <hi>Catti,</hi> who passed over into those Habitations,
from a domestick Sedition, in which they were to be
made a part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. The Honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
and a Mark of the ancient Alliance; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they disgrac'd by Tribute, nor does the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
of the publick Revenues oppress them. They
are exempted from Taxes and Contributions, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set apart for the Service of the War, as Darts and
Arms are reserv'd for Battle.</p>
            <p>The Nation of the <hi>Mattiaci</hi> are also under the same
Obedience; for the Greatness of the People of <hi>Rome</hi>
was extended beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and their Majesty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the ancient Consines of the Empire. As to the
Frontiers of their Country, and Habitations, they live
upon the Bank: In Humor and Inclination they are
joyn'd with us: As to other things, they are like the
<hi>Batavians;</hi> but that, as yet, by reason of the Soil of
their Country, and Air, they are much braver. I
shall not reckon them amongst the People of <hi>Germany,</hi>
altho' they have taken up their Abode beyond the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> and the <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

which pay Tenths.</p>
            <p>The most profligate of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and who are grown
bold by Want, possess the Land of a doubtful Title. Now
their Territories being enlarg'd and Forts advanc'd,
they are esteem'd the Border of the Empire, and part
of a Province. Beyond these the <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ti</hi> are seated whose
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50009:251"/>
Bounds begin from the <hi>Hercynian</hi> Forest; but not in
such spacious and fenny Places, as the rest of the Cities,
into which <hi>Germany</hi> expatiates itself. Here the Hills
seem to continue, but grow thin by degrees; and the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynian</hi>
Forest follows, and together, leaves the <hi>Catti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bodies of that Nation are hardned, their
Limbs compact, their Countenances threatning, and
their Courage greater. They have as much Reason and
Policy as is to be found amongst the <hi>Germans.</hi> They
prefer choice Men, hearken to their Officers, know
their Ranks, and make the best of Opportunities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
their Resentments, order the Day according to
their several Occasions, intrench by Night, reckon
Fortune dubious, but Virtue unerring; and what is
more uncommon, unless it's to be allow'd from the
Reason of their Discipline, To repose more Confidence
in their General, than their Army. All their Strength
lies in the Foot, whom, besides their Arms, they load
with Iron Tools, and Provisions: You may see others
go to Battle, but the <hi>Catti</hi> to War. They seldom
make Incursions, or engage accidentally. It's peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to the Horse, suddenly to gain the Victory, or sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
Retreat: Expedition borders upon Fear, but
Delay comes nearer to Constancy; and the particular
Courage of every one, seldom try'd by the rest of the
<hi>Germans,</hi> is grown to an unanimous Consent amongst
the <hi>Catti,</hi> that as soon as they attain to the Years of
Maturity, to let their Hair and Beard grow long; nor
do they lay aside this Fashion of the Face, devoted
and oblig'd to Gallantry, 'till they have slain an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>Upon Blood, and Sports, they discover the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and declare, That they have made a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for their being born, and that they are worthy
of their Country and Parents; that Deformity sticks
to the cowardly and timerous. Moreover, every one
of the most valiant, wears an Iron Ring, as it were a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50009:252"/>
Bond (most ignominious to that Nation) 'till he can
acquit himself of it by the Death of an Enemy.</p>
            <p>This Mode pleases many of the <hi>Catti;</hi> and now
these remarkable People, grown grey, are both shew'd
together, to their Enemies, and their own Soldiers:
These always give the first Onset: This is always the
Fore-front, distinguish'd by the Figure they make;
neither in Peace have they milder Aspects: They have
no House, or Land, or take Care of any thing; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they come to any one, they are provided
for; are profuse of another's, Contemners of their
own, 'till Bloodless Old Age makes them incapable of
such hard Service.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vsipii,</hi> and <hi>Tenecteri,</hi> Neighbours to the <hi>Catti,</hi>
inhabit upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> now known by the Channel,
which is su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>icient to be a Boundary.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tenecteri,</hi> above their accustomed Reputation in
War, excel in the Art of Horse-Discipline; nor have
the <hi>Catti</hi> a greater Repute for Foot, than the <hi>Tenecteri</hi>
have of Horse: So have their Ancestors instituted,
and their Posterity imitate them. These are the Plays
of Children, this the Emulation of Young Men, and
the Aged persevere in them.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Family, and Goods, as the Rights of
Successions, Horses are deliver'd: The Son receives
them; not as he does the rest, by Priority of Birth,
but as he is more Couragious, and a better Man in War.</p>
            <p>Near the <hi>Tenecteri,</hi> in Times past, the <hi>Bructeri</hi> liv'd:
Now its reported, that the <hi>Chamavi,</hi> and <hi>Angrivarii,</hi>
are come to dwell there; having chas'd away, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
extirpated the <hi>Bructeri,</hi> either by the Consent
of the bordering Nations, or out of Hatred to
their Ambition, or for the Sweetness of the Booty,
or by a peculiar Favour of the Gods to us: For
they did not envy us the Sight of a Battle, wherein
were slain above Threescore thousand; not by the
<hi>Roman</hi> Arms, and Darts, but what is more Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50009:252"/>
to give Diversion, and to delight the
Eye.</p>
            <p>I pray, that if the Affection for us from these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
can't remain and continue, that their Aversion
for one another may; that when the Fates of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
are declining, Fortune can't perform a Greater
Thing than the Discord of our Enemies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dulgibini,</hi> and <hi>Chasuari,</hi> shut up on the back;
the <hi>Angrivarii,</hi> and <hi>Chamavi,</hi> and other Nations, not
so much as mention'd. On the Front the <hi>Frisii</hi> are
ready to receive them: They are call'd the Greater,
or Lesser <hi>Frisii,</hi> from the Proportion of their Forces;
both Nations spread themselves from the <hi>Rhine</hi> to the
Ocean; where Fame hath publish'd, that <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are there, as yet, remaining.</p>
            <p>Whether <hi>Hercules</hi> was there, or whether what is
every-where Magni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Honour.</p>
            <p>Nor was Resolution wanting to <hi>Drusus Germanicus;</hi>
but the Ocean oppos'd both him and <hi>Hercules,</hi> from
making further Discovery. Since no one hath attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, it looks more holy and reverend to believe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than be too inquisitive, in prying into the Secrets
of the Gods.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have known <hi>Germany</hi> towards the
<hi>West.</hi> Towards the <hi>North</hi> it returns with a very
great Winding.</p>
            <p>And first of the Country of the <hi>Chauci.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it begins from the <hi>Frisii,</hi> and possesses part of
the Shoar, yet it is cover'd by the Confines of all those
Nations, which I have describ'd, until it winds even
to the <hi>Catti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such an immense Tract of Ground, the <hi>Chauci</hi> don't
only inhabit, but also replenish: The most Noble of all the
<hi>Germans,</hi> and who chuse rather to defend their Greatness
by their Iustice. Without Covetousness, without Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50009:253"/>
quiet and sequestred, make no War, are wasted by
no Theft or Robbery: And this is a principal Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Courage and Force, because that they did
not obtain by Injuries a Superiority over others. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they are all in a readiness for War. And if
their State requires an Army, they are well provided
of Men and Horses, and they are in the same Repute
when they lie still.</p>
            <p>On the side of the <hi>Chauci,</hi> and <hi>Catti,</hi> the <hi>Cherusci</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unprovok'd, have too long indulg'd a lasting,
but consuming Peace, which was more pleasant than
safe; because between the impotent and powerful
there's no living in Security: When it's done by Force,
Modesty, and Integrity, are Names in the Power of the
Superiour: So that they which were, in former Times,
the good and just <hi>Cherusci,</hi> are now call'd cowardly
and foolish: Fortune, in the conquering <hi>Catti,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
in them Wisdom; and the <hi>Fosi,</hi> a bordering
Nation of the <hi>Cherusci,</hi> were affected with the Ruine
of the <hi>Cherusci,</hi> by Right, their Companious of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity;
whereas they were much their Inferiours in
Prosperity.</p>
            <p>The same Coast of <hi>Germany,</hi> next to the Ocean, the
<hi>Cimbrians</hi> inhabit; now a little City, but great in
Glory: Their Camps on both Shoars, are largely the
Monuments of their ancient Fame, and those Intervals,
by whose Compass thou may'st compute the Bulk and
Strength of the Nation, and the Confidence they had
of so great an Army.</p>
            <p>Our City had been founded 640 Years, when first
the Arms of the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> were heard on, <hi>Caecilius
Metellus,</hi> and <hi>Papirius Carbo,</hi> being Consuls. From
whence, if we reckon to the Second Consulship of
the Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi> it almost amounts to Two
hundred and ten Years; so long <hi>Germany</hi> was conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
During which long Space of Time, there were
many reciprocal Losses on both sides; neither has
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50009:253"/>
the <hi>Samnite,</hi> nor the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> nor the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
nor the <hi>Gauls,</hi> or indeed the <hi>Parthians,</hi> so often check'd
us in our Carier; because the Liberty of the <hi>Germans</hi>
is more vehemently affected, than in the Kingdom of
the <hi>Parthians:</hi> For what hath the <hi>East</hi> to object against
us, besides the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ath of <hi>Crassus,</hi> who had lost himself,

<hi>Germans</hi> having slain, or taken Prisoners, <hi>Carbo,</hi> and
<hi>Cassius,</hi> and <hi>Scaurus Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Servilius Cepio,</hi> and
also <hi>Marcus Manlius,</hi> have, moreover, destroy'd Five
Consulary Armies from <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Varus,</hi> with his

and <hi>Germanicus,</hi> assaulted them in their own Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without Danger.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the great Threatnings of <hi>Caesar</hi>
were turn'd into Ridicule.</p>
            <p>From this time there was a setled Peace, 'till by the
Opportunity of our Discord, and Civil Wars, they
had won, by Assault, the Winter-Camps of the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and also attempted <hi>Gaul:</hi> And being again from

from the Vassals. So in other Countries, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the Alliance of the <hi>Suevians,</hi> or (which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
happens) in imitation, and that seldom, and whilst
they are young too: Amongst the <hi>Suevians,</hi> even till
they're Grey, they tie their brisly Hair behind, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50009:254"/>
oftentimes upon the Crown of the Head only: Their
Princes wear it more exact: Such innocent Care they
take of their Beauty. Nor do they do it out of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
that they may make Love, or be beloved: They
go into Battle with their Hair comb'd high, and for a
Terror, and are so trimm'd up in view of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Semnones</hi> report, That they are the most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and Noble of the <hi>Suevians.</hi> The Truth of
their Antiquity, is confirm'd by their Religion. At
a set time, all the People of one Blood, assemble by
their Embassies in a Wood, Sacred by the Oracles of
their Ancestors, and by an ancient Veneration, and
celebrate the horrid Beginnings of their barbarous
Rites, by publickly killing a Man.</p>
            <p>There is also another Reverence paid to that Grove;
no one enters into it, unless bound like an inferior
Person, and professing openly the Power of their God:
If by chance he falls down, it's not lawful to be taken
away, or rise up, but he is roll'd off the Ground: And
thither all their Superstition tends; and from thence
were deriv'd the Origine of their Nation, that there
was a God, Ruler of all, that all beside were subject,
and obeying.</p>
            <p>The Success of the <hi>Semnones</hi> gives this Authority:
They inhabit a Hundred Villages; and compose so
great a Body, that they believe themselves the Head
of the <hi>Suevians:</hi> On the other hand, the small Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
they have makes famous the <hi>Longobards;</hi> because,
being encompass'd with many, and very powerful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they are safe themselves, not by a Compliance,
but by Battles and Hazards. Moreover, the <hi>Reudigui,</hi>
and <hi>Aviones,</hi> and <hi>Angli,</hi> and <hi>Varini,</hi> and <hi>Eudoses,</hi> and
<hi>Suardones,</hi> and <hi>Nuithones,</hi> are fortify'd by Rivers and
Woods: Neither is there any thing remarkable in
particular, but that they in common Worship <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thum,</hi>
that is, their Mother-Earth, and believe she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interposes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50009:254"/>
in the Affairs of Mankind. There is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Wood in an Island of the Ocean, and a Chariot
dedicated in it, cover'd with a Garment, allow'd to be
touch'd but by one Priest: He understands, when the
Goddess is come to her Retiring Room, and follows
her, drawn by Cows, with much Veneration. Then
are their Days of Rejoycing, and Festival Places, which
she vouchsafes to honour with her Presence, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
she reputes worthy of her Arrival and Friendship.
They make no Wars, put on no Armor, all their
Arms are lock'd up: Peace and Tranquility is only
then known, then only belov'd, 'till the same Priest
returns the Goddess to her Temple, satiated with the
Conversation of Mortals; presently after the Chariot,
and Vestments, (and if you'll Credit it) the Deity her
self is wash'd in a secret Lake: Bond-men attend,
whom the same Lake immediately swallows up; from
hence there's a mystical Terror, and a holy Ignorance,
that should be, which they only see, who are just pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing.
