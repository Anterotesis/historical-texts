         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the death of Noble Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> that
there is but little done to participate unto
you one Thurſday laſt was fortnight there
went out 4000 Horſe and Foot, and ſix
pieces of Ordnance towards <hi>Athlone,</hi> of which number
2000 were for the reliefe of <hi>Connoght,</hi> and the reſt went
for their Convoy, and in their way ſet on a Caſtle called
the <hi>Knock,</hi> which coſt them 40 men, beſides ſome that
were hurt before it was taken and the women and men
ſtanding on the top of the Caſtle defied our Army a
good while, and called them traytors and Parliament
Rogues, but after 2 dayes fighting at the ſaid Caſtle,
our Army gave quarter to all the Gentlewomen, exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting
2 or 3, which the Soldiers laid hold on, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all the men, being in number about 100 only one
proper man that ſtripped himſelfe to his ſhirt and ruſhed
out through the Armey and ſcaped away with ſome
little hurt; and on Saturday laſt was ſennight, our 2000
came home, but at <hi>Manoth</hi> the Lord <hi>Liſles</hi> wagons and
his Landreſſe comming before, were there ſurpriſed by
the Rebels and ſhe hanged, and his carriage taken away.
And on the tueſday following their comming home
being tueſday laſt, Colonell <hi>Monke</hi> went forth, with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156045:3"/>
2000 Foot and Horſe, with two great braſſe battering
pieces, to a Caſtle of one <hi>Mores</hi> neare <hi>Monothe,</hi> where
there were many Commanders of the Rogues, and
good pillage, but the Rebels had preſently notice, and
ſo got away before our Army came, and burnt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;
Then our Army marcht further into the County
of <hi>Kildare</hi> to a Caſtle called <hi>Blackwood,</hi> which was a
ſtrong place, and there were many women and children
and Commanders beſides, beſides Souldiers of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,

that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>John Dungan,</hi> who commeth and walketh
ſafe and quietly here among us, ſent the Rogues notice,
whereby the chiefeſt men got away before, and thoſe
that remained held out ſtoutly, and the women from
the top of the Caſtle did much miſchief on our ſide, by
caſting of ſtones down thence and after much ſhooting
on both ſides, the great pieces were made uſe of, and
ſhot ſome 50 and odd ſhot before they yeelded, the
women before that time did from the top of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
call our Army traytors to the King, and Parliament
Rogues; but theſe creatures deſiring quarter, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
told them they ſhould have quarter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they came forth: the Souldiers being enraged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, becauſe they did the greateſt miſchiefe by
flinging of ſtones, quartered both women and children,
excepting ſome 5 that are brought to town, and the men
deſiring quarter, Colonell <hi>Monke</hi> gave them quarter,
that they ſhould be brought ſafe to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and there
left to the Iuſtices pleaſure; and ſo on this <hi>Monday</hi> our
Army came to town and brought with them the five
women and 68 luſty proper men, and before they yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
there were loſt and hurt of ours about 12 men, and

Colonell <hi>Monke</hi> eſcaped well, for a ſtone ſcraped his
chin alittle, but did but little harm, God be praiſed for it.
But the more is our ſorrow, we are in great want of
more men and money, and the Sommer ſtealing away
and nothing to any purpoſe done, but theſe ſmall frats.
In <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, the Rogues being at my brother <hi>Rams</hi>

there came a ſwarme of Bees out of the garden into the

wherein I thinke you were pleaſed to give
ſome intelligence of all the maine occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of theſe times, I was very ſorry to
heare of the great and grievous diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wherewith your Kingdome of England doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
with all, occaſioned by the diſagreement of his
Majeſty, and the high Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> now aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I hope it will ſuddenly pleaſe <hi>Almighty God</hi> to bring
the cauſers of theſe ſo great diſtractions to light, that
ſo the King and <hi>Parliament</hi> being united, there may be
a generall reformation eſtabliſhed with you in <hi>England,</hi>
and afterward we may obtaine by the ſame meanes a
ceſſation of thoſe bloudy times, which yet by reaſon of
an inſolent Enemie are frequent amongſt us. Now ſir
as I ſtand bound unto your goodneſſe for many favours
of your bounty expreſſed both to my youth and alſo to
my riper yeares, ſo ſir, in reſpect of this particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
whereby you were pleaſed to let me underſtand
the condition of your times, I durſt not be ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to commit a crime of ſo foale a nature, but out of
my reſpects, let you underſtand the neweſt occurrences
of our Kingdome. Conflicts wee have almoſt every
day with the Rebells, whom thanks be unto God, we
have much abated of their former inſolency and
ſtrength, albeit not ſo ſubdued, but yet they make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day ſome or other new oppoſition. Vpon the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of this preſent <hi>May,</hi> Sir <hi>William Sentleger</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156045:4"/>
of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> with their forces,
being of ſtrength about thouſand Foote and five
hundred Horſe, marched from <hi>Corke</hi> toward <hi>Tredarth,</hi>
having information given unto them, that the Enemie
had a deſigne to moleſt <hi>Tredarth</hi> afreſh, having now
marched on, not above two dayes march, a Poſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
informed them that the Enemy had left their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
againſt <hi>Tredarth,</hi> and that they were now making
forward that way, under the command and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Viſcount <hi>Muſgrave</hi> of <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> who lately
revolted from his Loyalty and King unto the Rebells
ſide. This newes was no ſooner arived unto them, but
it was entertained with a joyfull expectation of their
comming, they forbeare to march any farther for the
preſent, but within ten miles of <hi>Tredarth</hi> expected their
approach, and provided themſelves for the Encounter.
Vpon the tenth day the Enemy was eſpied to approach,
Sir <hi>William</hi> and the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> made ready for his
welcome which was ſo fierce and violent, that I beleev,
he never was entertained to ſo hot a feaſt in all his life
time. For he loſt within the ſpace of five houres fight
700. men, beſide there were maimed very ſore in that
Skirmiſh, which notwithſtanding their wounds, made a
ſhift to flye, 80. odde men, the Viſcount himſelfe was
very hardly brought off. The Skirmiſh being ended
thoſe two Cavaliers for that ſeaſon betooke themſelves
to the next adjoyning Towne, and there tooke up their
repoſe, leaving their force ſtill in the field. The next
morning by breake of day came with all ſpeed foure
ſouldiers, who pretended themſelves to bee weary of
their Rebellious confederacy, with Petitions in their
hands deſired acceſſe unto Sir <hi>William,</hi> who being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156045:5"/>
with his late conflict, was yet in bed taking his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and ſolacing himſelfe after his redious fight.
Theſe fugitives ſtill aiming at their deſigne did ſtay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
hee roſe, and left his chamber, and at his comming
forth out of his houſe to goe to take horſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him with a paper, wherein was expreſſed their
deſires, as he was peruſing the ſcrole, they drew each
of them out of their pockets a Caſe of Piſtolls ready
charged and ready cockt, which they endeavoured to
let flye, but by the providence of the Eternall Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
the powder fired in the panne, and would not go
off; whereupon they drew out their weapons, and were
reſolved, if the ſucceſſe had favoured their intents, to
have diſpatched him with their ſwords whom their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolls
thought moſt unjuſt to wound or injure, but the
Company of Servants who then attended his perſon,
prevented this damnable deſigne, and tooke the Actors
without any harme unto them, who immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their apprehenſion were had in Examination, and
