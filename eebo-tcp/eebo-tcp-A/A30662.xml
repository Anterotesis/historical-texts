            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe late Proceedings of the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> as Viſitor of <hi>Exeter-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> were ſo directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both to the Statutes of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> and the Laws of this Realm, that the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows,</hi> who oppoſed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip therein, little thought there would have been any cauſe to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a Vindication of their conduct in that Affair, eſpecially when they found that his Lordſhip had no other grounds for his Porceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, then what have been publiſh't in a late Pamphlet, Entitled <hi>An Account of the Proceedings of the Right Reverend Father in God</hi> Jonathan <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was hoped the weakneſs of that Pamphlet would be obvious to all judicious and intelligent Readers; and that the badneſs of his cauſe was ſufficiently detected by the weakneſs of his defence.</p>
            <p>But ſince it appears that ſome perſons, who know no better, or are willing to be deceiv'd, are impos'd upon either by the Biſhop's Character, or the credit of two Civilians, and perhaps ſome bold daſhes in the late Pamphlet (as Greatneſs and Reputation are apt to give a colour to things, that in themſelves have none) They began to conceive it might not be improper to let the unthinking part of their adverſaries understand, that they had much more to alledge in their own Vindication, then had been ſaid to run them down. Yet was this deſign retarded, becauſe one part of their Cauſe, to wit the Viſitor's Power as Ordinary, was in conteſt betwixt him and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> in the Court of King's Bench. But that having been ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in favour of the <hi>Rector,</hi> its hoped the judgement of the Court upon that part of the Cauſe may facilitate the belief that the reſt of his Lordſhips Proceedings have been all of a piece with that.</p>
            <p>The deſign of the enſuing diſcourſe, is to ſatisfie all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, or will concern themſelves in this Controverſie, that there was just cauſe for Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> firſt and ſecond Expulſion; that
<pb facs="tcp:41975:3"/>
his Appeal to the Viſitor, was not only not warranted by, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the very letter of the Statutes of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> that Dr. <hi>Maſter's</hi> his executing a Commiſſion from the Biſhop, was a Viſitation, within the intention of the Statutes, and that the Viſitor has no Epiſcopal juriſdiction over the <hi>Colledge</hi> or any of its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Which particulars, if they be cleared, we are not concern'd to give a ſuperfluous anſwer to little and inſignificant ſuggeſtions that trench nothing at all on the merits of the Cauſe. The Author of the Account has that province left entirely to himſelf, of urging immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial paſſages, and miſrepreſenting them too; Our deſign is peace, which to obtain, all expreſſions of rancour and harſh reflexions are abſtained from, nor is any thing here ſet down, but what tends to the juſtification of the <hi>Colledge</hi> in point of Right: Even the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> perſonal guilt had been forborn, had it not given the firſt riſe to the preſent diſorders, and if his own obſtinacy had not put his Judges upon a neceſſity of vindicating the Juſtice of their Sentence.</p>
            <p>But the main ſtreſs of this whole Affair centring in the Viſitor's Juriſdiction, the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> are heartily ſorry, that his Lordſhip did not meet with a more creditable occaſion of aſſerting his pretended Juriſdiction, then that, which does in the nature of the thing (tho not in his Lordſhips intentions) tend to the encouragement of Vice and Debauchery, and that in a Society inſtituted to be a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of Learning and Vertue.</p>
            <p>And they cannot but take notice, becauſe they hope it will make an impreſſion in favour of them upon unprejudiced minds, in what manner the illegality of his Lordſhips proceedings is backt by thoſe who abett him; to wit, with force and violence, riots and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances even at the performance of God's publick Worſhip, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars whereof are not thought fit to be here inſerted. A good Cauſe is always beſt maintain'd by proper and legal methods; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as paſſion and force are generally ſigns of a bad cauſe as well as of ill men.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of <hi>Exeter-Colledge,</hi> in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Related and Vindicated.</head>
            <p>WIthin the compaſs of three quarters of a year two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Children were born of young Women then in the Service of <hi>Bed-makers</hi> belonging to <hi>Exeter-Colledge.</hi> One <hi>Anne Aris</hi> appeared to be with Child about <hi>Mich.</hi> 1688. and towards the latter end of the next Summer, one <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> was in the ſame condition.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rector,</hi> and <hi>Senior Fellows</hi> thought (as well they might) that it highly behoved them for the Reputation of the <hi>Colledge</hi> to endeavour the wiping off ſuch a <hi>double ſcandal.</hi> Which could no otherwiſe be done then by a diſcovery who were the true Fathers of the ſaid Baſtard-children; and if upon Examination, and Proof, it ſhould appear that any Member of the <hi>Colledge</hi> had been faulty therein, then to proceed againſt ſuch Member, as the Statutes of the <hi>Colledge</hi> direct.</p>
            <p>Upon enquiring into the matter there appear'd violent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> Guilt.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Firſt, Anne Sparrow</hi> confeſttoh er Dame <hi>Thomaſin Smith</hi> (who was Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> Bed-maker) that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was the Father of her Child.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Thomaſin Smith</hi> confeſt, that after the ſaid <hi>Anne Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> was diſabled from working, Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was at the charge of maintaining her.</p>
            <p>Theſe two particulars, the ſaid <hi>Thomaſin Smith</hi> diſcloſed upon her Examination before the <hi>Rector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Ferdinand Smith, Thomaſin's</hi> husband, being Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Rector,</hi> ſaid that the Father of one of the Children was Father of both, but refuſed to confeſs who that was, or from whom he had money for keeping <hi>Anne Sparrow,</hi> becauſe a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (he ſaid) would be expell'd, and he ſhould loſe his Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The other young woman <hi>Anne Aris</hi> had laid her Child to the ſaid <hi>Ferdinand Smith,</hi> who Fled into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41975:4"/>
furniſhed with money by Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> for his Journey; by whom about three months after he was taken into his Service and brought back to the <hi>Colledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Ferdinand Smith</hi> gave bond to the Overſeers of the Poor to ſave the Pariſh harmleſs, penalty 40. <hi>l.</hi> One of the Overſeers, being <hi>Cook</hi> to the <hi>Colledge,</hi> and charged by the <hi>Rector</hi> for unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in his Office in <hi>taking bond of a</hi> man that was not ſolvent, replied that he ſhould not have taken it, if he had not been bid to do it by a Gentleman, who promiſed the Pariſh ſhould come to no damage: This Gentleman upon farther Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appear'd to be Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> who afterwards did not deny it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Preſently after <hi>Anne Sparrow's</hi> delivery, <hi>viz.</hi> about a weeks end, it being nois'd about that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was the Father, ſhe was removed and hid by Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> or by ſome of his friends; which upon his own Examination before the <hi>Rector</hi> he could not deny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The then <hi>Vice Chancellor,</hi> now Lord Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> being applyed to by the <hi>Rector</hi> to Examine <hi>Ferdinand Smith</hi> as a Juſtice upon the whole matter, in order to the finding out the truth; <hi>Ferdinand Smith</hi> confeſſed to him that the Girle had named Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> for the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The Midwife being ſent for, gave this Account, that when ſhe preſt <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> at the time of her travail to name the true Father, <hi>Thomaſin Smith</hi> her Dame deſired that ſhe would not urge her, ſaying ſhe had told her already; and <hi>Thomaſin,</hi> when afterwards examined by the <hi>Rector,</hi> confeſt that ſhe had hindred the Midwife's urging a confeſſion at that time, becauſe ſhe was loath to have Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> diſgrac't before the company then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Theſe grounds to ſuſpect Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> Guilt, the <hi>Rector</hi> thought ſufficient for bringing the Matter to a hearing before the <hi>Senior Fellows</hi>; And accordingly fixed a day, giving Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> notice about a fort-night before, that he might have time to prepare his defence.</p>
            <p>The day being come, which was the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1689. The <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Senior Fellows</hi> met together, Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> being preſent. And the ſubſtance of the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been guilty of <hi>Incontinence,</hi> and in particular of his being the Father of <hi>Anne Sparrow's</hi> Baſtard child, as diſclos'd upon a long hearing of ſeveral hours, appeared to be as followeth; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Anne Sparrow</hi> had acknowledged that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41975:4"/>
the Father of her Child. That ſhe had ſo acknowledged,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note, Ann. Sparrow</hi> could not be then produced in perſon, becauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd out of the way to prevent her diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the truth; and that by Mr <hi>Colmer's</hi> friends,</note> was confeſt by <hi>Thomaſin Smith</hi> her Dame then preſent, and her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had owned the ſame before the <hi>Vice Choncellor</hi>; as was then atteſted by the <hi>Rectors</hi> Oath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Overſeer of the Poor then atteſted, (and has ſince depoſed upon <hi>Oath</hi>) that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> bid him take the ſecurity of <hi>Ferdinand Smith,</hi> Scrape-trencher of the <hi>Colledge</hi> for the Child that <hi>Anne Sparrow,</hi> ſingle woman, then went with, and told him the Pariſh ſhould not be damnified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>Thomaſin Smith</hi> had acknowledged, that the money for <hi>Anne Sparrow's</hi> maintenance, whileſt ſhe was at <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand Smith's</hi> houſe, and big with Child, was paid by Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That by <hi>Ferdinand's</hi> ſaying (as before, and as himſelf acknowledged upon the hearing that he had ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi>) that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman would be expell'd, it appear'd he had ſome knowledge who was the Father; nor would name any other then Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> who might be liable to Expulſion for the ſame, and yet refuſed then to name him, tho' he was told, that unleſs he charged ſome body, what he had ſaid already, joyn'd with what othor proofs had been made, would faſten it upon Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>; whom he had all along favoured in the whole affair. (<hi>Note,</hi> that this <hi>Smith</hi> finding himſelf afterwards laught at for ſome weak tergiverſations and contradictions in what he ſaid at the hearing, has confeſt that by the Gentleman liable to be expell'd, he meant Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> ſome time before ſhe was known to be with Child, was heard to ſay, that ſhe had reaſon to curſe Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> for he had undone her. Of this one of the Fellows gave information; to whom it had been told by <hi>Joyce Aris,</hi> who heard the words, and ſhe being called in and Examined, did her ſelf confirm it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That of the <hi>Midwife</hi> mentioned before.</p>

               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That tho' Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> had ſufficient time given him to make his defence, and might have clear'd himſelf in a great meaſure from being guilty in the main charge againſt him, if <hi>Ann Sparrow</hi> had been brought in, and would have acquitted him; yet he forbore (as muſt be preſum'd out of a conſcience of guilt) to bring her forth, as he might eaſily have done; ſhe having been lately removed out of the way by ſome of his friends, as himſelf could not deny. (And, as it has appeared ſince by her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſhe was then but at one <hi>John Wakeland's</hi> houſe in <hi>Oxford,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41975:5"/>
whether ſhe had been perſwaded to remove by Mr. <hi>Cleveland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maundrel</hi> both <hi>Fellows</hi> of <hi>Exeter-Colledge,</hi> and intimate friends of Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>; who likewiſe paid for her keeping, whileſt ſhe was there.)</p>
            <p>Theſe Evidences appear'd to the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> ſo full and pregnant, that they conceived no rational man could entertain a juſt doubt of Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> crime; and the Caution that was us'd by the <hi>Rector</hi> in making what enquiry he could into the fact, tho' a publick ſcandal to the whole <hi>Colledge,</hi> before he would bring Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> Reputation in queſtion by a publick charge of this nature, is a great argument, how candid the proceedings of the <hi>Colledge</hi> have been in this affair. Yet were not the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> willing upon the hearing to proceed to a ſentence of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,</hi> tho upon ſuch violent proofs, as nothing but a poſitive Teſtimony upon Oath of the very committing the Act (which in a crime of this nature is very difficult to be had) could be more convincing; without enquiry into Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> former behavior and courſe of Life. Which, if it were innocent and free from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of ſuch like immoralities, ought to raiſe a tenderneſs in receiving ſuch an accuſation, and might perhaps entitle him to inſiſt upon ſtricter proof, then a man who is known to be of a looſe life can reaſonably be thought to have a Juſt claim to.</p>
            <p>It was made appear to them by the Atteſtation of a <hi>Scholar,</hi> that <hi>Anne Aris</hi> had confeſt to him ſome rude importunities uſed to her by Mr. <hi>Colmer: Vid. infr. Depoſit. Lett.</hi> B. And the <hi>Rector's Wife</hi> declared that one <hi>Mary Lawrence</hi> ſometime ſervant to the ſaid <hi>Ferdinand Smith,</hi> had declared to her that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> had made ſome uncivil attempts upon her, when ſhe was making his Bed, inſomuch that ſhe was afraid to go into his Room alone, <hi>Vid.

And ſhe has ſince made <hi>Oath</hi> of it, <hi>Vid. infr. Dep. Lett.</hi> D.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Defence conſiſted of nothing but confident denials of all that was charged and proved, and the Evidence of the two <hi>Fellows</hi> above mentioned, who took their voluntary Oaths, that <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> had in their hearing clear'd Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> of having been concern'd with her. But as this Teſtimony of theirs was not then thought conſiderable enough to counterpoize ſo many Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of her having confeſt it to others, backt with ſo many other circumſtances of Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s guilt, as have been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41975:5"/>
and were fully atteſted; eſpecially thoſe two <hi>Fellows</hi> being known to be Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Intimate Friends, and upon that ſcore ſuſpected to have gain'd ſome words of that kind from her in Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s behalf, ſo it has been made appear ſince by <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi>'s own <hi>Affidavits</hi> made before Juſtices of Peace, that Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maundrell,</hi> who were the two <hi>Fellows</hi> that gave this Teſtimony, had advis'd her to lay her Child to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> for that if ſhe laid it to Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> he would be expell'd, and that it was purſuant to their perſwaſions that ſhe own'd before <hi>Alderman Fyfield,</hi> that another man was tho Father. But withal ſhe ſwore that none had ever perſwaded her to lay it to Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> who was the true Father, for that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man but Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> had ever had carnal knowledg of her, <hi>Vid. infr. Depoſ. lett.</hi> E. <hi>&amp;</hi> L.</p>
            <p>Upon a full hearing of all the Allegations and Proofs on both ſides, the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> were convinced in their Conſciences of Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s guilt, and proceeded to a ſentence, whereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statute <hi>De cauſis propter quas Scholar.</hi> &amp;c. they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him <hi>ipſo facto</hi> expell'd.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> reſted to appearance ſatisfied with the Juſtice of his ſentence for ſome time; and deſired of the <hi>Rector</hi> a licenſe under his hand in order to his <hi>Admiſſion</hi> into ſome other <hi>Colledge</hi>; and confeſſed that he had no reaſon to complain of his Judges, for that himſelf upon the like Evidence would have found any other perſon guilty; but he pretended to find fault with the Witneſſes, and laid the whole blame upon them. But he continued not long in this ſubmiſſive mind: A deſign was laid to conteſt the matter again, and clear Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Innocence.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid that <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> was removed ſhortly after her lying in to <hi>John Wakeland</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Oxford,</hi> from thence after ſome Weeks ſtay, ſhe was brought back to <hi>Ferdinand Smith</hi>'s (where ſhe was before) and there a Juſtice of Peace, <hi>Alderman Fyfield,</hi> came to her, being conducted by the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Mandrell</hi> who had Chriſtened the Child; and examined her concerning the Baſtard-child, that ſhe had had. To him ſhe declared that ſhe had been got with Child by a Gentleman of <hi>Christ-Church</hi>; and cleared Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi> The <hi>Rector</hi> hearing that <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> had retracted what ſhe had formerly acknowledged to ſo many, went to <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Fyfield</hi> to enquire into the matter: But could receive from him no other Account than this: <hi>viz.</hi> That he had Examined her, but had taken no depoſition; and at what houſe it was he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41975:6"/>
knew not; that ſhe had cleared Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> and ſaid ſhe had lain with one of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> but knew neither his name nor his Chamber.</p>
            <p>Now this retractation of her's before <hi>Alderman Fyfield,</hi> as it is the leſs to be credited, becauſe contrary to what ſhe had frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared before, and becauſe ſhe was not upon her Oath for any thing that appears by the <hi>Alderman's Certificate,</hi> ſo it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that at the time when <hi>Alderman Fyfield</hi> examined her, ſhe was kept private in <hi>Oxford</hi> by the procurement of Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Friends, who had paid for maintenance ſince her great Belly diſabled her from working, and conſequently may well be ſuppoſed to have a great influence and deſign upon her: And further it muſt be obſerved that <hi>Alderman Fyfield,</hi> tho he was a Juſtice of Peace, did not in taking this Examination act as ſuch; he did not ſend for the Wench before him, but very officiouſly waited upon her; and at ſuch a houſe as he knew not how to find again, he took no <hi>Depoſition</hi> upon <hi>Oath,</hi> made but a very ſuperficial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after the true Father, took no care to ſecure the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> but being Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s friends, and their Pupils <hi>Mercer,</hi> was acted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently by him and his friends to gain an acquittal of Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> from <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi>'s mouth, which ſhould have the credit of being atteſted before a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>; and yet ſhould be ordered in ſuch a manner, as not to be capable of being contradicted.</p>
            <p>The next ſtep taken by Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> and his Managers was to convey <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> quite away, to prevent her being examined in another manner, than the <hi>Alderman</hi> had done; whereby the truth with reſpect to Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> might come out, and the indirect carriage of <hi>Alderman Fyfield</hi> in this matter be made publick. She was therefore conveyed by <hi>John Wakeland,</hi> in whoſe Houſe ſhe had lodged, to one <hi>Green</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> ſeven miles from <hi>Oxford</hi>; there ſhe made ſome ſtay, and diſcovered the whole matter to <hi>Green</hi> and his Wife, as appears by their <hi>Depoſit. Lett.</hi> M <hi>&amp; Lett.</hi> N. From <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> the ſame <hi>Wakeland,</hi> who had agreed and paid for her Lodging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at <hi>Dorchester,</hi> convey'd her to <hi>Farrington,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day after ſhe came to <hi>London,</hi> looking out at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow ſhe ſpied paſſing by one of the <hi>Fellows</hi> of <hi>Exeter-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and calling to him, gave him an account of all that had paſſed. Which he imparted to the <hi>Rector</hi> by Letter: And ſhortly after by the <hi>Rector</hi>'s order went to a Juſtice of Peace in order to have her Examined, but ſhe was removed, and the Woman of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41975:6"/>
the Houſe refuſed to tell the Juſtice whither; but being threatned to be ſent to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> confeſt that <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> was about <hi>Iſlington,</hi> whither ſhe went with the <hi>Constable,</hi> and brought her before the <hi>Juſtice of Peace,</hi> before whom ſhe depoſed, That Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was the only man that ever had lain with her, and that he was Father of her Child, that after her delivery ſhe was adviſed by Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mandrel</hi> to ſay that a Gentleman of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> was the Father, which by their perſwaſion ſhe did to <hi>Alderman Fyfield,</hi> who was brought to her by Mr. <hi>Maundrel:</hi> that the reaſon which they urged to her to lay her Child to another, was becauſe elſe Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> would be expell'd: And that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ever perſwaded her to lay her Child to Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She depoſed likewiſe at the ſame time (as the Juſtice has ſince certified to the <hi>Rector</hi> by Letter) that ſhe had never taken an Oath before a Magiſtrate before.</p>
            <p>So that after all, the ſentence againſt Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was both juſt in it ſelf, being pronounced upon a full hearing and ſufficient proof; it was acknowledged by himſelf to be juſt with reſpect to his <hi>Judges</hi>; but he found fault with the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> And now the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> is made appear to have been true by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent proofs; and the whole management of the Affair in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> private at firſt, and afterwards conveying her away by Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Friends; and in perſwading her to favour Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> and lay the Child to another, is made ſo clear and undeniable by what has been ſaid, and the following proofs; that thus far at leaſt the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> have acted nothing irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but have diſcharged their duty.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> having now by the cloſe management of his Friends, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maundrel</hi> got a verbal acquittal of his guilt from <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> before a Magiſtrate, and ſecured her, as he preſumed, from telling School-tales, by cauſing her to be convey'd far enough off, thought his Reputation would ſtand fair, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what had been proved at the hearing. The next thing was to get his Sentence of Expulſion taken off; In order to which he gets an <hi>Appeal</hi> drawn up, and carries it to the <hi>Lord Biſhop of</hi> Exeter, viſitor of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> then at <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Biſhop</hi> received the <hi>Appeal</hi>; and granted two Inſtruments, the one an <hi>Inhibition,</hi> by which all farther proceedings againſt Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> are forbid, (but the ultimate Act, which the <hi>Colledge</hi> could do, was already paſt) The other an Order requiring the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> to give an account of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>ſub poenâ juris &amp; contemptûs,</hi> in order to a new determination. And together with theſe two Inſtruments came his <hi>Lordſhips</hi> Letter to the <hi>Rector,</hi> mentioning the two Inſtruments, that were ſent to be ſerv'd upon himſelf and the <hi>Senior-Fellows,</hi> and that his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41975:10"/>
to be attended, and particularly that Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maundrel</hi> ſhould be of them that were to come.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> had no notice of this till the two Inſtruments were ſerved upon them, whereby they were deprived of having op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to repreſent the matter ſo to his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> as would, in all likelyhood, have prevented his <hi>Lordſhip's</hi> interpoſing in this Affair. It was reſolved therefore that an anſwer ſhould be ſent to his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> with all due Reverence, with a true State of the caſe, both as it related to Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> and themſelves. This the <hi>Rector</hi> did in a Letter, which was preſented to his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> by three of the <hi>Fellows.</hi> It was ſaid therein that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> had by his <hi>Appealing</hi> added a new crime to his former, and a crime, for which by the ſame <hi>Statute</hi> he had incurred the ſame penalty, and that he had ſo far juſtified the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in his conviction, as to tell the <hi>Rector</hi> in the preſence of Witneſſes, that upon the Evidence diſclos'd againſt himſelf, he himſelf would have judged any other perſon guilty: The Letter proceeded, <q>
                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> We willingly acknowledge your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> our <hi>Viſitor</hi> and <hi>Patron,</hi> and ſhall upon all occaſions pay your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> all poſſible Reverence and all due obedience, and what is due our <hi>Statutes</hi> do expreſs, which that your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> at this diſtance from your own Copy may infallibly diſcover, I have tranſcribed the whole <hi>Statute.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And having then repreſented that the <hi>Statutes</hi> do not give his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> any juriſdiction to receive and determine an <hi>Appeal</hi>; then theſe words follow; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The anſwers therefore which I make to your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> two Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, can be no other then theſe; 1. Whereas your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us from proceeding any farther in the cauſe, the <hi>Statute</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready executed: Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> expell'd, and we need do no more, and we could do no leſs. 2. Whereas your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> requireth us to ſend an extract of proceedings; this we cannot do; for that we proceeded in the ſame form that the <hi>Statute</hi> preſcribes in caſe the <hi>Rector</hi> be expell'd, <hi>ſummanè, de plano, extrà strepitum Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicialem.</hi> He added how much it was a trouble to him, to do or ſay any thing, that might diſpleaſe a perſon to whom he owed ſo much honour and reverence, but comforted himſelf with the hopes that his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> would ere long juſtify him in the performance of his duty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is reaſon to believe that this decent Letter of the <hi>Rector,</hi> and the Reaſons therein contained had ſome influence upon his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> for that he forbare any farther proceedings for ſome months: But at laſt Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> is <hi>Commiſſionated</hi> to receive and determine Mr. <hi>Colmer's appeal</hi> in a formal viſitation.</p>

And when he went away from the houſe, he caus'd to be hung up at the <hi>Chappel door</hi> a <hi>Citation,</hi> requiring the <hi>Rector</hi> and the <hi>Senior-Fellows</hi> by name, to appear on <hi>Saturday</hi> in the <hi>Chappel,</hi> and a time in the forenoon was aſſigned.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Senior Fellows</hi> attended at the time and place, where the <hi>Rector</hi> acknowledg'd the Obedience due to the <hi>Viſitor</hi> both in perſon, and by Deputy, ſubmitted to his Authority, and ſpoke otherwiſe reſpectively of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and ſuitably to the occaſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> then was for adjourning till <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed that the Statute of Viſitation allow'd but three days at moſt, and thoſe <hi>proximé ſequentes,</hi> he adjourn'd to the Afternoon; where the <hi>Commiſſary</hi> took care to have the Doors open contrary to the intent of the <hi>Statutes.</hi> When he was proceeding to Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s caſe the <hi>Rector</hi> and Major part of the ſeven <hi>Seniors</hi> tendred him a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation</hi> againſt his proceeding therein. Which he accepted, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be enter'd: and promiſed, if they thought fit to make any additions, that they ſhould be inſerted. Some debates then aroſe and the <hi>Rector</hi> pray'd another day becauſe he had ſent for two other <hi>Senior Fellows,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding both <hi>Proteſtations</hi> were admitted, the <hi>Commiſſary</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; gave ſentence for Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> to be reſtored, awarded him twenty Marks for Coſts, and wrote his name in the Book with his own hand.

               <p>Though the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> did not acknowledge Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> to be a Rightful Fellow of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> having been legally expelled, and no otherwiſe reſtor'd then as aforeſaid, yet after the <hi>Viſitation</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they did not preſently ſtrike his name out of the Book, nor was he diſturb'd in his poſſeſſion.

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41975:11"/>This ſecond accuſation, though for a fact precedent to the former, was for incontinence with one <hi>Anne Aris,</hi> who had been a Bed-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's Daughter belonging to the <hi>Colledge:</hi> She had formerly laid her Child to <hi>Ferdinand Smith,</hi> but had confeſt privately to her Mother <hi>Elizabeth Buckland,</hi> and in the hearing of her Siſter <hi>Joyce Aris,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> had lain with her as well as <hi>Smith</hi>; they two told it to <hi>Francis Buckland</hi> the Father-in-law. But the Mother having a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the <hi>Colledge,</hi> took care not to have it go out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, for fear of loſing her Employment; and when her Daughters time drew near, ſtrictly charged her, and ſo did her Siſter, to be ſure ſhe ſaid nothing of Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> when under the Midwife's hands: She took their counſel, and named <hi>Smith</hi> only. Her Mother was afterward troubled that ſhe had prevented her Daughter from telling the truth, and eſpecially when ſhe ſaw what diſturbance had been occaſioned in the <hi>Colledge</hi> through Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s means, which might have been prevented, if ſhe had let the truth come out at firſt; ſhe therefore took occaſion to diſcharge her mind, and confeſt the whole matter. Upon which <hi>Ann Aris</hi> was Examined before a Juſtice of Peace, and declared as in her Depoſition. Her Mother and Siſter likewiſe depoſed that ſhe had told them two Months before her lying in, according to the contents of her Oath, and that they had perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rector</hi> having theſe Proofs, Conven'd the Seven <hi>Senior Fellows,</hi> and ſummon'd Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> who appear'd.

The matter being then opened, Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have the Sentence of Dr. <hi>Maſter's</hi> own'd and ſubmitted to, and the Money paid that was awarded him for Coſts; otherwiſe he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to anſwer, and after ſome Diſcourſe withdrew.

And ſhortly after came, the <hi>Gates</hi> being violently broken open to make way for him, he went to the <hi>Hall,</hi> where there was a great crowd of people: Yet the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> got in with much a do as their names were reading, and as they had don before, tendred their <hi>Proteſtation</hi>; which one of the <hi>Senior-Fellows</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to read, but was not ſuffered to go on: Whereupon the <hi>Rector</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it in at the Table, and he and his party withdrew.

               <p>Here it is to be obſerv'd that the <hi>Fellows,</hi> who ſubmitted, tho then ſworn to preſent (amongſt other things) any that was but ſuſpected of in continency, yet did not preſent Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> tho it was noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly known, that he had been twice expell'd for that crime, upon the Grounds and Evidence above-mention'd.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Lordſhip</hi> having clear'd his way by removing thoſe <hi>Fellows,</hi> whom the <hi>Statutes</hi> make the proper Judges in the <hi>Rector's</hi> caſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with his new party to deprive the <hi>Rector</hi>;<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe ſevere and unſtatutable proceedings the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi> (according to the preſident the <hi>Biſhop</hi> had given them in his one caſe) humbly repreſented their grievances to her <hi>Majeſty</hi> in <hi>Council,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Honourable Board</hi> cauſed an <hi>Order</hi> to be ſent to him, to give his anſwer in writing, which was ſerved accordingly. But his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> has not thought fit to appear and anſwer as yet.</p>
               <p>The very ſame day in which this <hi>Order of Council</hi> came out, <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>Eight</hi> of the <hi>Senior-Fellows</hi> (all the reſt with the Officers to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Eleven</hi> being ſuſpended) broke open the Chappel door contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Statutes, and proceeded to the Election of a new <hi>Rector.</hi>

               <p n="1">§. 1.

And what then? Becauſe ſhe had ſaid ſuch words to ſome of Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> friends in private, when ſhe was removed out of the way by his means, and maintain'd at his charge; ſhall this be thought ſufficient to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe what ſhe had confeſt to her Dame long before? the truth of which Confeſſion appear'd by ſo many concomitant proofs, as that of Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> putting the Overſeer of the Pariſh upon taking <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand Smith's</hi> ſecurity, and promiſing the Pariſh ſhould not be damnified; that of Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> maintaining her when ſhe was big with Child?
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41975:15"/>
that of <hi>Ferdinand Smith's</hi> refuſing to name who was the Father, becauſe a Gentleman would be expell'd; which by all circumſtances appear'd to be Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> and not ſo much as denying that it was he? that of the <hi>Midwife's</hi> declaring that when <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> was in Labour, her Dame <hi>Thomaſin Smith</hi> deſired her not to urge her to name the Father; becauſe ſhe had named him to her; who was no other then Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?</hi> with divers other Proofs and Circumſtances aforementioned; of which it is far from being the leaſt, that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> did not produce <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> at the hearing to clear his innocence, which he had time enough to have done, and would unqueſtionably have done it, if he had not been guilty? Not to mention over again the character of his Life and converſation, which ſtrengthened the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that was brought againſt him.</p>
               <p>From this Sentence Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> appeal'd to the <hi>Viſitor.</hi> The <hi>legality</hi> of which <hi>Appeal</hi> is now to be enquired into; I ſhall endeavour, 1. To prove that no <hi>Appeal</hi> lies from a Sentence of Expulſion pronounc't as aforeſaid, and then ſhall give an Anſwer to what is urged by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Account,</hi> &amp;c. to prove that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> might lawfully appeal.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That the Statutes of a <hi>Colledge</hi> are the <hi>local Laws</hi> of the Society, and binding to all Members thereof, as ſuch, cannot be denied; and that the Power and Authority of all ſuch as have any ſhare in the Government of ſuch a Society, muſt be warranted by thoſe local Laws, is ſo evident that there needs nothing to be alledg'd in proof of it; and that if any perſon who by the Statutes has authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Colledge, accroaches to himſelf a Juriſdiction not only not warranted by the Statutes, but directly contrary to them, he invades the Rights and Priviledges of a Colledge over which he uſurpes ſuch pretended Juriſdiction, and both may and muſt be oppoſed therein by ſuch of the Colledge, who have any regard to the ſolemn Oath they have taken, to obſerve faithfully, themſelves, and as far as in them lies to cauſe to be obſerved by others, <hi>Omnia &amp; ſingula Statuta, decreta &amp; conſuetudines Collegii.</hi> vid. <hi>The Fellows Oath</hi> in ſine.</p>
               <p>Now that one Statute of the Colledge provides there ſhall be no Appeal at all from a Sentence of Expulſion pronounc'd by the Rector, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for <hi>Incontinency</hi> appears by the laſt mention'd Statute <hi>de Admiſſione eorum,</hi> &amp;c. and the Oath thereby preſcribed, as plain as words can make a thing. The words are univerſal and comprehenſive, and ſuch as will admit of no exception; <hi>nunquam perſequar, moleſtabo nec inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale, per me vel per alios.</hi> How does this conſiſt with carrying a complaint againſt the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Senior Follows,</hi> and getting them cited and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd as Criminals, and fined for their Sentence?

May a Fellow that's expell'd as aforeſaid, and has ſworn not to procure <hi>quaſcunque litteras Principum, Prelatorum, &amp;c.</hi> procure Letters and Inſtruments from the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> notwithſtanding? Are not the words, <hi>quibuslibet Juris &amp; facti remediis,</hi> as full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive as the wit of man could invent to impoſe an acquieſcence in the Sentence, without having recourſe to a ſuperior Judge to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a rehearing? Is it not a Reflexion on the <hi>Founder</hi>'s underſtanding to ſuppoſe that he would make uſe of ſo many general and emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal phraſes to exclude ſeeking relief againſt a Sentence pronounc'd as aforeſaid, and not add a word to except an <hi>Appeal</hi> to the <hi>Viſitor,</hi> if at the ſame time it was not his intention to exclude ſuch <hi>Appeals?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being the plain and obvious ſenſe of the words to exclude an <hi>Appeal</hi> to the <hi>Viſitor,</hi> as well as to any foreign Juriſdiction what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; nay the words importing it ſo violently that without adding an imaginary Exception, or ſuppoſing the <hi>Founder</hi> not able to expreſs his mind in proper terms, they cannot be otherwiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And that it was his intention and the deſign of enjoyning this Oath, to exclude the <hi>Viſitor</hi>'s Juriſdiction as well as that of any other perſon, or Court, as far as it was poſſible for him to do, will appear farther by taking notice what proviſion is made in other Statutes for the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ending of Controverſies ariſing within the Colledge. By the <hi>Stat. de cauſis propter quas Scholares, &amp;c.</hi> it is appointed that in caſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ariſe betwixt the Scholars or any other reſiding within the Colledge, and that the parties at variance do not agree within a day, nor that the <hi>Rector,</hi> or in his abſence the <hi>Sub-Rector,</hi> and three of the <hi>maximè Seniores</hi> determine it within two days, then the <hi>Rector</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Sub Rector,</hi> the <hi>Dean,</hi> and <hi>five Seniors,</hi> ſhall within three days next after <hi>Summariè &amp; de plano eam (diſcordiam,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>examinare,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et quicquid Rector cum predictis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>duxerit ordinandum, executioni abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que contradictione cujuſcunque demandetur.

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41975:16"/>
But it may be the <hi>Viſitor</hi>'s power may be let in notwithſtanding theſe words, for he will pretend to be no <hi>Judex Extrinſecus.</hi> No, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what follows that every perſon whatſoever, who is neither <hi>Rector, Sub-Rector, Dean,</hi> nor one of the <hi>Senior Fellows</hi> is a <hi>Judex extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecus,</hi> within the meaning of this Statute, <hi>Sed volumus omnino, quod hujuſmodi jurgia, irae, rixae, diſcordiae, &amp; diſſenſiones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>per perſonas praedictas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>terminentur &amp; finiantur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner differences ariſing betwixt the <hi>Rector</hi> and the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, if not determined within twenty days by the <hi>Sub-Rector,</hi> the <hi>Dean,</hi> and three of the <hi>Maximè Seniores,</hi> are to be determined by the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> of the Univerſity, or the <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> or his <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> to whoſe determination the <hi>Rector</hi> is to ſtand, <hi>Et eidem ſine contradictione parere.</hi> Stat. de Jur.

               <p>If the <hi>Rector</hi> be Statutably expell'd, he is bound by his Oath, in like manner, as the Fellows are, not to ſeek any remedy by <hi>Appeal</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; <hi>Vid. Stat. de Elect. &amp; Juram. Rector.</hi> Nor is it poſſible for him to <hi>appeal</hi> to the <hi>Viſitor,</hi> for that by the <hi>Stat.

               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe proofs that <hi>Appeals</hi> are excluded, which are grounded upon the words of the Statutes themſelves, we have a ſubſequent proof of what we aſſert, which though it be a negative one, yet in this caſe is as forcible as any affirmative proof whatſoever; and that is, that till this late <hi>Appeal</hi> in Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s caſe, there never was any <hi>Appeal</hi> to the <hi>Viſitor</hi> from the ſentence of the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows.</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent practice is always held to be the trueſt Expoſitor of the meaning of a Law; they that lived neareſt to the time when it was made, are reaſonably ſuppoſed to have underſtood the intention of the Law-giver beſt.</p>

               <p>I ſhall add one Obſervation more grounded upon the <hi>Probationer</hi>'s Oath, which with reſpect to the matter in hand differs very little in words, and I ſuppoſe not at all in ſenſe from this of the <hi>Fellows.</hi> There are theſe words in it, <hi>Omni actioni ſeculari, canonicae &amp; civili, appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onique &amp; querelae in eâ parte faciendae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et quibus libet Juris &amp; facti remediis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in vim pacti renuncio expreſſè in praeſenti, &amp; renunciabo in Scriptis, ſi exactus fuero in meâ expulſione.</hi> Although this promiſe to renounce in writing, if required, be not inſerted into the <hi>Fellows</hi> Oath, yet I preſume it will not be denied but a renunciation by a promiſſory Oath <hi>in vim pacti,</hi> is and was deſign'd by the <hi>Founder</hi> to <hi>be</hi> a renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo far forth as a man can renounce by Oath, of all the remedies that ſuch a renunciation <hi>in ſcriptis</hi> would have precluded him from. And then if Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> could not have had his <hi>Appeal,</hi> in caſe he had renounc'd <hi>in ſcriptis</hi>; no more could he proſecute it now, without breaking his Oath.</p>
               <p>Thus far from the Letter of the <hi>Statute,</hi> taken in that <hi>plain Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſenſe</hi> in which they direct themſelves to be underſtood, from the deſign of the <hi>Founder</hi> collected from ſome Obſervations upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Statutes, and from ſubſequent uſage, it has been ſhewn that <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals</hi> to the <hi>Viſitor</hi> are excluded in the caſe in queſtion.</p>
               <p>The reaſon and policy of his confining the Government of the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and the determining of all Controverſies that ſhould ariſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame, to the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Rector, Sub-Rector,</hi> the <hi>Dean,</hi> and the <hi>Senior Fellows,</hi> excepting where the Power of the <hi>Viſitor,</hi> or of the <hi>Chancellor, Vice-chancellor,</hi> &amp;c. is expreſly let in, may be reaſonably ſuppos'd to have been for the peace and quiet of the Houſe: Which being a Society of perſons bred up to ſtudy, and profeſſing Divinity, ought in both reſpects to have their Government managed with as little noiſe and clamour, and as free from diſturbances, as the nature of the thing will permit. It was therefore made part of the <hi>Probationer</hi>'s Oath, <hi>Quod tranquillitatem, pacem, concordiam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>dicti Collegii &amp; Scholari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um unitatem, quantum in me fuerit &amp; ad me pertinuerit, viis &amp; modis quibus potero, obſervabo.</hi> And therefore it was, that differences ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing within the <hi>Colledge,</hi> are to be determined by the perſons autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the <hi>Statutes</hi> to take cognizance of them, <hi>Summariè &amp; de plano &amp; ſine strepitu Judiciali.</hi> But what a diſturbance would it be to ſuch a Society of men, devoted to their Studies, to be ſubjected upon the complaint of every vexatious perſon, to the noiſe and clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41975:17"/>
of a Court of <hi>Appeals? Appeals</hi> may he brought from any other <hi>Cenſures,</hi> though never ſo ſmall, as well as from a Sentence of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion</hi>; and if ſuch a door be left open, what encouragement it might give to feuds and diſſentions, is obvious enough. Perſons really criminal, and duly cenſured, might however by friends and intereſt ſometimes prevail ſo as to give great trouble to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and procure a reverſal of their moſt legal and juſt Acts. And in all likelihood the Members of the Society will be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid the committing of ſuch crimes as are puniſhable by the <hi>Statutes,</hi> when they know before hand that they can have no redreſs elſewhere, if <hi>cenſured</hi> at home. And thoſe of the Society muſt needs be diſcouraged from doing their duty, and keeping a ſtrict Diſcipline, if they find themſelves in danger to be called to an account for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Act of Juriſdiction that they exert, and puniſhed for it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this the <hi>Author of the Account</hi> will have it that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> might lawfully <hi>Appeal,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Exeter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and proceed thereupon as he has done.</p>
               <p>The next thing therefore to be done, is to examine what is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to juſtify a thing that appears ſo directly contrary to the words of the <hi>Statutes,</hi> and to the <hi>Founder's</hi> intention. Why, the opinion of Dr. <hi>Bouchier</hi> is delivered to us, and the reaſons upon which he grounded it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, The Oath being acceſſary to the Statutes did only restrain thoſe perſons from vexatious appeals,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>who were expell'd according to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and direction of the Statute, and according to the form therein laid down and preſcribed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he means by the <hi>Oath being acceſſary</hi> to the <hi>Statute,</hi> I ſhall leave it to himſelf to explain. I take the Oath it ſelf, ſince the very words of it are inſerted into a <hi>Statute,</hi> to be as much part of the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Exeter-Colledge,</hi> as any thing elſe in them is. An <hi>Oath</hi> impoſed by an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> is part of the <hi>Act,</hi> and the words of it diſcloſe the mind of the Legiſlators as much as any thing contained in the body of the <hi>Act,</hi> or of any other <hi>Act,</hi> to which the <hi>Oath</hi> (to uſe the <hi>Author's</hi> expreſſion) may be ſaid to be <hi>acceſſary,</hi> can do. But that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the <hi>Author</hi> was this; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Stat. de cauſis propter quas Scholares,</hi> &amp;c. impowers the <hi>Rector</hi> &amp;c. to expel a <hi>Fellow</hi> that is <hi>legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timè convictus,</hi> &amp;c. And this <hi>Oath</hi> (ſays he) is <hi>acceſſary</hi> to that <hi>Statute,</hi> and therefore does not tie up the perſon expell'd from <hi>Appealing,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be <hi>legitimè convictus.</hi> Whether Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was <hi>legitimè con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victus</hi> or no within the intention of the <hi>Founder,</hi> we ſhall enquire by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41975:18"/>
and by. But this fallacy, of the <hi>Oath</hi> being <hi>acceſſary</hi> (as he calls it) to this <hi>Statute,</hi> muſt not eſcape without a detection. When an <hi>Oath</hi> is impoſed by a Law upon ſuch as Act by Vertue thereof, or are bound by it, to put it in execution or to obey accordingly, there the <hi>Oath</hi> is relative to the Law, and the Obligation of it reaches no farther then the Law carries it. But where an <hi>Oath</hi> is impoſed by a ſeparate diſtinct Law, without any ſuch relation, there the Law that impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Oath</hi> creates a duty of performing it in the genuine ſenſe, that the words import, and in this caſe of ours, in the <hi>plain, litteral</hi> and <hi>Grammatical ſenſe.</hi> If there were a <hi>Statute</hi> of the <hi>Colledge</hi> concerning <hi>Appeals,</hi> allowing them in ſome caſes, and reſtraining them in others; and an <hi>Oath</hi> enjoyned to obſerve the <hi>Statutes,</hi> or that <hi>Statute</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, there the <hi>Oath</hi> would be what the <hi>Author</hi> calls <hi>acceſſary.</hi> But in this caſe, there is no proviſion made by any clauſe in any <hi>Statute</hi> for <hi>Appeals</hi> at all; but particular directions for the final ending of controverſies and puniſhing offences within the <hi>Colledge</hi>; and an <hi>Oath</hi> impoſed to acquieſce in ſuch determination.</p>
               <p>To prove that one may appeal, if not expell'd according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and direction of the <hi>Statute,</hi> he quotes a clauſe out of the <hi>Probationer's Oath; ſi contingat me (quod abſit) juxta formam &amp; exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam ſtatutorum a praedicto Collegio expelli ſeu amoveri,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nunquam,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas the queſtion is upon the <hi>Fellow's Oath,</hi> in which thoſe words <hi>ſecundum formam &amp; exigentiam Statutorum</hi> do not occur. Tho if they were there, it would not alter the caſe much, unleſs it was made appear that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was not Statutably Expell'd. He was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the Perſons, that have authority by the <hi>Statutes</hi> to Expell, and for a crime that by the <hi>Statutes</hi> deſerves Expulſion, ſo that the <hi>forma &amp; exigentia</hi> was at leaſt ſo far obſerv'd. And if it were ſcrew'd farther and made to extend to the merits of the cauſe; then it were impertinent to impoſe an <hi>Oath</hi> not to <hi>Appeal,</hi> and at the ſame time to leave men at liberty to <hi>Appeal</hi> when ever they find or think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves aggrieved.</p>
               <p>His <hi>ſecond Argument</hi> is, that the <hi>Statute</hi> requires a legal conviction. <hi>legitimè convictus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If the Founder had required what we call a <hi>legal conviction,</hi> he would I preſume have uſed the word <hi>legalitèr</hi> or <hi>ſecundum legem terrae</hi> or the like; <hi>legitimè</hi> not being a word that enforces a reference to the <hi>Common-Law.</hi> If he had required a <hi>legal conviction,</hi> he would not have directed the proſecution to be before perſons that cannot in a ſtrict acceptation of the word, <hi>legally convict,</hi> A <hi>legal conviction</hi> is upon <hi>Oath,</hi> which the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Senior-Fellows</hi> have no power
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41975:18"/>
to adminiſter, and ſome of the crimes mention'd in the <hi>Stat. de cauſis propter quas Scholares,</hi> &amp;c. are ſuch as a man cannot be <hi>legally convicted</hi> of but by Jury; as <hi>willful man-ſlaughter, manifeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi> &amp;c. and yet of theſe a Scholar may be <hi>legitimè convictus</hi> within the intention of the Statute <hi>Coram Rectore,</hi> &amp;c. who cannot impannel a Jury. So that the word <hi>legitimè convictus</hi> cannot in the nature of the thing import the ſtrictneſs and formality of a <hi>legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi>; But (ſays he) <hi>the proofs were ſo far from making a legal convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Proofs making a conviction</hi> is another of his Expreſſions, that no body elſe would have uſed.</p>
               <p>It is the Verdict of a Jury or the Sentence of a Judge that makes the <hi>conviction; Proofs</hi> are but Evidence; and a man may be <hi>legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict</hi> without them, as when a Jury finds a Verdict upon their own knowledge. But according to this Gentleman's interpretation of the <hi>Statute</hi> the word <hi>legitimè convictus</hi> muſt ſignifie convicted upon ſuch proof, as would upon a Tryal at Law be ſufficient legal proof to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict, and every man that is not ſo convicted, may appeal. Which as it is a new-fangled Interpretatton, and ſcarce deſerves an anſwer; So it is contrary to the common acceptation of words. A <hi>legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> (which he would have the words of the <hi>Statute</hi> Import) may be, tho the Evidence be deficient, and the Jury corrupt, as a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Court in a cauſe depending before them judicially, is a <hi>legal</hi> judgment, tho there be error in it. Every Verdict in a criminal cauſe is <hi>legale judicium parium</hi>; and is ſo true in the eye of the Law, that the party convicted has no remedy, tho he be wronged, for there lies no <hi>Attaint</hi> in criminal matters. So the Sentence of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> in Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> caſe was, <hi>legitima convictio,</hi> becauſe they had conuſance of his cauſe; and as the Law of the Realm cuts off <hi>Appeals</hi> from the Verdict of a Jury in criminal cauſes, ſo do the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>Colledge</hi> bar all <hi>Appeals</hi> from ſuch a Sentence.</p>
               <p>Words are to be underſtood <hi>ſecundum ſubjectam materiam</hi>; the word <hi>proof</hi> generally ſpeaking is underſtood of proof by <hi>Jury,</hi> which is the Common-Law trial; but how many Caſes have we in our Books in which that word is otherwiſe taken, becauſe determin'd ſo by the ſubject matter? <hi>Legitimè convictus</hi> in the <hi>Statutes</hi> of a Colledge muſt of neceſſity be underſtood of ſuch a Conviction as the Statutes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. But the Statutes neither do require, nor can preſcribe what we call a <hi>Legal Conviction,</hi> becauſe they cannot inveſt the <hi>Rector,</hi> &amp;c. with authority to hold a <hi>Court,</hi> and adminiſter Juſtice according to Law.</p>
               <p>But for a full and clear anſwer (if what has been ſaid do not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) let us examine how the word <hi>Legitimè</hi> is apply'd in other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; and hear the Founder explaining himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41975:19"/>In the Statute <hi>de Elect. Rector. &amp; ejus juramento,</hi> we find the word <hi>Legitimè</hi> twice uſed; 1. Where all Scholars <hi>in nominationibus, electio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, admiſſionibus, aliiſve negotiis utilitatem Collegii concernentibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>intereſſe habentes, ac rite &amp;</hi> legitimè <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem vocati &amp; requiſiti,</hi> and then refuſing to give their Votes for the <hi>Election</hi> of a new <hi>Rector,</hi> are ſubjected to a penalty. Here the word <hi>legitimè</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by <hi>per conſuetudinem,</hi> the cuſtom of the Colledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Before they proceed to <hi>Election</hi> the <hi>Statute</hi> muſt be read <hi>per Subrectorem, aut eo abſente vel</hi> legitimè impedito, <hi>per Scholarem maximê Seniorem,</hi> &amp;c. here <hi>legitimè impediri</hi> imports a reaſonable cauſe of abſence.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> In the <hi>Statute de ſedendo ad menſam; Battellarii nec in aulâ nec alibi intrà Collegium abſque cauſa</hi> legitima <hi>&amp; approbata, alium quam La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinum aut Grecum exercitent ſermonem ſub paenâ pro arbitrio Rectoris injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendâ.</hi> Here <hi>cauſa legitima</hi> is ſuch a cauſe as the <hi>Rector</hi> ſhall allow to be a reaſonable cauſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> In the <hi>Statute de ordinationibus bis in Anno ad minis legendis,</hi> it is provided, That if any of the Scholars be abſent from the Reading of the Statutes, <hi>impedimento</hi> legitimo <hi>ceſſante, per eum qui convocavit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probando,</hi> ſuch abſent Scholar ſhall be turn'd out of Commons for fifteen days. Here <hi>impedimentum legitimum,</hi> is ſuch hindrance as the <hi>Rector,</hi> or in his abſence the <hi>Sub-Rector</hi> ſhall allow to be a reaſonable cauſe of Excuſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By the <hi>Statute de Pernoctatione,</hi> if a Scholar offend the fourth time in that kind and be thereof, Legitimè <hi>convictus Judicio Rectoris &amp; quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que aliorum maximè Seniorum vel majoris partis eorundem,</hi> &amp;c. he is to be <hi>expell'd.</hi> Here a lawful conviction is a conviction upon ſuch a proof of his guilt as ſhall ſatisfie the judgment of the <hi>Rector,</hi> and the more part of the <hi>five Senior Fellows.</hi> And in the common acceptation of words, <hi>Coram Rectore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; quinque aliis Scholaribus maximè Senioribus</hi> in the <hi>Stat. de cauſis propter quas Scholares,</hi> &amp;c. is the ſame there with <hi>Judicio Rectoris &amp; quinque aliorum,</hi> &amp;c. here.</p>
               <p>Now ſince it appears by theſe Inſtances, that the word <hi>legitimè</hi> had not in the <hi>Founder</hi>'s intention any relation to what in ſtrictneſs of ſpeech we call <hi>legal</hi>; why ſhould we tye it up to that ſenſe in the caſe in queſtion? Eſpecially ſince in the <hi>Statute</hi> for the Expulſion of the <hi>Rector, ſufficientes informationes</hi> are all that are required, and the ſufficiency of them muſt reſt in the judgment of the perſons that are impowered to expell him, becauſe he is debarr'd of any <hi>Appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:41975:19"/>His third Argument is, That in the <hi>Oath</hi> it ſelf, the word <hi>mea</hi> ſhews plainly, that the <hi>demerita</hi> muſt be in a true, and not in an imputed ſenſe. The Engliſh of which I take to be, if the Author would deliver himſelf in ſuch words as other men uſe, That if a man be expell'd for a Crime, of which he is really not guilty, he may <hi>appeal,</hi> notwithſtanding his <hi>Oath,</hi> becauſe of the words <hi>propter mea demerita</hi>; and a man that is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, is not expell'd for <hi>his</hi> demerits.</p>
               <p>Yes, a man that is indicted of Felony, and convicted and executed, tho innocent, ſuffers for <hi>his</hi> Crime. When a man has undergone ſuch a Trial as the Law requires, and is convicted, in the eye of the Law he is guilty, and muſt undergo whatever the Law inflicts, for a Crime that the Law ſays is <hi>his.</hi> But it is a fooliſh and childiſh quibble to catch at the word <hi>mea,</hi> and apply it as the Doctor has done: If the words <hi>propter mea demerita</hi> had been left out, yet all men would have underſtood the <hi>Expulſion</hi> ſpoken of to be meant of an Expulſion for an <hi>Offence</hi>; and then <hi>expreſſio eorum quae tacitè inſunt nibil operatur.</hi> Nor does he act fairly, in quoting the words <hi>mea demerita,</hi> without the word <hi>forſan:</hi> The Oath runs, <hi>propter mea forſan demerita</hi>; ſo that the Founder conſidered, that tho a perſon ought not to be expelled but for his demerits, yet ſo it might fall out, that a perſon expell'd might be innocent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and otherwiſe of good worth and fame; <hi>quantum cunque aliàs mihi probitatis &amp; vitae merita ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentur</hi>: in which caſe, for peace and quiet ſake, he requires an <hi>Oath</hi> to ſubmit to the Sentence, ſo far forth as not to call the perſons that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd it, in queſtion for it before any Court or Judge whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But this miſchief would follow,<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>if a perſon that is innocent of the Crime objected,</hi> might not <hi>appeal</hi>; viz. <hi>He muſt be forc'd to own That by virtue of his Oath, whereof he is not guilty; which were great impiety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I can ſee no ſuch Conſequence as that: If I am bound or ſworn to ſubmit to an Award, as I am equally concluded by it, whether it be juſt or unjuſt, ſo my ſubmitting to it is no confeſſion or acknowledgment on my part, that it is juſt, but proceeds from the obligation that I have put my ſelf under, to be concluded by it, right or wrong. Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> (upon a ſuppoſition of his innocence) was under no obligation by his <hi>Oath</hi> to acknowledge the Sentence <hi>juſt,</hi> or to own himſelf <hi>guilty</hi>; he might have taken all prudential methods of clearing his Reputation, without impeaching or moleſting the Perſons who pronounc'd Sentence againſt him: he might have had the Woman ſolemnly examin'd before a Magiſtrate, in his own preſence, where by many circumſtances the true Father might have been found out, and his innocence clear'd: he might have had an Action at Law againſt any of the Witneſſes; and upon the Trial the truth would, in all likelihood, have come out: he might, if injur'd, by diſcovering and acquainting the Rector and Fellows who
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41975:20"/>
expell'd him, with ſuch Evidences of his innocence as did not appear upon his Trial, have entitled himſelf to a Re-admiſſion, which would have reſtor'd him in Reputation to all intents and purpoſes. But this reaſon drawn from the word <hi>mea,</hi> &amp;c. (if there were any weight in it) would do Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> no ſervice, unleſs he were really innocent; which that he is not, I appeal to the Depoſitions and Allegations aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The fourth Reaſon is, <hi>That the plain deſign of the Oath is to ſecure the College from any Action at Law, or Diſturbance from abroad; That an Appeal to the Viſitor is not expreſly forbidden; That, in an equitable ſenſe, thoſe general words may be intended to reſtrain the Party from Appeal to an extraneous, not a domeſtick Court; to a foreign Judge, not to the Viſitor, who is a part, and the firſt Member of the College.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that the deſign of the <hi>Oath</hi> was to ſecure the College from any Action at Law, or diſturbance <hi>from abroad</hi>; and as true, that the diſturbance given lately to the College, was a diſturbance <hi>from abroad:</hi> The Biſhop is not a Member of the College; he has no Name in the Book, nor Seat in the Chappel, nor any Lodging in the Houſe, not ſo much as when he comes to Viſit. All Judges, but the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>ſeven ſenior Fellows,</hi> are <hi>Judices extranei,</hi> within the intention of the Founder, as has been obſerv'd already from the Statute, <hi>De cauſis, propter quas ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares, &amp;c.</hi> where <hi>aliquis Judex extrinſecus Eccleſiaſticus vel Saecularis,</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſed to the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>ſenior Fellows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That an Appeal to the <hi>Viſitor</hi> is not expreſly mention'd, is true; that is, it is not mentioned by name: but it is as expreſly forbidden, as if it had been named; as expreſly as the Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther,</hi> forbids <hi>John a Stiles</hi> to commit Murther. The Author had read a Rule in Law, That the Juriſdiction of rhe <hi>King's Courts</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> is not excluded by an Act of Parliament, unleſs they be named; and this he applies to the Power of a <hi>Viſitor.</hi> Whereas thoſe Courts are of Ancient and General Juriſdiction, which therefore is not ſuppoſed to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, unleſs by name: But the Power of a Viſitor is created and limited by the Statutes of the College, and can therefore claim no ſuch exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the general words, whereby <hi>all Appeals</hi> are renounced. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he urges, That an Appeal to the Viſitor was moſt obvious to be thought on, and would therefore have been mentioned, if deſigned to be precluded: I may with better reaſon turn it upon himſelf; If it was ſo obvious to be thought on, it would have been excepted, if not deſigned to be reſtrained, as well as other foreign Remedies.</p>
               <p>The fifth Argument is, <hi>Becauſe theſe Interpretations of the Oath are moſt conſonant to Law, and leaſt tending to eſtabliſh Arbitrary Power, and to exclude legal Remedies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:41975:20"/>It has been ſaid already, That the Oath is to be taked in the <hi>plain, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral,</hi> and <hi>grammatical</hi> ſenſe, from which the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> are ſworn not to depart; and therefore it is in vain in this Caſe to urge ſpecious pretences of what may ſeem in the Author's Opinion conſonant to Law. The urging of inconveniences, is quarrelling with the Oath it ſelf, as if it needed mending. We muſt now take it as it is, and it muſt and ought to be obſerved according to the <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>grammatical ſenſe,</hi> unleſs that ſenſe be directly contrary to Law; which it is not. It is not againſt the Law for a man to wave his right of <hi>Appealing,</hi> no more than it is againſt Law for a man to give a <hi>releaſe of Errors.</hi> A man may <hi>cedere Jure ſuo. Quilibet poteſt renunciare Juri pro ſe introducto.</hi> If an <hi>Appeal</hi> would lie to the <hi>Viſitor,</hi> in caſe this <hi>Oath</hi> had not been enjoin'd, then a renunciation <hi>quomodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet appellationi in vim pacti,</hi> is a renunciation of that remedy. The Founder muſt be allow'd to grant his Benefaction on his own terms: <hi>Cujus eſt dare ejus eſt diſponere.</hi> And now this is the true ſtate of the preſent Caſe. A <hi>Fellow</hi> is admitted upon this Condition, amongſt others, That in caſe he ſhall be expell'd by the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>ſeven Seniors,</hi> he ſhall never give them nor the <hi>College</hi> any trouble, by ſeeking remedy elſewhere. His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a Fellowſhip with this promiſe, is therefore called a <hi>Pactum</hi> in the very Oath; <hi>quomodolibet appellationi</hi> in vim pacti <hi>renuncio.</hi> I cannot but obſerve how theſe words are conceal'd by an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the late Pamphlet: they ſeem'd to carry ſuch a force along with them, as the Author was not willing a Reader ſhould take notice of. Tho if it ſhould be admitted that a perſon expell'd as aforeſaid, is not precluded from ſeeking remedy by Law; and that ſo private a Conſtitution as that of a particular Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, does not, nor can exclude the Juriſdiction of the <hi>King's Courts:</hi> yet it cannot in this Caſe but exclude an <hi>Appeal</hi> to the <hi>Viſitor,</hi> whoſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is grounded upon, and created by the Statutes themſelves. And can it be conceived, that a <hi>Founder</hi> would inveſt the <hi>Viſitor</hi> with a Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Appeals, and at the ſame time lay an Obligation by Oath upon all of his Foundation not to bring any?</p>
               <p>What is ſaid concerning <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> is ridiculous: <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> is power exerciſed without or againſt Law; but the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> have Power by their Statutes, and thoſe confirm'd by Letters-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; and they are under an <hi>Oath</hi> to obſerve their Statutes, and to act according to the direction and intent of them. And why ſhould it be thought, that the Judgment of eight Divines, and under an Oath, ſhould be more arbitrary than that of a ſingle Commiſſary, not ſworn at all?</p>
               <p>As for the excluſion of <hi>legal</hi> Remedies, a man may, to be ſure, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude himſelf of them; and if a renunciation <hi>quibuſlibet Juris remediis,</hi> does not preclude him as far as words can do it, I know not what words can. This Conſtitution, perhaps, does not reſtrain the Juriſdiction of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41975:21"/>
the Courts of Law; but it certainly makes him perjur'd, that having taken this <hi>Oath,</hi> ſhall apply himſelf to them for redreſs. And where is the Juſtice in allowing a man legal remedies againſt wrong-doing, when he has quitted them of his own accord? When a man has ſubmitted to a <hi>Rule of Court</hi> not to bring a <hi>Writ of Error,</hi> or a <hi>Bill in Equity</hi>; does he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo any hardſhip by being bound to obey it, tho there be <hi>Error</hi> in the Judgment, or tho he might have had relief in Equity, had he not tied himſelf up from ſeeking it? Tho there is little reaſon from the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to apprehend that wrong will be done. And it is every whit as reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and perhaps much more ſo, that <hi>one Fellow</hi> ſhould acquieſce in the Sentence of the College, than that the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Seniors</hi> ſhould, upon his Complaint, be called before another Judge, to whom they muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit without <hi>Appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be remembred too, That tho the Founder has taken good care that none of the Fellows may receive wrong, yet he was concern'd to do it in ſuch a manner, as that no Grievance, Prejudice, or Diſturbance might accrue to the Society, in caſe any ſuch wrong ſhould happen. The Common Good and Intereſt of the Whole was the chief End of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation: and for a Private Intereſt to give place to a Publick Good, is not only reaſonable in it ſelf, but abſolutely neceſſary for the ſupport of all Communities.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to give an Anſwer to the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s five Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why an <hi>Appeal</hi> ſhould lie.</p>
               <p>The next thing our Author does, is to acquaint us with the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon which his Lordſhip grounded his Opinion, That an <hi>Appeal</hi> lay to himſelf; and that, as <hi>Ordinary,</hi> He was the proper Judge of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note>The firſt is, <hi>Since a Fellow may appeal, there muſt be a competent Judge of the Appeal; and not only no other intermediate Judge can be aſſign'd, but all other Judges are, in Cauſes relating to the College, expreſly excluded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be not contrary to the Statutes for a Fellow to appeal, there muſt be a competent Judge of the Appeal: But I have endeavoured to prove, and hope I have made it clear, That a Fellow may not appeal. And a farther Argument may be drawn for it, from the <hi>Founder</hi>'s not having appointed a Judge to receive and determine an Appeal; which without queſtion he would have done, if he had not intended there ſhould be no Appeals; for he is very particular in directing how and by whom the ſeveral Controverſies and Differences, that may ariſe within the Society, ſhall be compoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All other Judges are excluded by Statute.</hi> What are they excluded from? Why, from receiving Appeals. If all other Judges <hi>beſides the Biſhop of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41975:21"/>
Exeter</hi> had been expreſly by Statute excluded from receiving Appeals, it would be very ſtrong on his Lordſhip's ſide, that he might receive them: But the Statute that is quoted for this, is the Statute <hi>de Viſitatione,</hi> which commits to the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and his Deputy, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

But this Statute has nothing in it concerning <hi>Appeals</hi>; and it is obſervable how hard his Lordſhip was put to it to find out a colourable pretence for his Juriſdiction.</p>

                  <hi>where no intermediate Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction is plac'd any where elſe, this, to prevent the defect of Juſtice, muſt be let in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſuch a Reaſon, as that Reſpect to his Lordſhip's Character tempts me to believe the Author has impoſed it upon him, and that his Lordſhip never entertained ſo weak a thought himſelf. The word <hi>Ordinarius</hi> is not in the Statute <hi>Subſtantivè</hi>; the Biſhop is conſtituted <hi>Ordinarius Viſitator,</hi> which in Engliſh ſignifies <hi>the Viſitor of courſe.</hi> To dream of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality of Juriſdiction,</hi> and of <hi>Epiſcopal Juriſdiction,</hi> becauſe of the ſound of a word, is a Conceit that needs no other refutation than the mentioning of it.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon is: <hi>Becauſe the words in the beginning of the Statute are general, and apt for an univerſal Proviſion; and therefore, tho the Viſitation of the whole College be reſtrain'd to Requiſition, or five years, the general words cannot be ſatisfied therewith; for there may be a Combination of the Majority of the Seniors, who only have power to deſire it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe <hi>general words</hi> that the Author urges, are but by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the <hi>particular Proviſion</hi> that is made afterwards for the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and redreſſing thoſe inconveniences that are recited in the <hi>Preamble</hi> of the Statute. The Founder takes notice; That it is impoſſible to make Laws and Statutes, which may not by ſome invented fraud be defeated of their due execution; and <hi>eam ob cauſam</hi> repoſes a confidence in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Exeter</hi> for the time being, <hi>ut ad hoc alvearium conſervandum invigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ut Statuta &amp; Ordinationes dicti Collegii firmiter obſerventur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jura, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertates &amp; privilegia defendantur &amp; protegantur.</hi> And in order to the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all this, what <hi>particular proviſion</hi> is made? Why, <hi>Eâ de causâ lieeat Domino Epiſcopo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; nulli alii nec aliis, quoties per Rectorem</hi> &amp;c. <hi>fuerit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitus, nec non abſque requiſitione ullâ de quinquennio in quinquennium ſemel, ad dictum Collegium per ſe vel ſuum Commiſſarium,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>liberè accedere.</hi> And then directs how the <hi>Viſitation</hi> ſhall be proceeded in. To argue, That
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41975:22"/>
becauſe ſome <hi>general words</hi> in the <hi>Preamble</hi> may ſeem not ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the <hi>Proviſion</hi> made in the Body of the Statute, is to find fault with the Founder, as not having provided a Plaiſter broad enough for the Sore, which muſt therefore be ſtretch'd by Conſtruction. When an Act of Parliament recites a general inconvenience, and proceeds to Enact how it ſhall be redreſſed, the Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> do not uſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the <hi>Purview</hi> farther than the Law-makers have done; but leave that to the Wiſdom of future Parliaments. It was not for nothing, that the word <hi>ſemel</hi> was inſerted. Can it be rationally ſuppoſed, that he who gave the Biſhop leave to have <hi>free acceſs</hi> to the College <hi>once</hi> in five years, <hi>ea de cauſa,</hi> that the Statutes and Ordinances thereof might be duly obſerved, would, if he had been asked the queſtion, Whether he might come oftener? have anſwered, Yes, he may come as oft as he pleaſes? He that ty'd up the requiſition to be made by the <hi>Rector,</hi> or, in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, by the <hi>Subrector,</hi> and four other ſenior Fellows <hi>at leaſt, (&amp; quatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or alios</hi> ad minus <hi>ex ſeptem maximè ſenioribus</hi>) would he, if he had been asked, Whether he might come upon the complaint of any particular Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? have anſwered, Yes, upon application made to him by any Member of the College; or without ſuch application, if he pleaſe himſelf? The Author would make a diſtinction betwixt a <hi>Viſitation</hi> of the whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and ſome other more particular <hi>Viſitation,</hi> or the Biſhop's coming to ſet ſome one Controverſie ſtreight: But the Statute <hi>de Viſitatione,</hi> which is the Law that empowers him to come at all, gives him no other Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than to come and <hi>Viſit the College</hi>; and that no oftner than as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>If his coming upon a particular occaſion, without making what the Author calls <hi>a general and ſolemn Viſitation,</hi> ſhall not bar him from coming again within <hi>five years,</hi> then he may come when he pleaſes, <hi>Viſit</hi> as oft as he liſt; and whereas the <hi>General Viſitation</hi> is ty'd up to <hi>three days,</hi> he may make his <hi>particular Viſitations</hi> hold <hi>five years</hi> apiece, and the College at that rate might never be rid of him. At that rate, the word <hi>ſemel,</hi> and the requeſt of <hi>quatuor ad minus,</hi> &amp;c. were vainly inſerted.</p>
               <p>The ſuppoſed <hi>Combination of the Majority of the Seniors,</hi> is but a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and will therefore be beſt anſwer'd by another ſuppoſition; <hi>viz.</hi> If the <hi>Viſitor</hi> come oftner than the Statutes direct, and when he is not requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the perſons who only have Authority to requeſt him; he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine with ſome reſtleſs and turbulent Spirits in the College, with Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and ſuch as cannot be ſafe under a good Diſcipline, to break in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Statutes; he may aſſume an Authority to undo whatever the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> and <hi>ſenior Fellows</hi> have done for the good of the Houſe; inſtead of taking care that the Statutes and Ordinances be firmly obſerv'd, he may liſten to the Advice of a <hi>Civilian,</hi> who may furniſh him with Diſtinctions
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41975:22"/>
to overthrow them; and theſe Proceedings of his may come to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a <hi>young Lawyer</hi> in Print, which may work in ſome unwary Heads a belief that all's well and ſtatutable, when by this means the College is brought into Confuſion.</p>
               <p>The fourth Reaſon is; <hi>The Viſitor was upon like reaſons limited to a</hi> Quinquennial, <hi>as a Biſhop to a</hi> Triennial Viſitation; viz. <hi>to prevent the Charge of</hi> Proxies <hi>and</hi> Sportulage: <hi>and therefore as a Biſhop, when barr'd from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and coſtly Viſitations, is not reſtrain'd from exerciſing the Ordinary Acts of Juriſdiction; ſo neither during the</hi> Quinquennial <hi>Term does the Viſitor's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ceaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Viſitor was limited upon like reaſons that a Biſhop was, is <hi>gratis dictum</hi>; but the difference is this, and it is very plain: The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop has an <hi>Ordinary Juriſdiction</hi> by Law all over his Dioceſe, and had before the <hi>Canon</hi> concerning <hi>Triennial Viſitations</hi> was made. But the <hi>Viſitor</hi> has no Juriſdiction nor Power at all, but by the Statutes of the College; They create his Authority, and antecedent to them he has none; and therefore what degree of Power they inveſt him with, that he has, and no more. And therefore his Power during the <hi>quinquennial Term,</hi> is a <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera,</hi> a <hi>fancy</hi>: the Government of the College during all that time is lodg'd elſewhere; and any application made to him to concern himſelf in it, is null and void, unleſs made by the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Four at leaſt</hi> of the ſeven <hi>ſenior Fellows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole then, I hope, it appears by what has been ſaid, That Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> had no grievance done him; That if he had, he had no liberty of <hi>Appealing</hi>; That the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> neither as Ordinary nor otherwiſe, is Judge of <hi>Appeals:</hi> and ought not in Juſtice to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Author of the Account,</hi> entitles his Second Section,<note place="margin">§ 2</note> 
                  <hi>Concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Biſhop and his Commiſſary upon the Appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which Subject, I ſhall not much inſiſt: for if the <hi>Appeal</hi> it ſelf was unlawful, All that was done purſuant to it, is ſo too. He takes ſome pains to free the <hi>Biſhop</hi> from any imputation of partiality to Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi> I Charge him with none. I only argue againſt his Jurisdiction. He quarrels with the <hi>Rector</hi> for denying the Juriſdiction of the Court; when all that the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> did, was only to tender a Proteſtation againſt the Commiſſaries intermedling with Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Caſe. They ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him as the <hi>Viſitors Commiſſary,</hi> and deſired him to proceed <hi>ad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Viſitationis negotia.</hi> He relates ſome extravagant Expreſſions of the <hi>Rectors,</hi> which were never ſaid by him; all that he ſaid like it, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to no more than this, That from cenſures inflicted within the College, no Redreſs was to be ſought elſewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:41975:23"/>The two Proteſtations tender'd at that time, are tranſcribed and inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the end of this Diſcourſe, to rectifie ſome miſtakes that the Author has committed, relating to this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>I paſs by alſo what he ſays concerning the Vice-Chancellor's having no Title to the Cognizance of this cauſe; the Queſtion not being here, whether the Vice-Chancellor have, or no? But whether the Viſitor?</p>
               <p>What follows, is declamation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">§ 3.</note>The third Section concerns <hi>the Offences of the Rector and others, which oblig'd the Viſitor to make his Solemn and General Viſitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Offence that he alledges, is, That as ſoon as Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was reinſtated by the Commiſſary, he was, immediately after his departure, again Expell'd, or rather Diſown'd by the <hi>Rector.</hi> For the Juſtice of this ſecond <hi>Sentence,</hi> I refer to the Relation given of it before, and the Depoſitions that were taken in the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The only Objection made againſt this Second Sentence of Expulſion, is,<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> that either Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was now a <hi>Fellow</hi> or not; If a <hi>Fellow,</hi> why diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed? If not, how could he fall under the <hi>Rector</hi>'s Juriſdiction? He was not a <hi>Rightful Fellow,</hi> becauſe expelled by thoſe that had power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him, and for an Offence that merits Expulſion by the Statute. But he was a <hi>Pretended Fellow,</hi> becauſe reſtored by the <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> who exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed a pretended Authority therein. His Name was writ in the Book again, he kept his Chamber and his Place in the Hall and Chappel. He pretended himſelf to be a Fellow, and conſequently ſubjected himſelf to the Government of the College. The Rector would not have claimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Jurisdiction over him, if he would have laid no claim to his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: But by ſo doing, he ſubjected himſelf to the Juriſdiction of the Statute; ſo that Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> at leaſt by his own admittance, muſt be bound by this Second Sentence, becauſe by claiming his Fellowſhip, he own'd the Rector's Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note>But <hi>there is no Statute provided for the Expulſion of Intruders and pretended Fellows.</hi> There is a Statute provided for the Expulſion of Fellows; and a man may be a Fellow, that has not a good Title to his Fellowſhip. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers <hi>de Facto</hi> are liable to the ſame Penalties for undue executing of their Offices;<note place="margin">Cr. Eliz. 775. Hales Plac. Cor. 114.

If a <hi>meer Lay-man</hi> be inducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Benefice, he is, whilſt he continues in poſſeſſion, a Parſon <hi>de Facto</hi>; he is equally ſubject to his Ordinary, as if he were a Clerk. A Gaoler <hi>de facto</hi> ſhall anſwer for Eſcapes. Nay, and we find a difference made betwixt an Officer that has a <hi>colour of Right,</hi> and one that has not ſo much as that. Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> had a colour to claim his Fellowſhip, becauſe rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated by the Viſitor's <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> who had a Jurisdiction in the College by the Statute, and claim'd the Cognizance of Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Cauſe: So
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41975:23"/>
that he was at leaſt a <hi>pretended Fellow,</hi> or a <hi>Fellow de facto,</hi> and therefore ſubject to the Laws of the Society.</p>
               <p>The other Crimes that he reckons up, are perſonal to the <hi>Rector</hi>; with which the world has, or will receive ſatisfaction, that he is unworthily aſpers'd.</p>
               <p>The fourth Section concerns the <hi>Viſitation</hi> it ſelf,<note place="margin">§ 4.</note> the Evidence there given, and the Sentences there pronounced.</p>
               <p>In this Part, the firſt particular to be diſcourſed of, is, the ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> proteſted againſt the Biſhop's <hi>Viſiting</hi> at that time; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Dr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> by a Commiſſion from the Biſhop, had lately exercis'd Acts of Juriſdiction and Viſitation in the College; and that therefore within the Term of five years, which was not yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd, his Lordſhip was barr'd from any other <hi>Viſitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queſtion then is, Whether Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi>'s coming and acting as he did, was a <hi>Viſitation</hi> within the intention of the Statute <hi>de Viſitatione,</hi> or not?</p>
               <p>That it was, may be argued, 1. Becauſe the Grant of Licenſe to the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> to <hi>Viſit</hi> the College, is expreſt in theſe words; <hi>viz. Liceat Domino Epiſcopo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>abſque requiſitione ullâ de quinquennio in quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quennium, ſemel ad dictum Collegium, per ſe, vel ſuum Commiſſarium,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>libere accedere,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis not mention'd, whether to <hi>Viſit</hi> the Whole, or a Part; whether to make a <hi>general</hi> Enquiry of matters relating to the <hi>Statutes,</hi> or only ſome one or more. Only the <hi>Viſitor</hi> is empowered to come in perſon, or ſend his Commiſſary, upon what occaſion ſoever, <hi>once</hi> in <hi>five years,</hi> and muſt have <hi>liberum acceſſum.</hi> They may freely come, and exerciſe their Power of <hi>Viſiting.</hi> The Biſhop has Authority, when he ſo comes or ſends, <hi>ſuper omnibus &amp; ſingulis particulis &amp; Articulis in dictis Statutis contentis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rectorem, Scholares &amp; Electos interrogare &amp; inquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> &amp;c. But if he does not think fit, or find no occaſion to make a <hi>general</hi> Viſitation, may he not confine himſelf, or reſtrain his Commiſſary to <hi>ſome particulars? Cui licet quod majus eſt, ei licet &amp; quod minus. Et Omne majus continet in ſe minus.</hi> But whatever Power he exerts, whether <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,</hi> or but in a <hi>particular</hi> Caſe, proceeds from him as <hi>Viſitor,</hi> becauſe he has no Authority within or over the College, in any other capacity; nor can exerciſe any act of Juriſdiction, but at the times appointed by the Statutes for his Viſitation. Now, Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> did <hi>libere accedere,</hi> and made uſe of the Viſitor's Authority in ſeveral Acts. He ſet up a Citation, ſummon'd the Rector and Fellows, call'd over their Names, adjourn'd from time to time, and from one place in the College to another; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced a Fellow to be reſtor'd, awarded him Coſts, and wrote his Name in the Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41975:24"/>And what tho his Proceedings, in taking cognizance of Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Cauſe, were illegal, and therefore proteſted againſt by the College? Does a Viſitor's ſtretching his Authority beyond its bounds, make his Viſitation therefore ſtand for nothing? At that rate, he may do as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Illegal Acts as he will; and the Wiſdom of the Founder, in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this <hi>Statute of Viſitation,</hi> conſiſts only in tying him up from doing the College any good, and looking to the due execution of their Statutes oftner than once in five years.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Commiſſion by which Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> acted, was granted by the Biſhop, by virtue of that Clauſe in the Statute that gives him leave to come or ſend his Deputy to <hi>Viſit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Biſhop ſtiles himſelf in the Commiſſion, <hi>Jonathan Providentiâ Divinâ Exon Epiſcopus, Collegii Exon in Academiâ Oxon Patronus &amp; Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:</hi> So that he conceived himſelf entitled to make out ſuch a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no otherwiſe than as he was Viſitor. And as ſuch, Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> had appeal'd to him. <hi>Ad nos Exon. Epiſcopum praedictum &amp; Collegii Exonienſis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morati Viſitatorem legitimum ritè &amp; legitimè appellaverit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Commiſſary did viſit, may be inferred from the Notion of a Viſitation, which the Author himſelf has given us; and we may preſume it comes from Dr. <hi>Bouchier:</hi> The Nature of a Viſitation, ſays he, is a voluntary Enquiry into matters Criminal, and Correction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Now, Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi>'s coming was voluntary; he came at no requeſt: (unleſs Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Appeal muſt ſtand for a Requeſt). And he was to enquire into matters Criminal; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> were guilty of <hi>Incontinence? Ad cognoſcendum &amp; diſcutiendum hujuſmodi cauſam appellationis, totumque negotium principale cum ſuis incidentibus, emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentibus, dependentibus, annexis &amp; connexis quibuſcunque. Et ad audiendum hinc inde propoſita &amp; proponenda &amp; ad probationes admittendum.</hi> He was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to enquire, Whether the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> had done Injuſtice in expelling him? And that <hi>Correction</hi> was to follow upon this Enquiry, is manifeſt: For if the perſon that had been cenſured, ſhould have been found a Criminal, the Puniſhment of Expulſion was to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely inflicted. For upon Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s <hi>Appeal,</hi> the Biſhop had granted an <hi>Inhibition,</hi> by which it was intended he ſhould remain in poſſeſſion till the re-hearing of his Cauſe.</p>
               <p>That Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi>'s coming was really a <hi>Viſitation,</hi> is ſo clear, that the Author is forc'd to have recourſe to a diſtinction betwixt a <hi>general</hi> and a <hi>particular Viſitation</hi>; and therefore calls that of the Biſhop in perſon, <hi>a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and general Viſitation.</hi> But all we deſire is, to have Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> his coming, and acting as he did, ſtand for a Viſitation; be it general or particular, it is all one to us; The Statutes make no difference; they give way to no Viſitation at all, without requiſition, more than once in five years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41975:24"/>And that a <hi>Viſitor</hi>'s exerting any act of Juriſdiction within a <hi>College,</hi> when he has no Authority but as <hi>Viſitor,</hi> has been accounted a <hi>Viſitation,</hi> may appear by what hapned in another <hi>College</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> not many years ſince, where Dr. <hi>Morley,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was their Viſitor, and confin'd, as the Biſhops of <hi>Exeter</hi> are in our Caſe, to a <hi>quinquennial Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> That Biſhop muſt be allowed to underſtand the extent of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as well as another, and equally concern'd to ſupport it: yet when a Member of the <hi>College,</hi> that had been debarr'd of a <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> carried a complaint to him as <hi>Viſitor,</hi> he refuſed to take cognizance of it, becauſe five years were not elaps'd ſince his laſt Viſitation. And tho he did it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, he was empower'd by a <hi>Royal Commiſſion</hi>; ſo that he was not ſenſible of any Juriſdiction that he had, as <hi>Ordinary,</hi> to receive the <hi>Appeal</hi>; and conceiv'd his coming or ſending to determine it by his own Authority, as Viſitor, to be as much a Viſitation, as what the Author calls <hi>a ſolemn and general Viſitation</hi>; or at leaſt concluded, that the Statutes by which he was empowered to <hi>Viſit</hi> but <hi>once</hi> in <hi>five years,</hi> debarr'd him from taking any Judicial Cognizance of the Affairs of the <hi>College</hi> at other times.</p>
               <p>But the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> had power to receive and determine this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, as <hi>Ordinary.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obj. p. <hi>28.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>This is a new Doctrine, never heard of in the <hi>College</hi> before, nor perhaps ever thought on till of late. That he was apply'd to by Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> as <hi>Viſitor,</hi> and granted Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> his Commiſſion as ſuch, and that Dr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> was receiv'd by the <hi>College</hi> as the <hi>Viſitor</hi>'s <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> has been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already; to which may be added, that the word <hi>Ordinarius</hi> is not ſo much as in the Commiſſion: nay, and that he acted as ſuch, by comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Statute <hi>de Viſitatione,</hi> in not adjourning his Commiſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the three days limited by the <hi>Statute,</hi> has been opened in the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But when the Biſhop was reſolved, upon Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s ſecond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, to come himſelf, then was this Invention ſet on foot,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> That the determining an <hi>Appeal,</hi> was no Viſitation, becauſe the Commiſſion was reſtrain'd to the hearing and determining that Cauſe only: and he might receive an <hi>Appeal,</hi> as <hi>Ordinary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the next fallacy that the Author goes upon; and which has as little appearance of Law and Reaſon, as any of the reſt. For how comes the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> to have <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Juriſdiction over the Members of <hi>Exeter College?</hi> The Juriſdictions of Biſhops are circumſcrib'd within the limits of their ſeveral Dioceſes; which bounds are ſet to them, either by poſitive Laws in being, or by immemorial Cuſtom, which preſuppoſeth a Law. And they are not only bounded as to Place, but with reſpect to the ſubject-matter of their Juriſdiction; <hi>viz.</hi> the Cauſes that fall under
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41975:25"/>
their <hi>Cognizance.</hi> Where an Act of Parliament or a Canon, received and ſubmitted to as a Law of this Nation, does not empower a Biſhop to hold Plea, there he has no Authority; and if a Biſhop breaks this boundary, and invades the conuſance of Cauſes that are not what the Law calls <hi>Spiritual,</hi> becauſe ſubmitted to the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts,</hi> he incurs the Penalty of an old Statute, that of <hi>Praemuniri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>College</hi> being a <hi>College of Divines,</hi> and the <hi>Viſitor</hi> an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Perſon,</hi> has, it ſeems, with the help of ſome miſapplied words in the Statutes, <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius Viſitator,</hi> and <hi>per cenſuras,</hi> help'd the Doctor and the Author to dreſs up a Notion of <hi>Epiſcopal Juriſdiction</hi> in this Caſe: whereas the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Authority is wholly conferr'd upon him by the Statutes, and as <hi>Viſitor</hi> only; and the Viſitation of a College, by virtue of a Right deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the <hi>Founder,</hi> let who will be entitled to it, is an act of <hi>Temporal</hi> Juriſdiction, becauſe the Founding of a College, and giving them Laws for the good Government of the Society, is a meer Temporal Act, which a Temporal Lord is as capable of, as a Spiritual: and ſuch <hi>Temporal</hi> Lord, or other <hi>Lay</hi> perſon, may equally exerciſe all Juriſdictions whatſoever that a <hi>Founder</hi> may reſerve to himſelf, or confer upon another.</p>
               <p>This invading of <hi>Temporal</hi> Rights, under a pretence of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and particularly invading and encroaching upon the <hi>Temporal</hi> Rights of <hi>Founders,</hi> occaſioned that remarkable Statute of <hi>Proviſions</hi> made in the 25th year of the Reign of K. <hi>Edward</hi> III. in which the King, Lords and Commons entitle themſelves to their <hi>Temporal</hi> Rights, ſuch as the <hi>Cuſtody of Voidances, Preſentments, Collations,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Lords and Advowees</hi>; and declare againſt <hi>diſturbances of free Elections,</hi> &amp;c. as being <hi>againſt the good diſpoſition and will of the firſt Founders.</hi> The ſame will appear by peruſing the other Statutes againſt <hi>Proviſors.</hi> All the <hi>Rights</hi> of a Founder, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him as ſuch, are recoverable by the Common-Law of the Realm; and, if controverted, are determinable by That, and That only. The Right of <hi>Viſitation</hi> is one of them, when reſerv'd to the <hi>Founder,</hi> or by him ſettled upon, or inveſted in any other perſon: whoever is entitled to it, derives his Title from him; and it is a <hi>Temporal</hi> Right. For a <hi>Viſitor,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe himſelf falls out to be an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Perſon,</hi> to apply <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures</hi> upon ſuch an occaſion, is as proper, as if a Biſhop ſhould <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> his Tenant for not paying his Rent, or his Servant for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Duty of his place.</p>

the Appeal did not lie; for that this Cauſe was out of the Statutes of 24 &amp; 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Nor did he obſerve the Order of the Statutes, (<hi>i. e.</hi> he ought not to have appeal'd to the Queen from the Sentence of the Biſhop, but (if the Cauſe had belonged to Eccleſiaſtical Conuzance) the Appeal ought to have been from the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and from Him to the <hi>Queen</hi>). And this matter of <hi>Deprivation</hi> was meerly <hi>Temporal,</hi> and as by a <hi>Lay-Patron.

               <p>Nor do the words in the Statutes that are laid hold on, warrant any ſuch Inference as is made from them. That of <hi>Ordinarius Viſitator</hi> does not deſerve an Anſwer. Nor muſt the words <hi>per Cenſuras</hi> needs be underſtood ſo as to give the Viſitor the Juriſdiction of an <hi>Ordinary.</hi> It is not ſaid, <hi>per Cenſuras Eccleſiaſticas</hi>; nor if it had been expreſs'd ſo, would it have prov'd the Point; ſince an Archdeacon may inflict <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures.</hi> The word <hi>Cenſura</hi> ſignifies no more than a Penalty, and ſometimes leſs, a Rebuke, a Reprehenſion. The late Act of <hi>Convocation</hi> at <hi>Oxford</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cenſura,</hi> tho it proceeded from no Eccleſiaſtical Authority. When a man is ſaid to have been <hi>cenſur'd</hi> in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> no body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the meaning to be, That that Court <hi>Excommunicated</hi> him: It may with as much reaſon be pretended, That where ever the word <hi>Judex</hi> is uſed, <hi>Judex Eccleſiaſticus</hi> muſt be underſtood, as that the word <hi>Cenſura</hi> muſt of neceſſity import <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures.</hi> But if the Statute had been full in it, and that <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures</hi> had been expreſs'd, yet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Title to his <hi>Epiſcopal Juriſdiction</hi> there, would have been never a whit the better. For how can the private Statutes of a College bring any Crime whatſoever within the laſh of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> for which a perſon is not by the Law of the Realm liable to that Cenſure?

I hold not them of him, nor enjoy them by any Right or Title derived from him.</p>
               <p>So that if this College were ſcituate within the Dioceſe of <hi>Exeter,</hi> yet the Members thereof would not, as ſuch, be ſubject to him, as Biſhop; nor would Offences againſt their Statutes bring them under his <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Power,</hi> becauſe his Juriſdiction over them, as <hi>Viſitor,</hi> is a <hi>Temporal Juriſdiction</hi>; and his general Juriſdiction over the whole Dioceſe, as <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi> is of quite another nature. And <hi>quando duo Jura concurrunt in unà perſonâ, aequum eſt ac ſi eſſent in diverſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:41975:26"/>Beſides all this, no Inſtance can be found by traditionary Report, or the Monuments of the College, that ever any former Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> exerciſed a Spiritual Juriſdiction over <hi>Exeter-College,</hi> or any Member of it; or did ever, in any <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of theirs to the College, aſſume that Name, or in any wiſe claim the Authority implied in it: and yet the College is of near 400 years ſtanding.</p>
               <p>But whereas the Author tells us, p. 37. <hi>That this, as all other</hi> Colleges <hi>in</hi> Oxford, <hi>being exempt from</hi> Epiſcopal <hi>and</hi> Metropolitical <hi>Juriſdiction, is immediately ſubject to the</hi> Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Juriſdiction of the</hi> Viſitor, <hi>if he be a Perſon competent and fit to exerciſe ſuch Authority:</hi> he muſt mean, if he mean any thing, That whatever Authority a <hi>Biſhop</hi> has, the Perſons that are ſubject to ſuch Authority, are ſubject to his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Juriſdiction; and then if a Biſhop be Lord of a Mannor within his Dioceſe, or, at leaſt, in a place exempt, he, being a Perſon competent and fit to exerciſe ſuch Authority, may <hi>Excommunicate</hi> his Tenants for not appearing at his Court, and performing the Services incident to their Tenures. A <hi>Biſhop</hi> that is <hi>Chancellor,</hi> for Example, or <hi>Juſtice of Peace,</hi> may <hi>Excommunicate</hi> Suitors and Offenders, and enforce his Orders by <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures.</hi> This is every whit as rational, as that a Biſhop, being a <hi>Viſitor of a College,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould take his <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Authority along with him when he goes to Viſit; the <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a College</hi> being an act of <hi>Temporal</hi> Juriſdiction, as much as any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>But <hi>the</hi> Colleges <hi>in</hi> Oxford <hi>are exempt from</hi> Epiſcopal <hi>and</hi> Metropoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Juriſdiction, and therefore they muſt be ſubject to the</hi> Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicton of their</hi> Viſitor, <hi>if a Perſon competent,</hi> &amp;c. What will become then of thoſe Colleges, whoſe Viſitors are of the Laity? muſt they be ſubject to no Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction at all? Yes; both are ſubject to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Juriſdiction belonging to the Univerſity; which belng now legally exempted from the Juriſdiction of any Biſhop or Archbiſhop, the Chancellor of the Univerſity, who was formerly always an <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,</hi> had the Juriſdiction transferred to him. And ſince of later-times Lay-men of higher Rank have been elected into that Office, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes have provided, That the <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> who is to execute the Powers, be a Perſon in <hi>Holy Orders.</hi> So that there is no neceſſity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the Viſitor with Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, becauſe the Univerſity is exempt from that of the Biſhop of the Dioceſe, or Archbiſhop of the Province.</p>
               <p>Nor was this College, for ought we can be inform'd of, ever reputed to be within the Dioceſe, or belonging to the Dioceſe of <hi>Exeter.</hi> It was anciently within that of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and has ſince been exempted, together with the reſt of the Univerſity; but not ſubjected to that of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:41975:26"/>
nor of any other Biſhop whatſoever. It is ſet free <hi>ab omni Juriſdictione, Dominio vel Poteſtate quorumcunque Archiepiſcoporum, neenon Epiſcoporum &amp; aliorum Ordinariorum:</hi> Theſe are the words. And this Exemption reaches to every particular College, and every Member of every College; and has been always maintained accordingly, and ſtrictly inſiſted upon by the Univerſity: particularly, in that famous Controverſie, <hi>Temp. Rich.</hi> 2. when Archbiſhop <hi>Arundel</hi> pretended a Right of Viſitation there; and again in K. <hi>Charles</hi> I.'s time, when <hi>Laud</hi> was Archbiſhop. But yet we cannot think we are beholden to this Exemption, for our being free from the Epiſcopal Juriſdiction of the Biſhops of <hi>Exeter</hi>; foraſmuch as the College was never ſubject to them as Ordinaries, and cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore properly be ſaid to be exempted from a Juriſdiction that never had a being.</p>
               <p>Nor can the <hi>Founder</hi> be ſuppos'd to have had it in his thoughts to cloath the Viſitor with ſuch an Univerſality of Juriſdiction as is contended for: If that had been his intention, or if he had thought it implied in the word <hi>Ordinarius,</hi> he would not have reſtrain'd him as he has done; He can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe no Juriſdiction, but at times of Viſitation; he cannot Viſit, but <hi>once</hi> in <hi>five years,</hi> unleſs <hi>requeſted</hi> by the College; and when he comes, his Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can laſt no longer than two or three days at moſt. He cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel a Scholar, without the conſent of the Rector and Three of the ſeven ſenior Fellows, <hi>tune in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitate praeſentium</hi>; nor the Rector, without the conſent <hi>quatuor ex ſeptem maximè ſenioribus ſupradictis</hi>; that is, <hi>tune in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitate praeſentibus</hi>; nor can he inflict any Puniſhment at all, but <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum exigentiam Statutorum.</hi> To which may be added, That the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor can put no ſenſe of his own upon the Statutes that ſhall be binding, but upon requeſt made to him by the Rector and the major part of the Fellows.

               </p>
               <p>Since therefore the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> has no Juriſdicton, as <hi>Ordinary,</hi>

For ſince he could not exert all the Powers of Viſitation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Concurrence, and they proteſted againſt his power to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit then, and inſiſted upon it, as a matter of <hi>Right</hi> that they were not obliged to appear; the Biſhop ought not to have proceeded in his Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till this Difference between him and them had been determined. He petitioned the Councel indeed, and they left him to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſual courſe of Law.</hi> But inſtead of taking that Courſe, he makes himſelf Judge in his own Cauſe; and ſince he could not amove them one by one as Viſitor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that could not be done without the Concurrence of the <hi>Rector,</hi> he having two ſtrings to his Bow, betakes himſelf to his <hi>Epiſcopal Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and ſuſpends them <hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio</hi> by whole-ſale.</p>
               <p>The <hi>courſe of Law,</hi> which he might have taken, and would have done, if the Peace and Quiet of the College had been ſo much his care, as the aſſerting his own double-fac'd Juriſdiction, and perhaps revenging ſome pretended Affronts, is this; He might have had a <hi>Mandamus</hi> out of the Court of <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench,</hi> directed to the <hi>Rector, &amp;c. of Exeter College,</hi> to command them to receive him as <hi>Viſitor,</hi> and to ſubmit to him as ſuch. Upon the return of which Writ, the College might have ſhown cauſe why they did not. By this means the matter would have been fairly and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially determined by a proper Court; in whoſe judgment all parties would have been compellable to acquieſce. But inſtead of this, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, who in this Controverſy concerning his Right to Viſit at that time, was but a party, makes himſelf a Judge in his own Cauſe: Which is ſo contrary to common ſenſe, that we read in our Books, that even <hi>an Act of Parliament made againſt natural Equity, as to make a man Judge in his own Cauſe, would be void in it ſelf,</hi> for <hi>Jura naturae ſunt immutabilia.</hi> Hob. 87. 8 Co. 118.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41975:27"/>This Suſpenſion therefore of the Seniors <hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio</hi> being done by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> as <hi>Ordinary,</hi> where he had not the leaſt pretence to the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of an <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and he in pronouncing it, having made himſelf a Judg in his own Cauſe, was in it ſelf a Nullity, and the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi> ſo Suſpended were not in the leaſt incapacitated thereby; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his declaring Dr. <hi>H</hi>'s place void [without the Concurrence of the <hi>Rector</hi> and Three of the <hi>maximè Seniores,</hi> then <hi>preſent in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>] was a void Declaration, and not warranted by the <hi>Statutes.</hi> And his Deprivation of the <hi>Rector</hi> afterwards, without the conſent of Four of thoſe <hi>Seniors,</hi> was void in like manner.</p>
               <p>I muſt take notice here by the by, That this <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of a Fellow <hi>ab Officio,</hi> is a thing not warranted by the Statutes at all; <hi>Expulſion</hi> and <hi>College-Cenſures</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> turning out of <hi>Commons,</hi> and with-holding their Profits for a time) we know, and admit of: but a Suſpenſion <hi>ab Officio</hi> is intended to diſable them from performing their Duty, as Fellows; which they being ſworn to, how can the <hi>Viſitor</hi> ſuſpend them, unleſs he could diſpenſe with their Oaths? or that he were expreſly empower'd by ſome Statutes of the College ſo to ſuſpend them?

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>A Biſhop's ſuſpending <hi>ab Officio</hi> within his Dioceſe, cannot be argued from in this Caſe: For there he <hi>ſuſpends</hi> from that Office or Cure which Himſelf or his Predeceſſors conferred; and it is his own Cure, as well as the <hi>Incumbent</hi>'s; and he has Power, and does accordingly appoint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to ſupply it: whereas this Suſpenſion is from an Office that he neither did nor could confer; nor has he Power to appoint another. And therefore his ſuſpending the Fellows <hi>ab Officio,</hi> and not having Power to ſubſtitute others in their rooms, has actually put the College into a ſtate of Diſtraction and Confuſion; nor is there, in effect, or indeed can be, any ſuch thing as good Government in it, till theſe Irregularities are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed.</p>

               <p>By the Statute <hi>de Promotione,</hi> &amp;c. it is provided, That <hi>ſi aliquis Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>uxorem duxerit, aut Matrimonium vel ſponſalia contraxerit, aut alicui obſequio, officio aut exrcitio, per quod à Studio in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitate Oxon' ultrâ unum menſem in Anno, preter quinquaginta dies, ſuperius in Statuto de Exitu ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pre-exceptos, impediatur, ſe commiſerit:</hi> That then <hi>immediatè poſtquâm aliquod iſtorum Rectori,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cognitum fuerit, omnes jus &amp; Titulum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>amittat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the acceptance of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Benefice</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to be comprehended within this clauſe; 1. Becauſe it is not in propriety of ſpeech, either an <hi>Obſequium, Officium,</hi> or <hi>Exercitium:</hi> There are many
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41975:28"/>
other Imployments that fall naturally under thoſe denominations; and therefore the words of the <hi>Stat.</hi> abundantly ſatisfied without taking in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Benefices.</hi> 2. Becauſe the accepting of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Benefice</hi> cannot hinder a Fellow of a <hi>College</hi> from abiding in the Univerſity, and following his Study there; foraſmuch as Scholars in either Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity abiding there for their Study, are expreſly excepted out of the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. againſt <hi>Non-reſidents.</hi> 3. Becauſe although abſence from the College for longer than a Month, and Fifty days make a <hi>Ceſſion,</hi> in caſe of acceptance of an <hi>Officium, Obſequium, &amp;c.</hi> yet in caſe of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Benefice,</hi> a years abſence is allowed by the ſame <hi>Statute.</hi> And 4. Becauſe when the <hi>Statute</hi> provides in what caſe the Acceptance of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Benefice</hi> ſhall be a <hi>Ceſſion,</hi> and in what not, regard is had to the <hi>value</hi> only, nor barely to the true intrinſick value neither, but to an eſtimated value, as taxed <hi>in publicis Regiiſve menumentis.</hi> Which the <hi>Author</hi> very unfaithfully tranſlates <hi>in any Publick Records:</hi> Whereas, if the words were ſo to be underſtood, it would make ſtrange havock in both <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi>; for whereas there are now many <hi>Benefices</hi> always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted conſiſtent with <hi>Fellowſhips,</hi> becauſe under 8 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in the <hi>King's Books,</hi> though to the extended value of 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and ſo rated and returned upon the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Twelve pence per Pound</hi>; all theſe would, according to the <hi>Author</hi>'s novel Interpretation, be inconſiſtent with <hi>Fellowſhips</hi>; and the Statutes of <hi>Exeter-College,</hi> as well as many others, would very imprudently have made that diſtinction betwixt <hi>Benefices conſiſtent</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtent</hi>; ſince, at this rate, hardly a <hi>Benefice</hi> in <hi>England</hi> would be found to be <hi>conſiſtent.</hi> I call it a novel Intepretation, becauſe it really is ſo; the words <hi>publicis Regiiſve</hi> having always, both in this and other <hi>Colleges</hi> been taken to be <hi>ſynonymous,</hi> and the one <hi>expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory</hi> of the other; both having been underſtood of the Records of the Taxation of <hi>Benefices</hi> in the <hi>Firſt-fruits Office</hi>; which are <hi>publica,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all perſons may have reſort to them; and <hi>Regia,</hi> becauſe they were made for aſcertaining the <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> and <hi>Tenths,</hi> which were then veſted in the Crown, when theſe Records were compiled, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>King's Books.</hi> And to enforce this meaning, than which none but Cavillers would have thought of any other; it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerv'd, that the word of the <hi>Statute</hi> is <hi>Taxatum</hi>; which looks backward, and can have no reference to a Private Act of Parliament made above a Hundred years afterwards. Beſides that, St. <hi>Ann's Living</hi> cannot be ſaid to be <hi>taxed</hi> at a Hundred pounds a year; for it is the Pariſh that by the Act of Parliament, is <hi>taxed</hi> to make it 100 <hi>l.</hi> a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:41975:29"/>The words muſt the rather be underſtood of the <hi>King's Books,</hi> becauſe of the ſubject matter; which is the <hi>conſiſtency</hi> or <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> of a <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and a <hi>Benefice.</hi> In aſcertaining which, the Statute conforms it ſelf to the Law of the Land, by which there is a difference betwixt Livings under and over 8 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> as to their compatibility. And the 8 <hi>l.</hi> which the Law takes notice of to this pupoſe, is 8 <hi>l.</hi> in the <hi>King's Books,</hi> and no where elſe.</p>
               <p>But (ſays the <hi>Author) the Condition of his Parſonage is, That he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide upon it four parts in five of the year; and the Condition of his Fellowſhip is, That he ſhall not be abſent from the College above fifty days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Stat. de Exitu Scholar. ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitate, &amp;c.</hi> does indeed mention <hi>Fifty</hi> days, as the utmoſt time allowed to be abſent from the <hi>College</hi> upon ordinary occaſions: But this clauſe follows, <hi>Illis, qui propter negotii Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legii aut ex ſpeciali cauſâ &amp; gratiâ inferius in hoc ſtatuto annotandâ abſentes fuerint, in numero abſentium minimè computatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Gratia inferiùs annotanda</hi> is this; <hi>Non prohibemus tamen quin ſcholaribus &amp; electis quibuſcunque</hi> ex cauſis promotionis ipſorum, <hi>mortis, vel gravis infirmitatis parentum, ſeu precipuorum amicorum vel cauſis conſimilibus urgentibus, per Juramentum, ſi opus fuerit, petentium hujuſmodi licentiam in preſentiâ Rectoris vel eo abſente ſubrectoris, &amp; majoris partis Scholarium domi exiſtentium, affirmandis &amp; approbandis, per eoſdem concedatur certum tempus, quo abeſſe poſſint.</hi> Here no time of abſence is limitted, but the Rector and Fellows are at liberty for a cauſe to be approved of by themſelves, to give leave for abſence as long as they pleaſe, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito reſpectu ad cauſas, perſonas, intervalla locorum &amp; circumſtantias hujuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that a <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> has no ſuch condition annex'd to it, as the <hi>Author</hi> tells us it has. A Fellow indeed muſt not be abſent above <hi>Fifty</hi> days without leave; but with leave he may be abſent <hi>Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be obſerv'd too, That <hi>cauſa Promotionis</hi> is one of the weighty Cauſes for which the Statute allows <hi>a Licence</hi> for abſence to be obtain'd, without reſtraining it to any certain time. Which word I underſtand not, if this be not its meaning, Where a Fellow is in hopes of, or is advanced to a preferment, that does not make a Ceſſion expreſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute <hi>de Promotione &amp; cauſis deſerendi, &amp;c.</hi> In ſuch caſe he may have leave from the Houſe to be abſent as long as they think fit to give leave.</p>
               <p>To which may be added, another conſideration, which perhaps is peculiar to this caſe of Dr. <hi>H.</hi> and has a conſiderable influence upon the merits of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:41975:29"/>(Says the <hi>Author) The Condition of his Parſonage is, That he ſhall reſide upon it four parts in five of the year:</hi> There is ſuch a Clauſe in the Stat. of 30 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. But the <hi>Author</hi> ought likewiſe to have conſidered, that by the Act of 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 2. The Rector is to have a Houſe built at the charge of the Pariſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And be it further enacted, That the ſaid Commiſſioners, or any Seven of them, ſhall within thirty Days after their Conſtitution make, or cauſe to be made an eſtimate in Writing under the Hands of ſome ſufficient Perſon or Perſons, qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſame, of the Charge of Building and Finiſhing the ſaid Church and Steeple, and a Houſe for the Rector,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and equally Aſſeſs, and cauſe the ſaid to be Aſſeſſed and Levied,</hi> &amp;c. So that Proviſion is made for the Building, as of a Church, ſo of a Parſonage-houſe at the Charge of the Pariſh. And ſince there cannot be Legal Reſidence without a Parſonage or Vicaridge-houſe, the Duty o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Reſidence enjoyned by the Act, cannot be ſuppoſed to take place till there be a Houſe built for the Rector to reſide in: Till then, not being obliged to <hi>Reſidence,</hi> his living is not inconſiſtent with his <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> according to the Authors own Interpretation of the Statutes. Involuntary Non-reſidence, is not <hi>Non-reſidence</hi> within the <hi>Stat.</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. or 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> as when a Parſon is abſent by reaſon of an <hi>Inhibition</hi> from the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And conſequently, Dr. <hi>H</hi>'s <hi>Non-reſidence</hi> not being voluntary, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Breach of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the late <hi>Statute.</hi> The Law is very clear,<note place="margin">Moor, 447 Num. 609.</note> That when there is no Parſonage-houſe upon the Glebe, the Incumbent is excuſed for <hi>Non-reſidence</hi> till there be one; <hi>Godolph.

Now the late <hi>Statute</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to enjoyn any other <hi>Reſidence</hi> than the Law requires; and conſequently, not till there be a Houſe built to reſide in. For the end of the Law in obliging Parſons to <hi>Reſidence,</hi> is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Hoſpitality, and preventing Dilapidations, as well as ſerving the Cure; neither of which can be performed where there is not a Parſonage-houſe to live in</p>
               <p>So that upon the whole matter, Dr. <hi>H</hi>'s accepting of St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Living, is not a <hi>Ceſſion</hi> within the Statute <hi>de Promotione,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe it is not a <hi>Benefice taxed</hi> in the <hi>Kings Books</hi> at 8 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it within the firſt Clauſe, becauſe it is not <hi>Obſequium, Officium,</hi> nor <hi>Exercitium,</hi> within the meaning of that Clauſe.</p>
               <p>Nor, if it were, is he obliged to be Abſent from the College by reaſon of it, till the <hi>Parſonage-houſe</hi> be built, becauſe the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the <hi>Statute</hi> cannot take place, but from that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:41975:30"/>What follows, is either Raillery, or a plain Juſtification of the <hi>Doctor,</hi> in reſigning his former Living about eight or ten years ago. For if, as he acknowledges, he kept himſelf therein to the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Statute,</hi> then he did not <hi>Elude,</hi> but fully comply with the Deſign of the Legiſlator; which was, that his Statutes ſhould be obſerved in the <hi>plain, literal Senſe</hi>; and that if he did not like his Preferment, he ſhould have Liberty to Reſign it within that time, and keep his <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> which was accordingly done, <hi>ſine fraude ulla &amp; abſque penſione ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Remark, I ſhall only add, (tho the Cauſe needs it not) That Grants of Priviledges, as well as Pardons and Reſtitutions, are always to be taken in the moſt benign and beneficial Sence; but according to the Interpretation that this Gentleman would put upon the Statutes, the priviledge in Queſtion would dwindle into juſt nothing at all; and conſequently, this Gentleman does very well defend the Priviledges of the Univerſity, which yet he once Swore to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Vivian</hi>'s Caſe has little in it. His Right to his <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> depends upon his Election into Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s place, who having been ſtatutably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd, as we inſiſt, and hope we have proved, Mr. <hi>Vivian</hi> was duly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Deprivation</hi> of the <hi>Rector</hi> is the next and laſt thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">P. 36.</note>The <hi>Author</hi> tells us, The <hi>Viſitor</hi> reſolved to confine himſelf ſtrictly to the methods which the <hi>Statutes</hi> direct in the <hi>Deprivation</hi> of a <hi>Rector.</hi> A good Reſolution! but how far the Biſhop deviated from it, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in theſe following Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas by the <hi>Statutes,</hi> the Conſent of <hi>Four of the Seven Senior Fellows,</hi> is neceſſary to the <hi>Deprivation</hi> of a <hi>Rector,</hi> his Lordſhip took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to Suſpend all the Seven but Two, that he might incapacitate them to diſſent from his deſign to Deprive him. Which is the more apparent by this, That the <hi>Rector</hi> was deprived for <hi>Contumacy</hi> in not appearing at, and owning him as having a Right then to <hi>Viſit</hi>; which if it were a Crime, the reſt of the <hi>Fellows,</hi> who oppoſed and proteſted againſt his <hi>Viſitation,</hi> were equally guilty, and yet they are only <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended.</hi> I ſay, The <hi>Rector</hi> was deprived for <hi>Contumacy,</hi> becauſe no other cauſe of Deprivation is alledg'd in the Sentence, a fewe other Bombaſt-words being only mentioned in a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> and ſuppoſed to expreſs the cauſe of his Contumacious Abſence.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:41975:30"/>2. He takes in Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> who had been expelled, and whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion occaſion'd all this trouble, to be one of the <hi>Seven Seniors,</hi> who were to ſit in Judgment upon the <hi>Rector</hi> that Expelled him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To make it yet more Statutable, he takes in <hi>Four</hi> more of the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors,</hi> (who were Regiſtred by the <hi>Rector,</hi> as obnoxious to <hi>Expulſion</hi>) and by their Votes, (the two Seniors of the Seven diſſenting, and other two being preſent in the Hall, and not asked their Conſent) he proceeded to paſs Sentence of <hi>Deprivation</hi> againſt the <hi>Rector.</hi> And this exactneſs was obſerved <hi>(ſays the Author)</hi> becauſe the Statute expreſly requires the Conſent of four, <hi>E ſeptem maxime ſenioribus tunc in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitate preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, this exactneſs was declined, becauſe if the Viſitor had confin'd himſelf to the Statutes, he could not have compaſt the <hi>Rector's Deprivation,</hi> becauſe he could not have the Majority of the Seniors of his ſide; and therefore it was neceſſary for him to lay them aſide, whereby he depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Rector of the benefit of having his proper Judges.</p>
               <p>So that the Objection remains: They that did conſent, were not Four of the Seven <hi>maximè ſeniores.</hi> But that's all one: <hi>The</hi> Biſhop <hi>was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the</hi> Statutes <hi>were ſufficiently obſerved in the concurrence of thoſe that ſubſcribed to the</hi> Deprivation, <hi>though not the</hi> Seniors. If the Biſhop were ſatisfied, all's well.. The Reaſons of the Biſhop's ſatisfaction, have been anſwered already.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing there had not been theſe Irregularities in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Method of his <hi>Deprivation,</hi> what was he deprived for? Why, the Sentence expreſſes it, <hi>Propter ejus manifeſtam &amp; multiplicem contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam, &amp; circumſtantiis variis aggravatam in non ſubmittendo ſe Viſitationi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae Ordinariae, ſed contumacitèr ſe abſentantem,</hi> &amp;c. So that he was deprived for <hi>Contumacy.</hi> And herein the Biſhop confined himſelf ſtrictly to the Statutes, becauſe among all the Cauſes mentioned in the Statute, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter quas cauſas Rector privari Officio debeat,</hi> Contumacy is not reckon'd up as one. Nor if it had, can the <hi>Rector</hi>'s non-appearance in the Caſe in queſtion be reputed a contumacious abſence, becauſe he inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a Right not to appear. Nor was it his own ſingle Act, but that of the College, the Proteſtation having been tendred under the Seal of the College.</p>
               <p>The Rector having been thus Illegally deprived, and his Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, whereby the Viſitor enforc'd his Sentence, having by the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> been declared to have been pronounced Illegally, let the <hi>New pretended Rector,</hi> at his peril, make uſe of any violent methods to gain Poſſeſſion. To <hi>legal</hi> Remedies, if he thinks he has any, the Law
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41975:31"/>
is open; which whether it be of his ſide or no, neither the Viſitor, nor Civilians, nor his own Set of <hi>Junior Fellows,</hi> are to be Judges.</p>
               <p>Thus we have gone through the merits of the Controverſie now depending between the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> and the Rector and Senior Fellows of <hi>Exeter-College</hi>; and it is hoped, that notwithſtanding the vain Allegations, and miſtaken Inferences of the <hi>Author of the Account,</hi> it is plainly proved, That Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was lawfully expelled both the firſt and the ſecond time; That he could not by the Statutes Appeal any where; That the Viſitor had no Right to receive his Appeal, as Viſitor, by the Statutes of the College; and that, as <hi>Ordinary,</hi> he had no Right either to receive the Appeal, or to do any thing elſe relating to the College, or any Member of it; That Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> his coming was a <hi>Viſitation</hi> within the intention of the Statutes; and therefore that the Biſhop could not Viſit again till <hi>five years</hi> were expired; That being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his ſecond Viſitation, by thoſe without whoſe concurrence he could not exert the Power of a Viſitor, he ought not to have proceeded, till that Controverſie had been ſetled; That he had no Authority to ſuſpend any of the Fellows; That the voidance of Dr. <hi>H.</hi>'s place, was Illegal, both as to Matter and Form; and the Rector's Deprivation no better.</p>

            <p>SInce theſe Papers were finiſhed, Mr. <hi>Painter,</hi> the <hi>new pretended Rector</hi> and his party, have ſet on foot another practice, as little warranted by the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> as the reſt of the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings above mentioned: They have aſſum'd a power to themſelves of Electing <hi>New Officers</hi> out of their own party in the room of the old ones, whom the <hi>Viſitor</hi> had as Arbitrarily ſuſpended, and with the aſſiſtance of the Youth of the <hi>Colledge</hi> have placed theſe <hi>New Officers</hi> by force and violence both in the <hi>Hall</hi> and the <hi>Chappel,</hi> and that whileſt the matter of Right is depending judicially before a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Court, and at their own Suit; and they dare to confront the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> which has already declared the pretended Sentence of <hi>Excommunication</hi> againſt the <hi>Rector</hi> to be null and void, by oppoſing forcibly his entrance into the <hi>Chappel</hi> under the pretence of his being an <hi>Excommunicated</hi> perſon.</p>
            <p>The particulars of theſe diſorders are not here intended to be made publick; but their unſtatutable proceeding in chuſing <hi>New Officers</hi> as aforeſaid, muſt be taken notice of, and the Authors of theſe confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions put in mind of the Statutes, which they ſeem to have forgotten.</p>
            <p>It is provided by the Statute <hi>De Electione Subrectoris &amp; Decani,</hi> &amp;c: that their Election ſhall be, <hi>Triceſimo die Junii annuatim modò &amp; formâ ſubſequentibus, videlicet quod convocatis per Rectorem quinque maximè ſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oribus ſcholaribus perpetuis tunc in Univerſitate praeſentibus, inquirat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Rector palam ac publiè ſuffragia ſingulorum, quibus ſuum duplex ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium addat, &amp; ille Subrector habeatur, in quem plura ſuffragia praedictorum
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41975:41"/>
conſenſerint. Quae ſimiliter forma eligendi Decani ſemper obſervetur.</hi> So that by the Statute the <hi>Election</hi> is appointed to be upon a certain day of the year, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi>; and ſo ſtrict was the <hi>Colledge</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in obſerving their <hi>Statutes,</hi> and of their <hi>Oaths,</hi> that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a juſt doubt whether or no in any caſe whatſoever they could proceed to an Election upon any other day: And therefore they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it as a queſtion to their <hi>Viſitor</hi> in <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s time, <hi>Si forte Subrector, Decanus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Quoquo tempore ante Craſtinum Petri fato vel ſodalitio ceſſerit, vel amotus fuerit a Collegio, quum ipſo craſtino Petri nec aliàs praedictorum Electiones fieri Statuta praeſcribant, quid interim faciendum?</hi> To which the Anſwer is, <hi>Quum quid tale evenerit, alius idoneus in ceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis vel amoti officium vacuum a ſolitis Electoribus juxta Statuta intrà ſeptem dies uſque ad craſtinum Petri ſequentis, nec ultrà ex ea Electione ſubſtituatur &amp; eligatur.</hi> By this Queſtion and Anſwer it appears that the <hi>Colledge</hi> in thoſe days had not the leaſt apprehenſion of an Officer's place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming void otherwiſe than by <hi>Death, Ceſſion</hi> or <hi>Expulſion</hi>; and none of the <hi>Officers</hi> are either <hi>dead,</hi> or have made a <hi>Ceſſion,</hi> or are <hi>Expell'd:</hi> ſuſpended <hi>taliter qualiter</hi> they are. But as the <hi>Statutes</hi> do no where warrant any ſuch thing; ſo if they did, there could be no ground to chuſe new ones in their room, becauſe new ones are not to be choſen but in one of the three caſes a forementioned; and if <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> did war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a new Election, it ought to be made within ſeven days after the Suſpenſion: ſo that all's wrong. Nor can any pretence of neceſſity juſtifie what's done; for if there be any ſuch neceſſity, it's a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that their own illegal and unſtatuable procedeings have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd.</p>
