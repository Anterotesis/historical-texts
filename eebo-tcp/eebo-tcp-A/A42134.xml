            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>MAn that is in honour, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, is like unto the Beaſts that periſh;</hi> when our firſt Parents loſt <hi>Gods Image</hi> they were <hi>degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> from <hi>Humanity</hi> as well as <hi>Divinity,</hi> and became as <hi>brutiſh</hi> as the <hi>Creatures below them;</hi> ſo that there is no <hi>Beast,</hi> or <hi>Monſter</hi> in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Great World,</hi> but what may be found in the <hi>Microcoſmus</hi> or <hi>Little-world</hi> of <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>inwardly Wolves,</hi> Drunkards <hi>inwardly Swine,</hi> Whoremongers <hi>inwardly Goats,</hi> Diſſemblers <hi>Foxes,</hi> Flatterers <hi>Dogs,</hi> Valiant Men <hi>Lyons,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Men <hi>Lambs,</hi> as though we had <hi>Cloathed</hi> our <hi>Souls</hi> with their <hi>Natures,</hi> as well as our <hi>Bodies</hi> with their <hi>Skins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44904:3"/>Amongſt the reſt it hath been my <hi>Part</hi> to act the <hi>Aſſe;</hi> and no wonder, for the whole <hi>Kingdome</hi> hath done the ſame before me, and (like the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Iſſachar</hi>) been a long time <hi>Couchant</hi> betwixt <hi>two burdens,</hi> that is (in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi>) the <hi>Prophaneſſe</hi> of ſome who call themſelves the <hi>Kings true Subjects,</hi> and the <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> of others, who term themſelves <hi>Gods precious Saints,</hi> as though <hi>Loyalty</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Ranting, Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Drunkeneſſe,</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>Treaſon, Murder</hi> and <hi>Sacrilege.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not ignorant how ſome have rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>nomine Domini,</hi> witneſs the <hi>Devills Martyrs</hi> at <hi>Charing-Croſſe,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their <hi>unparallel'd Treaſon</hi> was <hi>Acted</hi> in the <hi>fear of the Lord;</hi> others have ſinned againſt <hi>God in nomine Regis,</hi> witneſſe thoſe <hi>Hectors</hi> of the times whom if you ſhould check for <hi>Swearing</hi> would call you <hi>Phanatick;</hi> others have <hi>diſhonoured</hi> the <hi>Church in nomine Epiſcopatus,</hi> and (as the wickedneſſe of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> and <hi>Hophni,</hi> made the people <hi>abhorre</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice</hi>) ſo hath their <hi>Ignorance, Scandall, Inſufficiency,</hi> made the Sacred name of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> the <hi>decent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Divine <hi>Liturgy,</hi> become <hi>odious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44904:3"/>And ſhall a man ſee all this and be afraid to ſpeak? no <hi>Friends;</hi> theſe are not times to <hi>daub,</hi> and <hi>flatter;</hi> the <hi>ſinfull burden</hi> of a <hi>corrupt Balaam</hi> will make a <hi>dumb Aſſe</hi> turn <hi>Oratour;</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> of a Man or Woman (I hope I may ſpeak it without <hi>offence</hi>) is worth more than his <hi>Majeſties</hi> three <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and ſhall the charge of a Whole <hi>Congregation</hi> of theſe be committed to a <hi>Dunce,</hi> a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that hath neither <hi>Grace,</hi> nor <hi>Learning?

            <p>In the Verſes called the <hi>Aſſes Complaint</hi> (however they may be miſtaken) I know nothing that can juſtly offend a <hi>ſober Man;</hi> The <hi>King Himſelf</hi> hath Declared that it is, and ſhall he his <hi>Majesties Will <hi>That no Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, Negligent, nor Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Miniſters be permitted in the Church, &amp;c.</hi>

ſpoken Treaſon, Let him tell him that Prays <hi>Thy Will be done,</hi> that he ſpeaks <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (poſſibly) it is ſuppoſed by ſome that <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Scandall,</hi> are quite out of <hi>faſhion,</hi> and that there is no ſuch thing in any of the <hi>Clerge,</hi> Truly I could wiſh it were ſo indeed; But when our <hi>Saviour</hi> amongſt <hi>twelve Diſciples</hi> had one <hi>Devill,</hi> it would be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> amongſt ſo many <hi>thouſand Curats</hi> ſhould have <hi>none;</hi> Yet to name, or mention any <hi>particular Perſon</hi> (untill I have further occaſion (I think) will be as <hi>abſurd,</hi> as for a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> that reproves any <hi>groſſe Sin,</hi> to tell his <hi>Pariſhioners,</hi> openly in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> the name of any <hi>Perſon</hi> whom he knows to be <hi>Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this ſuffice; although others are <hi>unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied</hi> with the <hi>harſhneſſe</hi> of my <hi>Expreſsions,</hi> yet I my ſelf am well <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with the honeſty of my <hi>Intentions,</hi> which (I queſtion not) will bear me out againſt all <hi>malicious Gain-ſayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whereas it is objected that my <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Pamphlet,</hi> hath proved a Doctrine of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> unto <hi>diſaffected</hi> perſons. What then (I beſeech you?) have they not alſo made the

            <p>It was not my <hi>purpoſe,</hi> when I publiſhed thoſe Verſes, to <hi>encourage Sedition,</hi> but to <hi>rebuke Prophaneſſe;</hi> and therefore, to give the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> further <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> I have written theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Precepts,</hi> which are the <hi>Rules</hi> by which thoſe <hi>People walk,</hi> for whoſe ſakes the <hi>Cry</hi> was written; You may find in them <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable advice,</hi> which, though it ſeem to lye confuſedly in my <hi>Meditations,</hi> will be brought into better <hi>order</hi> in your <hi>Practice.</hi>

            <l>None fitter then an Angel to appeaſe</l>
            <l>The fray, betwixt poor Bala'm and his Aſſe?</l>
            <l>And that your Lordſhips are concern'd I'm ſure;</l>
            <l>Unleſſe you can both ſcorn and loſſe endure,</l>
            <l>The livings are your own, our's but the cure!</l>
            <l>Twill be no wonder to your Learned Train,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Iſſacar</hi> of <hi>Levy</hi> ſhould complain!</l>
            <l>The Aſſes ſpleen, will in his mouth remain.</l>
            <l>Nor wil't I hope ſeem ſtrange to any one,</l>
            <l>That there's amongſt us ſuch diviſion,</l>
            <l>Proud <hi>Jack</hi> did evermore abuſe poor <hi>John!</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In vain it is for Bala'm to reply</l>
            <l>Unto the Aſſes charge, when all men cry,</l>
            <l>A ſwitch and ſpurr's the beſt Philoſophy!</l>
            <l>Yet in my heart I think no wiſe men do,</l>
            <l>Think us falſe Prophets, for they all do know,</l>
            <l>They are but Aſſes, that do count us ſo.</l>
            <l>But oh we cannot hold, ſhould we not ſpeak,</l>

            <l>'Twould vex a <hi>Moſes</hi> were he ne're ſo meek!</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levy</hi> fight, both diſagree?</l>
            <l>And ſorry boys, old Fathers villifie?</l>

            <l>Turn up his Fathers skirt, divulge his ſhame?</l>
            <l>Yes, yes, mine own dear ſons have done the ſame!</l>
            <l>And as if God were deaf, and Conſcience dumb,</l>

            </l>
            <l>And why Sir <hi>John?</hi> what mean thoſe names and words?</l>
            <l>Or hath the Church her Knights, as well as Lords?</l>

            <l>Of civil Wars, the croſs, and waining Moon,</l>
            <l>Parted her Enſigns, and ſhe was undone.</l>

            <l>Stay'd for to help their Mother bear her Croſs.</l>
            <l>But why Sir <hi>John?</hi> would not St. <hi>George</hi> have been</l>
            <l>A better Epethite, but chiefly when</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Griffins,</hi> and <hi>Draggons</hi> are ſo nee'r a kin?</l>

            <l>Is love inferiour to obedience?</l>
            <l>Why the rude Vulgar folk do call us <hi>John,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And adde a Sir, I muſt profeſſe I'm one</l>
            <l>As muſt go ſeek a revelation?</l>
            <l>True, we have been as we do all confeſs,</l>
            <l>A long time in the howling wilderneſs,</l>
            <l>Save that we might not preach up righteouſneſs!</l>
            <l>Beſides our Commons too were very ſmall,</l>
            <l>Like to the Baptiſt's, yet they differ all!</l>
            <l>
               <hi>John</hi> fed on Honey, but we fed on Gall.</l>
            <l>Yet we embrace the title, 'tis no ſhame</l>

            <l>Nor fight, nor fawn, be inſolent, nor proud,</l>
            <l>Or fluſh our ſelves with quaffing humane blood!</l>

            <l>To bait poor Chriſtians in the skins of beaſts.</l>

            <l>The Aſs may then return from whence he came?</l>

            <l>To this, a Pye may ſooner ſpeak than read?</l>
            <l>But oh we cannot pray our hearts are ſcant,</l>
            <l>Strange that we cannot pray, and yet can cant,</l>
            <l>The poor man never did expreſſions want!</l>
            <l>True, we can't hang the head, and look demure,</l>
            <l>Talk faſt, and lowd like Monkeys in a Lure,</l>
