            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Amerlane</hi> was born at <hi>Samercand,</hi> the chief City<note place="margin">His Parentage.</note> of the <hi>Zagatajan Tartars;</hi> his father was called <hi>Zain-Cham,</hi> or, as others will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Og,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Zagatajans,</hi> of the Country <hi>Sachithay</hi> (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times part of the famous Kingdome of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi>) third in descent from <hi>Zingis</hi> the great, and successful Captain of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> which <hi>Og</hi> being a Prince of a peaceable nature (accounting it no less honour quietly to keep the Countries left him by his father, then<note place="margin">His fathers peaceable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note> with much trouble and no less hazard to seek how to enlarge the same) long lived in most happy peace with his Subjects, no less happy therein then himself; not so much seeking after the hoording up of gold and silver (things of that Nation not regarded nor va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued) as contenting himself with the encrease and profit of his sheep and herds of cattel, then, and yet also the principal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the <hi>Tartar</hi> Kings and Princes; which happily gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to some ignorant, of the manner and customs of those Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations and Countries, to account them all for shepherds
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51479:3"/>
and herdsmen, and so also to have reported of this mighty Prince, as if he had been a shepherds son, or herdsman himself; vainly measuring his Nobility by the homely course of life of his people and Subjects, and not by the honour of his house, and heroical vertues, hardly to be parallelled by any Prince of that or the former ages.</p>
            <p>His peaceable father now well stricken in yeers, and weary of<note place="margin">He resignes his Kingdome to his son.</note> the world, delivered up his Kingdome to this his son (not yet past fifteen yeers old) joyning unto him two of his most faithful Councellors, <hi>Odmar</hi> and <hi>Ally,</hi> to assist him in the government of his State, whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> dearly loved whilest they lived, and much honoured the remembrance of them being dead.</p>
            <p>The first proof of his Fortune and valour, was against the great<note place="margin">Tamerlanes war against the Muscovites.</note> Duke of <hi>Mosco,</hi> or Emperor of <hi>Russia,</hi> for spoiling of a City which had put it self under his protection, and for entring his country, and proclaiming war against him: whom he in a great battel overthrew, having slain twenty seven thousand of the<note place="margin">His victory.</note> 
               <hi>Muscovites</hi> footmen, and between fifteen and sixteen thousand horsemen, with the loss of scarce eight thousand horsemen, and four thousand footmen of his own. After which battel <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> beholding so many thousands of men lying dead upon the ground, was so far from rejoycing thereat, that turning himself<note place="margin">His merciful disposition.</note> to one of his familiar friends, he lamented the condition of such as command over great Armies, commending his Fathers quiet course of life, accounting him happy in seeking for rest, and such most unhappy, which by the destruction of their own kind, sought to procure their own glory, protesting himself even from his heart to be grieved to see such sad tokens of his victory. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hacen</hi> in his <hi>Arabick</hi> History of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> makes this Narrative of the battel. The <hi>Muscovite</hi> (saith he) had a great Army, which<note place="margin">His battel with the Muscovites</note> he had gathered together out of sundry Nations: and <hi>Tamberlane</hi> intending not to put up such wrongs and indignities, assembled all his forces, and those of his allies. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> forces were such as had been well trained up in the wars; for having lately concluded a peace with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> he had from thence ten thousand very good horsmen: There were also with him many <hi>Hungarian</hi> Gentlemen, under the conduct of one <hi>Uladislaus,</hi> who brought with him more then eight thousand horse; so that he had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51479:3"/>
in his Army above eighty thousand horse, and one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand foot. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had in his Army about one hundred and twenty thousand horse, and one hundred and fifty thousand foot, but not so good soldiers as the <hi>Muscovites;</hi> for his Subjects had been long trained up in peace under his peaceable Father; and though they had sometimes been exercised, yet they wanted the practical part of war. <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> order in his march was this, He caused all his Army to be divided into squadrons, each consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of six thousand horse save his own, which consisted of ten thousand; so that he made eighteen squadrons besides his own. The Avanguard was conducted by <hi>Odmar,</hi> who led eight squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons which were flanked by fourty thousand footmen, divided on the right and left sides, who shot an infinite number of Arrows. The battel was conducted by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who with his own led ten squadrons, and fifty thousand footmen, the best and choicest soldiers of his whole Army. The Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> his kinsman, led the arereward with six squadrons of horse, and fourty thousand foot; his forlorne Hope consisted of some three thousand horse, adventurers. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> fought by double Ranks with Lances, and they seemed to be a greater number then <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes,</hi> making a great noise: but <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> skill and multitude<note place="margin">His victory.</note> at length overcame the force and valour of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> the victory bending to the <hi>Parthians</hi> side which they pursued hotly. In this battel <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was hurt on the side of the left eye, and<note place="margin">He is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</note> had two horses slain under him: and indeed that day <hi>Odmar</hi> was the safeguard of the Prince, but he lost <hi>Ally,</hi> who was slain with an arrow. The Battel being ended, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> returned thanks<note place="margin">Ally slaine. Tamerlanes Piety.</note> to God publikely for his victory, and the next day reviewing his Army, he found that he had lost between seven and eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horsemen, and between three and four thousand footmen. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> lost about twenty seven thousand foot, and fifteen or sixteen thousand horse. The Prince slacked no time after so great a victory, but marching on, came into the borders of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> whom he enforced to this agreement. That they should<note place="margin">The Articles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Peace.</note> become his Tributaries, paying yeerly one hundred thousand Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets: That he should defray al the charges of the wars, amounting to three hundred thousand Duckets: That he should withdraw his Army, and send back all the Prisoners; and that for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance hereof, he should give pledges, which should be changed every
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51479:4"/>
yeer: All which being agreed to, he returned with great content and glory to his Father.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, the great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> (his fathers brother) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown old, and out of hope of having any more children; moved with the fame of his Nephew after this victory, sent him diverse presents; and with all, offering him his only daughter in marriage, sent him word that he would proclaime him heir apparent to his Empire, as in right he was being his brothers son, and the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not using to succeed in those Empires: which so great an offer <hi>Tamerlane</hi> gladly accepted, and so the marriage was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with great triumph at the old Emperors Court solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,<note place="margin">His marriage to the great Chams daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and consummated, and our <hi>Tamerlane</hi> according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and his right was proclaimed heir apparent of that great Empire.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Tamerlane</hi> indeed made great being ever after this marriage by the old Emperor his Uncle, and now his father in Law, so long as he lived, notably supported, and after his death succeeded him in that so vast, and mighty an Empire. Before his marriage he would needs be crowned, to the intent that none should think that the Crown came to him by the right of his wife<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> but by his own; and during his abode in the City of <hi>Quavicai,</hi> where the old Emperor was, he was entertained with all kinde of triumphs, wherein he alwayes carried away the Bell, whether in shooting in the bowe, in changing of horses in the middest of their<note place="margin">His agility and strength.</note> courses, in Tiltings, and in all other exercises which required agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or strength; and so after two moneths returned with his wife to <hi>Samarcand,</hi> in which City he delighted exceedingly to remaine, because the situation thereof was fair, and being watered with a great River, was a place of great Traffick, whereby it was made richer then any in that Country: And whensoever he received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from the Emperor his Uncle, he still imparted the same to <hi>Odmar,</hi> whom he used as his right hand in all his great affaires: There was also in his Court a Christian whom he loved much, and every on greatly respected, called <hi>Axalla</hi> a <hi>Genovois</hi> by birth, brought up from his youth about his person, for he countenanced all that worshiped one onely God that was the Creator of all<note place="margin">His Piety.</note> things. And about this time the old Emperor sent to him to stir him up to war against the great King of <hi>China,</hi> who stiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Lord of the world, and Son of the Sun,</hi> who had exceede his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51479:4"/>
bounds, and incroached upon the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Empire: This was no small enterprise, and before he would begin the same, he sent Ambassadors to the King of <hi>China</hi> to demand restitution of his lands, and the passages of a River called <hi>Tachii,</hi> which were<note place="margin">His Justice.</note> within the <hi>Tartarian</hi> border, and on this side that stupendious wall builded on purpose by the Kings of <hi>China</hi> for the defence of their Country against the incursions of the <hi>Tartars:</hi> and whilst he attended for the return of his Ambassadors, expecting a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,<note place="margin">His preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the King of China</note> he caused his forces to be assembled together from all parts, appointing their rendevouz to be in the <hi>Horda</hi> of <hi>Baschir:</hi> The old Emperor also assembled for his aid two hundred thousand fighting men, wherein were all the brave men of his Court who were accustomed to the wars: for this Emperor had greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased his limits, and conquered a great Country, so as all these men were well trained up in the wars, and had been accustomed to travel and paines; These were to joyn with <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Army in the Deserts of <hi>Ergimul</hi> at a certain day. In the mean time the Ambassadors which were sent, return and informe the Prince that this proud King of <hi>China</hi> wondred how any durst denounce war<note place="margin">The King of China's pride.</note> against him, making this lofty answer: <hi>That</hi> Tamerlane <hi>should content himself with that which he had left him, which also he might have taken from him, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This answer being heard, our Prince marched directly to his Army, gave orders for conveiance of victuals from all parts, sent to hasten forwards his confederates, imparted the answer to the old Emperor, caused the insolence of the King of <hi>China</hi> to be published, that all the world might know the justness of his cause; yet before his departure he went to take leave of his own<note place="margin">His Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> father, who endued with a singular and Fatherly affection, kissed him a thousand times, made solmne prayers for his prosperity, drew of his Imperial Ring, and gave it him, telling him that he should never see him againe, for that he was hasting to his last rest, and calling <hi>Odmar,</hi> bad him farewell, requiring his faithfulness to his son. The Prince having performed this duty, returned to <hi>Samercand,</hi> where the Empress his wife remained, whom he took along with him in this journy, as the maner of that Country is, and so presently departed, committing the charge and care of his Kingdome in his absence to one <hi>Samay,</hi> a man well practised in Affaires, who also had had the charge of our Prince in his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51479:5"/>
youth. These things being dispatched, he marched forwards in the midest of his Army, which consisted of fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse, and a hundred thousand footmen, relying principally on the Forces of the great <hi>Cham</hi> his Uncle: yet he left order that the rest of his Forces should be ready to advance upon the first command, as soon as he should be joyned with his Uncles Army. In<note place="margin">His sickness.</note> his march he was stayed by the way in regard of some distemper of his body contracted by reason of his change of the aire yet the forces which <hi>Catiles,</hi> Captain of the Army of the great <hi>Cham</hi> conducted, went daily forwards. Now the newes of his distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prature was bruted abroad in all places, yet did he not neglect to<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> send to the great <hi>Cham,</hi> and often to advertise him of the state of his health, to the end that the same should not cause any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which might arise in that great Empire whereunto he was lately advanced: for he was very suspicious of a great Lord, named <hi>Calix</hi> who was disconted therewith, and had not yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him as all others his subjects had: and indeed it was not without cause that he suspected him, for <hi>Calix</hi> being informed<note place="margin">The Rebellion of Calix.</note> that the forces of the great <hi>Cham</hi> were advanced beyond the mountaines, having passed the River of <hi>Meau,</hi> and were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at <hi>Bouprou,</hi> and that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was sick, he thought it a fit time for his enterprize, and thereupon assembling the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of his most faithful followers, he told them that now was the time for them to shake off the yoke of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who otherwise would enslave them; and seeing that now their Prince was so badly minded as to translate the Empire to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> of his own minde without calling them to Councel which had interest in the election, that this was the onely means to assure their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which otherwise was like to be lost: He caused also a rumor to be spread, that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was very sick, the Emperor old and crazy, and that his forces were far separated from him; yet like cunning Traytors, they dispatched away a messenger to the great<note place="margin">The Rebels subtilty.</note> 
               <hi>Cham,</hi> to assure him that they bended not their forces against him, but were his faithful and obedient Subjects; and they onely Armed them selves because they would not be governed by the <hi>Parthians,</hi> their ancient enemies.</p>
            <p>As soon as our Prince was advertised of the pretences of <hi>Calix,</hi> he marched one daies journy forward, to the end that he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto <hi>Calibes,</hi> who, what face soever he set on the matter,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51479:5"/>
yet hearkened what would become of <hi>Calix,</hi> that he might likewise make some commotion. This <hi>Calibes</hi> was by <hi>Tamerlane</hi> made Commander of his Avanguard, which consisted of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Tamerlanes Prudence.</note> yet had joyned with him the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> without whom he could not do any thing. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> also gave special commandment, that the passages (which were not many) should be diligently guarded, to the end that the King of <hi>China</hi> should not be advertised of these tumults: and so giving to <hi>Odmar</hi> the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">His march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Calix.</note> of his Avanguard, he hasted forwards; And surely it was high time for him so to do, or else all had been revolted; for <hi>Calix</hi> having assembled a hundred thousand fighting men, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself before the great City of <hi>Cambalu,</hi> chief of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Cathai,</hi> the inhabitants whereof came out to meet him, receiving him with all the joy that might be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> in his march went to <hi>Caindu,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Calatia,</hi> where he expected to meet with the forces of his native Country of <hi>Sachetai,</hi> yet did he not neglect to send forward his Army towards <hi>Cambalu,</hi> which caused the inhabitants, to their great terror, to think that all his forces were already on their<note place="margin">Calix leaves Cambalu.</note> neck. <hi>Calix</hi> perceiving that the Citizens begun already to repent his entertainment, thought it not safe to remaine amongst them, and therefore withdrawing himself, he sent for his forces from all parts, resolving to meet <hi>Tamerlane</hi> in the field, and to put all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the event and hazard of a battel. He drew out of <hi>Cambalu</hi> fifty thousand men, whereof twenty thousand were Citizens, the other thirty thousand were the Garison-souldiers placed there by the old Emperor, <hi>Calix</hi> having corrupted their Leaders, and so<note place="margin">The number of Calix Army</note> procured them to joyn with him in this revolt. In short, having assembled all his forces, his Army consisted of fourscore thousand horse, and one hundred thousand footmen, which he gathered from all parts.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Tamerlane's</hi> Army marching forward, his Scouts which were two thousand horse, had news of the Army of <hi>Calix,</hi> which came forward directly towards them, of which they speedily advertised the Emperor, who thereupon presently sent two thousand horse more, to the end that they should keep<note place="margin">Tamerlanes Prudence.</note> the passages of a certain River called <hi>Brore,</hi> by which River victuals were conveyed to his Army: as also to win time, the Prince well knowing that the motions of a civil war are furious
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51479:6"/>
at the beginning, and that therefore its best to resist slowly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes drawing them out at length, if it be possible, For when means, money and victuals fail, the people use to be sensible of their faults, and to return home.</p>
            <p>The old Emperor sent to him to adventure all upon a battel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering up into his hands the safety of his life and estate, that thereby he might end his daies in peace: By this means forces came to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> on all hands, whose Army daily encreased, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary the enemies Army was then in its chiefest force, and began to feel the want of victuals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calix</hi> was about fourty yeers old, a Captaine renouned with the great <hi>Cham,</hi> and one of the chiefest in dignity and place about him, so that many of the <hi>Tartars</hi> had alwayes respected him as a person most worthy of the Empire, if the glory of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> and his reputation had not so far exceeded.</p>
            <p>The Armies began to be in view one of another about eight a clock in the morning, and many skirmishes began betwixt them<note place="margin">The Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane and Calix.</note> before they came to the maine battel. The place wherein they met at that time, was a great Plain, with like advantage on either part. <hi>Odmar</hi> led the Avanguard, wherein were fourty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse, and eighty thousand foot, which he divided into three squadrons; the first whereof he sent before him to begin the battel. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> marched in the same order, but his squadrons were much stronger. The footmen of both made the right and left wings. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had drawn out six thousand <hi>Parthian</hi> horsemen, and two thousand <hi>Tartarian</hi> for his Areareguard, which he committed to his faithful servant <hi>Axalla;</hi> a man of a great judgement, quick of conceit, and in great esteem amongst the souldiers, although he being a Christian, worshipped God in an other manner then they; and he had many other Christians with him, whom he had drawn from the <hi>Georgians,</hi> and the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, who fought with great agility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calix</hi> on the other side, who was a well spoken man, was exhorting, and encouraging his souldiers to fight for his Fortune, and the liberty of their Nation; he divided his Army into three maine Battels, himself remaining in the middest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with his footmen, and so the Battels joyned, where, after<note place="margin">Calix beaten and taken pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner.</note> a terrible fight, <hi>Calix</hi> fell into <hi>Axalla</hi>'s hands, being taken fighting valiantly, which <hi>Axalla</hi> caused to be presently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proclaimed thorow
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51479:6"/>
the Army, to the overthrow of the courage of all the adversaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hereupon immediately fled. <hi>Calix</hi> was kept till the next day, and then by a Councel of War was adjudged to death; whereupon <hi>Tamberlane</hi> caused his head to be stricken off, the which he sent<note place="margin">Calix con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed.</note> as a present to the inhabitants of <hi>Cambalu:</hi> The like he caused to be done to all the chief Leaders, not out of a cruel dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, but enforced thereto by necessity, knowing very well that the way to cut off the foot of Civil War, is to punish the heads of the same, which as <hi>Hydra</hi>'s grow up too fast.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with his Army marched into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">Tamerlanes march into Cathai.</note> of <hi>Cathay,</hi> a Country rich in grass, and all kind of pastures, abounding with great quantity of beasts, and people, which knew not what war meant; and the Prince gave command that they should not be used as enemies, but as his good Subjects, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as diverse Cities had adheared to <hi>Calix,</hi> they came now and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselves before him, craving pardon, which he gave them, enjoyning them only to provide victuals for his Army, which also they willingly did. This example of lenity was of no small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance for the appeasing of others, which had put all their hope in extremity, resolving to sell their lives deer, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the inhabitants of <hi>Cambulu</hi> had taken this resolution, but being informed of the Emperors clemency, they changed their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: yet as the Army daily approached neerer, their fears en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,<note place="margin">Cambalu yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him.</note> but <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was daily informed by his friends in the City, that the inhabitants resolved to obey the Conqueror; and therefore leaving his Army at <hi>Gonsa,</hi> he only sent thirty thousand to the City, which was the ordinary Garison, and within two hours after entred the City himself, where he was received with great magnificence: yet would he not pronounce their pardon, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all to the old Emperor, and to the ordinary course of justice: For which end he sent one of his favourites to the old Emperor to certifie him of his victory, of the death of <hi>Calix,</hi> and that the chief of his faction remained prisoners with him; as also to know what justice he would appoint to be inflicted upon those Citizens which were the authors of the revolt of this City, and so after eight dayes he departed, and not many daies after he had<note place="margin">His departure from Cambalu. His policy.</note> intelligence that the great <hi>Cham,</hi> his Uncle, had caused justice to be done on the chief movers of Sedition in <hi>Cambalu,</hi> so that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51479:7"/>
the people complained of the old Emperors cruelty, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the mercy of <hi>Tamerlane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he came back to his Army, he was received of all his souldiers with loud acclamations, calling him, <hi>Most great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and most victorious.</hi> Amongst his Captaines he discoursed of the beauty and greatness of the City of <hi>Cambalu,</hi> and afterwards asked <hi>Odmars</hi> advise whether it were not best for him to visite the old Emperor; and so with his Emperess to spend the winter<note place="margin">Odmars good councel.</note> with him at <hi>Quinsay? Odmar</hi> remembring the honour which he had received there, easily perceived his inclination to that journy, yet by all means disswaded him from it; to which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he had alwayes found his fidelity and love to him, which he was sorry that he could not recompence to the full; but (saith he) whereas I had thought to give my self some ease: I perceive that instead of the delicacies, and pleasures of <hi>Quinsay,</hi> I must make the deserts of <hi>Cipribit</hi> my resting place after my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velles in this new victory: yet a rumor being spread that the Prince intended to visite the Emperor, every man began to desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into his own Country, hoping to enjoy the sweetness of his native soile: which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> being informed of, calling his Army<note place="margin">Tamerlanes speech to his Army.</note> to a Rendevouz, he thus spake unto them,<q>We have (my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful souldiers) begun an enterprise against the King of <hi>China,</hi> who hath of late repulsed even beyond the mountaines the <hi>Tartarian</hi> name, but were hindred to our great grief by the foolish rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Calix,</hi> and were driven to turn the bridle to punish him, wherein you have all assisted me. It grieves me that I cannot as well boast of the fresh spoiles of a stranger, as I may (by the means of your weapons) of those of our unfaithful Subjects, and as in times past of the fierce <hi>Muscovites,</hi> against whom with your assistance I made trial of my first Armes: but for this last victory being against our own Subjects, I cannot speak of it without shedding tears, desiring to bury such victories in oblivion, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the glory and honour gotten thereby. Neither do I recount these things to you, but to shew that I forget not your faithfulness, and the great travel you have endured for my sake: We must not therefore be weary, but must turn our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons against those which imagine us to be full of troubles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we are indeed victorious: Our companions, and all our amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition is advanced neer to our enemy already; we must in that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51479:7"/>
place (my souldiers, and friendly followers) pass over the rest of Winter; Our Companions look for us; our enemies are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and look not for us at this season of the yeer, and know that our Army that is already there, is not sufficient for offence, but only for defence. You shall receive double pay, the better to furnish you against the injury of cold; and as we shall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled with double garments, so I hope we shall be clothed with double glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus spoken, his souldiers all cryed, <hi>One God in Heaven, and one Emperor on earth,</hi> shewing their willingness to obey his commands.</p>
            <p>The Prince after this remained there eight dayes longer, sending back <hi>Zamai</hi> with twenty five thousand horse, and fifty thousand<note place="margin">His Piety.</note> foot to <hi>Sachethay,</hi> for the safety of his estate in those parts: and so after solemne and publike prayers, the Army began to march forwards: He forgat not likewise to dispatch away a messenger to the great <hi>Cham</hi> to acquaint him with all his purposes, which he approved very well of: By the same messenger he also beseeched him in the spring to send him fifty thousand men to recruit his Army, and some moneys for the payment of his souldiers, which also he granted; sending also good store of warlike munition, and plenty of victuals, knowing how much the success of the war would advance the <hi>Tartarian</hi> greatnesse and profit.</p>
            <p>The Army being upon their march, in thirty eight dayes came to <hi>Cipribit,</hi> yet met with many inconveniences by the way. There<note place="margin">His march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards China.</note> they had news of <hi>Calibes,</hi> who was glad to hear how businesses had passed, and came to visit the Prince, who entertained him very courteously, acquainting him with his purpose, and understood by him how all things passed in the Kingdome of <hi>China.</hi> The next day the Prince came to <hi>Pazanfou,</hi> where <hi>Calibes</hi> forces were, who had often fought with, and tried the valour of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> but found it much inferior to their own: There the Prince took a general Muster of all his Army, caused them to be paid, took notice of their countenance, whilest they all cryed out, <hi>God save the victorious and invincible Emperor,</hi> according to their custome.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> who commanded the Army with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libes</hi> had diligently viewed the wall, and the wayes by which he might forcibly enter into <hi>China,</hi> and had sent many Spies by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51479:8"/>
wayes thorow the mountaines into that Country, by whom he was advertised of all their proceedings: He had also gained by his curtesie a Lord of those mountaines, called the Lord of <hi>Vauchefu,</hi> who commanded over a great Country, who being desirous of a new Master, and to submit to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> had told the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> that he was able to do the Emperor good service, and to help him much in his wars against the <hi>Chinois:</hi> This the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> discovered to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who was very desirous to speak with this Lord; whereupon a day was appointed,<note place="margin">A Chinois Lord comes to Tamerlane.</note> and <hi>Tamerlane</hi> without moving of his Army, went to the tents of the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> where this foresaid Lord meet him; and the Emperor having heaped upon him many gifts of fair horses, and rich furs, and other rare things; this Lord spake thus unto him, <q>Know, my Lord, that it is but lost labour for you to think that with your Armies you shall be able to force this wall made<note place="margin">His speech to Tamerlane.</note> by the <hi>Chinois</hi> to hinder the incursions of your Subjects: the Defendants have too much advantage therein; I doubt not of your souldiers valour and courage, I know you have conquered many Nations with them, and that whatsoever you command them they will effect it or die in the enterprize: I know that you have great and wise Captaines with you, and that you of all persons in the world, are most worthy to command them: But all this will be but in vain against the wall of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> where I assare you are fifty thousand men to keep it; neither can you stay there so short a time, but there will come fifty thousand more to assist them, led by one <hi>Xianxi</hi> who hath already received such a commandment: The King of <hi>China</hi> will himself follow, who will give you battel with two hundred thousand horsemen, and as many foot; and though happily your Fortune, and valour may carry away the victory, yet I believe it will cost you dear: But to shew you how much the reputation and courtesies of your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have prevailed with me, I will direct you in a way whereby fifty thousand of your men may go into <hi>China,</hi> whom I my self will conduct, and they shall come upon those which guard the wall in a manner before they be discovered. In the mean time you shall lead your Army to a place which I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you to, where you may win easily a mountaine which will give you great advantage against the <hi>Chinois.</hi> For I assure my self, that when they shall perceive your men to be passed; they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51479:8"/>
will lose their courage, so that you may easily win the passage to assist your Army, which shall be led by me amongst them; and to assure you of my fidelity, I will deliver into your hands my wife, my only son, and two little daughters. I have also one brother who, I assure my self will follow me to do you service.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor having heard this, much rejoyced at it, hoping that his affaires would succeed happily, and kept this very secret, not revealing it to the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> himself, none being present at the discourse, but the Lord and his Interpreter, and so heaping new favours upon him, he was conducted back by the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> with all the honour that might be.</p>
            <p>So the Emperor returned to his quarters, and the next day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the whole matter unto <hi>Odmar;</hi> and then calling <hi>Calibes,</hi> he asked what he had learnt concerning <hi>China</hi> during his abode there: To which <hi>Calibes</hi> made this answer, <q>Know, my<note place="margin">Calibes speech to Tamerlane.</note> Lord, that I am your slave to obey you; but seeing you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to give an account of all that I know concerning the Kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> for that I have remained these six moneths upon the borders: I can assure you that the King of <hi>China</hi> who now reigneth, is of great reputation, and hath encreased the limits of his Kingdome, more then any of his predecessors: His strength consisteth in this wall opposed against us, which he hath made to prevent the inrodes of our Nation: I believe there are above fifty thousand to defend it, and that of his best train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed souldiers, and I know no good means to force this wall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much hazard and great loss of your men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>Tamerlane</hi> answered, I hope that the great God, whose honour I will defend against those Idolaters, will find out meanes<note place="margin">Tamerlanes confidence of success.</note> to effect it; and so dismising <hi>Calibes,</hi> he appointed his Army to remove to a certain place, where he meant to chuse out fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, whom he would deliver to the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> and <hi>Axalla;</hi> which accordingly he did, and directed them to follow this <hi>Chinois</hi> Lord, who was now againe come to him, and to do as they should be directed by him: In the mean time himself with all the rest of his Army approached the wall directly over against <hi>Qauguifois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Army led by the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> having marched ten<note place="margin">Forces sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to China.</note> leagues by the conduct of the <hi>Chinois</hi> Lord, entered without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51479:9"/>
and after a short repast, they marched directly towards those that guarded the wall, who suspected no such matter, but only had an eye to those which came to force the wall. But it fell out far otherwise, for just as <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with his Army came to the wall, they saw <hi>Axalla</hi> with twenty thousand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was followed by the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> with thirty thousand choice<note place="margin">The wall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.

            <p>The news of this overthrow being carried to the King of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who was now at <hi>Quantifou,</hi> it brought great astonishment to<note place="margin">The King of China's fear.</note> him, for that he judged it impossible to have been effected, so that every one was filled with tears, fears, and lamentations for their friends. Yet the King gathers forces from all parts, calling<note place="margin">The King of China's super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</note> also the Priests, and such as had the charge of his unholy holies to come unto him, commanding them to offer sacrifices to their gods, whereof the Sun is the principal, requiring the same to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thorow all the Cities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then that every one that was able to bear Armes, should mount on horsback, and speedily repaire to the King at <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> whither he suspected that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> would march, for that it was one of the Cities neerest to the borders. In the mean time <hi>Tamerlane</hi> beat down the wall, the better to<note place="margin">The wall beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down.</note> assure his return, as also the Fortresses upon all the passages, all which upon his victory were easily surrendred to him. He shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself very courteous to the people upon the mountaines, and gave to the Lord that had conducted his Army, a Country which bordered upon his, wherein were seven or eight good Towns,<note place="margin">Tame lanes courtesie.</note> who came and delivered up the Keyes to him: he gave him also the Government of the Frontier-Province of <hi>Xianxi,</hi> shewing himself to be a Prince of his word, and reserved the rewarding of<note place="margin">Hisgratitude.</note> his brother till he had farther opportunity.</p>
            <p>Whilest he was thus imployed, news was brought him that the King of <hi>China</hi> had assembled his forces, and was marching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, himself being there in person; as also that he had strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51479:9"/>
the Garisons in all his Cities which of themselves were well fortified. Upon this intelligence <hi>Tamerlane</hi> called a Councel of War, and having heard the opinions of all his Captaines, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to take in some famous City, that thereby his Army might<note place="margin">His Po<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">

For the effecting of the first, he resolved to assault <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> which was a great City strongly fortified, and well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with people; and for this end he sent <hi>Odmar</hi> with fourty thousand horse to summon it, and to prevent the farther victualling of it, and the driving away of the cattel out of the champion-Country about it, which might nourish his Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He<note place="margin">He besieges Paguinfou.</note> also caused the Lord <hi>Axalla</hi> (whom now he had made Lieutenant General of all his foot) to follow <hi>Odmar</hi> with all his foot, which were neer a hundred and fifty thousand men well trained, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in war, himself marching immediately after with all his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Artillery, Ensignes, and other munitions belonging to the war, directly to <hi>Paguinfou.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Odmar</hi> made such haste that he arrived unexpected by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who rather looked for their King, then for an enemy: and having taken much cattel, wherewith that Country abounded, he pitched his tents on the farther side of the City: there he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued two or three dayes, giving the City many Alarms, till the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry led by that brave Christian <hi>Genuois</hi> shewed themselves, in the plaine of <hi>Paguinfou:</hi> Then was the City summoned, but they returned answer, That they were resolved to live and die in the<note place="margin">Formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Tartars.</note> service of their Prince. By the way you must understand, that about fourty yeers before, the Father of this present King of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> had conquered this City and Country from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and had so planted the same with new Colonies, that but few of the <hi>Tartarians</hi> remained: but onely in the flat Country, and some small walled Towns, who all came with their keyes, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly submitted to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> whereby he had great plenty of victuals in his Army, which made him hope for good success, there being nothing that doth sooner overthrow great Armies, then the want thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Paguinfou</hi> besieged round, the footmen lying within a slight-shoot of the walls, the Citizens and souldiers using their best indeavours for their defence, and <hi>Tamerlane</hi> doing the like for their offence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51479:10"/>
               <hi>Axalla</hi> having viewed a great Suburb, which was in length al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most half a league, supposed that the Citizens kept no watch there, &amp; therfore acquainting the Emperor with his purpose, in the first watch of the night, his men being all ready with sealing lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,<note place="margin">A Suburb ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by storme.</note> he assaulted the same in sundry places, and after a great fight entred and cut in pieces at least eight thousand men which were within the same: yet on one side where they expected to be assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he lost many of his men. The tkaing of this Suburb did greatly astonish the Citizens, who observing the valour of the <hi>Tartarians</hi> began to suspect their own safety: by this Suburb there ran a river, which being now under the command of <hi>Axalla,</hi> he stopt all provision from going to the City.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Army approached, which was very great; whereupon the Emperor determined to go in person, and meet him with the greatest part of his horsemen, but to leave most of his foot to continue the siege, being very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to take the City; for the accelerating whereof, he caused his Engines for battery to approach, as Rams, and such like; so that the City was assaulted on two sides very couragiously, and in the end, thorow the valour of <hi>Axalla,</hi> who gave an assault with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">The wall won.</note> thousand of his best souldiers, he won the wall, and at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Emperor lodged there, who desired rather to have the City by Treaty then storme, the City being great and rich, and the enemy but thirty leagues from thence, and therefore he feared<note place="margin">Tamerlanes Prudence.</note> lest his Army should be found in disorder, and knowing also that rich souldiers never fight well. Besides, he intended to draw out of that wealthy City such things as he stood in need of, and to make it his magazine for the time to come. Yet though the wall was won, the enemies wanted not heart to defend themselves vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, hearing that their King was coming for their reliefe: but it so happened that an Engine shooting a bullet, slew the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; whereupon the Citizens were so discouraged, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved<note place="margin">The City sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> to yield, saving their lives, and the souldiers to march away with horse and armes. The conditions were admitted, and there came out of the City eighteen thousand souldiers, almost all the inhabitants remaining behind: This siege had lasted two moneths, and the City had in it at first thirty thousand souldiers. <hi>Axalla</hi> had the honour of winning this City, and therefore was made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<note place="margin">Axalla's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.</note> of it, and all the Country belonging to it; but he beseeched
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51479:10"/>
the Emperor to bestow it upon some other person, reserving for himself the hope of his Master, in whose fortune he would take part: This gave great content to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who much desired the service of <hi>Axalla;</hi> and upon this refusal the charge was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> with the title of <hi>Vice-Roy:</hi> Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> give notice of his affaires to the old Emperor, and having paid his souldiers, and settled all things in the best manner he could, he marched forward; and taking a general Muster of his whole Army, Horse and Foot, he found them to be diminished ten thousand men only. And so with his Army he spent one whole day in prayer, calling upon the immortal, invisible, and<note place="margin">Tamerlane's Piety.</note> invincible, and incomprehensible God, and then went directly to meet the enemy, who was at <hi>Sintehu</hi> with all his own &amp; the forces of his allies, and as soon as he received news that <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s Army was advanced over the River of <hi>Chulifu,</hi> the King of <hi>China</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly to them with great magnificence: there was nothing to be seen in his Army, but Gold and precious stones: He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self<note place="margin">The riches of the Chinois.</note> usually rode in a Chariot whereof every part shone with Gold, Pearles, Rubies, and Diamonds. He was of the age of about three and thirty, and had been brought up in pleasures, not under the bloody Ensigne of <hi>Mars:</hi> So that he was very insolent in threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings, bravadoes, and defying to the battel: He often accused <hi>Tamerlane</hi> for surprizing him before he was ready, not giving him warning, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The rumour of his riches sired the spirits of the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> that they longed to be at the battel: and so both sides hasted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and in the way there was a City called <hi>Tunichevoy,</hi> surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> which afforded him much refreshing for his Army: and thus the two Armies drawing neer together, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> made choice of a place in his judgement most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous<note place="margin">Tamerlane prepares for the Battel.</note> for the battel; and having set down to <hi>Odmar</hi> the order which he would have to be observed, he longed to see his enemy; then did he send before him five or six thousand horse as Scouts under <hi>Calibes,</hi> and himself went with them, and having viewed the great confused Army of his enemies, which came continually forward, he commanded <hi>Calibes</hi> to retire himself so soon as they drew neer to him, <hi>And bring</hi> (saith he) <hi>this great cloud to me, which I hope soon to disperse:</hi> and so retiring to his Army, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them, assuring them of the victory. He placed all his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51479:11"/>
footmen, which were about a hundred and twenty thousand, along a mountaine, planting great store of Artillery for their guard; many of his foot-souldiers were armed after the Christian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who were all commanded by <hi>Axalla:</hi> His horsemen were in Battalia in a great plaine, who upon any disadvantage could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the assistance of the Footmen: the horsemen were eighty thousand; <hi>Calibes</hi> with the <hi>Scythians</hi> were in the Avantguard, being thirty thousand horse, who were to receive <hi>Odmar</hi> when he should retreat from the enemy, as he was commanded; thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand more were appointed for <hi>Odmar,</hi> and <hi>Tamerlane</hi> himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Areare at one of the wings of his footmen: His pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was to let that sixty five thousand horse under two such gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Captaines, to break the force of the enemy, hoping after them to have a good market, causing his foot to march forward, and reserving with himself twenty thousand of his best horse, who of themselves were able to make a new Battel if any mischance should befall the former: For he understood that it was the custome of the Kings of <hi>China</hi> to enclose themselves in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of their Chariots with their footmen, and not to hazard their persons, but upon extremity. The <hi>Chinois</hi> failed not to march directly unto <hi>Calibes</hi> the whole Army following and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">The Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</note> upon him: <hi>Calibes</hi> with his six thousand <hi>Scythian</hi> horse, after their usual manner, in retreating gave many charges, giving and receiving hurt. The King of <hi>China</hi> marched with much gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry with his Army, which seemed to be twice so big as that of <hi>Tamerlane's:</hi> He had very many armed Chariots, wherein he put his principal trust; they had much Gold and Silver, as well in the trappings of their horses, as one their Armour, which glistered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly against the Sun, to the admiration of the <hi>Tartars. Tamerlane,</hi> who with a troop of horse beheld the <hi>Chinois</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after <hi>Calibes,</hi> commended greatly the drawing forth of their men to compell <hi>Calibes</hi> to fight, endeavouring to discover and note with his eye the place where-abouts the Kings person was, having by him the <hi>Chinois</hi> Lord to instruct him, who knew well the manner of their fight. They had no Avantguard, but were all in a gross commanded by the King inclosed with his Chariots, which being shewed to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> by this Lord, he turned to those Captaines that were neer him, and said, <hi>Yet must we disperse this guilded cloud, and the King of</hi> China <hi>and my self must make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition thereof.</hi>

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51479:11"/>Thus having sufficiently viewed the enemy, and observed their maner of marching, he thought it not convenient to suffer them to take breath, nor to rally, being something disordered in their march, whereupon he sent to <hi>Calibes,</hi> to will him to begin the fight; and when those that were with him should be weary, to retreat to him: But as soon as his <hi>Scythians</hi> heard this word <hi>Fight,</hi> they required the<note place="margin">The Scythians charge the Chinois.</note> first charge with a young Lord that commanded over them called <hi>

This sight endured a long hour before they had overthrown <hi>Calibes: Tamerlane</hi> beheld all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, saying, that the great multitude (how disorderly soever<note place="margin">Tamerlanes constancy.</note> they were) would at length carry it away from the order and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his souldiers; yet could there not be discerned any alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his countenance, adversity and prosperity being both alike so indifferent to him.</p>

            <p>The King of <hi>China</hi> coming forwards, and the horsemen that had been broken by <hi>Odmar,</hi> joyning themselves to him, <hi>Odmar</hi> sent to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> desiring him that the Footmen and Artillery might advance forward sending him word that he might assure himself of the victory. Hereupon <hi>Tamerlane</hi> commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to advance with fifty thousand foot, and part of the Artillery<note place="margin">The foot charge.</note> requiring him to set upon the Chariots, and to make an entrance. The Artillery marching in the first place did greatly astonish the

enemy; for the Governours of the horses belonging to the Kings Chariots could not rule them: it made also a great spoile. <hi>Axalla</hi> perceiving the disorder, hasted forwards till they came to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blows. The King of <hi>China</hi> had yet about his person a hundred and fifty thousand men: Yet <hi>Axalla</hi> full of courage, fought so valiantly, that they never beheld any man to do more bravely.<note place="margin">Axalla's valor</note> During this fight, <hi>Odmar</hi> againe charged the horsemen that were retired to the Kings aid, and put them to flight.

            <p>The Emperor would not see the Captive King, till the next day: but being mounted on hoseback he rode about the field to stay the slaughter, and to rally his men, that the accustomed watch might be kept, whereof he gave the charge unto <hi>Axalla,</hi> commanding him also to keep the King of <hi>China</hi> in the middest of his souldiers, who was dressed of the wound which he had received in his right arme. It was a strange sight to see the diversity of the enemies weapons, and the variety of their Streamers and Ensignes, which seemed afar off as beautiful as the diversity of colours plentiful. The King of <hi>China</hi>'s Army was very great, consisting of a hundred and fifty thousand horse, and two hundred thousand footmen: but the greatest part of them were rude and barbarous people, far inferiour to <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s in valour, who suffered themselves to be slaine one upon another, not marking their advantages, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little skill in warlike affaires.</p>

Then caused the wounded to be cured, and amongst others <hi>Calibes,</hi> who more through the distemperature of the aire, then from the danger of the wound, found himself very ill, yet would he not omit his duty in commanding the Van, which was very grateful to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> for that he being a <hi>Scythian,</hi> was greatly beloved of his Nation.</p>
            <p>These things being dispatched, he sent unto <hi>Axalla</hi> to bring forth his prisoner the King of <hi>China;</hi> and when he approached, the<note place="margin">The King of China brought before him.</note> Emperor issued out of his Tent, and went to receive him. This King came with a very proud and haughty countenance, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching neer to the Emperor, he by his Interpreter, asked of <hi>Axalla</hi> which was he? and being shewed him, he spake in an haughty language after this manner: <hi>The gods whom I worship,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King of China's proud speech.</note> 
               <hi>being provoked against my Nation and people, have conspired against my good fortune, and made me this day thy prisoner: But for as much as it is reported over all the world, that</hi> Tamerlane <hi>maketh war for the honour of his Nation, thou shouldest be content with this glory, that the Lord of the world, and childe of the Sun is in thy power to receive such laws as thou pleasest to prescribe unto him.</hi> This he spake in a brave manner, without any other humbling of himself:<note place="margin">Tamerlane's courtesie.</note> The Emperor on the other side saluting him very courteously, led him into his Tent.</p>
            <p>This King of <hi>China</hi> was a great Prince, having two hundred famous Cities within his Kingdome; which also is a fruitful and plentiful Country, wherein are Mines of Gold and Silver, much<note place="margin">The riches of China.</note> Musk and Rhubarb: It abounds in Fish and Fowl, and hath much Silk and Porclane, with Cotton and Linnen, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> assemble his Captaines to consult about the disposal of the King; and how the victory should be best improved. At the same time he received news by <hi>Odmar,</hi> that the Kings brother, who escaped out of the battel, was at <hi>Quantou,</hi> which he had strongly sortified, and that great store of forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to adjoyn themselves to him: Hereupon he commanded two thousand <hi>Parthian</hi> horse to convey the King to <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Burda,</hi> where he was to be kept carefully. Then did he resolve upon the besieging of <hi>Quantou,</hi> and if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51479:13"/>
to shut up the Kings brother therein, it being one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal seats that belonged to the King of <hi>China.</hi> It was fourty leagues from the place where the battel was fought. Thither therefore he sent a good party of his Army under <hi>Odmar,</hi> who<note place="margin">Quantou besieged.</note> pitched his Tents about the City: But the Kings brother was gone. The Emperor in the mean time summoned, and took in many lesser Cities, which yielded wholly to his mercy, making great lamentation for their Captive King, yet the gentleness of the Conqueror made them to take all their losses with patience, and the rather because they heard that he used their King courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. The Kings brother also sent Ambassadors to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> craving leave to see the King, and to know of his health, which the Emperor willingly assented to.</p>
            <p>Now the Kings brother hearing of the estate of the besieged in <hi>Quantou,</hi> he resolved either to relieve it, or to fight a battel, for which end he advanced strait unto <hi>Porchio,</hi> making a bridge of<note place="margin">Odmars <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">

The Kings brother who was on the other side<note place="margin">The King of China's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</note> of the River (not yet come over) saw his men slaine and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and could not relieve them. This second overthrow was of no smal importance, though it was but the third part of the Kings brothers Army. For the Citizens of <hi>Quantou</hi> hearing of it, and despairing of relief, sent out some proposals for their sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Axalla</hi> which received them, presently dispatched away a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful messenger to the Emperor to know his pleasure therein: This was more welcome news to him then the overthrow of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, wherefore he referred all to the sufficiency, and fidelity of <hi>Axalla:</hi> So that upon treaty the City was surrendred to <hi>Axalla,</hi>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51479:13"/>
with great signes of joy by the inhabitants, who resolved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the Emperor with all the solemnity that might be. <hi>Axalla</hi> put thirty thousand men into it for a Garrison, injoyning the Citizens to pay the Emperors Army four hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns: Presently after he received a command from the Emperor to stay in the City himself, and to send all the rest of his foot men unto him, which he commanded the rather, because he<note place="margin">Tamerlanes Policy.</note> understood that Ambassadors were coming to him from the Kings brother to treat of peace, and he presumed the sight of all his Army together ready to march, would strike such a terror into them, as would cause them the readilier to assent to good termes.</p>
            <p>The Ambassadors sent by the Kings brother were of their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est men, whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> entertained with all humanity, causing his greatness to appear to them, as also the activity of his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whereby they might discerne that it would tend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their Country if they agreed not with him: Then did the Ambassadors deliver their message, which consisted of two branches: One was for the delivery of their King, the other for<note place="margin">The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors proposals.</note> the preservation of their Country: The Emperor answered, that they should deliver their message in writing, and he would give a speedy answer: Their Propositions were to leave <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> and all the Country beyond it, with all the Fortresses of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> possession: That they would pay all the charges of his Army from that day forward: And that they would give two millions of gold for the ransome of their King: To this the Emperor answered, that he would keep that which he had<note place="margin">Tamerlane's proposals.</note> conquered within the Country, being his own as taken by his Arms. That he would have the River by which his Army was now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, and so along to the Sea, to be his Frontiers: That the King of <hi>China</hi> should pay him yeerly two hundred thousand Crowns, which should be delivered at <hi>Paguinfou</hi> for acknowledgement of his submission to his Empire: That he should pay five hundred thousand Crowns in ready money for the charge of his Army: That the King of <hi>China</hi> should be delivered, and that all the other <hi>Chinois</hi> prisoners should pay ransomes to particular men that took them, except those which carried the names of Kings, who should pay ten thousand Crowns for their liberty and peace: And that no <hi>Chinois</hi> should be kept for a slave, nor sold for such hereafter,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51479:14"/>
being under the Emperors obedience: That Traffick, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Merchants should be free between both the Nations: That the King of <hi>China</hi> should deliver his brother, and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called Kings, with twelve principal men of the Country for<note place="margin">Peace conclud ed.</note> Hostages to secure the peace: These conditions, after they had consulted together, were accepted of, hoping that time would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store again their ancient liberty, and in the mean time they must bear the yoke of the Conqueror.

            <p>Thus <hi>Tamerlane</hi> having settled his affairs, and provided for the assurance of his new conquest, left <hi>Odmar</hi> to govern the same,<note place="margin">Odmar made Governor.</note> leaving with him thirty thousand horse, and fifty thousand foot to furnish all the Fortresses and strong places, giving him in charge to make his chief residence at <hi>Quantifou,</hi> to fortifie well the passages and to build a new Fort at <hi>Dermio,</hi> the better to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his borders: He left him all necessaries, and commended the Lord of the mountaines, who had been so serviceable to him;<note place="margin">Tamerlanes gratitude.</note> his brother he took with him, giving him large preferment in <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chethay:</hi> He also carried along with him many of the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered people, to plant them in his own Country, sending other Colonies in their stead, which he did, because he found them a light<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> people, and such as affected novelties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> sent to acquaint the old Emperor with all these things, having two of the greatest and fairest Cities in all <hi>China</hi> in his possession, and an hundred leagues of Land, extending his<note place="margin">His possessions in China.</note> borders to a River, by which he might go to the enemy, but they could not come to him without passing over the same: He desired also above all things, that all the Idols which were within his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest should be beaten down, and commanded the worshipping of <hi>one God.</hi>

               <hi>Odmar</hi> being thus severed from <hi>Tamerlane's</hi> side, all his favour was turned to <hi>Axalla,</hi> of whose prudence, valour, and fidelity he had such large experience in these wars, so as the report of his valour did flye thorow all the Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Calibes</hi> led the Avantguard, and <hi>Axalla</hi> was in the Battel neer to the Emperor, who bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him two hundred thousand Crowns yeerly to maintaine his ordinary expences. And thus after certaine daies journey,<note place="margin">His liberality.</note> news was brought of the old Emperors arrival at <hi>Cambalu:</hi> wherefore <hi>Tamerlane</hi> leaving his Army to winter in a faire and fertile Country, and dismissing many of his souldiers, he hasted thitherwards, and when he was arrived within four leagues of<note place="margin">His entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balu.</note> 
               <hi>Cambalu,</hi> all the Princes of the Emperors Court came to receive him there, together with all the chiefest Citizens to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his admirable success: The Prince having received every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wonted courtesie, yet retaining convenient Majesty, he was beheld by all with great contentment: He had with him the Emperess his wife, who had not left him in all this journey: And the next day the old Emperor honoured him so much as to come to meet him with all the magnificence that might be. <hi>Tamerlane</hi>
               <note place="margin">His presents to the old Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</note> presented him with all the richest Chariots, and fairest horses that he had won: and the old Emperor being very desirous to see his daughter, her Chariot was uncovered, and he caused her to enter into his own: But the Prince remained on horseback, whom the eyes of all the people could not be satisfied with admiring. <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> also presented <hi>Calibes</hi> to the Emperor, making a recital of all his faithfulness; whereupon the Emperor gave him an hundred thousand Crowns for the encrease of his pension: He also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented <hi>Axalla</hi> to the Emperor, who being informed of his valour, gave unto him a hundred thousand <hi>Tartarirs</hi> of Gold in a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, that he might declare how much he esteemed his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>During <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> abode at <hi>Cambalu</hi> this winter, complaints<note place="margin">He is stirred up against Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet.</note> came to him that <hi>Bajazet</hi> the great Turk had attempted to joyn the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi> to his own, resolving also upon the siege of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whereupon the Emperor of <hi>Greece</hi> sent to him to crave his aid. <hi>Axalla</hi> who was of kin to this Emperor <hi>Paleologus,</hi> being desirous to maintaine the Christian Religion in <hi>Greece,</hi> stirred<note place="margin">He sends Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors to him.</note> him up much unto this war: whereupon he sent Ambassadors to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> to warn him in his name not to molest the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51479:15"/>
who was his confederate: But <hi>Bajazet</hi> answered them very proudly, asking them what their Master had to do therewith, and<note place="margin">Bajazets proud answer.</note> that he should content himself with injoyning Laws to his own Subjects, and not to meddle with him who was none of them.</p>
            <p>This answer being returned, by <hi>Axalla</hi>'s meanes, was very ill taken, so that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> resolved to hinder this enterprise of the <hi>Ottomans:</hi> for which end he obtained of the Emperor his Uncle,<note place="margin">Tamerlane's preparations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> an hundred thousand footmen, and eighty thousand horsemen, hoping to have as many from his own Country of <hi>Sachetay,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Lords who would accompany him to win glory, from whom he made account of fifty thousand men more that they would bring along with them. Thus he departed from <hi>Cambalu,</hi> taking his leave of the old Emperor his father in Law, and of the Princess his wife (then left behind him for the comfort of her aged father) and departed towards <hi>Samercand,</hi> the place of his birth and seat of his Empire, leaving the forces granted him by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to come after him to <hi>Ozara,</hi> where he had appointed the general rendezous of his Army. This his departure was very grievous to the old Emperor, but more grievous of the Princes part towards his wife, who had never left him since they were first married: But nothing could withhold this brave Prince where honor was to be purchased, or where he might be profitable to his oppressed friends; For he would often say, That <hi>he was born to this end, and that all his other imployments were but by the By, God</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tamerlane's speech.</note> 
               <hi>having appointed, and called him to punish the pride of Tyrants.</hi> He was accompanied with <hi>Calibes,</hi> and made the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> Colonel of all his footmen, which place <hi>Axalla</hi> had left, whom now he made Lieutenant General of all his Army, with command to lead his Avantguard, and <hi>Calibes</hi> the Arereward. Forces came to him from all parts: And the <hi>Chinois</hi> Lord being licensed by <hi>Odmar,</hi> marched towards him with twenty thousand men of his Subjects newly conquered, being desirous to shew his forwardness to the Emperor, as also to learn the manners, and fashions of strange Countries. When <hi>Tamerlane</hi> came neer <hi>Samercand, Zamay</hi>
               <note place="margin">His entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Samer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cand.</note> went to meet him, and neer a million of people blessing and and praising him with all manner of songs: There he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about a moneth: In which space <hi>Axalla</hi> had rendevozed his Army at <hi>Ozara,</hi> from which also he advertised <hi>Tamerlane</hi> of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51479:15"/>
proceedings of <hi>Bajazet.</hi> Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> send for him to <hi>Samarcand</hi> to confer with him about seting forward of his Army. For although he was still accompanied with renowned Princes and famous Captaines; yet were they no body in comparison of <hi>Axalla,</hi> whose sound judgement and counsel had won him such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with his Lord and Master, as by his advise he did althings, and without him nothing, which his so great authority and favor<note place="margin">Envy attends vertue.</note> with his Prince, wanted not the envy of the Court; but that his great vertues, and rare-found courtesie (in so great fortune) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with so many great services as he had done, supported him against the malice of the same. He upon this command from <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> leaving the charge of the Army at <hi>Ozara</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> came to <hi>Samercand,</hi> and there discoursed with him at large concerning the estate and order of his Army: and so shortly after they all departed to <hi>Ozara,</hi> where a new consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was held by which way he should conduct his Army: as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was better to lead them by the coast of the <hi>Muscovite</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards <hi>Capha,</hi> or on the other side of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, by the skirts of <hi>Persia;</hi> and after much discourse, and sundry opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with their reasons delivered, it was resolved (although the way were the longer) to pass by the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> so to come to the <hi>Georgians,</hi> and to <hi>Trepizond,</hi> and from thence to enter into the <hi>Ottomans</hi> Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This being resolved on, they marched forward till at length they came to <hi>Maranis,</hi> where they stayed three dayes, looking<note place="margin">His march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Bajazet.</note> for the <hi>China</hi> forces, whereof they received news: there also <hi>Tamerlane</hi> mustered, and paid his Army: He had also news of fifteen thousand horsemen sent him by the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> with a sum of money, with leave for him to pass thorow so much of his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories<note place="margin">His Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> as should be necessary, being glad that he set upon others, rather then on himself; and that such great preparations should fall upon them, whose greatness was as dreadful and dangerous to him as any other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> caused a great quantity of victuals, and most part of<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> the furniture of his Army to be sent along the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, which was a great ease and commodity to his men, which marching by Land, was of necessity to pass some twenty leagues thorow places destitute both of victuals and water: Himself all the way coasting along the Sea shore, passed his time in Hunting and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51479:16"/>
Hawking, to make the journey less tedious, his Army not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer him by ten leagues, which was so great that it extended it self full twenty leagues.</p>
            <p>Coming to the River <hi>Edel</hi> he stayed at <hi>Zarazich,</hi> whilest his Army passed the River at <hi>Mechet,</hi> and two other bridges that he had caused to be made of boats for that purpose. Now that <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassians,</hi> and <hi>Georgians</hi> hearing of the approach of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with his huge army, by their Ambassadors offered him all the help and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance<note place="margin">The Georgians assist him.</note> they could in his journy, as he passed that way. These <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> were, and yet were Christians, a great and warlike people, of long time tributaries to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors; and afterwards sometime tributaries, and sometimes confederates to the <hi>Persians:</hi> but alwayes enemies to the Turk, and therefore glad they were of <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> coming against them: of these warlike people <hi>Axalla</hi> drew great numbers to the service of his Prince, who not a little esteemed of them, being all tall men, very beautiful, of great strength and courage, and withall, most expert souldiers, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many times resisted the power of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Kings, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the advantage of their Country, which was rough, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainous, and hard to come to. These people every where kindly entertained <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> and plentifully relieved his Army with all necessaries. In passing thorow which, and other Countries, he<note place="margin">His strict discipline.</note> took such order with his souldiers, that none of the people by whom they passed were any whit injured by them, insomuch that if a souldier had taken but an Apple or any other trifle, he died for it. And one of his souldiers having taken a little Milk from a Country-woman, and she thereof complaining, he caused him presently to be hanged, and his stomack to be ript, where the Milk that he had lately drunk being found, he payed the woman for it, who had otherwise without mercy dyed for her false accusation: Which his great severity was indeed the preservation of his Army, being so great as that it was thought impossible to provide it with victuals, whereof yet there was not want, nor of any other thing necessary for the relief of man: his Camp being still as a most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and well-governed City, stored with all manner of things, whereunto both Artificers and Merchants resorted from far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with their commodities as to some famous Mart: and the Country-people from every place without fear brought in their Country-commodities, for which they received present money, and so departed in peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51479:16"/>So marching on, he at length came to <hi>Bachichich,</hi> where he stood to refresh his Army eight dayes, and there againe took a general muster of them, finding, as some write, four hundred thousand horse and six hundred thousand foot; but others that<note place="margin">His huge Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> were present with him say, three hundred thousand horse, and five hundred thousand footmen of all Nations: There also he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally payed them, and as his manner was, made an oration to them, informing them of such orders as he would have observed, with much other military discipline, whereof he was very curious with his Captaines.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Bajazet</hi> would not believe that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> durst once look towards him, yea so exceeding barbarous was he,<note place="margin">Bajazets Pride.</note> that he would not so much as suffer any man to speak of him, or his Army to him, by reason of his pride. He also strictly forbade all the bordering people to make any vows or prayers for <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes</hi> prosperity: But he was soon after awakened out of this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy as we shall presently hear. Indeed <hi>Tamerlane</hi> could hardly be perswaded that <hi>Bajazet</hi> having subdued the greatest part of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and much distressed the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, and having so great means to recover whatsoever he should lose in <hi>Asia,</hi> would be so adventurous as to come over the streits out of <hi>Europe</hi> to try the Fortune of a battel with him: but rather warily to protract the time, to weary him with wants, that in a strange Country drew such a world of people after him: wherein yet he found himself much deceived, for when he had passed the <hi>Georgian</hi> Country, and was come to <hi>Buisabuich; Axalla</hi> (whom he had not seen in eight dayes before, because he commanded the Avantguard of the Army) came to him with such news as he knew would be most grateful to him: which was, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> had raised his besiegers at<note place="margin">Bajazet advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards him.</note> 
               <hi>Constantinople</hi> to come and defend his new conquests in <hi>Asia,</hi> and that he was certainly resolved to come to a pitched Battel with him, not so much trusting to the multitude of his men, as to the experience and valour of his souldiers, being long trained up in the wars. At which unexpected news <hi>Tamerlane</hi> greatly rejoyced, yet without insolency and vaunting, but rather with the countenance of such an one as judged the event of Battels to be alwayes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;<note place="margin">Tamerlanes moderation.</note> saying some times, That <hi>a small number well conducted, did carry away the victory from the confused multitude.</hi> Three daies after he stayed at <hi>Buisabuick,</hi> causing his souldiers continually to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51479:17"/>
march forward, which at two places passed over the river <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> which, he did the rather to maintaine his Army upon the<note place="margin">He passeth the River Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> spoile of the enemies Country, chusing rather there to attend his coming then amongst his friends and allies. All the Cities that yielded to him in the way as he marched, he favourably received; the other that refused to submit themselves to his obedience, he used with all extremity, especially the great and strong City of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> where certaine of the forerunners of his Army, were by the <hi>Turks</hi> that kept Garrison in it, cut off and slaine, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite<note place="margin">Turkish pride.</note> him the more, the City gates were set open in contempt of him: whereupon being justly offended, he sent out certaine <hi>Tartarian</hi> horsemen, charging them upon paine of his displeasure so to behave themselves against their enemies that at his coming up to them he might finde either the City taken, or at least the gates shut up against him: and he had his men at so great command, that no danger was unto them more dreadful then his displeasure, neither did he punish any thing so severely as cowardize. Now the <hi>Turkes</hi> in <hi>Sebastia</hi> seeing these <hi>Tartarian</hi> horsemen marching towards the City, making little account of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their number was not great, issued out to meet them, where they were so furiously charged by these few horsemen, that they were glad to retire, and for hast to shut the gates against some of their own men, lest the enemie should have entered pell mell with<note place="margin">Turks beaten.</note> them, which <hi>Turkes</hi> were there slaine at the gates of the City. Shortly after came <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with all the rest of his Army, and sat down before the City, where he lay still seven dayes not making any shew of violence at all. The defendants because the City was of great strength, thought that his purpose was by a long siege to distresse the same: But about the eight day, the Towers, and walls being undermined in sundry places, suddenly fell down, leaving large breaches for the enemy to enter; wherewith the <hi>Turks</hi> being dismayed surrendred the City to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> in hope so to have saved their lives, but he caused them all to be buried quick,<note place="margin">Sebastia taker.</note> and the City utterly to he razed: and then calling the Governour, whose life he had spared for that end, he bade him go and tell his Master what had happened to his strong City of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> and what himself had seen there; of which Tragical action, when the Governour had made report to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> he demanded of him whither of the two Armies he thought bigger or stronger; for he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51479:17"/>
had now assembled a mighty Army of three hundred thousand horse, and two hundred thousand footmen: whereunto the Governour having first craved pardon, answered: That it could not be in reason, but that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had the greater Army, for that he commanded over far greater Countries: wherewith proud <hi>Bajazet</hi> being offended, replyed in great Choller. <hi>Out of doubt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bajazet's arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</note> 
               <hi>the sight of the</hi> Tartarian <hi>hath so affrighted this coward, that he thinks every enemy to be two.</hi> As <hi>Bajazet</hi> marched forward he heard a Country-Shepherd merrily pleasing himself with his homely pipe as he sat on the side of a mountaine feeding his small flock where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he stood still, and listened to him to the admiration of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and at last brake forth into these words, <hi>O happy shepherd,</hi>

            <p>The rest of the Cities as <hi>Tamerlane</hi> marched forwards, warned by the destruction of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> yielded to him, the Citizens where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he used courteously, especially the Christians, whom he set at<note place="margin">Tamerlanes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the Christians.</note> liberty for the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors sake, whom he sought therein to gratifie.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had not gone far in the <hi>Turkes</hi> dominions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Bajazet's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</note> he was certainly informed that <hi>Bajazet</hi> was coming against him with a mighty Army, and was now within thirty leagues of him, which caused him from thence forward to march with his Army more close together. <hi>Axalla</hi> leading the Van, sent forth <hi>Chianson</hi> Prince of <hi>Ciarchan</hi> with four thousand <hi>Parthian</hi> horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to get knowledge of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army, and where <hi>Bajazet</hi> lay, as also what manner of Country it was beyond <hi>Sennas,</hi> and if he could learn any thing thereof, to make relation of it to him. This Prince of <hi>Ciarchan</hi> was <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> neer kinsman, a man of great reputation, and next to <hi>Axalla,</hi> in whose absence he had the command of the Avantguard, who also sent before him an other <hi>Parthian</hi> Captaine with five hundred horsemen: who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advanced about ten leagues, and surprized <hi>Sennas,</hi> was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly<note place="margin">Sennas surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane.</note> informed there of the state of <hi>Bajazets</hi> Army, which was now at <hi>Tataia,</hi> and so marching forward; which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of, commanded him not to retire from that place till he saw the arrival of the enemy, and thereof to give him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51479:18"/>
every hour, resolving himself to pass on no farther, being encamped in a faire large plaine, which was very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for him, his Army being bigger then <hi>Bajazet's</hi> which made him make choise of those large plaines. His Army also being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> of sundry Nations, he considered that he was not to fight against the <hi>Chinois,</hi> a soft effeminate people, as of late; but against the <hi>Turkes,</hi> a most warlike Nation and well acquainted with all manner of sights and warlick stratagems, and therefore he judged it necessary to proceed warily against them. Upon this consideration he presently sent for <hi>Axalla,</hi> with him to view the said place, and to have his opinion whether it would be advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for him to stay there or no? <hi>Axalla</hi> not misliking his choice of the place, yet withall advised him to keep <hi>Sennas</hi> as long as possibly he could: and accordingly he sent word to them at <hi>Sennas,</hi> that when they could keep the place no longer, they should set fire of it, and so retreat, and this he did that the enemy should have no desire to encamp there, but to march forwards to those places where <hi>Tamerlane</hi> desired to fight, the rather because he was stronger in horse then <hi>Bajazet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly the Prince of <hi>Ciarchan</hi> sent out a hundred horse toward the <hi>Turkes,</hi> then divided the rest of his forces into two parts, commanding the former that as soon as they perceived the enemy to pursue the hundred horse, whom he had commanded to fly disorderly before them, that they should receive them into their squadrons, and so retire altogether: He in the mean time with the<note place="margin">An Ambush.</note> other part stood close in a valley neer unto a wood-side, wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen; where having suffered two thousand of the enemies horse (the vant-curriers of the <hi>Turks</hi> army) to pass by him, he following them in the taile, charged them home, the other also which before reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">Two thousand Turks over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</note> now turned again upon them; so that the <hi>Turkes</hi> seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thus beset, and hardly layed to both before and behind, as men discouraged, fled: but in their flight were most of them slaine, the rest of them taken prisoners. This was the first encounter between the <hi>Turkes</hi> and the <hi>Parthians.</hi> All the prisoners taken were by the Prince sent as a present to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> and amongst the rest the Bassa of <hi>Natolia,</hi> who led those Troops; of whom<note place="margin">The Bassa Natolia taken.</note> 
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> earnestly demanded what caused his Master <hi>Bajazet</hi> so little to esteem him as to shew so great contempt of his Army: <hi>Which</hi> (saith he) <hi>he shall finde strong enough to abate his pride?</hi> To
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51479:18"/>
this the Bassa answered: That his Lord was the Sun upon earth, which could not endure any corival: And that he rather was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished<note place="margin">His speech to Tamerlane.</note> to see how he from so far a Country had undertaken so dangerous a journy to hinder the fortune of his Lord, in whose favour the heavens (as he said) did bend themselves to further his greatness, and unto whom all the world subjected it self; and that he committed great folly in going about to resist the same. Unto this proud speech <hi>Tamerlane</hi> replied, That he was sent from<note place="margin">Tamerlanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> Heaven to punish his insolency, and to teach him that the proud are hated of God, whose promise is to pull down the mighty, and to advance the lowly. As for thy self (said he) thou hast already felt (though I pitty thy mishap) what the valour of my <hi>Parthian</hi> horse is against thy <hi>Turkish:</hi> and I have already caused thy Master to raise his siege before <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to look to his affaires here in <hi>Asia.</hi> He also asked him whether his Master did come re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to give him battel? Assure your self (said he) that there is nothing that he more desireth, and would to God that I might<note place="margin">His release.</note> acknowledge your greatness in giving me leave to assist my Lord in that battel. Good leave have thou (said <hi>Tamerlane</hi>) go thy wayes, and tell thy Lord that thou hast seen me, and that in the battel he shall finde me on horseback, there where he shall see a green Ensigne displayed. The Bassa thanked him, and swore that next unto his Lord, he vowed unto him his service. And so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning he related unto <hi>Bajazet</hi> how he had seen <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> and reported to him truly all that he had willed him to say, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">He commends Tamerlane.</note> above all to praise his courtesie and bounty: who besides that he had frankly set him at liberty, had also given him a very faire horse, well furnished, although he well knew that he was to serve against himself: To this <hi>Bajazet</hi> answered no more but that he would shortly make trial of him, and that he doubted not but before he had done with him, he should make him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his folly.</p>
            <p>The next day the two Armies drew neer together, and encamped within a league the one of the other, where all the night long you might have heard such noise of horses which filled the heavens<note place="margin">Preparations for the battel.</note> with their neighings, and the aire with sounds; and every man thought the night long that they might come to the trial of their valours, and the gaining of their desires. The <hi>Scythians</hi> (a people no less greedy, then needy) talked of nothing but the

spoile; the proud <hi>Parthians</hi> of attaining honour; the poor Christians of their deliverance from an insulting adversary; all to be gained by the next dayes victory; Every man during the night-time speaking according to his humour. All which <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> (walking privately up and down in the Camp) heard, and much rejoyced to see the hope which his souldiers had already conceived of the victory: and so after the second watch, returning into his Pavilion, and there casting himself upon a carpet, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to sleep a while: but his cares not suffering him so to do, he then (as his manner was) called for a book, wherein was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained<note place="margin">Tamerlanes prudent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</note> the Lives of his Fathers and Ancestors and of other vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant worthies, which he used ordinarily to read in, as then also he did: not vainly to deceive the time, but to make use of it, by imitating that which by them was worthily done, and declining such dangers as they by their rashness, or over-sight fell into. After having slumbered a little, he commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to be sent for to him, who presently came, accompanied with diverse other great Lords and Captaines of the Army, with whom after he had consulted a while about the order of the battel, himself presently mounted on horseback, and sent each of them to their charge to see their orders put in execution: At which very instant he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived intelligence that the enemy was marching forwards, and come to chuse his ground for the battel, whose order of marching <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was very desirous to see, that so he might marshal his own Army accordingly. <hi>For</hi> (said he) <hi>I do not so much trust to</hi>
               <note place="margin">His prudent speech.</note> 
               <hi>the Lions skin wherein I wrap mine arme, but that withall I will make use of the Foxes, therein to wrap mine head, which my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father neglected to his overthrow in a battel against the</hi> Persians: <hi>for being in a place of advantage, he went out of it to seek his enemy that was lodged strongly, contrary to the advice of all his Captaines, which proved his ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did he cause three thousand horsemen to advance forward with charge to begin the skirmish, himself following after to lodge every part of his forces in such places as he had foreseen to be fittest for his advantage: And seeing the <hi>Turkish</hi> Janizaries marching in a square battel in the middest of the Army, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the two Fronts two great squadrons of horsemen, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be about thirty thousand, and another which advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and covered the Battalion of the Janizaries, he thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:51479:19"/>
this their order to be very good and hard to be broken, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turning himself to <hi>Axalla,</hi> he said, <hi>I had thought this day to have fought on foot, but I see that it behoves me now to fight on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back to encourage my souldiers to open that great Battalion of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His directions for the battel.</note> 
               <hi>And my will is that my men come forwards to me so soon as may be; for I will advance forward with a hundred thousand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, fifty thousand upon each of my two wings, and in the midest of them fourty thousand of my best horsemen: And my pleasure is that after I have tryed the force of these men that they come unto my Avantguard, of whom I will dispose, and fifty thousand horsemen more in three bodies, whom thou shalt command, which I will assist with eighty thousand horse, wherein shall be mine own person, having a hundred thousand footmen behind me, who shall march in two squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons: and for my Arereward I appoint fourty thousand horse, and fifty thousand footmen, who shall not march but to my aid: And I will make choice of ten thousand of my best horse, whom I will send in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every place where I shall think needful within my Army, for to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part my commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Over the first fourty thousand horse the Prince of <hi>Ciarchan</hi> commanded, over the formost footmen was the Lord <hi>Synopes,</hi> a <hi>Genovois,</hi> kinsman to <hi>Axalla,</hi> and his Lieutenant over the footmen, a Captaine of great estimation: The Prince <hi>Axalla</hi>'s charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of five squadrons of horsemen: <hi>Bajazet's</hi> Army also being faire and great, came bravely still on forwards towards their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who stirred not a whit from the place which they had chosen<note place="margin">The Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</note> for the battel, except certaine lighthorsemen. <hi>Scythians, Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who sent out as loose men, hotly skirmished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Armies. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was informed by a Spie that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> was on foot in the midest of thirty thousand Janizaries, his principal men of war, and greatest strength, wherein he meant that day to fight, and in whom he had reposed his greatest hope. His battel of horse was very faire, amounting to the number of one hundred and fourty thousand, all old souldiers: The Sultan of <hi>Egypt</hi> having also sent to his aide thirty thousand Mamelukes, all<note place="margin">Bajazet's great Army.</note> excellent good horsemen, with thirty thousand footmen; so that his Army marching all in a front, in the form of an half Moon, seemed almost as great as <hi>Tamerlane's:</hi> These <hi>Turkes</hi> with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of horrible cries still advanced forwards, <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> souldiers all the while standing still with very great silence. Never
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51479:20"/>
was there a more furious charge then the <hi>Turkes</hi> gave upon the Prince of <hi>Ciarchan,</hi> who was commanded not to fight till the enemy came unto him: neither could there have been chosen a fairer plaine, and where the skilful choice of place gave less ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage either to the one or to other, only <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had a River of the left side of the Army, serving him to some small advantage. Now this young Prince of <hi>Ciarchan</hi> with his fourty thousand horse, was in the first encounter almost wholly overthrown; yet having fought right valiantly, and entred even into the middest of the Janizaries (where the person of <hi>Bajazet</hi> was) putting them into disorder, was himself there slaine. About which time <hi>Axalla</hi> set<note place="margin">The Prince of Ciarchan slain.</note> upon them with his squadrons, but not with the like danger: for having overthrown one of the enemies wings, and cut it all to pieces, and his footmen coming to joyn with him as was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he faced the Battalion of the Janizaries, who right valiantly behaved themselves for the safety of their Prince. This furious<note place="margin">A furious bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</note> fight continued an hour, and yet you could not have seen any scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but the one still resolutely fighting against the other. You might there have seen the horsemen like mountaines rushing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and infinite numbers of men dying, crying, lamenting, and threatening all at the same instant. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had patience all this while to see the event of this so mortal a fight: but perceiving his men at last to begin to give ground, he sent ten thousand of his horse to joyn with the ten thousand appointed for the Rereward commanding them to assist him when they saw that he had need, and so himself gave a furious charge, and made them to<note place="margin">Tamerlane himself charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> give him room, causing the footmen also to charge, over whom the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> commanded, who gave a gallant charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Battalion of Janizaries, wherein was yet the person of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet,</hi> who before had sustained a great burden. Now <hi>Bajazet</hi> had in his Army a great number of Mercinary <hi>Tartars</hi> called <hi>Destenses,</hi> with many thousands of other souldiers taken up in the Countries of the poor exiled <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes, in whose just quarrel, and the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had chiefly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken that war. These <hi>Tartarians</hi> and other souldiers, seeing,<note place="margin">Many revelt to Tamerlane.</note> some their friends, and other some their natural and loving Princes in <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Army, stricken with the terror of disloyalty, and abhorring the cruelty of the proud Tyrant, in the heat of the battel; revolted from <hi>Bajazet</hi> to their own Princes, which much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51479:20"/>
               <hi>Bajazet's</hi> forces: who never the less with his own men of war, especially the Janizaries, and the help of the Christian soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers brought to his aide from <hi>Servia,</hi> and other places of <hi>Europe,</hi> with great courage maintained the fight: But the multitude rather then true valour prevailed; for as much as might be done by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and couragious men, was by the Janizaries, the Mameluks, and the rest performed, both for the preservation of their Prince,<note place="margin">The Turkes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown.</note> and for gaining the victory: But in the end the horsemen with whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> himself was, giving a fresh charge, and his Avantguard being rallied, and joyning with him, he with much ado obtained the victory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bajazet</hi> himself being wounded, when he saw all desperate,<note place="margin">Bajazet woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> mounted on horseback, thinking to have escaped: but falling into <hi>Axalla</hi>'s hands, he yielded himself to him, supposing him to have been <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> neither did <hi>Axalla</hi> for a while know him, but took<note place="margin">Bajazet taken.</note> him for some great Commander in the <hi>Turkes</hi> Army. <hi>Musa</hi> sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Zelabi,</hi> or the Noble, one of <hi>Bajazet's</hi> sons, with divers others of his great Captains, were there taken also; and amongst the rest <hi>Georg</hi> Despot of <hi>Servia,</hi> who notwithstanding his misfortune had that day by his valour gained the reputation of a great and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Captain; inso much as <hi>Tamerlane</hi> in the very heat of the battel marvelled to see him and his <hi>Servians,</hi> and the other Christians<note place="margin">The valour of the Christians.</note> that he had brought to the aide of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> to fight so valiantly; whereupon turning to some of his Captaines that were neer him, he said, <hi>See how valiantly these Religious fight,</hi> supposing them by their strange attire to have been some of the <hi>Turkes</hi> superstitious vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But the Despot being now taken, and afterwards brought to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> he was by him courteously entertained; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reproved for that he had assisted <hi>Bajazet</hi> against him, who was come in favour to the Christian Emperor, and the other poor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Princes such as the Despot himself was: who thereupon boldly answered, <hi>That indeed it was not according to his profession,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Despot of Servia's speech</note> 
               <hi>but according to the prosterity of</hi> Bajazet, <hi>unto whom it seemed that all the world should bend, and that he did it for his own safety:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Tamerlane</hi> excused him, and without any more ado gave him<note place="margin">Tamerlane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaseth him.</note> liberty at his own pleasure to depart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bajazet</hi> himself being afterwards brought to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, was by him courteously entertained, who never shewed any token of submission at all, but according to his proud nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51479:21"/>
respect of his present state, answered him presumptuously to what ever he demanded of him: wherewith <hi>Tamerlane</hi> being<note place="margin">Bajazets proud behaviour.</note> somewhat moved, told him that it was in his power to take his life from him; whereto he answered no more, but <hi>Do it, for that loss will be my greatest happiness:</hi> Then <hi>Tamerlane</hi> demanded of him, what made him so proud as to enterprize to bring so noble a Prince as the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor into his subjection? He answered, <hi>Even the same cause which moved thee to invade me, namely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of glory and sovereignty.</hi> But wherefore then (said <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi>) doest thou use such cruelty towards them that thou overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est without respect of age or sex? <hi>That did I</hi> (said he) <hi>to strike the greater terror into mine enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> aske him if he had ever given thanks to God for making him so great an Emperor? <hi>No,</hi> (said he) <hi>I never so</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leoncla. in edit Anual. Turk.</note> 
               <hi>much as thought upon any such thing.</hi> Then said <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> Its no wonder that so ungrateful a man should be made a spectacle of<note place="margin">Note.</note> misery. For you (saith he) being blind of an eye, and I lame of a leg, was there any worth in us, that God should set us over two such great Empires to command so many men far more worthy then our selves? But, said <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> what wouldest thou have done with me if it had been my lot to have faln into thy hands, as thou art now in mine? <hi>I would</hi> (said <hi>Bajazet) have enclosed thee in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lex Talionis.</note> 
               <hi>a Cage of Iron, and so have carried thee up and down in Triumph thorow my Kingdome.</hi> Even so (said <hi>Tamerlane</hi>) shalt thou be served: And so causing him to be taken out of his presence, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his followers, he said, Behold, a proud and cruel man, who deserves to be chastised accordingly, and to be made an example to all the proud and cruel of the world of the just wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. I acknowledge that God this day hath delivered into my hands a great enemy, to whom therefore we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks, which he caused publikly to be performed the same<note place="margin">Tamerlanes Piety.</note> day; for the battel was ended about four a clock, and there were diverse hours yet of day-light. The next day he caused the dead to be buried, where amongst the rest was found the body of the prince of <hi>Ciarchan</hi> dead in the middest of the Janizaries, where he lay enclosed with their dead bodies, shewing that he dyed not unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, whose untimely death <hi>Tamerlane</hi> much lamented, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his dead body to be Enbalmed, and with two thousand horse, and diverse <hi>Turkish</hi> prisoners chained together, to be conveyed to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51479:21"/>
               <hi>Samercand</hi> untill his coming thither. All other dead bodies were<note place="margin">The dead buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> with all honour that might be, buried at <hi>Sennas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great bloody battel was fought in the yeer of our Lord, 1397. not far from mount <hi>Stella</hi> (where formerly the great king <hi>Mithridates</hi> was by <hi>Pompey</hi> the great in a great battel overthrown.) It continued from seven a clock in the morning till four in the afternoone; victory as it were all the while hovering with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wings over both Armies, as uncertain where to light, until at<note place="margin">Tamerlanes Policy.</note> length the fortune of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> prevailed: whose wisdome, next unto God, gave him that days victory; for that the politick tiring of the strong forces of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> was the safeguard of his own: whereas if he had gone unto the battel in one front, assuredly the multitude finding such strong opposition, had put it self into confusion, whereas this successive manner of aiding his men made them all unto him profitable. The number of the slaine is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously reported. The <hi>Turkes</hi> themselves say, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> lost there his noble son <hi>Mustapha,</hi> with two hundred thousand of his men, and <hi>Tamerlane</hi> not many fewer: Others say, that the <hi>Turkes</hi> lost<note place="margin">The number of the slain.</note> about sixty thousand, and <hi>Tamerlane</hi> not past twenty thousand. But likely it is that the carnage was very great in so long a fight between two such Armies as probably never before met a in field together.</p>
            <p>By this dayes event is plainly seen the uncertainty of worldly<note place="margin">The uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of worldly greatness.</note> things, and what small assurance even the greatest have in them. Behold, <hi>Bajazet</hi> the terror of the world, and (as he thought) supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to fortune, in an instant by the event of one battel thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom of misery and despaire, and that at such time as he thought least of it, even in the middest of his greatest strength. It was three dayes before he could be pacified, but as a desperate man still seeking after death, and calling for it. Neither did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> after he had once spoken with him, at all afterwards use him courteously, but as of a proud and insolent man, made small account of him. And to manifest that he knew how to curb the haughty, made him to be shackled in fetters and chaines of Gold, and so to be shut up in an Iron Cage, made like a grate,<note place="margin">Bajazet kept in a Cage.</note> that he might be seen on every side, and so carried him up and down as he passed thorow <hi>Asia,</hi> to be made a scorn and derision to his own people, over whom he had before Tyrannized. And to his further disgrace, upon festival dayes he used him for a footstool
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51479:22"/>
to tread upon when he mounted on horseback, and at other times scornfully fed him like a dog with fragments that fell from his table. A rare example of the uncertainty of worldly honours and greatness, that he unto whose ambitious minde <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> two great parts of the world, were too little, should now be carried up and down, cooped up in a little Iron Cage, like a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wild beast: How might he have taken up that speech of <hi>Hecuba</hi> in <hi>Seneca? Quicunque Regno fidit, &amp; magna potens do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatur in aula, me videat.—Non unquam tulit Documenta Fors majora quàm fragili loco starent superbi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> used this severity, not so much out of hatred to the<note place="margin">Pride goeth before destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> man, as to manifest the just judgement of God against the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant folly of the proud. And when on a time he was requested by one of his Nobles to remit some part of this rigour to so great a man, he answered, <hi>I do not use this rigor against him as a King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tamerlane prosecutes his victory.</note> 
               <hi>but rather to punish him as a proud ambitious Tyrant, polluted with the blood of his own brother and many other innocents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This so great an overthrow brought such a fear upon all the Countries possessed by <hi>Bajazet</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> that <hi>Axalla</hi> being sent before <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with fourty thousand horse, and a hundred thousand foot, without carriages to prosecute the victory, came without resistance to <hi>Prusa,</hi> whither all the remainder of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Army was retired with Bassa <hi>Mustapha:</hi> all places as he marched along still yielding to him: Yea the great Bassa with the rest<note place="margin">The Turkes flye.</note> hearing of his coming, and not thinking themselves in safety in <hi>Asia,</hi> fled over the streit of <hi>Hellespont</hi> to <hi>Callipolis,</hi> and so to <hi>Hadrianople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Axalla</hi> coming to <hi>Prusa,</hi> had the City without resistance yielded to him, which by his Army was plundred and there with other of<note place="margin">Prusa taken.</note> 
               <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s wives and concubines, he took prisoner the faire <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina, Bajazet</hi>'s best beloved wife, to the doubling of his grief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emmanuel Paleologus</hi> now hearing of <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> coming to <hi>Prusa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> sent honourable Ambassadors thither before to <hi>Axalla,</hi> by<note place="margin">The Greek Emperor sends Ambassadors.</note> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were entertained till the coming of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with all the honor that might be, shewing them all his magnificence, and the order of his Camp to their great admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For it resembled a most populous and well governed City by reason of the order that was therein, which brought it plenty of victuals, and of all manner of Merchandise as well for delight as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51479:22"/>
necessity. By these Ambassadors the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor yielded his Empire, together with his person unto <hi>Tamerlane</hi> as his most<note place="margin">The Greek Empire yielded to Tamerlane.</note> faithful subject and vassal: which (as he said) he was bound to do, for that he was by him delivered from the most cruel Tyrant of the world; as also for the long journy he had undertaken for his sake, and the discommodities he had endured with the hazard of his person and loss of his subjects, which could not be otherwise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensated, but with the offer of his own and his subjects lives to him, which for ever he therefore dedicated to his service, with all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity &amp; loyalty that so great a benefit might deserve: besides, that his so many virtues, and rare endowments which made him famous thorow the world, did oblige him the more hereunto, and that therefore he would attend him in his chief City, to deliver it into his hands as his own, together with all the Empire of <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these Ambassadors expected no less then to fall into the bondage of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> judging that which they offered to be so great and delicate a morsel, as that it would not be refused, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of such a victorious Prince as was <hi>Tamerlane;</hi> and that the acceptance thereof in knindness and friendship was the best bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine they could make therein. But they received an answer from this worthy Prince far beyond their expectation: For he with a mild countenance beholding them, answered thus, That he was not come from so far a Country, nor undertook such paines<note place="margin">Its refused by him.</note> for the enlargement of his dominions, big enough already (too base a thing for him to put himself into so great danger, and hazard for) but rather to win honour, and to make his name famous to future posterities: And that he would make it appear to the world that he came to assist their Master as his friend &amp; ally at his request: and that his upright intentions therein were the greatest cause that God from above had favoured him, and made him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental to bruile the head of the greatest and fiercest enemy of mankind that was under heaven; and therefore to get him an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal name, his purpose was to make free so great and flourishing a City as was <hi>Constantinople,</hi> governed by so noble and ancient an house as the Emperors. That he had alwayes joyned faith to his courage, which should never suffer him to make so great a breach<note place="margin">Tamerlanes fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> into his reputation, as that it should be reported of him, that in the colour of a friend he should come to invade the dominions of his ally. That he desired no more, but that the service he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51479:23"/>
had done for the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor might remaine for ever engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the memory of his posterity, to the end they might for ever wish well to him and his successors by the remembring the good he had done for them: That he wished that long might the noble Emperor live, happily to govern his estate, and that before his return, he would so well consider for the establishing of the same, as that he should not lightly fall into the same jeopardy.</p>
            <p>Easie it is to judge what joy the Ambassadors did conceive upon hearing this so gracious an answer from the mouth of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> who rather then he would break his Faith, refused an Empire of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, together with one of the stateliest, and magnificentest Cities in the world. After the testification of their joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness these Ambassadors were by the command of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> royally feasted by <hi>Axalla,</hi> having all the honour done to them that might be. And one of them being sent back to carry this<note place="margin">The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors dismissed.</note> unexpected news to the Emperor, filled both him and all the City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> with exceeding joy and gladness, which both he, &amp; all his subjects testified by making of Bonefires, and other signes of joy and pleasure. And the Emperor the more to shew his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude by the advise of his Councellors, passed over the streit into<note place="margin">The Greek Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror comes to him.</note>

            <p>Now had <hi>Tamerlane</hi> himself conceived a great desire to see the famous City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from which he was not now far, yet would he not go thither as a Conqueror, but as a private person:<note place="margin">Tamerlane goes to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</note> which by the meanes of <hi>Axalla</hi> was accomplished, and he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into by the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor privately received, and with all famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity possible entertained: the Emperor shewing unto him all the rare and excellent things that were contained therein; and the other <hi>Greek</hi> Princes devising all the meanes they could to do him pleasure, and them that were with him, who were all in a manner clothed after the <hi>Greek</hi> fashion. The <hi>Greek</hi>

Emperor was curious to shew him all the beautiful Gardens along the Sea-cost, and so privately conducting him about, spent five or six dayes with all the mirth that mighty be: <hi>Tamerlane</hi> by the way, often saying, that he had never seen a fairer City;<note place="margin">He highly commended it.</note> and that of all others, considering the scituation of it, it was right worthy to command all the world. He wondred at the costly buildings of the Temples, the faire engraven pillars, the high Pyramides, and the excellent gardens; afterwards saying often that it nothing repented him to have undertaken so long and dangerous a journy, if it had been only to preserve so notable a City from fire and sword. In the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor he greatly commended his mild nature &amp; courtesie, who knowing that above all things he took pleasure in fair serviceable horses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gave unto him thirty of the fairest, strongest, and reddiest that were possibly to be gotten, all most richly furnished: He sent likewise great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to all the Princes, and great Commanders of the Army, and bountifully caused to be delivered to them all things which he thought necessary for the army: So after these great kindnesses, and a strict bond of friendship made, and by solemne Oath confirmed by these two great Princes, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with great contentment took leave of the Emperor, and returned to his Army at <hi>Prusa,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with now at pleasure he spoiled and wasted all the dominions of <hi>Bajazet</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> no man daring to make head against him.</p>
            <p>The winter now drawing on, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> dispersed his Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">He sends his Army to their winter-quarters.</note> diverse Provinces of the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> expecting daily when some of <hi>Bajazet's</hi> sons, or great friends should make suite to him for his deliverance; but none came, most fearing the fierce na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who if he had been delivered, was like enough to have taken severe revenge upon all that forsook him in the battel, and therefore they never interceded for him. Whereupon <hi>Tamerlane</hi> one day passing by him, said, <hi>I marvel that none of thy sons, nor friends either come to see thee, or to intreat for thee; it must needs be that thou hast evil deserved of them, as thou hast of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

better. This proud answer made <hi>Tamerlane</hi> keep a stricter hand over him.</p>
            <p>In this great war the Sultan of <hi>Egypt</hi> (as we said before) had aided <hi>Bajazet,</hi> which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> took in so evil part that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved<note place="margin">Tamerlanes Justice.</note> revenge: for as to his friends he was most kinde and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, so to his enemies most terrible and dreadful. Yet before his departure he restored to the poor <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes that had fled to him for refuge, all their ancient inheritance, with something more out of his bounty; as also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he did diverse Cities and Countryes of <hi>Natolia</hi> to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor for the yeerly tribute of four hundred thousand Ducats of gold, and eight hundred thousand Franks of silver. And so having enriched<note place="margin">He marches towards Egypt.</note> his Army with the spoiles of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his forces against the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sultan, and so passing thorow <hi>Caramania,</hi> he entred into <hi>Syria,</hi> then part of the Sultans King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; where neer unto <hi>Aleppo</hi> (before yielded to him) there was fought betwixt them a great and mortal battel, the Sultan having in his Army a hundred thousand foot, and seventy four thousand horse; whereof there were thirty thousand Mameluks, accounted the best horsemen in the world. In which battel <hi>Axalla</hi> with the Avantguard of <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s Army was hardly distressed, and <hi>Axalla</hi> himself taken, but presently rescued by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who had he not by his coming on with fresh forces speedily restored<note place="margin">His battel with the Sultan.</note> the battel, that day was like enough to have put a period to his fortunes: But victory after a long and cruel fight (wherein were eighty thousand of both sides slaine) inclining to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> the Sultan sled, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> pursuing him for the space of three leagues.

overthrown a great part of the wall, took the City by storme, onely the Castle yet remained which was accounted impregnable:<note place="margin">Damasco taken by storme.</note> but yet at the taking of the City such a multitude pressed into it, as was not possible for them long to subsist; therefore in a short time being pinched with hunger, and many already dead, the rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promise of their lives offered to yield; But <hi>Tamerlane</hi> would not receive them to mercy to make them sensible what it was to hold out against him: So that most of them dying of famine, the rest yielded at pleasure, &amp; were most of them put to the sword for their obstinancy; which severity of his caused all the Cities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the space of thirty leagues to bring their keyes to him in token of their submission, whom he no way molested, otherwise then in<note place="margin">Tamerlane goes to Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</note> contributing to the charge of his Army. From thence he turned directly towards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> at which time they of the City had turned out the Sultans Garison, as had almost all they of <hi>Iudea,</hi> submiting themselves unto <hi>Tamerlane:</hi> At <hi>Chorazin</hi> was a Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of six thousand, who at first pretended to defend the place: but when they perceived that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was resolved to have it, they submitted, and found mercy. There <hi>Tamerlane</hi> left a Garison of his own to repress the Mameluks, who with frequent incursions<note place="margin">His Piety.</note> troubled his Army. Himself with some of his horsemen rode to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to visit the Sepulchre so much reverenced of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: by the inhabitants he was joyfully received, and having sought out all the antiquities of that ancient City, he would be conducted to all the places where Christ had preached, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sepulchre, he gave there many rich gifts, to the great content of all, only the Jews much blamed him for so doing, but he reguarded them not, calling them the accursed of God: There had he news that the Sultan having gathered together all his forces, was fortifying his Cities in <hi>Egypt,</hi> especially <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Caier;</hi> whereupon <hi>Tamerlane</hi> commanded his Army to march towards <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Damietta,</hi> which strong City he thought not good to leave behinde him, though by some he was perswaded so to do, for that it was thought impregnable both by reason of the strong Castle, and great Garison placed therein<note place="margin">He marcheth into Egypt.</note> by the Sultan: But he whose fortune nothing could hinder, would needs go thither: And having commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, followed himself after with the rest of his Army.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:51479:25"/>Now <hi>Axalla</hi> having summoned the City, declared to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants (who were most of them Christians) the mildness, and courtesie of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> as also who himself, and of what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione he was; causing many of his <hi>Greek</hi> Captains to speak to them, and to tell them what misery they endured under the <hi>Moors</hi> and Mameluks, which so far prevailed with them that they resolved to adventure their lives to put the Mameluks out of the City; And the night after taking Armes, made themselves<note place="margin">Damiettata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> Masters of one quarter of the City, opening one of the gates to <hi>Axalla,</hi> whereby he entering, put all the Mameluks to the sword, or took them prisoners, and so became Master of that strong City: Whereof <hi>Tamerlane</hi> hearing, hoped by so prosperous a beginning to finde an happy end of his wars in <hi>Egypt.</hi> For he knew that the haven of <hi>Damietta</hi> might furnish him with victuals out of all parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> as the Emperor <hi>Emmanuel</hi> had promised him, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he nothing failed him. Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> enter the City, leaving therein a Garison of two thousand of the Emperor of <hi>Greece</hi> his souldiers, with a Governor, of whom he took an oath for their obedience. And having staid a while at <hi>Damietta,</hi> he<note place="margin">Tamerlane marcheth to Caire.</note> caused his Avantguard to march towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and having passed over the River, he suddenly turned directly towards <hi>Grand Caire,</hi> to the great astonishment of the Sultan, who provided for the defence of <hi>Alexandria</hi> as neerest to the enemy: But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding this news, used such diligence that he entred into <hi>Caire</hi> with fourty thousand horse, and sixty thousand foot, even as <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Army approached to it. By this unexpected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Sultan, the great City that before was ready to have revolted, was again confirmed in his obedience to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> affaires: For to remaine long before it was impossible thorow want of victuals for so great an Army in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Country. Yet this discouraged not <hi>Tamerlane</hi> from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to it, and with all his Army to encamp neer unto the same, having caused a great trench to be made for the security of<note place="margin">Caire besieged.</note> his horsemen, and therein to lodge his Army more safely: during which time he caused diverse attempts to be made, as well to try the enemies confidence, as to see how the people of the City, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the slaves (which in that populous City are in great numbers) were affected towards him, who indeed were glad to see the state of his Army, and the proud Mameluks still put to the worst, but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51479:25"/>
farther stirred not. During this siege, he thought good one day to draw forth his Armie before the Citie, to try whether the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie had any minde to come to a battel; as also to view his own forces, and so indeed to seek occasion to fight, hoping that if the Sultan should come forth with his Army, some revolt might happen at the same time in the Citie, as well by the slaves, unto whom by secret Spies, he had promised liberty, as by the Citizens<note place="margin">Tamerlanes Policie.</note> themselves, who were much discontented with the insolency of the Mamelukes, and to whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> by the same Spies had made it known that he came not to hurt them, but to deliver them from the tyranny of his, and their enemies: But standing thus in battel array, none stirred out of the Citie, neither was there any tumult raised within, according as he expected: For the Sultan being plentifully provided with all things in that rich Citie, resolved to weary out <hi>Tamerlane</hi> by lying still, and not to put all to the hazard of a Battel. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> perceiving his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, yet resolved not to depart till he was victorious; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he thought fit also to attempt him in his greatest strength, and in the heart of his greatest Citie, though it could not be done without great hazard, such confidence had he in the valour, and multitude of his Army. Now his purpose was first to take one of the Cities (for <hi>Caire</hi> is divided into three) and therein encamping himself by little and little to advance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as he could finde opportunity. Upon this resolution he<note place="margin">Cair stormed.</note> commanded a strong assault to be given, and having conducted his footmen to the place chosen by him for the onset (for the Citie was not walled, but onely fortified with ditches and trenches) he commanded the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> with fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men to begin the assault even in the face of the enemy, which he most valiantly performed, which occasioned a great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fight <hi>Axalla</hi> in the mean time deeming (as the truth was) that the Sultan had drawn the greatest part of his forces to that place, fetched a compasse about, and in another part of the City, with small resistance passed the trenches, where he presently left thirty thousand men to fill up the ditches, thereby to make way for the Horsemens entrance, himself with the rest, advancing<note place="margin">Axalla enters.</note> forwards against twenty thousand sent by the Sultan to oppose his farther passage, the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> being at the same time almost beaten back by the Mamelukes: But the ditches being
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51479:26"/>
presently levelled, ten thousand horsemen entred, who charged upon the backs of the Mameluks, where the Sultan himself was; they were likewise seconded by ten thousand more sent in in by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> himself following after with all his power:<note place="margin">Caire taken.</note> Hereupon the Sultan retreated into a second strength which he had made in the next Citie.</p>
            <p>This fight endured full seven houres, wherein were slain of the Sultans men, above sixteen thousand, and of <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s between seven and eight thousand. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> being well contented that he had dislodged his enemy, and gained one of the Cities, caused a retreat to be sounded, hoping the next day to win all the rest, as indeed he did. For the next morning the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> storming the trenches in one part, as <hi>Axalla</hi> did in an other; the Sultan after a great fight finding himself hardly pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<note place="margin">The Sultan flyeth.</note> by the obstinate enemy, and unable longer to hold out, retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, abandoning the Citie, and encamping himself along the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> resolving to retire to the Citie of <hi>Alexandria</hi> his second strength, and onely refuge, which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> suspecting, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after him with his Horsemen, (who onely were in order) and<note place="margin">Tamerlane pursueth.</note> some few foot hardly drawn from the Citie, which their fellows were in plundering, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> promising them both to regard, and reward their good service. Against these the Sultan upon a narrow cawse way, had opposed twelve or fifteen thousand men to favour his passage, who being of his best Souldiers, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ground stoutly, the place being much for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; yet at length their enemies still encreasing, and pressing hard upon them, they were forced to cast themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">A brave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the Mameluks.</note> the great River, and made a most honourable retreat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every man having his weapon in one hand, and swimming with the other hand to the farther banke. The Sultan flying with about eighteen thousand Horse (the rest being either drowned, or dispersed) is said to have comforted his flying men, by telling them, they were not men, but gods that had vanquished them.</p>
            <p>Divers of the Mameluks that were taken prisoners, being<note place="margin">Fidelity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</note> brought before <hi>Tamerlane</hi> were by him courteously used, and asked if they would be content to serve him, seeing their Master was sled and gone? This they all utterly refused, whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing for their fidelity, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> set at liberty to go again to their Master, being no lesse desirous to be admired by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51479:26"/>
his enemies for his goodnesse and bounty, then to be feared for his force and valour.</p>
            <p>The wonderful wealth of this so great, and famous a Citie,<note place="margin">Caire plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> became a prey to his Souldiers, who for the space of twentie four houres had the spoil thereof: At the end whereof every man was straitly charged by open Proclamation to retire to his quarters. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> would not suffer any of the Citizens to be taken Prisoners, and such as were, he released, and so leaving ten thousand good Souldiers, with many others that followed his Camp, for the guard of the Citie, and taking with him all such persons, as he thought might hurt him, he caused his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie<note place="margin">Tamerlane goes to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</note> to passe over the River, and to follow the Sultan to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> that so his victory might be compleated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Axalla</hi> hasting before with the Avantguard to hinder the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan from gathering up his forces together: The rest of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was conducted by the Prince of <hi>Thanais. Tamerlane</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with an infinite number of Boats, and many Souldiers to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, went by water, greatly delighting to behold that fair River of <hi>Nilus,</hi> sometimes running with a swift course; other sometimes very calme, and scarce moved. The Citizens of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> hearing of his coming, and fearing the issue, besought the Sultan to compassionate their condition, and to withdraw himself into <hi>Lybia;</hi> whither <hi>Tamerlane</hi> could not follow him by reason of the barrenesse of the Countrie: Resolving for their parts to submit to fortune, and to do as the time required; yet promising in heart to remain his, and to make the same to appear to him, so soon as occasion should be offered. Hereupon the<note place="margin">The Sultan flyes.</note> Sultan, seeing all things desperate, determined to retire, yet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that time might bring a change, for that <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s numerous Armie could not long remain there: And so depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Alexandria</hi> with tears standing in his eyes, he often said, that God was angry with him and his people, so that he must of necessity suffer the fatall overthrow of his estate: yet for his own part he had done as much as in him lay, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dutie of his place, and to satisfie the expectation that the world had of him, for the upholding of the same, yet he hoped to return again, and to deliver his people from that bondage, which for the present they were necessitated to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to.</p>

               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> coming to <hi>Alexandria</hi> (before yielded to <hi>Axalla</hi>) staid there a great while, sending <hi>Axalla</hi> to pursue the Sultan;<note place="margin">Axalla pursues him.</note> being much grieved that he could not get him into his hands, and therefore he still feared that some Innovation would be raised by him after his departure, which made him to deal the more hardly with them he suspected to favour him. Now the bruit of these victories having with <hi>Axalla</hi> passed into <hi>Lybia,</hi> brought such a fear, not onely upon the Countries adjoyning to these Conquests, but also upon all <hi>Affrica,</hi> supposing (that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> followed with his Armie) that twentie two of the <hi>Moorish</hi>

With his did the desires of the Souldiers also well agree, who were now weary of running so many and divers adventures.

This <hi>Bajazet</hi> had some vertues, which were much obscured by his cholerick and waiward nature, which made him to exceed in cruelty and pride: He was also very covetous; which qualities made him indeed much feared, but little beloved of his souldiers and men of war, by whom therefore in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est need he was forsaken. He used commonly to say, That <hi>his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures were his childrens meat, and not his souldiers pay;</hi> which by way of reproach was by a common souldier cast in his teeth, when he raged to see himself by them forsaken in that great battel against <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> telling him as he fled, <hi>That he ran not away, but went to seek his pay, wherewith to provide his children bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> as we said before, having conquered <hi>Persia,</hi> used his victory so mildly, that as long as he lived the people of that Country were alwayes much affected to him; which served him greatly, as well for the keeping of <hi>Syria,</hi> as the Sultan of <hi>Egypts</hi> Empire: In his own Country he was received with all Triumphs, and expressions of joy that might be; the chiefest prisoners march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him, and wheresoever he passed, the people assembled themselves by thousands, praising and singing his victories. The Emperor having spent a moneth or two in Feasts and Triumphs<note place="margin">Tamerlane's devotion.</note> according to his accustomed devotion, he vowed a Church and Hospital unto God, the most magnificent that might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised: and to beautifie his City of <hi>Samercand,</hi> he searched out all sorts of Handicrafts-men, intending to make it as large again as it was, and one of the stateliest Cities in the world: he peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled<note place="margin">He enlargeth Samercand.</note> it also with so many several Nations as he had brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, unto whom he gave liberty to build houses, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing money unto them to do the same, giving them also all
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51479:28"/>
kind of priviledges, and immunities for their encouragement therein: He caused also the streets to be plotted out, and in one corner of it he built his Church and Hospital. His next care was to preserve the good will and love of his famous souldiers, whose names he caused to be Registred in a general Muster-Role, which he kept by him, and daily conferred honours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">His love to his souldiers.</note> upon them (they not thinking of it) in recompence of their former good services: thinking that day lost wherein he did not some good. Then did he declare the death of the old Emperor to his Councel (of which he had received private intelligence) and forgat no Ceremony due unto his honor, publikely expressing the<note place="margin">He goeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Quinsay.</note> grief he had conceived for his death, Then did he with his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Court consisting of fourty thousand horse, and sixty thousand foot, set forwards towards <hi>Quinsay,</hi> where his Emperess was. And when he came to <hi>Cambalu,</hi> he had intelligence of a battel fought by <hi>Odmar</hi> against the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Captaine General, and how he had pursued his victory, having taken three or four great and<note place="margin">Odmars victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in China.</note> rich Cities, and that the <hi>Chinois</hi> did again desire peace Hereupon he sent them these Articles; That the King of <hi>China</hi> should pay all the areares of his Tribute; That he should come in person to do his homage, acknowledging himself a Vassal of his Empire; That he should deliever up to him all his Cities saving three such as the Emperor should nominate: That he should pay all the charges of the war, because he had broken the peace; which<note place="margin">Tamerlane gives him his sister in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> performed, things should be restored to the same state they were in before the war. And to gratifie <hi>Odmar,</hi> he sent to him with all magnificence one of his sisters to be his wife.</p>
            <p>When he first entred into <hi>Cambalu,</hi> he was received with all the expressions of joy that might be, whereupon he restored to them their priviledges which he had taken from them for their Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Calix.</hi> The Emperess being informed of his being there (leaving Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> to govern at <hi>Quinsay</hi>) came to him: So that he remained there neer two moneths, giving order for all his affaires, the rather because it was neer to mount <hi>Althay,</hi> where the <hi>Scythian</hi> Emperors use to be buried: and so causing<note place="margin">The old Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror buried.</note> the body of the old Emperor to be brought thither, himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted it with all pomp, honouring not only the body, but all that he had loved in the world; and though it was not the custome for women to assist at Funerals, yet he took his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peress
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51479:29"/>
along with him, who went neer unto the Corpse, till they came to the place where it was interred amongst his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor. After these Ceremonies finished, he returned to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balu,</hi> where he spent the winter in Tilts, Turnaments, Hunting, and such like recreations: The rather because this place was neer to <hi>China,</hi> whereby he had the fitter opportunity to hear how affaires passed there, purposing to go thither in person the next winter, if <hi>Odmar</hi> that summer did not make an end of the wars: and if the King of <hi>China</hi> did not submit himself to his obedience. The mark he shot at now being only to keep that which by his valour he had won, desiring to spend the rest of his life in reaping the fruites of his hard travels, and former labours.</p>
            <p>Now Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> governed at <hi>Quinsay,</hi> as well to the great contentment of the souldiery, as of the inhabitants, who out of their abundant love to the Emperor, requested Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> to write importunately to him, that his son might be brought up amongst them, which at <hi>Axalla</hi>'s request he consented to, making him in the absence of his son, the Governor of <hi>Quinsay,</hi> from<note place="margin">His son brought up at Quinsay.</note> 
               <hi>Cambalu</hi> even to the Sea, which Country contained in it about three hundred Cities, besides an infinite number of villages: all which was formerly under the government of the old Emperor: He delivered also into his charge the Government of his son.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the King of <hi>China</hi> came to his Court, according<note place="margin">The King of China comes to him.</note> to the Covenants offered to him, where he once again swore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Emperor, who shewed him his greatness, the more to make him stand in awe: for he knew that this Barbarian would keep no promise longer then it should stand with his own interest. This King of <hi>China</hi> was astonished to behold so many souldiers, and the Country so well replenished with people: and above all, that they used so little curiosity and riches in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, especially wondring that the Emperor himself was apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mean cloth of one colour, without curiosity.</p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Tamerlane</hi> went to <hi>Quinsay,</hi> and by the way<note place="margin">Tameilane's plaine apparel.</note> was met by Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> and all the chief Lords and Citizens, who entertained him with all the magnificence that might be. This City of <hi>Quinsay</hi> was the fairest, and one of the richest in the world, and of the most wonderful scituation, being divided by<note place="margin">Quinsai descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. It was one hundred miles in compasse.</note> many channels of water, upon which are framed wonderful and stately buildings, having also an infinite number of Bridges: It
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51479:29"/>
abounds with all kinde of Spices, and Merchandizes in great quantity. The Citizens presented the Emperor with many rare things, judged to be worth two millions in gold, with great variety of strange and excellent things. Then did the Emperor call for his son that was there educated, who was now seven yeers old. He forbade that thence forward they should suffer him to<note place="margin">His directions about the breeding of his son.</note> wear any thing on his head, and hung a bough about his neck, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>That they which from their birth were called to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, should be used both to cold, and heat, and should be exercised to armes betimes, and not be brought up idly, and delicatly: reprehending those which brought him up for using him so tenderly, asking them if they meant to make a woman of of his son? They replying that he was tender. If he be not born (said he) to be strong and valiant, he will not be worthy to succeed me, for he must not be an effeminate Prince that must preserve the <hi>Parthian</hi> Empire.</q> About this time his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peress<note place="margin">His second son born.</note> was brought to bed of another son at <hi>Samarcand,</hi> for joy whereof he made Feasts, with Tiltings and pastimes fifteen dayes<note place="margin">Recreations rightly used<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> together. Then did he visit all the Sea-Townsineer to <hi>Quinsay,</hi> hunting all manner of Games: yet saying often, That <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations which he used, were only helps to ease him in the paines of his publick affaires which God had called him to.</hi> And when Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> told him that that City was a fit place for his abode.<note place="margin">His prudence,</note> 
               <q>O my friend (said he) it is not so: For its a Maxime, that the Lord of this great City must not come to it above once in ten yeers, and when he is here, he must temper his actions, as if he were upon a stage, with gravity and a good grace before the people, who are apt to receive good or evil impressions accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their Prince deporteth himself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having setled his affaires in that part of his Empire, he returned<note place="margin">His return to Samarcand. His Justice.</note> to <hi>Samercand,</hi> where three times a week he administred Justice publickly unto the meanest of his subjects as well as to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, which made him much beloved of all over whom he did command. On other dayes he gave secret audience, and disposed of the affaires of his estate which were concluded daily in his presence. In his counsel he used such severity that none durst deal untruly, or passionately in his presence. Yet shewed he such courteousness in his conversation that he was both beloved and feared of his people. He never changed his servants except they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51479:30"/>
committed some great faults against him. All the servants of the<note place="margin">His love to his servants.</note> late Emperor his Uncle, he never changed one of them, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased their pensions, making them sencible of his liberality in that change: The like bounty he used to strangers, thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<note place="margin">His bounty.</note> them to him. He drew great store of money yeerly from the <hi>Muscovite</hi> by way of tribute, which yet he distributed in the same Country to maintaine his authority there, winning those to him, who otherwise might have hurt him. He had great care of his revenues, wherein he was so expedite that in one hours space he could see his estate from three moneths to three moneths, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his ordinary and extraordinary expences, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented<note place="margin">His frugality.</note> to him so well digested.</p>
            <p>But after all his publick affaires so well mannaged, and his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate businesses so well ordered, sickness arrested, and death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered this great Conqueror, leaving his Empire to <hi>Sautochio</hi>
               <note place="margin">His death.</note> his eldest son now ninteen yeers old, who was proclaimed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror within two hours after his fathers death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> from his childhood was well instructed in the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Character.</note> learning, wherein he was very studious, insomuch as when they thought him to be in the Bathes, wherein they are very curious in that Country, being their chiefest delight, he was retired to the contemplation and study of heavenly things. He had within his eyes such a Divine beauty, and radiancy full of majesty, that one could hardly endure the sight of them without closing of his eys, so that some that talked with him, and beheld him were stricken dumb for the present, which caused him with a comely modesty to abstain from looking upon them that talked with him. All the rest of his visage was courteous, and well proportioned: He had but little haire on his chin: He wore his haire long and curled, contrary to the custome of his Country men, who used to shave their heads: He went almost alwayes bareheaded, saying, that his mother came of the race of <hi>Sampson,</hi> who therefore advised him to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour long haire. His haire was of a dusky colour inclining some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to a Violet, the most beautiful that any eye could behold. His stature was of a middle sort, somewhat narrow in his shoulders: He had a faire and strong leg: his bodily strength and agility was such as none did surpass, and often on Festival dayes, he made trial of them with the strongest; yet did he it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51479:30"/>
with such a grace, mixt with humanity, that he whom he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came held himself therein most happy, though it was a great disgrace amongst the <hi>Tartarians</hi> to be thrown to the ground in wrestling.</p>
            <p>In the time of his Warrs against the Turks, a Souldier of his<note place="margin">Note.</note> found buried in the ground a great pot of Gold, which he brought to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who asked him if it had his Fathers stamp upon it; But when he saw that it had the stamp of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he would not own, nor meddle with it.</p>
