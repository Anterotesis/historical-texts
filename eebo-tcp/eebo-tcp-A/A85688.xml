            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Magiſtrate cannot reſtrain or cenſure the inward luſts of the heart, nor the corruption of the judgment.

Such things as appertaine to the outward man, ſuch things only are within the cognizance of the civill Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Magiſtrate cannot conſtraine to the inward exerciſe of religion with ſpirit and power; he cannot compell any man to bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, This power is not wholly ſpirituall in reſpect of the Subject.</p>
            <p>The power of the Magiſtrate is not a compulſive power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the conſcience, to deſtroy or infringe that liberty purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſt. Conſcience is bound to no other Lord, or Lawgiver then Chriſt, to no other rule then the Word.

The power of Derivatives or Relatives is moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in that ſubject which ſtands in the neareſt relation: power is more in the wife then any under the husband in the family, heat is more in fire, then it is in water made hot by fire. <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid efficit tale magis eſt tale,</hi> thoſe that ſtand in the neareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto, are the livelieſt Repreſentation of the People, in thoſe is power moſt tranſcendent.

devolved into the hands of the generall Councell, and was by them to be diſpoſed of according to order, for the rule and government of the univerſall Church, to which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every perſon was comanded to ſubmit. So the Romanes when <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> had rendred regall government odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Commons of <hi>Rome</hi> by his Tyranny, and exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the Senate depoſed him, cenſured him to baniſhment, and altered the frame of the Government from Kings to Conſuls; it is hence a knowne maxime in civill law, and owned by moſt Nations, that he who changeth Government, (from a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy to a Tyranny) loſeth the right of the former.

               <p>Theſe States ſtating this for a fundamentall, that treaſon againſt a State is more criminall then againſt a King, the whole being greater then a part; Thoſe hold every State or Kingdome to be an Independent body, no one having deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination over the other, neither owing an account of their actions each unto other, but only to thoſe by whom they are entruſted. One State may as well take liberty to prejudge another in matter of vote, with as much reaſon as they may in matter of fact; and what State would tolerate ſuch uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? neither are conſociated kingdoms further concerned in the affairs each of other, but for mutuall helpefulneſſe to the remotion of common dangers, by the conjunction of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and powers, ſtill preferring their Liberties, priviledges, and intereſts, diſtinct, peculiar, and intire.
