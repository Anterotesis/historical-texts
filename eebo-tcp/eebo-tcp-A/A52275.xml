            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRUE RELATION OF THE FACT, TRIAL, CARRIAGE and DEATH OF Elizabeth Ridgeway.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ELizabeth,</hi> the late <hi>Wife of the late Thomas Ridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> was born at <hi>Ibſtock</hi> in the County of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and there educated in the knowledge of the ordinary Duties of Chriſtianity, ſo far as concern a Woman in <hi>her</hi> ſtation. Being arrived at Maturity, ſhe was, at the inſtigation, and through the practices of a pragmatical <hi>Fellow ſervant,</hi> utterly againſt her Father's declared Will <hi>(He forbidding the Banns)</hi> married to the above-named <hi>Thomas Ridgeway of Ib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, Tailor.</hi> They were married (if I miſtake not) on <hi>Friday, Febr.</hi> 1. 1683/4. Thenceforward they lived together in all ſeeming mutual Love, without the leaſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96343:4"/>
jarr, until the <hi>Sunday three weeks after.</hi> On that <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning</hi> Tho. Ridgeway went to Church, and his Wife ſtaid at home to prepare Dinner. At his <hi>coming home</hi> ſhe gave him a <hi>Diſh of Broth</hi>; of which he ate the greater quantity, but left part; there being ſeen in it <hi>ſomething like to Gritt or Lime.</hi> In leſs than half an hour he was taken with a <hi>violent vomiting and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,</hi> and held therewith 'till <hi>past midnight</hi>; when in great torment he <hi>died,</hi> not ſuſpecting <hi>(as is ſaid)</hi> any thing of Poyſon.</p>
            <p>A day or two after he had been buried, an <hi>Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> of his, about Sixteen years of Age, declared to his Maſters Relations, that, he <hi>feared his Maſter was poyſon'd,</hi> becauſe of that <hi>ſtuff, that was ſeen in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his diſh,</hi> which his Wife took from him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd away. This Information being taken by a <hi>Juſtice of Peace,</hi> a Gentleman of great <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> an Inqueſt was ordered by him to be taken by the <hi>Coroner:</hi> Upon whoſe Inqueſt the Wife was found <hi>Guilty of Poyſoning her Husband,</hi> and by the <hi>Coroner's Mittimus</hi> ſent to the Gaol at <hi>Leiceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday, March</hi> 14. She was by the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> put upon her Trial before my <hi>Lord Judge Street.</hi> Upon her Arraignment ſhe pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and put her ſelf upon her Countrey for her Trial. Upon a Full Hearing, ſhe was at firſt by <hi>Eight thought Guilty,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Debate <hi>found Guilty by the whole Twelve,</hi> and according to the Verdict <hi>Sentence past.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proof depending principally upon the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a <hi>Youth of Sixteen years old,</hi> and ſhe all along
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96343:4"/>
proteſting her <hi>Innocency,</hi> ſome tender People were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hope favourably of her; whereupon ſome Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications were made on <hi>Saturday morning</hi> for ſome Reſpite, or a Reprieve. But his Lordſhip having by his great <hi>Sagacity</hi> clearly diſcerned, how <hi>well</hi> his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was grounded, and how <hi>neceſſary</hi> it was, it ſhould be executed, according to his ſignal <hi>Wiſdom and Juſtice,</hi> rejected all ſuch Addreſſes, leaving her to the <hi>Mercy of God,</hi> and the <hi>Care of her Friends</hi>; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly recommending of her to <hi>my poor Advice and Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to ſtand to give you any account of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers preferred to God by my ſelf and others, publickly and privately, for and with her, I ſhall proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the <hi>Occurrences of each day,</hi> from her <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to her <hi>Execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday night</hi> ſhe only aſſerted her <hi>Innocence,</hi> and begg'd, that Application might be made for her <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday evening</hi> I, viſiting of her, enquir'd of her Guilt, but ſhe aſſerted her Innocence. I deſired her thereupon to recollect, whether ſhe had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>ſome other heinous Offence of the like or ſome other nature,</hi> for which God might be provoked to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch a grievous unuſual Calamity to befall her. At that ſhe ſighed, and ſaid, <hi>Ay, There it is, There's the cauſe of my Woe</hi>; or words of the like Import: And ſo upon fair Inducements, ſhe proceeded to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſhe feared ſhe was too far concerned in the <hi>Death of another Man:</hi> which (as ſhe then freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) came to paſs as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96343:5"/>Having left her Father's Houſe, and betaken her ſelf to a Service in the Town, and her Maſter being often from home, ſeveral young Men frequented the Houſe, with whom ſhe was wont to diſcourſe of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Marriage</hi>; profeſſing often more Love to any of them all, than was at any one time meet to pretend to <hi>any more than one.</hi> One above the reſt ſhe for ſeveral Months entertain'd, not only with fair <hi>expreſſions of Affection,</hi> but alſo with <hi>promiſes of Marriage.</hi> After all, on a ſudden, ſhe <hi>utterly rejects him,</hi> without any juſt cauſe aſſign'd. Not long after, he on the Friday falls into a <hi>violent Diſtemper,</hi> whereof (after he had ſent importunate Entreaties for a <hi>Viſit</hi> from her, which ſhe <hi>utterly deny'd</hi>) the next Week he dies. Now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there was then nothing of <hi>foul Practice</hi> ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet, upon <hi>recollection,</hi> it is well remembred, that he, in his <hi>last illneſs, fared very ſtrangely.</hi> That upon his ſudden Fall his blood ſetled (as they apprehended) and turned black, he burned intolerably, all eaſe of Nature was utterly obſtructed, his Stomach was violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gnawed: But, above all, he all along complained of the <hi>last draught of Beer he drank</hi> (after his coming from out of the Field) in his Maſters houſe; where, <hi>that day,</hi> (as <hi>his Wife</hi> a little before her death affirmed) <hi>Thomas Ridgeway aforeſaid was at work:</hi> And here, by the way, it is ſomething <hi>remarkable,</hi> that ſhe ſhould <hi>ſo early obſerve,</hi> and <hi>ſo lately remember,</hi> that her Husband wrought <hi>the ſame day in the ſame houſe,</hi> wherein the other Perſon fell ſo ſuddenly and ſo violently into a mortal Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>She further told me, that juſt before her Husband <hi>breathed his last,</hi> he, in horror, cry'd out, <hi>That God's hand was just upon him, for the wrong he had done to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96343:5"/>
that perſon ſo deceaſed; for as much as having had time afforded him to repent of it, he neglected to improve it, and now being just dying he could not repent.</hi> I asked her what the <hi>wrong</hi> was: She anſwered that ſhe had no time to enquire of him particularly <hi>what it was.</hi> I asked her whether ſhe had not at any time heard <hi>Tho. Ridgeway threaten the Perſon deceaſed?</hi> She anſwered no; nor was ſhe at all privy to any violence practiſed or intended: Yet ſhe ſaid that ſhe feared <hi>Thomas Ridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> had played <hi>ſome foul play,</hi> and that ſhe <hi>her ſelf was to blame</hi>; and that ſhe had been often <hi>haunted, both making and ſleeping, with frightful apprehenſions of the appearing of the deceaſed Perſon to her.</hi> All this while I could draw no more from her, touching any mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous deſign or attempt, than that ſhe ſuſpected her <hi>falſe and cruel carriage</hi> towards him, might occaſion his Sickneſs and death.</p>
            <p>I then inquired of her, <hi>Who the deceaſed Perſon was?</hi> She refuſed to tell me either his <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Place of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> or <hi>Time of Dying</hi>; and all, leſt the noiſe of ſuch a diſcovery, ſhould revive much grief to his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which I told her might eaſily be prevented. At laſt ſhe told me, that <hi>his Mother lived at a Neighbouring Town called</hi> Norton: I gave her my ſence of all, and left her.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday,</hi> as ſhe came from Church in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I examined her again ſtrictly and ſeriouſly; but ſhe advanced <hi>not one ſtep.</hi> Within two hours, after ſhe had denyed all knowledg of any evil will of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ridgeway</hi> againſt the <hi>Perſon deceas'd,</hi> a Brother and a Siſter of hers came to my Houſe, and told me, that ſhe freely <hi>confeſſed to them,</hi> that <hi>Thomas Ridgeway</hi> had long and often threatned the Perſon deceaſed with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96343:6"/>
Revenge, and <hi>Cutting of him off:</hi> That for a time ſhe endeavoured to diſſwade him; but at laſt permitted him by ſaying theſe words, <hi>[Do what you will with him.]</hi> I inquired the <hi>Name of the Perſon:</hi> They ſaid, they knew it not: I told 'em, <hi>His Mother liv'd at</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton: They anſwered, it muſt certainly be one <hi>John King</hi> who had liv'd in their Town, and died about <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer laſt.</hi> Whereupon I apprehended that her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Siſter became very <hi>ſuſpicious</hi> of ſome heinous guilt of them both: I mean both of <hi>her Husband and her ſelf.</hi>

               <hi>At night,</hi> I queſtioning of her of what hath paſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this ſhort and reſerved anſwer: <hi>I ſuppoſe my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath told you all.</hi> I asked her what ſhe ſaid to <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ridgeway,</hi> when he firſt came to her with profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Love, <hi>after the death of</hi> John King. She ſaid, ſhe uſed theſe words: <hi>So, have you not now made good your threatning words against</hi> John King? I here ſet my ſelf to diſplay and aggravate the black crimes of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ridgeway</hi> and her ſelf. She anſwered me after this canting manner, <hi>Truly I dare not judge my Husband for any thing further than for ſome raſh and harſh words; nor my ſelf, for intending any hurt by ſpeaking the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned words of conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon I left her, not without <hi>aſtoniſhment,</hi> that ſhe ſhould go ſo far towards the Confeſſion of a <hi>bloody Fact,</hi> the guilt whereof I could render her no further ſenſible of.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday morning,</hi> having conſidered what a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſtupid, uncertain, yea, and <hi>falſe Creature</hi> I had to deal with, I ſet down in writing the moſt material paſſages, which ſhe with <hi>her own mouth</hi> had related to me; and thoſe in the hearing of divers grave Perſons,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96343:6"/>
I diſtinctly <hi>read, and questioned her upon.</hi> She could not deny any word that I charged her withal. The <hi>Fact</hi> all along ſhe acknowledged, but ſtill, as before, the <hi>Guilt</hi> ſhe denyed.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday, Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday,</hi> ſhe perſiſted much in the ſame poſture.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday,</hi> a Neighbour of hers charged her home with <hi>buying two penniworth of</hi> white Arſenick <hi>on the</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday <hi>ſevennight after She was married, at</hi> Aſhby-de-la-Zouch. After a while ſhe <hi>acknowledged it,</hi> but could not aſſign any <hi>uſe</hi> ſhe made of it. The Perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting me with this, I <hi>that Evening</hi> went to her, and applyed my ſelf very ſeverely to her for <hi>denying ſo long her buying any Poyſon</hi>; and concluded ſhe had <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it to her Husband.</hi> She would not <hi>expreſly confeſs the buying of the Poyſon,</hi> or that ſhe had <hi>before confeſſed it to her Neighbour</hi>; nor yet, upon my charging of her ſo peremptorily, did ſhe <hi>deny either buying or ſuch uſing of the Poyſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thereupon took leave of her, with a purpoſe to <hi>ſee her no more,</hi> until finding her ſelf in a better mind, ſhe ſhould ſend for me: And ſo I <hi>told her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this obſtinacy and reſervedneſs amazed me, and put me upon gueſſing at the <hi>cauſe thereof</hi>; which I could not determine to be mere <hi>Blindneſs and Senſeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> becauſe ſhe otherways appeared ſufficiently Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive and Knowing. I was not willing to impute her ſhyneſs to an <hi>utter averſion to my Cloth and way</hi>; becauſe ſhe had declared her ſelf indifferently inclined to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Private Meetings.</hi> Sometimes I thought her ſilence proceeded from an unwillingneſs to imprint the mark of her Infamy upon her the deeper by her <hi>own Confeſſion,</hi> whether ſhe believed ſhe was to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96343:7"/>
               <hi>Die,</hi> or whether ſhe hoped for any fruit of the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of ſome for a <hi>Reprieve.</hi> She did indeed declare a tenderneſs ſhe had for the <hi>Credit of a Party,</hi> amongſt whom ſhe had been bred and convers'd: But I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to aſſure her, that the Reputation of any Party was much better provided for by the <hi>humble Confeſſion,</hi> than by the <hi>obſtinate denyal</hi> of any Criminal Member of the ſame; and that it argued an intolerable <hi>Pride</hi> in her, to think that the Credit of any Party depended upon any <hi>ſuch obſcure and vile wretch as her ſelf.</hi> But if, after all, there were any Perſon, or Perſons, that <hi>adviſed her to any concealment of the Guilt of her ſelf or any other,</hi> ſo derogatory to the Honour of <hi>Publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and ſo pernicious to <hi>her Soul</hi>; let ſuch <hi>(if any there be)</hi> repent effectually in time, leſt, at the laſt Judgment, they find more Blood to anſwer for, than yet they think of. But to return to the <hi>Story.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday,</hi> to a very <hi>conſiderable Perſon,</hi> ſhe began to acknowledge <hi>ſome concern ſhe had had in the Death of her Husband</hi>; and ſhe deſired him to acquaint me, that ſhe was very ſorry ſhe had <hi>dealt ſo unfaithfully with me</hi>; and to intreat me I would make her <hi>another viſit,</hi> that ſhe might diſcover the <hi>whole Truth</hi> to me.</p>
            <p>When I came to her, ſhe told me that ſhe had indeed <hi>bought Poyſon at</hi> a <hi>Shop in</hi> Aſhby, <hi>in the preſence of one Widow</hi> Brooks, who wrapt it up, (and who hath this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at leaſt, to anſwer for, that ſhe <hi>appeared not to give E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for God and the King againſt the Criminal.</hi>) She <hi>added,</hi> that ſhe had not made <hi>any uſe of the ſaid Poyſon,</hi> but that it then yet lay upon a Bed in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe. She further <hi>added,</hi> that there was a <hi>man,</hi> who, both before and after her Marriage, did ſollicit her very much for her Love; and who, to make way
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96343:7"/>
to his ends, came on <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>Church-time</hi> to her houſe; and having put <hi>ſome poyſon into a diſh,</hi> ſlipt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; that ſhe <hi>wittingly, at her Husbands return home, put Broth to the Poyſon, and gave it to her Husband to his destruction:</hi> That ſhe had ſeen the face of this man that day in the next Room to her; that I ſhould <hi>ſee him at her Execution,</hi> for his Countenance would bewray his Guilt: That he had lived at <hi>Ibſtock,</hi> and now lives with a Gentleman at <hi>Hinckly.</hi> His Name ſhe would by no means declare, as being <hi>under a Vow or Oath to the contrary.</hi> I diſcovered to her the <hi>wickedneſs of ſuch an Oath,</hi> and that it could no ways bind her to ſuch an <hi>Helliſh Concealment.</hi> When I had ſaid all I could, I was conſtrained to leave her, without any further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction touching <hi>this pretended Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday,</hi> ſhe, with the <hi>other Condemned Perſons</hi> was again brought to Church Morning and Evening: After <hi>Evening Sermon,</hi> ſhe declared to a Gentlewoman, that whereas before ſhe was reſolved, that <hi>all the world ſhould not have perſwaded her to confeſs the very truth</hi>; She, upon hearing the <hi>Sermon</hi> (the ſubſtance whereof is hereto annexed) declared an inviolable purpoſe to be <hi>free and ſincere in her Confeſſion to me.</hi> I went up to her Chamber, and yet found her not ſo forward to ſuch Confeſſion: <hi>Soon after,</hi> her Father and the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had heard her make the Promiſe, went up to <hi>challenge her therewith.</hi> She, <hi>laughing in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> told them, that <hi>All ſhe had ſaid touching the man of</hi> Hinckly, <hi>was a mere fiction</hi>; and that there was <hi>no ſuch man in being</hi>; but that ſhe <hi>her ſelf alone, and without the confederacy or privity of any other creature, had poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned her Husband.</hi> Nor did ſhe expreſs any deſire of ſeeing me that Night, as I could then hear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:96343:8"/>I began to ſuſpect ſhe was <hi>diſtracted,</hi> and ſo went home: And I ſhould have continued under <hi>that ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> but that at her requeſt ſent firſt by her <hi>Brother</hi> and afterwards by her <hi>Father,</hi> I coming to her <hi>ſome hours before Execution,</hi> found her in a temper that ſpoke <hi>no ſuch diſorder of mind:</hi> For ſhe then in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of approaching Death and Judgment, did <hi>with many tears confirm her laſt Confeſſion.</hi> She <hi>further told us,</hi> that <hi>three years before, upon ſome diſcontent, ſhe had bought other poyſon with a purpoſe to make away her ſelf:</hi> which happening <hi>about the time of her mothers death,</hi> occaſions ſome ſurmiſes touching the ſame; as alſo ſome whiſpers of the death of <hi>another young man, and two little Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>laſt Poyſon,</hi> ſhe ſaid ſhe bought it for <hi>her ſelf</hi> being fruſtrated of her <hi>expectations in her marriage:</hi> For ſhe could not <hi>love her Husband as ſhe ought</hi>; and took further prejudice againſt him, becauſe of <hi>a debt of twenty pounds,</hi> which his Siſter demanded of him ſoon after his marriage, and which was as much as ever he had pretended to be worth. But, <hi>above a week before her Husbands death, ſhe converted her deſpair into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> and ſo took the firſt opportunity for <hi>ſending of him out of the world.</hi> This ſhe <hi>conſtantly aſſerted with ſeeming remorſe and ſorrow until her very death</hi>; which ſhe underwent without much apparent conſternation, and yet with much ſeeming contrition.</p>
            <p>☞ And <hi>this laſt declaration ſhe did earneſtly intreat me to make known as the real Truth,</hi> for the preventing all <hi>falſe reports</hi> that might be further raiſed, and for the <hi>rectifying of all miſtakes,</hi> which by means of her ſelf or others, had been already ſpread abroad.</p>
            <p>If the real <hi>importunity of divers of my worthy Friends,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96343:8"/>
had not after a ſort inforced the Publication of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed tedious ſtory, the very <hi>requeſt of the dying Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,</hi> being ſo well grounded, might have induced me thereto; eſpecially when thereby I do but conſult <hi>my own eaſe:</hi> For now I can refer many to this Print, who would otherwiſe be exacting frequent relations of the matter of me by word or writing.</p>
            <p>I know that to ſome <hi>inconſiderate Perſons,</hi> the Story may appear leſs agreeable for the <hi>Lamentable Form,</hi> as well as <hi>Matter</hi> of it; it containing divers <hi>uncertainties,</hi> and <hi>contradictions about horrid Poyſoning.</hi> Nevertheleſs, through the uſe of ordinary diſcretion, <hi>out of ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Poyſon much ſoveraign Medicine may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded:</hi> To give you a <hi>few Inſtances amongst many,</hi> that your own Reaſon may collect: — Hence,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Majeſties Juſtice is vindicated from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Partiality,</hi> which ſome have wickedly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to fix thereupon, by ſuggeſting that the woman was dealt the more harſhly with, for her <hi>ſuppoſed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinion or Inclination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If Virtue and Goodneſs be not always the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of a <hi>careful Education,</hi> how may we dread the wickedneſs of our Children, that may enſue upon our <hi>utter neglect,</hi> or <hi>evil example?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Parents,</hi> who are openly repayed in the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of a Child,</hi> ſhould do well, humbly to reflect upon the provocation they may have given to God, and the encouragement they have occaſioned to their Child, by any viſible oppoſition they have made to the <hi>Sovereign Father of their Country,</hi> or by any manifeſt diſregard they have any ways ſhewed to their <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Mother the Church.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.21, 22. When I diſcerned my Brethrens <hi>bloody purpoſes</hi> againſt my Brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> I deliver'd him actually out of their hands; and diverting them from killing of him, I contrived the <hi>putting of him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Pit,</hi> that thence I might in ſeaſon have taken him,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96343:15"/>
and delivered him to his Father again, without any ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him into ſlavery and danger.</p>
            <p>

And now <hi>this diſtreſs</hi> is come upon us, and the wickedneſs of that our <hi>unnatural ſin</hi> is thereby afreſh brought to our remembrance; although I do tell you, that I <hi>abhorr'd and declar'd against ſuch ſin</hi>; yet I do not take upon me to exempt my ſelf from <hi>all guilt.</hi> I do conclude <hi>his Blood is required:</hi> you muſt needs acknowledge <hi>your ſelves guilty of it,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>murderous conſpiracy and cruel practice.</hi> Nor do I ſay but <hi>my concealing</hi> of the whole from my Father to the indemnifying of you, may juſtly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhare of his Blood to be required of <hi>me amongst the rest of you.</hi>

            <p>After all that hath been ſaid upon the aggravation of this Miſdemeanor, we may clearly diſcern, that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> evil men may be (and the <hi>leſs ſenſible</hi> they are, the <hi>worſe</hi> may they be judged to be) of any actions amounting to Murder; ſuch good men (as in the main we may hope <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s <hi>Brethren</hi> to have been) are apt to be overwhelmed with apprehenſions of ſuch their attempts as but <hi>border upon Bloodſhed.</hi> They not

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>groſs Murder it ſelf</hi> is not ſo utterly unpractiſed amongſt us, that at this time we need to inſiſt upon its <hi>Circumſtantials,</hi> or the <hi>Tendencies thereto.</hi> How fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth there cry aloud in our ears, <hi>The Blood of Innocents ſhed by their unnatural Mothers at their birth,</hi> the Blood of honeſt men ſhed upon the <hi>Road,</hi> or in their <hi>Bed</hi> by <hi>Robbers and Burglarers</hi>? Not to mention the leſs precious Blood of <hi>Ruffians ſhed in Taverns,</hi> or of <hi>Hectors ſhed in Duels.</hi> Sometimes we hear of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Sinners ſhedding <hi>their own blood with their own hands.</hi> At this time we are given to ſuſpect that the <hi>Blood of a Lover hath been ſhed by his Rival,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to by his unconſtant and treacherous Miſtriſs.</hi> However, this we are ſure of, that we have here in view a <hi>wretched woman ſentenced to death for hating her own Fleſh, and poyſoning her ſo lately married Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:</hi> Nor doth the horror of the Fact as yet oblige her (ſo far as we can <hi>yet diſcern</hi>) either to the <hi>free confeſſing of her Murder before men,</hi> or to the duely <hi>aggravating of it to her ſelf.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:96343:16"/>
Can you aggravate your Sin from your <hi>Treachery,</hi> who when he <hi>asked Food,</hi> did with ſemblance of Love, give him as bad as a <hi>Serpent or a Scorpion?</hi> Can you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance your Guilt, by conſidering how you have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a <hi>Man made in the likeneſs of God</hi>; and how you have murder'd a <hi>Husband ſet over you as your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Head?</hi> Whereupon the wiſdom of our <hi>Law-givers</hi> hath made ſuch Murder no leſs than <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have alſo ordained a <hi>puniſhment for it no leſs terrible,</hi> than its Name is odious: even that of <hi>burning alive to aſhes</hi>; which may be probably ſuppos'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend amongſt other, theſe two formidable Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the one of <hi>Hell Torment,</hi> the other of <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oblivion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet further; Can you, during your ſilence and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, counſel your ſelf in all the methods of an <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Repentance,</hi> and <hi>ſaving Faith?</hi> Can you aſſure your ſelf of the prevalence of <hi>your own Prayers,</hi> (if you pray at all) or can you hope for the effectual fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Prayers of the Righteous,</hi> who can diſcover in you no ſuch Contrition, as may move 'em to Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Can a Soul, ſo preſs'd down as yours ought to be, raiſe it ſelf up, unleſs by <hi>deep Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>free Confeſſion,</hi> you obtain <hi>comfortable Abſolution?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s guilty Brethren came to know that they ſtood before him, they could not anſwer him, for they were <hi>troubled</hi> and <hi>terrified at his preſence.</hi> And are you able (if you know you ſtand in a <hi>more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preſence,</hi> even that of <hi>God himſelf</hi>) can you be able to think, or ſpeak, or do any thing of a free and noble nature, that may at all <hi>recommend you to mercy?</hi> I rather ſuſpect, that <hi>ſuch a cloſe, ſullen, trayterous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,</hi> muſt through her dark thoughts be <hi>rackt with

torture,</hi> be bound in all her Faculties, and be drown'd in Deſpair and Perdition.</p>
            <p>Conſider then <hi>in time,</hi> (if it be not already paſt) whether it be not more adviſeable to make an <hi>ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcovery of the whole of your Guilt,</hi> than at laſt, when it is too late, to have it <hi>wrung out with the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or <hi>extracted by the Fire.</hi> Let not then your wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs be <hi>ſweet in your mouth,</hi> neither <hi>hide it under your tongue,</hi> Job 20.12. <hi>Acknowledge your tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and <hi>let your ſin be ever before you</hi>; according to the <hi>language and practice of penitent</hi> David, <hi>when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the guilt of blood,</hi> Pſal. 51.3. Yea, take your puniſhment meekly, as <hi>juſtly inflicted upon you both by God and man for your heinous ſin</hi>; which leads me to the <hi>last Particular of their Deportment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Having Remembred, Confeſſed, and Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Sin, they <hi>take their preſent Distreſs to be as a puniſhment inflicted upon them for it.</hi>

            <p>Theſe men had been from their Infancy educated in the <hi>Knowledge and Fear of the True God,</hi> who made and Governs, and Judges the World in Righteouſneſs. And however their <hi>Envy</hi> againſt their Brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> might for a ſeaſon blind 'em, to the permitting of 'em to do ſo foul a deed: And however their <hi>Proſperity</hi> might of a long time infatuate 'em, to the ſtupifying of their hearts to the Recognition or Senſe of the ſame; yet they not having abjur'd or forgotten their God, nor having utterly ſtifled their Conſciences, nor having abſolutely eraſed paſt facts out of their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but being now caſt into ſudden adverſity, which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96343:17"/>
makes men to <hi>conſider,</hi> they begin penſively to caſt about for the <hi>Cauſe of their preſent Woe.</hi> Diſtreſs they ſenſibly feel: <hi>A Cauſe thereof they muſt ſuppoſe</hi>; for they were not of the number of thoſe, that imagine any thing comes by a mere <hi>blind chance.</hi> They knew their affliction <hi>aroſe not out of the duſt,</hi> nor was blown upon them by any of the winds: Nor did they blame the <hi>Stars</hi> for it: They underſtood that <hi>God orders all the affairs of men, both for weal and wo:</hi> They knew that he doth <hi>not willingly afflict nor grieve the children of men, to cruſh under his feet all the Priſoners of the Earth.</hi> They weighed that <hi>Sin is the only Mother of Miſery,</hi> and that theref<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re they muſt certainly have <hi>ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Maker and Judge</hi>; and that the grievouſeſt of all their Sins muſt be put to this account.

            </p>
            <p>They could not then but remember, what they had <hi>long before contriv'd and executed againſt their dear Brother,</hi> Joſeph. In the ſevere Treatment they now met withal, being threatned as Spies, obliged to fetch their tender Brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> to the grief of their Aged Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the danger of his Life; and being in danger all, or ſome of 'em, of being made cloſe Priſoners, or of being caſt into the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> as they caſt their Brother <hi>Joſeph</hi> into the Pit, they ſee much of their <hi>former Crime</hi> in their <hi>preſent Diſtreſs</hi>; the one proving (as ordinarily it doth) a <hi>mirror</hi> of the other. No wonder then, they feeling the inſtant and urgent calamity, and recollecting their ancient provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and conſidering the <hi>Juſtice of an incenſed God,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:96343:18"/>
ſhould in horror and anguiſh, believe and acknowledg themſelves to be <hi>verily guilty concerning their Brother</hi>; and that <hi>Diſtreſs, as a puniſhment, was come upon them,</hi> and that <hi>his Blood was required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I (as many <hi>Avocations and Interruptions</hi> would give me a little time to collect them) given you my <hi>ſudden, but ſerious Reflections upon this ſorrowful Song of</hi> Joſeph's <hi>Brethren</hi>; with ſome accommodation thereof to the <hi>preſent ſad occaſion.</hi> Before I conclude, give me leave a little to exemplifie the uſefulneſs of this remarkable paſſage, in the <hi>following deductions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We may hence learn, to <hi>admire the inſcrutable Revolutions of Divine Providence. Paris, Romulus,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> having been expoſed to extremities (as is ſtoried, though without any great certainty) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards mounting to the height of Power, are ſtill ſpoken of as <hi>almoſt miracles:</hi> But here we read <hi>a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>much more true and no leſs ſtrange.</hi> In his tender years, he hardly eſcapes out of the violent hands of his bloody-minded Brethren into a calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and deſperate <hi>Captivity:</hi> He was ſold and bought, and bought and ſold over and over: He is caſt into <hi>Pit and Priſon,</hi> in Perils always, in Deaths often. And after all, his Brethren, by a <hi>wonderful turn of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> are brought low, when he is exalted: They ſeek to him whom they had ſold, and <hi>bow to him in the midſt of all his Glory,</hi> whom they had trampled upon in the depth of his miſery. They behold him advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by God himſelf, to be a <hi>Foſter Father to a Great King, a Patron of a vaſt People,</hi> and as able as willing, to be a <hi>Preſerver of their Father and themſelves.</hi> By this ſecret Intrigue of Gods Wiſdom, the <hi>holy Seed of Iſrael</hi> is ſecur'd from Famiſhing, and the ſacred Stock is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96343:18"/>
continued, from which was to ſpring the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Glorious Saviour of Mankind. Thus we ſee the moſt ſlight and unpromiſing circumſtances of humane affairs, capable of being ordered by God to the <hi>moſt important and Noble Purpoſes.</hi> Nor are there any wheels in this vaſt Machine of the World, how croſs ſoever they move to one another, that God cannot, doth not over-rule and harmonize to the producing moſt admirable effects, as ('tis more than probable) we ſhall be clearly given to comprehend at the <hi>Conſummation of all things.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now ſtand to infer, how this ſhould quiet and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh our fluctuating hearts, in the midſt of all <hi>croſs-grain'd occurrences,</hi> and ſeemingly <hi>unequal adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of worldly concerns.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since we read how <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren were thus over-reached and over-ruled, to the recalling to mind within themſelves their Violence intended, and in part committed againſt their Brother, to the <hi>confeſſing of it to one another in the hearing of that Brother himſelf,</hi> who had then full power for the avenging of it upon their heads, and to the ſeeing themſelves, with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of face, made, by way of juſt puniſhment for it, <hi>Priſoners,</hi> and further obnoxious to deſtruction: Since we read all this brought to paſs by the <hi>ſecret Providence of an All-ſeeing God</hi>; who, henceforward, whilſt he knows and thinks of the whole, will dare to offer any violence to his Brother, though in the <hi>ſecreteſt Receſs, or darkeſt Night?</hi> If I ſay, <hi>Surely the darkneſs ſhall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me</hi>; even <hi>the night ſhall be light about me; yea the darkneſs hid<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th not from thee, but the night ſhineth as the day; the darkneſs and the light are both alike to thee; Pſal.</hi> 139.11, 12. We can no more evade <hi>Gods Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> when he hath a mind to detect us, than we can
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96343:19"/>
obſtruct <hi>his power,</hi> when he arms himſelf to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us.</p>
            <p>There is no <hi>ſecurity in the commiſſion of any ſin.</hi>
               <q>God ſhall bring every work into judgment, with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecret thing, <bibl>
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.14.</bibl> There is nothing hid,
which ſhall not be manifeſted, <bibl>
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.22.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But then there are <hi>ſome Sins,</hi> that God makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more peculiarly concerned to detect, ſuch as <hi>High-Treaſon against his own Vicegerents.</hi> And therefore we are upon <hi>that very Conſideration</hi> warn'd againſt the <hi>clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſest entertaining ſo much as a thought of the ſame.</hi>
               <q>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought, and curſe not the Rich in thy Bed chamber: for a Bird of the air ſhall carry the voice, and that which hath wings ſhall tell the matter, <bibl>
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.20.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>God is likewiſe very <hi>rigorous in the Scrutiny he makes after any bloody Crimes:</hi> As if he would upon occaſion <hi>take the Coroner's Inquest into his own hand,</hi> he himſelf is ſaid to <hi>make inquiſition for blood,</hi> Pſal. 9.12. When <hi>Ahab</hi> had ſo wickedly murder'd <hi>Naboth,</hi> God commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <hi>Elijah</hi> both as a <hi>Searcher,</hi> and a <hi>Judge</hi>; firſt to <hi>hunt him out,</hi> and then to <hi>doom him to his deſerved puniſhment,</hi> 1 Kings 21.17, 24. It is long ſince that it p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt into a Proverb <hi>[Murder will out.]</hi> And ſuch a <hi>Vox Populi</hi> being founded upon obſervation of the uſual effects of Providence in the caſes of blood, may in a ſober ſence paſs for <hi>Vox Dei.</hi> Man firſt ſaith it, and <hi>God himſelf by his frequent wonderful Diſcoveries hath ſet his Seal to it.</hi> It would be endleſs, it is really im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reckon up or ſearch out the myſterious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of the Almighty practiſed or practicable in this Proceſs. We may from conſideration had in groſs of ſuch his Arts at the <hi>riſing of every furious paſſion,</hi> at the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96343:19"/>
               <hi>ſtirring of any revengeful inclination,</hi> at the <hi>offer of any cruel and bloody temptation,</hi> take warning to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Guard, and to quell the very firſt of all muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and boiſterous motions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How deeply doth it concern every Creature to <hi>examine himſelf to the bottom touching all crying Sins,</hi> particularly touching the Sins of <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Blood?</hi> Divers men may heretofore have incurr'd more or leſs guilt of this nature, which becauſe Providence for a while lets to <hi>ſleep,</hi> Conſcience is content to <hi>bury as dead.</hi> They wipe their bloody mouths, wherewith they have ſuckt the blood of their Brethren, and cry, <hi>Am I not innocent?</hi> They are as ready for a <hi>new attempt,</hi> as ever they were for the old performance: <hi>Becauſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against their former evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore their heart is fully ſet in them to do evil,</hi> Eccl. 8.11. But let all ſuch remember the <hi>bloody Agag,</hi> who, after he had dreamt that the <hi>bitterneſs of his death was past,</hi> came <hi>delicately unto</hi> Samuel <hi>the Lords Inquiſitor for blood:</hi> who, for that <hi>Agag</hi>'s <hi>Sword had made women childleſs,</hi> made <hi>his mother childleſs among women, by hewing of him in pieces before the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32, 33.</p>
            <p>In ſuch an <hi>almost deſperate Caſe</hi> as this of Blood is, Let a man take his meaſures for averting the Shame, Horror, Confuſion and Deſtruction that are due to him at the <hi>hand of the Lord,</hi> from the behaviour of ſuch as diſcreetly endeavour to reconcile themſelves to the <hi>offended juſtice of man, to their Soveraign.</hi> Let him go with a <hi>Rope about his Neck in all true humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with all frank Confeſſion.</hi> Fearing and trembling, let him proſtrate himſelf, entreating the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of his God the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to offer his own
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96343:20"/>
blood once ſhed, even for the <hi>ſhedders of his own blood,</hi> as well as for the reſt of Mankind. Who knoweth but thereupon the Divine Sovereign may have mercy <hi>here</hi> and <hi>hereafter:</hi> For God is <hi>King of the Kings of Iſrael,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were wont to be <hi>merciful Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us all exerciſe the <hi>utmost Compaſſion towards theſe periſhing wretches</hi>; what, though as yet they do not <hi>think us kind,</hi> becauſe we urge them to what is <hi>grievous to fleſh and blood,</hi> but profitable to the Spirit, even <hi>voluntary and ample Confeſſion?</hi> What, though they do not rightly <hi>pity themſelves?</hi> What, though they cannot or will not (as they ought) <hi>pray for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi> yet in pitious conſideration, that the end of their Journey is <hi>Eternity,</hi> the way to their Bliſs is long, the paſſage thereto ſtrait, their ſucceſs very <hi>dubious,</hi> but not abſolutely deſperate; Let us, according to our Opportunities and Abilities, whil'ſt we and they breath together, with ſtrong Cries never ceaſe aſſailing the Throne of Grace on their behalf for ſuch meaſures of, <hi>Clear Conviction, Thorough Contrition, Deep Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Free Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Living Faith,</hi> as may carry them through the Agonies of Death to a Crown of Life, through Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>
