            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>In like maner fareth it with me (right Honourable) who hauing vnskilfully shadowed with bad colors, the counterfait of Fortune, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume boldly to shroud it vnder your Ladiships patronage, as able to defend it, be it neuer so meane, and to countenaunce it, were it neuer so good, beeing of <hi>Decius</hi> minde, who thought himselfe safe vnder the shielde of Caesar.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ayling towards <hi>Candie,</hi> after that I had long time b√©ene tossed with infortunate tempests, forced by wind and waue, our course not well guided by our compasse, happilie arriued at the Cittie of <hi>Sydon,</hi> where being set on shore, I straight with my Companions went to offer incense to the Goddesse of prosperitie, which the Cittizens call <hi>Astarte.</hi> Whither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, my deuotion doone, and my oblations offered vp, desirous to take a viewe of the ancient Monuments of the Temple, I passed through manie places, where most sumptuous Sepulchers were erected: which beeing s√©ene, as I thought to haue gone to my lodging, I spied a Cell, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the doore open: whereinto as I entered, I sawe an Archflamin sitting (as I supposed) at his Orizons, for so was the Priest of the Goddesse termed, who b√©eing clothed in white Sattin Robes, and crowned with a Diademe of perfect Gold, leaned his head vpon his right hand, powring forth streames of watrish tears, as outward signes of some inward passions, and held in his left hand the counterfaite of Fortune, with one foote trode on a Polype fish, and with the other on a Camelion, as assured badges of her certaine mutabilitie. Driuen into a dumpe with the sight of thys strange deuise, as I long gazed at the vnacquainted ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of this olde Flamin, willing to knowe both the cause of his care, and what the picture of Fortune did import, I was so bold as to waken him out of his passion, with thys parle.</p>
            <p>Father (Íùô I) if my presumption be great in preasing so rashlie into so secret and sacred a place: yet I hope weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my wil, you wil somwhat excuse my boldnes, for I haue not presumed as thinking to giue anie iust occasion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb facs="tcp:6215:4"/>
but as a stranger, desirous to see the Monuments of this ancient Temple, which as I narrowly viewed, happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by chance into this your Cell, and seeing your old age perplexed with strange passions, staied as one willing to learne what disaster hap hath driuen you into these strange dumps, which if I without offence may request, and you without preiudice grant, I shal find my selfe by duty bound to requite your vndeserued curtesie.</p>
            <p>After I had vttered these words, staying a good space to heare what the old Man would answer, s√©eing that he did not so much as vouchsafe to giue an eare to my parle, or an eye to my person, but still gazed on the picture of Fortune. As I was ready to course him from his harbor with a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per blast, I saw a present Metamorphosis of his mind: for from teares hee fell to trifling, from lowring to laughing, from mourning to mirth, yet neuer casting his eyes from Fortunes counterfaite, tyll at last after he had long smiled (as I thought) at the picture, he as in despight cast it from him, taking his Lute, plaied a dumpe, whereto he warbled out these words.</p>

            <p>The old sire hauing with sighes sobbed out this sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dittie, I was driuen into a maze what the contrarie contents of these verses should meane, vntill at last casting his eye aside, and s√©eing me stand so solemnlie, he burst forth into these chollericke termes.</p>
            <p>Friend, quoth he (if I may so terme th√©e) thou hast ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not heard much, or learned very little, either thy curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie is small, or thy conditions too currish, that s√©ekest to come to counsell before thou be called. If the secrecie of my Cell, or the reuerence of my age, or thy small acquaintance with me, were not sufficient to holde th√©e from preasing so nigh: yet s√©eing me thus solemnly perplexed, thou mightest (for modestie sake) haue left me to my secret and sorrowfull passions. If it be the custome of thy Countrey to be so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous, I like not the fruite of such a soyle: If thy owne reckles follie to be thus rash, I craue not to be acquainted with such a bold guest: but whether it be, as thou cammest in without my leaue, I wishe th√©e to goe out by iust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund.</p>
            <p>He had no sooner vttered these words, but he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to take vppe the picture, if I had not hindered him with this replie.</p>
            <p>Sir (Íùô I) where the offence is confessed, there the fault is halfe pardoned, and those facts that are committed by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce, alwaies claime them pardons by course: I graunt that I haue beene much too rash, but I repent, and therefore hope you will take the lesse offence, and the sooner
<pb facs="tcp:6215:5"/>
excuse my follie: faults committed by will, gaine oft times but a checke, then mine doone by ignorance, shall I hope e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape without a mate. Penalties are enioyned by the will more than by the worke: and thinges doone amisse, (saith <hi>Tullie</hi>) euer ought to be measured by the intent, and not by the m√©ere action. Which considered, if my presence hath b√©ene preiudiciall to your passions, I hope you will think I offended as a stranger, and will pardon mee, as one sorrie for so rash an enterprise.</p>
            <p>The olde man very attentiuelie hearing my talke, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing somewhat digested his choller, rysing vppe from his seate, made me this friendly answer.</p>
            <p>Friend (Íùô he) all is not gold that glisters, the smoothest talk hath oft times the smallest trueth: the Sunne when it glistreth most bright, then br√©edeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest showre, when the Bore laieth down his bristles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he meaneth to strik. The Painter casteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayrest colour ouer the foulest boord, and strangers flatterings are oft times but m√©ere fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yet whither thy talke be truth or tales: whither thou commest to note my passions as a spie, or hast by chaunce hit into my Cell as a stranger, I care not: for if thou enuie me as a foe I force th√©e not, in that I feare not the spight of Fortune: if thou muse at my suddaine motions, as one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to be acquainted with my case, it shall little auaile th√©e to heare it, and be a great griefe for me to rehearse it.</p>
            <p>O sir (Íùô I) if my credite might be such, as without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert to obtaine so much fauour: or if the Prayer of a poore stranger might preuaile to perswade you to vnfold the cause of these your suddaine passions, I should thinke my former trauels counteruailed with this your friendly curtesie.</p>
            <p>It is good ind√©ed (Íùô he) by other mens harmes to learne to beware: <hi>Phoebus</hi> had neuer b√©en so warie of <hi>Vulcane,</hi> if <hi>Mars</hi> his mishap had not bid him take h√©ede: <hi>Vlisses</hi> had not
<pb facs="tcp:6215:5"/>
so wisely eschewed <hi>Circes</hi> charms, if he had not s√©ene before his fellowes trans-formed, and perhaps the hearing of my former cares may fr√©e th√©e from ensuing calamitie.</p>
            <p>I haue b√©en my selfe a Prince, which am nowe subiect vnto power: alate a mightie Potentate, and now constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to liue vnder a seruile law: not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tented ere while with a princelie Pallace, nowe sufficiently satis-fied with a poore Cell, and yet this present want exc√©edes my wonted weale. I then had too much in penury, and now I lack in superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, being cloyed with aboundance, yet hauing nothing, in that my mind remaineth satis-fied. Fortune, yea Fortune in fauouring me, hath made me most infortunate. Syrenlike hiding vnder musick misery, vnder pleasure paine, vnder mirth mourning, like the sugred Honicombe, which while a man toucheth he is stoong with B√©es. She presenteth fayre shapes, which proue but fading shadowes, shee proffereth Mountaines, and perhaps keepeth promise, but the gaines of these golden Mines is losse &amp; misery. None rode on <hi>Seia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> horse, which got not mishap. None toucht the golde of <hi>Tholossa,</hi> whom some desaster chaunce did not assaile: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath any b√©en aduanced by fortune, which in time hath not b√©en crossed with some haples calamitie. I speake this by experience, which I pray y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods thou neuer try by proofe: for he onlie is to be thought happy, whom the inconstant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Fortune hath not made happy. The Picture which thou s√©est heere, is the perfect counterfaite of her inconstant conditions, for she like to the Polype Fysh, turneth herselfe into the likenes of euery obiect, and with the Camelion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her whole delight in change, beeing sure in nothing but in this, that shee is not sure. Which inconstancie after I had known by too much proofe, I began to arme my selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her guiles, and to count her fauning flatterie, and her frownes of no force, not to accept her as a friende, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise her as a foe, and in despight of her fained deitie, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my selfe against her fickle power, which I haue found the greatest shielde to shrowde me from her secret iniuries.
<pb facs="tcp:6215:6"/>
I haue left my Pallace, and taken me to a simple Cell, in the one I found often displeasure, but in the other neuer but contentation. From a Prince of the earth, I am become a Priest to the Gods, s√©eking only by this obscure life to please my selfe, and displease Fortune: whose picture when I s√©e, I w√©epe that I was so fonde, as to be subiect to such a seruile Dame, and I laugh, that at last I triumph bothe ouer myne owne affections, and ouer Fortune. Thus friend, since thou hast hearde the cause of my care, cease off to enquire farther in the case, passe from my Cell, and leaue me to my passions, for to procure my griefe, and not thy gaine, were to offer me double losse. After he had vttered these wordes, perceiuing by his parle that he was a mighty Prince, I beganne with more reuerence to excuse my rashnes, framing my talke to this effect.</p>
            <p>I am sorrie (Íùô I) if sorrowe might be amendes for that which is amisse, that my hastie follie hath offended your highnesse: and that my poore presence hath b√©en preiudiciall to your princely passions, but since the fault once committed may be repented, but not reclaimed, I hope your highnesse will pardon my vnwitting wilfulnes, and take (had I will) for an excuse of so suddaine an offence, which graunted, the desire I haue to heare of your strange happe, doth make mee passe manners in being importunate with your Maiestie, to heare the tragicall chance of this your strange change.</p>
            <p>Well (Íùô hee) since thy desire is such, and time allowes me conuenient leysure, sit downe, and thou shalt heare what trust there is to be giuen to inconstant Fortune.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ntill I waxt weary of my diademe, (Íùô he) I was king of the famous Countrey of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> wherein, after <hi>Bosphorus</hi> deceassed, for so was my father called, I raigned in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie prosperitie, comming to the Crowne at the age of one and twentie yeeres, beeing so honoured of my Subiects for my vertue, and so loued for my courtesie, as I did not onely gaine the harts of mine own Countrimen, but also win the good wil of strangers. I could not complaine of lack, in that my greatest want was store. I feared not the force of forraine foes, for I knew none but were my faithful friendes. I doubted no mis-fortune, for I coulde s√©e no waie for me to mishap: nay, if I had b√©ene wise, I might y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more haue feared miserie, in that I was so fullie pampered vppe with felicitie. But I poore wretch was not daunted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie dread, because I sawe no present danger: I thought the sea being calme, there could come no tempest: that from the cl√©ere aire could ensue no storme, that quiet ease was not the mother of dissention, and that where Fortune once tuned, in the strings could neuer be found any discorde.</p>
            <p>But O fond and infortunate <hi>Arbasto,</hi> for so is my name, and therfore infortunate in that thou art <hi>Arbasto,</hi> thou now hast tried though by haplesse experience, that when <hi>Nilus</hi> fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vp his bounds, ensueth a dearth: when the <hi>Angelica</hi> is laden with most seede, then hee dieth: when musicke was heard in the Capitoll, then the <hi>Romanes</hi> were plagued wyth pestilence: when <hi>Circes</hi> proffered most gifts, shee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded most guile, and that when Fortune hath depriued thee of moste care, then shee meanes to drowne thee in the greatest calamitie: for as thus I safelie floated in the Seas of securitie, and bathed in the str√©ames of blysse, Fortune, thinking at length to giue me the mate, began thus
<pb facs="tcp:6215:7"/>
to prosfer the check. I hauing but one onely brother called <hi>Tebaldo,</hi> whom forced by nature, I most entirely loued and liked, who soiourned in Frannce, as one desirous to see the manners of strange Countries, &amp; to furnish himselfe wyth al qualities fit for a worthy Gentleman, I vnhappily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued newes, that he was cowardly without cause slain in the French Court, which so appalled my sences, as nature most cruelly exclaimed against Fortune, in so much, that scorched with the flame of sp√©edie reuenge, contrarie to the counsaile of my nobles, with a resolute mind, I determined to inuade France, and either to bring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole realme to ruine, or els to hazard life and limme in the battell: well, no perswasion beeing able to driue me from this setled determination, I caused my Ships to be rigged, and with as much sp√©ede as might be, sayled into France with a great nauie, where I had no sooner landed my soldiers, but as a professed foe cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pence for my brothers death but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, I burnt their borders, fired their forts, rased their Townes and Cities to the earth, vsing no mercie but this that hauing depriued them of their possessions, I also berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them of their liues<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Pelorus</hi> hearing with what violence I had inuaded his lande (for so the French king was called) fearing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was not able to withstand my force, s√©eing that Fortune so fauoured my enterprise, passed sp√©edily with hys whole host vnto <hi>Orleance,</hi> whither I hasted being not great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly resisted, laying valiantly a strong siege to the citie, which after I had diuers times assaulted, &amp; had so shaken y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walls with Cannon shot, that they were forced to strengthen them with new counter mures. <hi>Pelorus</hi> halfe daunted with my desperat attempts, coueted secretly to conclude a peace: to colour therfore this his intent with a false shadowe, he sp√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily dispatched an Heralde, to intreat a truce for thr√©e mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, which being vnhappily graunted, and therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily because graunted, it was lawfull for them of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke peaceably to passe into the Cittie, and for them of <hi>Orleance</hi> quietly to come into our Campe. While thus the
<pb facs="tcp:6215:7"/>
truce continued, I beeing desirous to take a viewe of the French Court, accompanied with my Nobles, went to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorus,</hi> who willing to shewe his martiall courage by vsing courtesie to his foe, gaue me very sumptuous and courteous entertainment. But alas, such desaster hap ensued of this my fond desire, that death had b√©ene thrise more welcome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> such endles distresse. For <hi>Pelorus</hi> had onely two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the eldest called <hi>Myrania,</hi> the yongest named <hi>Dorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> so faire and well featured, as <hi>Venus</hi> would haue beene iealous if <hi>Adonis</hi> had liued to s√©e their beauties. But especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie louely <hi>Doralicia,</hi> and therefore more louely, because I so entirely loued, was so beautified with the gifts of nature, and so adorned with more then earthly perfection, as she s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be framed by nature to blemish nature, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beauty had skipt beyond her skil, in framing a p√©ece of such curious workmanshippe, for that which in her (respecting her other perfections) was of no price, woulde be counted in others a pearle, her greatest want woulde in others bee thought a store, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if any thing lacked in her, it was not to be sought for in any earthly creature. This <hi>Doralicia,</hi> beeing appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by vniust Fortune to be the instrument of my fall, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with her sister <hi>Myrania</hi> and other Ladies, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber where her father &amp; I was at parle, whose gorgious presence so appaled my sences, that I stood astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, as if with <hi>Perseus</hi> shield I had b√©ene made a sencelesse picture, not knowing from whence this suddaine and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine passion should proc√©ed: yet this fond affection I felt to rule my fancie, that as the Dormouse can not shut his eies as long as he lieth in the beames of the Sun, as the Deare can not cease from braying where the herbe Moly groweth, so could not I but stare on the face of <hi>Doralicia,</hi> as long as her beauty was such an heauenly obiect. Shee narrowlie marking my gazing lookes, straight perceiued that I was galled, &amp; therfore to shewe how lightly she accounted of my liking, passed out of the Chamber with a coye and courtlie countenance, but <hi>Myrania</hi> as one perceiuing and pittying
<pb facs="tcp:6215:8"/>
my passions, s√©emed with her lookes to say in hart, <hi>Arbasto,</hi> farewell.</p>
            <p>These two Goddesses beeing gone, f√©eling my minde somewhat perplexed, I tooke my leane of <hi>Pelorus,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. Comming home to my Tent, fraught with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand toyish fancies, I began to coniecture what should be the cause of these contrarie motions, the effect I felt, the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I could not find, applying therfore a contrary salue to my sore, it did rather increase, than cure the maladie, for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie was a corsiue, not a comfort: thinking Musick shoulde be a preseruatiue, I founde it a poyson: and to bee solitarie, I found it the sinck of all sorrow: for then strange thoughts, vnacquainted passions, pinching fancies, waking visions, and slumbering watchings, disquieted my head. Me thought I sawe the counterfaite of <hi>Doralicia</hi> before mine eyes, then the harmonie of her sp√©ech sounded in mine eares, her lookes, her gestures, yea, all her actions were particularly deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a secret imagination. Wrapped thus in a laborinth of endlesse fancies, when reason coulde not suppresse will, nor wisedome controule affection, but that wit (though inuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled) yet disdained the vse of a guide. I then cast my cardes, and found by manifest proofe, that the lunatike fit which so distempered my braines, was that franticke passion which fooles and Poets call loue, which knowne, blaming my selfe of cowardise, that beautie should make me bend, I fel at last into these termes.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Arbasto</hi> (quoth I) art thou so squemish that thou canst not see Wine, but thou must surfet: canst thou not drawe nie the fire and warme thee, but thou must with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrus</hi> kisse it and burne thee: art thou so little master of thy affections, that if thou gaze on a picture, thou must with <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malion</hi> be passionate: canst thou not passe thorough <hi>Paphos,</hi> but thou must offer incense to <hi>Venus?</hi> doost thou thinke it iniurie to <hi>Cupid</hi> to looke, if thou doost not looue. Ah fonde foole, knowe this, fire is to b√©e vsed, but not to be handled: the Baaran floure is to be worne in the hand, not chawed in
<pb facs="tcp:6215:8"/>
the mouth: the precious stone Echites is to bee applied out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and not to be taken inwardly: and beautie is made to f√©ede the eye, not to fetter the hart, wilt thou then swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vp the baite which thou knowest to be bane? wilt thou hazarde at that which can not bee had without harme? no, stretch not too far, wade not too deepe, vse beautie, but serue it not, shake the tree, but taste not of the fruite, least thou find it too hard to be disgested. Why, but beautie is a God, and will be obeyed: loue looketh to commaunde, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered: <hi>Iuno</hi> stroue but once with <hi>Venus,</hi> and she was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished: <hi>Iupiter</hi> resisted <hi>Cupid,</hi> but he went by the worst, it is harde for thee with the Crabbe to swimme against the streame, or with the Salamander to striue against the fire, for in wrastling with a fresh wound, thou shalt but make the sore more daungerous. Can beautie fonde foole bee resisted, which makes the Gods to bow: Loue himselfe yeelded to the feature of <hi>Psyche,</hi> and thinkest thou thy fancie of greater force? yea but what fondnesse is that <hi>Arbasto</hi> to soothe thy selfe in thy folly. Thou didst come a Captaine, and wilt thou returne a captiue: thy intent was to conquer, not to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, to fight with the Launce, not to be foilde with loue, to vse thy speare, not thy pen, to challenge <hi>Mars,</hi> not to dallie with <hi>Venus.</hi> Howe doost thou thinke to subdue Fraunce, which canst not rule thine owne affections: Art thou able to quaile a kingdome, which canst not quell thine owne mind? no, it will be hard for th√©e to goe in triumph, which art not so much as Lord of thy selfe. But <hi>Arbasto,</hi> if thou wilt needes loue, vse it as a toye to passe away the time, which y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> maist take vppe at thy lust, and lay downe at thine own pleasure. Loue, why <hi>Arbasto,</hi> dost thou dreame, whom shouldest thou loue? <hi>Doralicia?</hi> what thy foe, one that wisheth thy mishap, and partly prayeth to the Gods, for thy mis-fortune, no sure thou art not so fond.</p>
            <p>And with that, as I vttered these words, such thoughts, such sighes, such sobs, such teares assailed mee, as I was stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken dumbe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extremitie of these hellish passions, scarce
<pb facs="tcp:6215:9"/>
being able to draw my breath for a good space, til at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering my sences, I fel to my former sorrow in this sort.</p>
            <p>Yes alas <hi>Arbasto,</hi> it is the lucklesse loue of <hi>Doralicia,</hi> and therefore the more lucklesse because thou loouest <hi>Doralicia,</hi> that hath thus inchaunted thy affections. Sh√©e is not thy friend whom thou maist hope to get, but thy foe, whom thou art sure not to gaine: for dost thou think she wil requite thy merit with m√©ed, or repay thy loue with liking? no, she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth th√©e <hi>Arbasto,</hi> as sworne <hi>Pelorus</hi> foe, and her enemie. Can she loue th√©e which s√©ekest her fathers life: nay, did she loue, yet could she think thou dost like, which layest siege to her Cittie: no, vnlesse by loue shee were blinded with too much looue. Sith then to fancie thy foe, is with the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice to peck against the st√©ele, subdue thy affections, bee maister of thy mind, vse will as thy subiect, not as thy soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, so maist thou triumph and laugh at <hi>Cupid,</hi> saying: Fonde boy I was in loue, what then.</p>
            <p>I had no sooner sealed vp these secrete meditations with a sorowfull sigh, but least being solitarie I shold fal into far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dumps, I went out of my Tent to passe away the time with some pleasant parle, thinking this the fittest means to driue away idle fancies, hoping that hote loue wold be soone cold, that the greatest bauin was but a blaze, and that the most violent storme was euer least permanent.</p>
            <p>Wel, to s√©e how Loue and Fortune can play false when they list, I was not so drowned in desires towards <hi>Dorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> as pore <hi>Myrania</hi> burned with affection towards me. For <hi>Venus</hi> willing to shew she was a woman by her wilful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties so fiered her fancies with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of my feature, as the poore Lady was perplered with a thousande sundrie passions, one while shee sought with hate to rase out loue, but that was with the D√©ere to f√©ede against the wind: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while shee deuised which way to obtaine her desire: but then alas she heaped coales vpon her head, for she sawe no spark of hope to procure so good happe. Driuen thus into sundry dumpes, she fell at last into these termes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6215:9"/>Alas <hi>Myrania</hi> (Íùô she) happy, yea thrice happie are those maides which are borne in the Ile <hi>Meroe,</hi> which in their virginity are suffered to s√©e none but him whom they shall marry, and b√©eing wiues are forbidden by the Law to s√©e any man but their husbande, vntill they be past fifty. In this Country <hi>Myrania</hi> beauty is vsed as a naturall gift, not hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a supernaturall God, and they loue onely one, because loue cannot force them to like any other: so that they sowe their loue in ioy, and reape it in pleasure. Would God thou hadst b√©en borne in this soile, or brought vp in the same sort so shouldest thou haue triumphed ouer beautie as a slaue, which now leadeth th√©e as a seruile captiue.</p>
            <p>O infortunate <hi>Myrania,</hi> and therefore infortunate because <hi>Myrania,</hi> hast thou so little force to withstand fancie, as at the first alarum thou must y√©eld to affection: canst thou not looke with <hi>Salmacis,</hi> but thou must looue: canst thou not s√©e with <hi>Smylax</hi> but thou must sigh: canst thou not viewe <hi>Narcissus</hi> with <hi>Eccho,</hi> but thou must be vowed to his beautie. Learne learne fond foole by others mishaps to beware: for shee that loueth in hast, oft times, nay alwaies repenteth at leysure. The <hi>Hippians</hi> anointing themselues with the fat of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fish <hi>Mugra,</hi> passe through most furious flames without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. The people called <hi>Psilli,</hi> as long as the sacrifice vnto <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta,</hi> can be hurt with no venimous Serpents. <hi>Telephus</hi> as he wore the counterfeit of <hi>Pallas</hi> shielde, was inuulnerable, and thou as long as thy minde is fraughte with the chaste thoughts of <hi>Diana,</hi> canst neuer be fired with the haples flame of <hi>Venus</hi>: arme thy selfe with reason, and thou mayst passe through <hi>Cytheria</hi> without daunger: let thy will and wit be directed with aduised counsaile, and thou maist say: <hi>Cupid,</hi> I defie th√©e.</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Myrania,</hi> things are soone promised, but not so casilie performed: it is easie to sound the victory, but passing hard to obtaine the conquest: all can say, I would ouercome, but few or none returne with triumph. Beauty is therfore to be obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because it is beautie, and loue to be feared of men, because
<pb facs="tcp:6215:10"/>
honored of the Gods. Dare reason abide the brunte, when beautie bids the battell: can wisedome win the fielde when loue is Captaine. No, no, loue is without law, and therefore aboue all lawe, honored in heauen, feared in earth, and a very terror to the infernall Ghostes.</p>
            <p>Bow then vnto that <hi>Myrania,</hi> wherunto lawlesse neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie doth bend, be not so fond as with <hi>Xerxes</hi> to bind the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Sea in fetters: fight not with the <hi>Rascians</hi> against the winde: seeke not with them of <hi>Scyrus</hi> to shoote against the stars: contende not with <hi>Niobe</hi> against <hi>Latona,</hi> nor striue not with <hi>Sapho</hi> against <hi>Venus,</hi> for loue being a Lord, lookes to commaund by power, and to be obeyed by force.</p>
            <p>Trueth <hi>Myrania,</hi> but what then, to loue is easie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps good, but to like well is hard &amp; a doubtfull chance: fancie thy fil (fond foole) so thou bend not thy affection to thy fathers foe: for to loue him who s√©ekes his life, is to war against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fortune. Is there none woorthy to be thy pheere but <hi>Arbasto,</hi> the cursed enemie to thy Countrey? can none win thy good will but the bloodie wretch, who s√©eketh to br√©ed thy fathers bane? can the Eagle &amp; the bird <hi>Osiphage</hi> builde in one tr√©e? will the faulcon and the doue couet to sit on one pearch: will the Ape &amp; the Beare be tied in one tedder, will the foxe and the lambe lie in one den: no they want reason, and yet nature suffers them not to liue against nature: wilt thou then be so wilfull or witles, as hauing reason to guide nature: yet to be more vnnaturall then vnreasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be sure if thou fal in this thou striuest against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods, and in striuing with them looke for a most sharpe reuenge.</p>
            <p>Tush I know this, but hath not loue set down his sentence, and shal I appeale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> his censure: shall I deny that which the destenies haue decr√©ed: no, for though <hi>Cydippa</hi> rebelled for a time, yet she was forst at last to make sute to <hi>Venus</hi> for a pardon, &amp; I may s√©ek to hate <hi>Arbasto,</hi> but neuer find where to begin to mislike him. And with that, such fiery passions op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed her, as shee was faine to sende foorth scalding sighes somewhat to ease her inflamed fancie, which being sorowful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:6215:10"/>
sobbed forth, she had begun a fresh to poure forth her pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful complaints, if her sister <hi>Doralicia</hi> beeing accompanied with other Gentlewomen had not driuen her out of these dumps, whom shee no sooner spied, but leauing her passions, she waxed plesant, couering care with conceits, and a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hart with a merry cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tenance, least her sorowful lookes might giue the company occasion to coniecture somwhat was amisse. But I alas which felt the furious flames of fancie to broile incessantly within my brest, could not so cunningly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble my passions, but al my P√©eres saw I was perplexed: for wheras before this sudden chaunce, <hi>Pelorus</hi> mis-fortune procured my mirth, now the foile which I reaped by affection draue me to a d√©eper misery. In the day (to the increasing of my care) I spent the time in sollitarie dumpes, in the night affected thoughts and visions suffered mee scarce to slumber: for alas there is no greater enemy to the mind, than in loue to liue without hope, which doubt was the sum of my endles sorrow, that in s√©eing my selfe fettered, I could s√©e no hope at all of my fr√©edom: yet to mittigate my misery, I thought to walke from the Campe towarde the Cittie, that I might at the least f√©ede my eye with the sight of the place wherein the Mistresse of my hart was harboured, taking with me onelie for companie a Duke of my Countrey called <hi>Egerio,</hi> vnto whom I durst best commit my secrete affaires, who noting my vnaccustomed passions, coniecturing the cause of my care by the outward effects, coueting carefully to apply a salue to my sore, and to driue me from such drowsie thoughts, wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me from my dumps with this pleasant deuise.</p>
            <p>Sir, quoth he, I haue often meruailed, &amp; yet cannot cease to muse at the madnes of those men, whom the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thinke to honour with the glorious title of louers, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> rashly they purchase their own mishap in placing their affection, where either their disabilitie or the destinies denie successe to their suites, doe either passe their daies in endles dolor, or preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t misery by vntimely death. If these passionate
<pb facs="tcp:6215:11"/>
patients listned a litle to <hi>Venus</hi> allurments, as I to <hi>Cupids</hi> flatteries, few men shold haue cause to call the Gods vniust, or women cruell: for I think of loue as <hi>Mylciades</hi> the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian did, who was wont to say, that of all the plagues wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Gods did afflict mortal men, loue was the greatest, in that they sought that as an heauenly blisse, which at last they found their fatall bane.</p>
            <p>Hearing <hi>Egerio</hi> thus cunningly and couertly to touch me at the quick, thought to dally with him in this wise.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Egerio</hi> (Íùô I) dost thou count it a madnes to looue, or dost thou thinke him rashe which y√©eldeth vnto affection: knowest thou not that loue is diuine, and therefore comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by power, and that hee enioyneth by destiny and cannot be resisted. I am not of that mind with <hi>Mylciades,</hi> that loue is a plague, but rather I thinke hee is fauoured of the gods that is a happy louer.</p>
            <p>Truth (Íùô he) but who is happie in loue? he that hath the happiest successe? no: for I count him most vnhappy which in loue is most happy.</p>
            <p>Why then <hi>Egerio</hi> (Íùô I) thou thinkest him vnhappy in that he loueth.</p>
            <p>Or els may it please your highnes, quoth hee, I shoulde think amisse: for shall I count him fortunate which for one dram of prosperity reapeth a whole pound of misery? or shal I est√©eme that louer happy, whose greatest gaine is but gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den griefe: nay that is neuer to be called pleasure, which is sauced with paine, nor that good luck whose guerdon is losse.</p>
            <p>Sith <hi>Egerio</hi> (Íùô I) thou doost thus broadly blaspheme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Cupid,</hi> tell me why thou thinkest ill of loue.</p>
            <p>Because sir, quoth he, it is loue, being such a frantick fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie which so infecteth the mindes of men, as vnder the taste of <hi>Nectar,</hi> they are poysoned with the water of <hi>Stix,</hi> for as he which was charmed by <hi>Lara</hi> sought still to heare her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, or as the D√©ere after once he brouseth on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariske tr√©e, will not bee driuen away till hee dieth: so our amorous louers haue their sencelesse sences so besotted with
<pb facs="tcp:6215:11"/>
the power of this lasciuious God, that they count not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selus happy but in their supposed vnhappines, being at most ease in disquiet, at greatest rest when they are most trobled, s√©eking contentation in care, delight in misery, and hunting gr√©edily after that which alwaies bringeth endlesse harme.</p>
            <p>This is but your sentence <hi>Egerio</hi> (quoth I) but what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons haue you to confirme your censure?</p>
            <p>Such (quoth he) as your highnes can neither mislike nor infringe: for the first step to looue is the losse of libertie, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mind to the will of her, who either too curious, little respecteth his sute, or too coy smally regardeth his seruice, yet he is so blinded with the vale of fond affection, that he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her sullennes sobernes, her vain charines vertuous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie: if she be wanton he counteth her wittie, if too familar curteous, so besotted with the drugs of doting loue, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fault is a vertue, and though euery string be out of tune, yet the Musick cannot sound amisse: resembling <hi>Tamantus</hi> the Painter, who shadowed the worst pictures with the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shest colours.</p>
            <p>The paines that Louers take for hunting after losse, if their mindes were not charmed with some secret enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were able either to k√©epe their fancies from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, or els to coole desire being alreadie kindled: for the dayes are spent in thoughts, the nights in dreames, both in danger, either beguiling vs of that we had, or promising vs that wee haue not. The heade fraught with fancies, fiered with iealousie, troubled with both: yea so manie inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences waite vpon loue, as to reckon them all were infinite, and to taste but one of them intollerable, being alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with griefe, continued with sorow, &amp; ended with death: for it is a paine shadowed with pleasure, and a ioy stuffed with miserie: so that I conclude, that as none euer sawe the Altars of <hi>Basyris</hi> without sorrow, nor banqueted with <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> without surfeiting: so as impossible it is to deale with <hi>Cupid</hi> &amp; not gaine either sp√©edy death or endlesse danger.</p>
            <p>As I was ready to reply to <hi>Egerios</hi> reasons, drawing to a
<pb facs="tcp:6215:12"/>
small thicket of trees, which was hard adioining to the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I spied where some of the French dames were friendlie sitting about a cl√©ere fountaine, of whom after I had taken a narrow viewe, easily perceiued they were thr√©e Ladies (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with one Page) namely <hi>Myrania, Doralicia,</hi> and their Nurse called Madam <hi>Vecchia,</hi> which sudden sight so appalled my sences, as I had b√©en appointed a new Iudge to the thr√©e goddesses in the valley of <hi>Ida:</hi> yet seeing before my eyes the Mistresse of my thoughts, and the Saint vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> I did owe my deuotion, I began to take hart at grace, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by this fit opportunitie, loue and Fortune began to fauour my enterprise, willing therefore not to let slippe so good an occasion, I boldly paced to them, whom I saluted in this sort.</p>
            <p>Faire Ladies (Íùô I) the sight of your surpassing beautie so dazeled mine eyes, as at the first I was in doubt, whether I should honor you as heauenly Nimphes, or salute you as earthly creatures: but as I was in this dumpe, I readilie called to mind the figure of your diuine face, which b√©eing at my comming to your fathers Court, by some secret influence most surely imprinted in my fancie, I haue hetherto without any sparke of forgetfulnes perfectly retained, f√©eling euer since in my hart, such strange passions, an vnaccustomed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to your beautie and vertues, as I woulde thinke the Gods and Fortune did fauour mee, if either I might find oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to manifest my affection, or liue to doo you seruice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doralicia</hi> hearing mee thus strangely to salute her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she saw her selfe in the handes of her fathers foe: yet as nothing dismaied, with a coy countenaunce, shee gaue mee this crabbish answer.</p>
            <p>Sir, quoth she, if at the first looke ye tooke vs for Nimphes by the perfection of our diuine beautie, it s√©emeth vnto vs that eyther your women in <hi>Denmarke</hi> are very fowle; or your sight sore blemisht since your comming into <hi>Fraunce:</hi> for we know our imperfections far vnworthy of such dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled praise. But <hi>Diomedes</hi> smiled most when hee pretended
<pb facs="tcp:6215:12"/>
greatest mischiefe: <hi>Scyron</hi> entertained his guestes best, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he ment to intreat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> worst: <hi>Lycaon</hi> feasted <hi>Iupiter</hi> when hee sought to betray him: the <hi>Hiena</hi> euer fauneth at her pray: the <hi>Syrens</hi> sing when they meane to enchant: <hi>Circes</hi> is most pleasant, when she presenteth poison: and so you, in praising our beauty s√©eke to spoile our blood: in extolling our perfection, to make vs most imperfect, in wishing openlie our weale, secretly to worke our death and destruction. For your seruice you offer vs, we so much the more mislike it, for hys sake that makes the proffer: for we are not so inueigled with selfe loue, nor so senceles to conceiue, but that wee thinke he little fauoureth the stems that cutteth down the old stock, he little respecteth the twig that tendereth not the roote, and he lightly loueth the child, that deadly hateth the father, <hi>Polix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena</hi> counted <hi>Achilles</hi> a flatterer, because he continued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> siege against Troy. <hi>Cressid</hi> therfore forsooke <hi>Troylus,</hi> because hee warred against the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and we cannot count him our priuie fr√©ende which is our open foe.</p>
            <p>Why Madame (Íùô I) did not <hi>Tarpeia</hi> fauour <hi>Tantius,</hi> though a foe vnto <hi>Rome:</hi> did not <hi>Scylla</hi> respect <hi>Mynos</hi> thogh he besieged <hi>Nisus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truth sir, (Íùô <hi>Myrania</hi>) but the gaines they got was perpetuall shame and endles discredit, for the one was slain<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> by the <hi>Sabynes,</hi> the other reiected by <hi>Mynos.</hi> The young Faunes cannot abide to looke on the Tyger: the <hi>Halciones</hi> are no sooner hatched, but they hate the Eagle. <hi>Andromache</hi> woulde neuer trust the faire sp√©eches of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> nor <hi>Dydo</hi> laughe when shee sawe <hi>Hierbas</hi> smile: where the partie is knowen for a professed foe, there suspicious hate ensueth of course: and fond were that person that would thinke wel of him that proffereth poyson though in a golden pot.</p>
            <p>Madame, quoth I, I know it is hard where mistrust is harboured to infer beleefe, or to procure credite where hys trueth is called in question: but I wish no better successe to happen to my selfe, than in hart I do imagin to you al, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the gods that I do honor your beauties and vertues
<pb facs="tcp:6215:13"/>
so much, that if I had woon the conquest, and you were my captiues, yet I woulde honor you as my soueraignes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey you as a louing subiect.</p>
            <p>But I pray God, quoth Madame <hi>Vechia,</hi> you haue neuer occasion to shew vs such fauour, nor we cause to stand to your courtesie: for I doubt wee shoulde finde your glowing heate turned to a chilling colde, and your great promises to small performance.</p>
            <p>In the meane time (and with that she tooke <hi>Myrania</hi> and <hi>Doralicia</hi> by the handes) we wil leaue you to returne to the Campe, and we will repaire to the Cittie, willing to giue you thanks for your good will, when we finde you a friende, and not before.</p>
            <p>Nay Madame, quoth I, not so, for construe of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning how you please, or accept of my companie how you list, I wil not be so discourteous to leaue you so slenderly guided, as in the guarde of this little Page. And with that, taking <hi>Doralicia</hi> by the hand, willing not to let slip so fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I began to court her on this manner.</p>
            <p>The choyse is harde Madame <hi>Doralicia</hi> (quoth I) where the party is compelled either by silence to die with griefe, or by vnfolding his mind, to liue with shame, yet so sw√©et is the desire of life, and so bitter the passions of loue, that I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to preferre an vns√©emelie sute before an vntimelie death. Loth I am to speake, and in despaire I am to sp√©ede: in the one shewing my selfe a coward, in the other weighing myne owne case. For considering what loue is, I fainte, and thinking how I am counted a foe, I feare. But sith where loue commandeth, there it is folly to resist, so it is Madame, that intending to be victor, I am become a vassale, comming to conquer, I am caught a captiue, seeking to bring other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thrall, alas I haue lost mine owne libertie. Your heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beautie hath brought me into bondage, your exquisite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection hath snared my fr√©edome, your vertuous qualities hath subdued my mind, as onely your curtesie may free mee from care, or your crueltie crosse mee with calamitie. To

               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eigled with thy beautie, or the seruice I haue vowed vnto thy vertue, since thou dost count my talke, though neuer so true, but m√©ere toyes, were rather to br√©ede in thee an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then a beliefe. But this I added for the time, which the end shall try for a trueth, that so faithfull is my affection, and so loyall is my looue, that if thou take not pittie of my passions, eyther my life shall be too short, or my miserie too long.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doralicia</hi> hearing attentiuely my talk, oft times chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged colour, as one in great choller, being so inflamed with a melancholike kind of hate, as shee was not of a long time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vtter one word, yet at last with a face full of fury, shee burst foorth into these despightfull termes.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Arbasto</hi> (Íùô she) art thou of late become frantick, or doost thou thinke mee in a frenzie: hast thou b√©ene bytten with the Serpent <hi>Amphisbena</hi> which procureth madnesse, or doost thou suppose me fraught with some lunatick fits, for thy speech makes mee thinke, either thou art troubled with the one, or that thou countes me combred with the other: if this thy poisoned parle were in iest, it was too broade wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the case, if in earnest, too bad considering the person: for to talke of peace amidst the pikes, sheweth either a cowarde or a counterfeit: and to sue for loue by hate, either frenzie or follie. It is a mad Hare <hi>Arbasto</hi> that will be caught with a Taber, a gr√©edy fishe that commeth to a bare hooke, a blinde Goose that runneth to the Foxes sermon, and shee a louing foole that stoopeth to her enemies lure. No no, think me not so fond, or at least hope not to find me so foolish, as with <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> to fancie <hi>Cecrops,</hi> with <hi>Harpalice</hi> to like <hi>Archemerus,</hi> with <hi>Scilla</hi> to loue <hi>Mynos,</hi> with carelesse Minions so far to forget my honor, my honestie, my parents, and my Country, as to loue, nay not deadlie to hate him which is a foe to the least of these: for experience teacheth me, that the fairer the stone is in the Toades heade, the more pestilent is the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in her bowels, the brighter the Serpents scales bee, the
<pb facs="tcp:6215:14"/>
more infectious is her breath, and the talke of an enemy, the more it is seasoned with delight, the more it sauoureth of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight, cease then to s√©eke for loue, where thou shalt finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hate, for assure thy selfe, if thou didst fancie as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as thou dost flatter falsely, yet the guerdon for thy looue should be only this, that I will pray incessantly to the Gods, in thy life to pesture th√©e with earthly torments, and after death, to plague thee with hellish tortures.</p>
            <p>Although these bitter blastes of <hi>Doralicia,</hi> had beene a sufficient cooling carde to quench fonde affection, yet as the water causeth the seacoale to burne more freshlie, so her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfull termes far more inflamed my desire, that I made her this friendly replie.</p>
            <p>Alas (Madame) weigh my case with equitie: if you hate me, as I am foe to <hi>Pelorus,</hi> yet fauour me as I am a friend to <hi>Doralicia.</hi> If you lothe me as a conquerer of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, yet pittie me as I am a captiue to your beautie. If you vouchsafe not to listen to the lure of your enemie, yet heare the passionate complaints of a perplexed louer, who leading others in triumph, yet he himselfe liueth in most haples ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude.</p>
            <p>If I haue doone amisse <hi>Doralicia,</hi> I will make amendes: if I haue committed a fault, I will bothe requite it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence it: as I haue beene thy fathers foe, so I will bee his faithfull friend, as I haue sought his bale, I will procure his blisse: yea, I will goe against the haire in all thinges, so I may please th√©e in any thing.</p>
            <p>But as I was about to make a longer discourse, she cutte me off in this wise.</p>
            <p>In faith sir, quoth shee, so well doe I like you, that you can not more displease me, than in s√©eking to please mee: for if I knew no other cause to hate th√©e, yet this would suffise, that I cannot but dislike th√©e: be therfore my fathers friend or his foe, like him or hate him, yet this assure thy selfe that I will neuer loue th√©e. And with that she floong from mee in a great chafe. Replie I could not: for by this we were come
<pb facs="tcp:6215:14"/>
to the gates of the Cittie, where (though vnwilling) I tooke my leaue of them in this sort.</p>
            <p>I am sorrie Ladies that such is my luck, and so vnhappie is my lotte, that in offering my selfe a companion, I haue greatly offended you with my companie: yet sith I cannot striue against chance, I think my selfe happy that Fortune hath honoured me with the fruition of your presence, hoping when time shall trie my words no tales but trueth, you will at last make me amends with crying <hi>peccaui:</hi> in the meane while I commit you to the tuition of the Gods, praying For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune rather to plague me with all mishap, then to crosse you with anie chip of mischance.</p>
            <p>The thanks I had for this my friendly curtesie, <abbr>was</abbr> a coy disdainfull looke of <hi>Doralicia,</hi> and a churlish <hi>vale</hi> of the olde trot <hi>Vechia,</hi> but <hi>Myrania</hi> as one stoong with the pricke of fancie, bad me farewell, with a more curteous gloze.</p>
            <p>If sir (quoth she) the secret intent of your friendship had beene agreeable to the outward manner of your curtesie, w√©e had without rubbing our memories ere this y√©elded you great thanks for your companie: but sith you gr√©et vs with a <hi>Iudas</hi> kisse, we thinke wee haue small cause to gratifie you for your kindnes: notwithstanding, least you shold accuse vs wholie of discourtesie, we say we thank you, whatsoeuer w√©e think, and with that, she cast on me such a louing looke, as she seemed to play loth to depart. Well, they now returning to the Court, and I now retiring to the Campe, f√©eling my self d√©eply perplexed, yet as much as I could, dissembled my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, willing in loue not to be counted a louer, iesting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with <hi>Egerio,</hi> I thus began to draw him on.</p>
            <p>How now <hi>Egerio,</hi> (Íùô I) hath not the beautie of these faire Ladies brought you from your fonde heresie: will you not be content for blaspheming of Looue, in pennaunce to carrie a burning Faggot before <hi>Cupid?</hi> me thought your eyes were gazing, wheresoeuer your hart was gadding: but tell mee in good troth, is not <hi>Doralicia</hi> worthy to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6215:15"/>Yes sir, quoth he, if shee were not <hi>Doralicia,</hi> for as shee is beautifull, shee is to bee liked of all, but as shee is <hi>Pelorus</hi> daughter, not to be desired of <hi>Arbasto,</hi> least in s√©eking to gain her loue, he get that which he least looketh for.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Egerio,</hi> quoth I, what ill lucke can ensue of loue, when I meane not to venture but vppon trust, nor to trust without triall.</p>
            <p>Such (quoth hee) as happened to <hi>Achilles</hi> by <hi>Polexena,</hi> and yet he feared <hi>Priamus.</hi> But alas sir, I sigh to think, and I sorrow to s√©e that reason should y√©eld to affection, liberty to loue, fr√©edome to fancie, that <hi>Venus</hi> should beare the target, and <hi>Mars</hi> the distaffe: that <hi>Omphale</hi> shoulde handle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> club, and <hi>Hercules</hi> the spindle: that <hi>Alexander</hi> shoulde crouch, and <hi>Campaspe</hi> be coy: that a warlike mind should yeelde to a little wauering beautie, and that a Prince whose prowesse could not be subdued, shoulde by loue become subiect at the first shot.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Egerio,</hi> quoth I, knowest thou not that hee whem no mortall creature can controule, loue can commaund, that no dignitie is able to resist <hi>Cupids</hi> deitie: <hi>Achilles</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable, yet wounded by fancie: <hi>Hercules</hi> not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered of anie, yet quicklie vanquished by affection: <hi>Mars</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to resist <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but not to withstande beautie. Looue is not onely kindled in the eye by desire, but ingrauen in the mind by destenie, which neither reason can eschew, nor wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome expell.</p>
            <p>The more pittie (quoth hee) for poore men, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impietie in the gods, that in giuing loue fr√©e libertie, they graunted him a lawlesse priuiledge. But sith <hi>Cupid</hi> will be obeyed, <hi>Arbasto</hi> is willing to be obedient, woulde God loue had either aimed amisse, or els had not made <hi>Doralicia</hi> the marte.</p>
            <p>I not vnwilling that <hi>Egerio</hi> shoulde be priuie to my passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tolde him that what I spoke was in iest, and that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I did fancie, as yet I knew not what it meant: I would vse loue as the <hi>Persians</hi> did the Sunne, who in the morning
<pb facs="tcp:6215:15"/>
honor it as a God, and at noone-tide curse it as a deuill. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing thus my care, the couered sparks burst into greate flames, that comming to my Tent, I was forst to cast my selfe vppon my bedde, where I sobbed foorth sorrowfullie these wordes.</p>
            <p>Alas <hi>Arbasto,</hi> how art thou perplexed, thou both liuest in ill hap, and louest without hope: thou burnest in desire, and art cooled with disdaine: thou art bidden to the feast by loue, and art beaten with the spit by beautie. But what then, dost thou count it care which thou sufferest for <hi>Doralicia,</hi> who shameth <hi>Venus</hi> for her hue, and staineth <hi>Diana</hi> for her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie.

            <p>Well, being resolued vpon this point, I felt my minde disburthened of a thousand cares, wherewith before I was clogged, feeding my selfe with the hope of that pleasure, which when I enioyed sholde recompence my former paine.</p>

Why then seeke some meane to manifest thy looue to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basto:</hi> for as the stone <hi>Draconites</hi> can by no meanes bee po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, vnlesse the Lapidarie burne it, so thy minde can by no medicine be cured, vnlesse <hi>Arbasto</hi> ease it: alas <hi>Arba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto,</hi> sweete <hi>Arbasto.</hi> And with that she fetcht such a groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sighe, that one of her Maydes came into the Chamber, who by her presence putting her from her passions, sate so long by, tyll tyred with drousie thoughts she fell into a slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>Fortune frowning thus vppon her (as I supposed) and fawning vpon me, I set my foote on the fairest sands, althogh at last I found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> most fickle, thinking I must needes tread the Mesures right, when Fortune piped the daunce, but though I threw at all, yet my chance was hard, for <hi>Pelorus</hi> trifling for truce, pretended treason: making a shew of fear, fought subtilly how to ouerthrow me by deceit, saying, that in ruling of Empires there is required as great pollicie as prowesse, in gouerning an estate, close crueltie dooth more good than open clemencie: for the obtayning of a kingdome, as well mischiefe as mercie is to be practised: that better he had commit an inconuenience in breaking his oth, than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a mischiefe by keeping his promise: setting downe the staffe therefore on this secure periurie, thus it fell out.</p>
            <p>After two or thr√©e daies were passed, accompanied onely with <hi>Egerio,</hi> and a fewe of my guarde, I went to <hi>Orleance,</hi> determining both to conclude a peace, and to demaunde <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralicia</hi> in marriage: where no sooner I arriued, and was entered in at the gates of the Citty, but I found <hi>Pelorus</hi> and al his men in Armes, which sight so appalled my sences, that I stood as one trans-formed, fearing that which presentlie I found true: for <hi>Pelorus</hi> hauing his force inflamed with furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous choller, commaunded his Captaines to lay hold on me, and to carrie mee to close prison, swering that no lesse than
<pb facs="tcp:6215:17"/>
the losse of life should mittigate his furie.</p>
            <p>And raging in this choller, after he had lodged me vppe in Lymbo, he went with al his Armie to the Campe, wher fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my soldiers secure, as men little doubting of such mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, he made such a monstrous and mercilesse slaughter, as of fiftie thousand he left fewe aliue, those which remained he plagued with al kind of slauerie, returning home with his shameles triumph, hee commaunded that in the mids of the Cittie there should be made a great scaffold, wherupon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ten daies I should be executed: these heauie and haplesse newes b√©eing come to myne eares, such sorrowfull passions perplexed my mind, as after floods of brinish teares, I burst forth into these bitter termes.</p>
            <p>O infortunate <hi>Arbasto</hi> (quoth I) and therefore the more infortunate, because <hi>Arbasto,</hi> art thou not worthy of thys mishap, which wilfully sought thine owne miserie? canst thou accuse the Gods, which didst striue against the Gods? canst thou condemne Fortune, which hast warred against nature, and Fortune: No no, in suffering reason to yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to appetite, wisedom vnto will, and wit vnto affection, thou hast procured thine owne death, and thy Souldiers destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Loue, yea loue it is that hath procured thy losse, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that hath bred thy bale: fancie hath giuen th√©e the foyle, and thine owne witlesse wil that hath wrought thy woe: the more is thy paine, and the lesse thou art to bee pittied: was there none to like but <hi>Doralicia?</hi> none to choose but thy foe? none to loue but thine enemie? O vile wretch fraught with carelesse follie.</p>
            <p>And with that, as I was readie to exclaime against my curssed destenie, I heard the pryson doore open, where I saw presently to enter <hi>Myrania, Doralicia,</hi> and Madam <hi>Vecchia,</hi> who s√©eing me sit in such sorrowfull dumpes, began to smyle at my dolor, and to laugh at my mishappe, which wilfullie thrust my selfe into such miserie, thinking therefore to agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate my griefe by rubbing a fresh my sore, <hi>Doralicia</hi> began
<pb facs="tcp:6215:17"/>
to gall me on this sort.</p>
            <p>Hearing <hi>Arbasto</hi> (quoth she) that you were come to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute your sute, playing the good Captaine, that for the first foyle giueth not ouer the field, I thought good to giue you a smiling looke in recompence of your flattering loue, least if I should not be so curteous to so kind a Gentleman, the world should account me ingratefull.</p>
            <p>It is truth sister (Íùô <hi>Myrania</hi>) it s√©emes he is a passing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous louer: but it is pittie he hath verie ill luck: he choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his chaffer well, but yet is an vnskilfull chapman, for if he buy at such an vnreasonable rate, he is like (sell howe hee can) to liue by the losse.</p>
            <p>Tush (quoth Madam <hi>Vecchia</hi>) he playeth like the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, who sucking bloode out of the Clephant, killeth him, and with the same poysoneth her selfe: so <hi>Arbasto</hi> s√©eking to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray others, is himselfe taken in the trap: a iust rewarde for so vniust dealing, and a fit reuenge for so rechles an enemie.</p>
            <p>And yet (Íùô <hi>Doralicia</hi>) his purpose hath taken small place: for whatsoeuer his mind was, his malice hath wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ted might, wherin he resembleth the Serpent <hi>Porphirius,</hi> who is ful of poyson, but b√©eing toothlesse hurteth none but himselfe. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie whatsoeuer his chaunce be, hee hath made a verie good choice: for he preferreth sw√©ete loue before bitter death, and the hope of euerlasting fame before the feare of momentarie mis-fortune: he shall now for his constancie be canonized in Denmark for a saint, and his subiects may boast &amp; say, that <hi>Arbasto</hi> our King died for loue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Egerio</hi> s√©eing that extremitie of griefe woulde not suffer me to vtter one worde, not able anie longer to abide these frumpes, crost her with this chollerick replie.</p>
            <p>Gentlewoman (Íùô he) although I so terme you, rather to shew mine own curtesie, than to decipher your conditions, it s√©emeth Nurture hath taught you very few manners, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affoorded very smal modestie, that s√©eing one in distresse, you should laugh at his dolor, and where the partie is crossed
<pb facs="tcp:6215:18"/>
with mishap, you would with bitter tants increase his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: if he be your foe, he hath now the foile, he is taken in the snare, his life hangeth in the ballance.</p>
            <p>Though your father be without pietie, yet in that you are a woman be not without pittie. Hate him if you please as hee is your enemie, but despise him not as he is <hi>Arbasto,</hi> a king, and your haples louer: we are captiues, not to a woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy conquerer, but to a wretched caitife: not vanquished by prowesse, but by periurie, not by fight, but by falshood: who in our liues to thy fathers losse, won continuall fame, and by our death to thy fathers discredite shall purchase vnto him perpetuall infamie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doralicia,</hi> not willing to suffer him wade anie further, cut him short in this manner.</p>
            <p>Sir (quoth she) if bragges could stand for payment, I am sure you woulde not die in any mans debt: but if your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse had b√©ene as good as your prattle, you needed not haue daunced within so short a tedder: crauen Cocks crowe low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest: fearefull curs barke most, and a hartlesse cowarde hath alwaies more tongue than a hautie Captaine. But I heare with you, for I doubt the feare of death and danger hath dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thy Maister into a cold palsey, and hath made th√©e either frantick, or lunatick, the one shewing his melancholie, the other bewraying thy choller, willing therefore as a friende you should passe ouer your passions with more patience, wee will leaue you as we found you, vnlesse you mean to be shri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and then I will send you a ghostlie father.</p>
            <p>Our confession good Mistresse (quoth <hi>Egerio</hi>), requires but a small shrift: for wee haue very little to say, but that <hi>Arba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto</hi> repents that euer he loued such a peruerse Minion, and I that euer I trusted such a periured Traytor.</p>
            <p>The Gentlewomen tooke this for a farewell, passing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie to the Pallace, and leauing vs sitting sorowfully in the prison, bewayling our mishap with teares, and exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Fortune with bitter curses, what our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>plaints were, it little auaileth to rehearse: for it would but driue th√©e into

dumpes, and redouble my dolour. Suffise this that we were so long tormented with care, that at last we were past cure, counting this our greatest calamity, that liuing, euery houre we looke to die.</p>
            <p>Wel, as thus we were drowned in distresse: so poore <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania</hi> had her minde doubtfullie perplexed. Nature claymed by due to haue the preheminence, and leue sought by force to winne the supremacie. Nature brought in <hi>Pelorus</hi> aged haires to make the challenge, and Loue presented <hi>Arbastoes</hi> sweete sweete face to be the Champion: tossed thus wyth two contrarie tempests, at last she began thus to plead with her passions.</p>
            <p>Ah thrise infortunate <hi>Myrania,</hi> what strange fits be these that burne thee with heate, and yet thou shakest with colde? thy body in a shiuering sweat and in a flaming Ice, melting like waxe, and yet as hard as the Adamant: it is loue? then woulde it were death: for likelier it is thou shalt loose thy life than win thy loue.</p>
            <p>Ah haplesse <hi>Arbasto,</hi> woulde to God thy vertues were lesse than thy beautie, or my vertues greater than my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: so should I either quickly fr√©e my selfe from fancie, or be lesse subiect vnto follie.</p>
            <p>But alas I f√©ele in my mind fierce skirmishes betweene reason and appetite, loue &amp; wisedome, danger and desire, the one perswaded her to hate <hi>Arbasto</hi> as a foe, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained him as friend: If I consent to the first, I ende my daies with death, if to the last, I shall leade my life with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie. What shall I then doe? Ah <hi>Myrania,</hi> either swallow the iuyce of Mandrake, which may cast th√©e into a dead sl√©ep, or chewe the herbe <hi>Carysium,</hi> which may cause th√©e to hate euery thing, so either shalt thou die in thy slumber, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Arbasto</hi> by thy potion.</p>
            <p>Tush poore wench, what follies be these? wilt thou with the Wolfe barke at the Moone, or wyth the yong Gryphons pecke against the starres? Doest thou thinke to quench fire
<pb facs="tcp:6215:19"/>
with a sword: or with affection to mortifie loue?</p>
            <p>No no, if thou be wise, suffer not the grasse to be cut from vnder thy f√©ete, strike while the yron is hote, make thy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket while the chaffer is to sale.</p>
            <p>Nowe <hi>Arbasto</hi> is thine owne, now thou maist win him by loue, and weare him by law: thou maist fr√©e him from mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie without thy fathers mishappe: thou maiest saue his life without thy Fathers losse: thou maiest grant thy good wyll vnto loue, and yet not falsifie thy faith vnto nature.</p>
            <p>Can <hi>Arbasto</hi> which is so curteous, become so cruell? but he wil requite thy loue with loyalty, thy faithful fancy with vnfained affection.</p>
            <p>No no: he will and must looue th√©e of force, since thou hast graunted him his life of fr√©ewill: hee will like th√©e in thyne youth, and honour thee in thine age: he will be the porte of prosperitie wherein thou maist rest, and the hauen of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wherein thou maist harbour without harme: so that thou maist say of him as <hi>Andromache</hi> said by <hi>Hector, Tu Do<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Yea but <hi>Myrania,</hi> yet looke before thou leape, and learn by other mens harmes to beware. <hi>Ariadne</hi> loued <hi>Theseus,</hi> fr√©ed him from the monstrous <hi>Mynotaure,</hi> taught him to passe the Laborinth, yea forsooke Parents and Countrey for his cause, and yet the guerdon hee gaue her for her good will, was to leaue her a desolate wretche in a deserte wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Medea</hi> saued <hi>Iason</hi> from the daunger of the Dragons, and yet she found him trothlesse: <hi>Phillis</hi> harboured <hi>Demiphoon,</hi> and <hi>Dido Aeneas,</hi> yet both repaied their loue with hate.</p>
            <p>Tush the fairest floure hath not the best sent: the Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries choose not the stone by the outward colour, but by the secrete vertue: <hi>Paris</hi> was faire, yet false: <hi>Thiestes</hi> was beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, but deceitfull: <hi>Vulcan</hi> was carued in white Iuory, yet a Smith.</p>
            <p>The precious stones of <hi>Mansaulous</hi> sepulcher coulde not make the dead careasse sweete. Beautie <hi>Myrania</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb facs="tcp:6215:19"/>
accompanied with vertue, honestie and constancy: but ofttimes fraught with vice, &amp; periurie. What then? if some were Traytors, shall <hi>Arbasto</hi> be trothlesse? if some were false shal he be faithles: no, his beautie and vertue hath won me: and he himselfe shal weare me: I will forsake Father, friends and Countrey for his cause: yea I will venture lim and life to fr√©e him from danger, in despight of froward For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and the destinies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Myrania</hi> being thus resolute in her opinion, began to cast beyonde the Moone, and to frame a thousande deuises in her heade to bring her purpose to passe, fearing euery shaddowe, doubting euerie winde, stumbling at the least strawe, yet at the last pricked forward by fancie, she thought to preuent all cause of feare in this wise.</p>
            <p>The euening before shee meant to atchiue her enterpryse, she secretly sent for the Iaylor by one of her maids, to whom she durst commit her secret affaires, who beeing taught by her Mistresse to play her part cunninglie, brought the Iaylor into <hi>Myranias</hi> chamber by a posterne gate, so that they were neither s√©ene nor suspected of any: where he no sooner came, but he was curteously entertained of the yong Ladie, who faining that she had to debate with him of waighty affaires, called him into her closet, were treading vpon a false boorde, he fell vp to the shoulders, not b√©eing able to helpe himselfe, but that he there ended his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Myrania</hi> hauing desperatlie atchiued this d√©ede, she straite sought not to rob him of his coyne, but to bereaue him of his keyes, which after she had gotten, and conueied his carcasse into a secret place, she went in her night gowne, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely with her Maid to the prison.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arbasto</hi> and <hi>Egerio</hi> hearing the dores open at such an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomed houre, began straight to coniecture, that <hi>Pelorus</hi> sought to murther them secretly, least his owne people shold accuse him of crueltie: but as they looked to to haue s√©ene the Iaylor, they spyed <hi>Myrania</hi> in her night gowne: which sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
<pb facs="tcp:6215:20"/>
and vnlooked for sight so appalled their sences, as they were driuen into a maze till <hi>Myrania</hi> wakened them from their dumpes with this sugred harmonie.</p>
            <p>I perceiue <hi>Arbasto</hi> (quoth she) that my presence dooth make thee to muze, and my suddaine arriuall hath driuen thee into a maze what strange wind should land mee in thys coast. In truth thou maist think either my message is great, or my modestie little, either that I take small care of my selfe, or repose verie great trust in thee, who at a time vnfit for my calling, haue without any guarde come to a stranger, a captiue, yea and my fathers fatall foe. I confesse it is a fault if I were not forst: but sith necessitie hath no law, I thinke I haue the lesse broken the law. But to leaue off these need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse preamples where delay breedes no lesse daunger then death: know this <hi>Arbasto,</hi> that since thy first arriuall at my fathers Court my eyes haue b√©en so dazeled with the beams of thy beautie, and my minde so snared with the viewe of thy vertues, as thou onely art the man who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in hart I looue and like: seeing th√©e therefore drowned h√©ere by aduerse fortune in most haplesse distresse, willing to manifest the loyaltie of my loue in effect, which I haue protested in wordes, I haue rather chosen to hazard both my life and honour, than not to offer th√©e peace if thou wilt agr√©e vnto the conditions. As my father hath wrought thy woe, I will work thy weale: as he hath sought thy bale, I will procure thy blisse: from penurie I will set thee in prosperitie. I will fr√©e thee from prison, from daunger, yea from death it selfe, I will in yeelding to loue, dissent from nature to leaue my father, freendes, and Countrey, and passe with thee into Denmarke. And to cutte off sp√©eches, which might s√©eme to sauour either of flatterie or deceit: as thou art the first vnto whom I haue vowed my loue, so thou shalt be the last, requiring no m√©ede for my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, nor no other guerdon for my good wil, but that thou wilt take m√©e to thy Wife, and in pledge of my trueth, s√©e h√©ere the keyes, and all other things prouided for our speedie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</p>

               <hi>Myrania</hi> had no sooner vttered these words, but my minde was so rauished, as I was driuen into an extasie for ioy, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the terror of my death was taken away with the hope of life, that from heauines I shoulde b√©e restored to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, and from most carefull miserie, to most secure felicity, I therefore framed her this answer.</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Myrania,</hi> the purest Emeralde shineth brightest when it hath no Oyle, and trueth delighteth when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled worst.

To decipher in coloured discourses, and to painte out with curious shaddowes, howe humbly I accept of your offer, and howe greatlie I thinke my selfe beholding to the Gods, for blessing me with such an happie chaunce, what my loyaltia and truth shal be, were but to prooue that which your Ladiship hoping of my constancie hath not put in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. The guerdon you craue for your good will is such, that if your curtesie had not forced me to it by constraint, yet your beautie and vertues are so great, as fancie woulde haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled mee by consent. <hi>Myrania,</hi> what thou canst wishe in a true and trusty Louer, I promise to performe, swearing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that the floodes shall flowe against their streames, the earth shall mount against his course, yea my carcasse shal be consumed vnto dust an ashes, before my minde shall bee found disloyall, and to this I call the Gods to witnesse, of whom I desire no longer to liue, than I meane simply to loue.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Arbasto</hi> (quoth she) woulde God I had neuer seene thee, or that I may find thy works according to thy wordes, otherwise shall I haue cause to wishe I had been more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell or lesse curteous. But loue will not let mee doubt the worst, but bids me hope the best: yet thus much I may say, when <hi>Iason</hi> was in danger, who more faithfull, when <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus</hi> feared the Laborinth, who more loyall, when <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6215:21"/>
suffered shipwracke, who more louing: but I will not say what I thinke <hi>Arbasto,</hi> because thou shalt not suspect I feare.</p>
            <p>Madame (Íùô <hi>Egerio</hi>) <hi>Arbasto</hi> is my soueraigne, &amp; I bothe honor and feare him as a subiect, yet if he shoulde but once in hart think to be disloyall to <hi>Myrania,</hi> the Gods confound m√©e with all earthly plagues, if I would not of a trustie Freend, become his mortall foe.</p>
            <p>It is easie to perswade her <hi>Egerio</hi> (quoth she) who already is most willing to bel√©eue, let vs leaue therefore these neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse protestations, and goe to the purpose, delay br√©edes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, time tarrieth no man, speede in necessitie is the best spurre, let vs haste therefore till we gette forth of France, least if we be preuented, if breede my mishap and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall miserie.</p>
            <p>Upon this we staied not, but shutting the pryson close, gotte couertlie out of the Cittie, passing through Fraunce with many fearefull perrils, which to rehearse, were either needlesse or bootlesse: suffise this, we at last happily arriued at Denmark, where how I was welcommed home with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, were too long to relate. But how <hi>Pelorus</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed after he knewe of our happy departure, though (God wot) most haples vnto him, I refer to thy good consideration to coniecture. The old father fretted not so fast in his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, but <hi>Doralicia</hi> chafed as much in her choller, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bitterlie both against me and her sister <hi>Myrania:</hi> but as words breake no bones, so wee cared the lesse for her scol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, fearing not the noyse of the p√©ece as long as wee were without daunger of the shot. Well, leauing them to theyr dumpes, to vs againe which floted in delight. Fickle For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hauing now hoysed vs vp to the toppe of her inconstant wheele, seeing howe careles I slumbered in the cradle of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, thought to make mee a verie mirrour of her muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, for shee beganne a freshe to turne my typpet on this wise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6215:21"/>As dailie I flattered <hi>Myrania,</hi> for fancie her I could not, promising with sp√©ed to call a parliament for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mariage, I still felt the stumpes of the olde loue I bare <hi>Doralicia</hi> to stick in my stomacke, the more closelie I couered the sparkes, the more the flame burst forth, I found absence to increase affection, not to decrease fancie: in the day my minde doted of her vertues, in the night I dreamed of her beautie: yea, <hi>Cupid</hi> began to encounter mee with so fresh canmizados, as by distance my distresse was far more augmented, such sighes, such sobs, such thoughts, such paines and passions perplexed mee, as I felt the last assault worse than the former batterie. If I loued <hi>Doralicia</hi> in Fraunce, I now liked her thrise better being in Denmark. If in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence her person pleased mee, nowe in absence her perfection more contented mee. To conclude, I sware to my selfe with a sollemne sighe. <hi>Doralicia</hi> was, is, and shall be the Mistresse of my hart in despight of the froward destinies, yet amazed at mine owne follie, I began thus to muse with my selfe.</p>
            <p>O foolish <hi>Arbasto,</hi> nay rather frantick fondling, hast thou lesse reason then vnreasonable creatures? the Tyger fl√©eth the traine, the Lyon escheweth the nettes, the D√©ere auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the coyles, because they are taken with these instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and art thou so mad, as hauing escaped pikes, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to thrust thy selfe into perrill. The child being burnt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the fire, but thou b√©eing an old foole, wilt with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worme <hi>Naplitia</hi> no sooner come out of the coales, but thou wilt leape into the flame. But alas what then: I s√©e the measure of loue is to haue no mean, and the end to be euerlasting: that to loue is allotted to all, but to be happy in loue incident to fewe: why, shall I be so mad to loue <hi>Doralicia,</hi> or so fraught with ingratefull periurie, as not to like <hi>Myrania,</hi> the one hath crossed me with bitter, girds, the other courted me with sweet glaunces: <hi>Doralicia</hi> hath rewarded me with disdain, <hi>Myrania</hi> intreated me with desire, the one hath saued my life, the other sought my death. O <hi>Arbasto</hi> thou s√©est the best,
<pb facs="tcp:6215:22"/>
but I feare like to follow the worst. Alas, I cannot but loue <hi>Doralicia,</hi> what then? what resteth for me to doe, but to die with patience, s√©eing I cannot liue with pleasure: yea <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basto,</hi> die die rather with a secret scar, than an open scorne, for thou maist well sue, but neuer shalt thou haue good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. And yet Lyons fawne when they are clawed: the most cruell Tygers stoope when they are tickled: and Women though neuer so obstinate, y√©eld whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> they are courted. There is no Pearle so hard, but vinegar breaketh: no Diamonde so stonie, but blood molifieth, no hart so stiffe, but loue weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: what though <hi>Doralicia</hi> sought thy death, perhaps now she repents, and wil giue th√©e life: though at the first she cast th√©e a stone, she will now throw th√©e an Apple. Why then <hi>Arbasto</hi> assault her once againe with a freshe charge, s√©eke to get that by Letters which thou couldest not gaine by talke, for one line is of more force to perswade, then a months par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, for in writing, thou mayst so set downe thy passions, and her perfections, as she shall haue cause to thinke wel of th√©e, and better of her selfe, but yet so warilie, as it shall be harde for her to iudge whither thy loue bee more faithfull, or her beautie amiable. I haue thus determined with my selfe, though as couertlie as I could to conceale my affaires, least either <hi>Myrania</hi> or <hi>Egerio</hi> should spie my halting, conueying therfore my affaires as cunninglie as I could, I priuilie sent an Embassadour to <hi>Pelorus,</hi> to intreat for a contract betw√©en vs, and also to craue his daughter <hi>Doralicia</hi> in mariage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to send him <hi>Myrania</hi> safe vpon this consent, and with all, I framed a Letter to <hi>Doralicia</hi> to this effect.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:6215:23"/>After that the Messenger was returned to Denmarke, and that I had receiued and reade the Letter, such sundrie thoughts assailed me, that I became almost franticke: feare, dispaire, griefe, hate, choller, wrathe, desire of reuenge, and what not, so tormented my minde, that I fell to raging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gods, to rayling at <hi>Doralicia,</hi> and to cursing of all womankind, conceiuing such an extreame hate against her, as before I loued her not so hartilie, as nowe I loathed her hatefullie, counting my selfe an vngrate wretch towarde <hi>Myrania,</hi> and calling to mind her beautie &amp; vertue, her boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and curtesie, I fel more d√©eply in loue with her than euer with <hi>Doralicia,</hi> so that I coulde not spare one glaunce from gazing vpon her person, nor draw my minde from musing on her perfection. A suddaine change, but alas a sorrowfull chance.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Myrania</hi> s√©eing me soused in these sorrowful dumps, began straight without casting anie water, to coniecture my disease, and to shoot at that which indeede she hytte without anie great ayme.

most intollerable passions, yea care and griefe so fiercely and freshly assaulted her, as she fell into a Feuer, refusing all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance, wishing and calling for nothing but death.</p>
            <p>While shee thus pined away with gr√©efe, I thought to search out her sore, but I could not perceiue the cause of her sorrow onely I did coniecture this, that she doubted my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles would not consent to our mariage: to rid her therefore of this care, I presently called a parliament, where without anie great controuersie it was concluded.</p>
            <p>This newes being come to the eares of <hi>Myrania,</hi> it no whit decreased her dolor, but did rather farre the more aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her distresse, which made <hi>Egerio</hi> to muse, &amp; draue mee into a great maze: so that accompanied with my Nobles, I went to comfort her, &amp; to carrie her newes, that if she coulde but come into the Chamber of presence, she should there bee crowned Qu√©ene. But alas, when I came and sawe her so altered in one weeke, wasted to the hard bones, more like a ghost than a liuing creature, I began thus to comfort her.</p>

            <p>I had no sooner vttered this worde, but <hi>Myrania</hi> as one possessed with some hellish furie, start vp in her bed with sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lookes and wrathfull countenaunce, s√©eming by her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging gestures to bee in a frenzie: but b√©eing kept downe by her Ladies, she roared out these hatefull curses.</p>

But b√©eing carried by force to my bed, I lay for certaine daies oppressed with such sorrowe, as if I had b√©ene in a trance, cursing and accusing my selfe of ingratitude, of periury, and of most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfull disloyalty, I lay perplexed with incessant passions.</p>
            <p>Well, this heauie and haplesse newes b√©eing noysed in France, <hi>Pelorus</hi> taking the death of his daughter to hart, in short time died, leauing <hi>Doralicia</hi> the onely inheritour of his kingdome.</p>
            <p>But yet s√©e how Fortune framed vp this tragedie, who meant to cast <hi>Doralicia</hi> from most happie felicitie, to most haplesse miserie: for she s√©eing that no sinister chance coulde change my affection, that neither the length of time, nor the distance of place, the spight of Fortune, the feare of death, nor her most cruell discurtesie coulde diminish my loue: mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing I say on this my inuiolable constancie, <hi>Cupid</hi> meaning to reuenge, s√©eing her nowe at discouert, drewe home to the
<pb facs="tcp:6215:26"/>
heade, and strooke her so d√©epe at the hart, as in despight of <hi>Vesta</hi> shee valed bonnet, and giuing grounde sobbed foorth secretly to herselfe these words: Alas I loue <hi>Arbasto,</hi> and none but <hi>Arbasto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Venus</hi> s√©eing that her boy had so well plaide the man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to triumph ouer <hi>Doralicia,</hi> who now was in her dumps, striuing as yet betw√©ene loue and hate, till fancie sette in her foote, and then ye y√©elded vp the bulwark in these peaceable termes.</p>
            <p>Why how now <hi>Doralicia</hi> (quoth she) dost thou dreame or dote? Is it follie or frenzie: melanchollie or madnesse, that driueth th√©e thus into dumps, and so strangly distresseth th√©e with dolor, what fonde thoughts, what vnacquainted passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: what slumbring imaginations are these which perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth th√©e: dost thou now f√©ele fire to spring out of the cold flint? heate to fry amids the chilling frost? loue to come from hate, and desire from disdaine? Doost thou fare as though thou hadst b√©en drenched in the Riuer <hi>Iellus</hi> in <hi>Phrigia</hi>? which at the first breedeth sorrow through extreame colde, but foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with burneth the sinewes through raging heat. Hath <hi>Venus</hi> nowe in despight of <hi>Vesta</hi> made th√©e vale bonnet: the more (poore wenche) is thy mishap, and the worse is thy fortune: for loue though neuer so sw√©et, cannot yet be digested with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a most sharpe sauce: faring like the golde that is neuer perfect till it hath past through the furnace.</p>
            <p>Loue <hi>Doralicia,</hi> but whom dost thou loue, <hi>Arbasto:</hi> what the man whom euen now thou diddest so deadlie hate? hast thou so little force ouer thy affections, as to fancy thy foe. No no fond foole, <hi>Arbasto</hi> is thy fr√©end, and one that honoureth th√©e as a Saint, and would serue th√©e as his soueraigne, that loueth and liketh th√©e as much as thou canst desire, but more than thou doost deserue, who beeing bitterly crossed with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curtesie, could neuer be touched of inconstancie: but still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth like to <hi>Aristotles Quadratus,</hi> which howsoeuer it is turned, alwaies standeth stedfast. Thou canst not then of
<pb facs="tcp:6215:26"/>
conscience <hi>Doralicia</hi> but repay his loue with liking, and hys firme fancie with mutuall affection: he is beautiful to please the eye, vertuous to content the minde, rich to maintaine thy honor, of birth to counteruaile thy parentage, wise, curteous, and constant, and what wouldest thou haue more.</p>
            <p>Yea but alas I haue reiected his seruice, and nowe he will not respect my sute, I haue detested him, and nowe hee will despise me, I haue requited his good will with crueltie, and he will reuenge me with contempt.</p>
            <p>Better hadst thou then conceale it with gr√©efe, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it to thine owne shame: for if thou aime at the white and misse the marke, thou shalt bee pointed at of those that hate th√©e, pittred of those that looue th√©e, scorned of by him, and falked of by all: suffer rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> (poore <hi>Doralicia</hi>) death by silence, than derision by reuealing thy secretes, for death cutteth of all care, but derision br√©edeth endles calamitie.</p>
            <p>Tush, dost thou think <hi>Arbasto</hi> can so harden his hart, as to hate th√©e, so maister his affections as to fl√©e fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> fancy, that hee will become so proud as to refuse thy proffer. No if thou sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest him but one line, it wil more charme him than al <hi>Circes</hi> inchantments: if thou lendest but one fr√©endly looke it will be more est√©emed of him than life. Why, but <hi>Doralicia</hi>? and with that she sate stil as one in a trance, building Castles in the aire, hanging betw√©en feare and hope, trust and dispaire, doubt &amp; assurance: to rid her selfe therfore fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> these dumps, she tooke her Lute, whereupon she plaied this dittie.</p>

For we shunne the place of pescilence for feare of infection, the eies of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharismes</hi> because of diseases: the eyes of the Corkatrice for feare of death: <hi>Cyrces</hi> drinkes are dreadfull charmes, and <hi>Syrens</hi> tunes doubting inchantments: should I not then es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew thy alluring baits, when thou hast galled me with the hooke: yes I will, and must, least I be intrapped wyth thy subtiltie, or intangled with thy sorcerie.
