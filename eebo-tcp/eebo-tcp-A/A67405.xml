            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Reasons shewing the consistency of the place of <hi>Custos Archivorum</hi> with that of a <hi>Savilian Professor.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEREAS some objections have been suggested as if the place of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos Archivorum</hi> were inconsistent with that of a Savilian Professor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of those words <hi>Nullum [acceptet] in Vniversitate publicum officium (ut Vicecancellarii, Procuratoris, Clerici Mercat√ªs, &amp; similium,) sub poena amissionis omnis juris quod in Professione sua praetendere valeat.</hi> (Though if it were so, a <hi>Savilian Professor</hi> were no more incapable of being chosen to that office, then a Fellow of a Colledge to bee chosen Head, or presented to a living, which if he accept he must loose his Fellowship.) These Reasons are exhibited to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That by <hi>publicum officium,</hi> is not here meant, all publike imployment in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity whatsoever, is manifest: For if so, then might not the <hi>Savilian Professors</hi> be ordinary Delegates of Convocation, Delegates for Accounts, for Apeales, for Printing, for sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying Records, for making and reforming Statutes, &amp;c. contrary to the known constant usage of the University.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Statute expressely declaring, what kind of Publike Offices it doth intend, (to wit, that of Vice-Chancellor, Proctor, Clerk of the Market, &amp; such as are like these,) is not to be extended beyond such as are there mentioned. Now 'tis manifest, that this is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one of those three there mentioned, nor yet of like nature with any of them: They being all Offices of Magistracy, and publike Government: this only a place of Trust.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Imployment of <hi>Custos Archivorum,</hi> is so far from being one of the Offices intended in that Statute, that 'twas not then in being when that Statute was made: and therefore cannot be reputed one of those there intended; but at the most <hi>Casus omissus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be further objected, That though it be not within the letter of the Statute, yet there may be as much reason why the Founder might have forbidden this as some of those which bee did forbid, and therefore that it might be thought within the equity of the Statute:</p>
            <p>'Tis answered; Not onely, That we are not to enquire, especially in penal Laws, what <hi>might</hi> have been forbidden, but what <hi>is:</hi> or, That <hi>&amp; caetera's,</hi> and <hi>par ratio,</hi> are not, in Law, of any great weight for drawing in other crimes beside what are particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed (though in point of favour, they are good grounds for relief in equity, against the rigor of a Law:) or, That penal Laws are to be interpreted in the more favourable sense.</p>
            <p>But also, That, in equity, there is much more reason for relief against those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which are expressed, than to draw in such as are not: Because the Revenues of the Savilian Professors come much short, not onely of what Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi> did intend to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but even of what he thought he had, and the Statutes do expresly presume to be, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally settled. And therefore no reason to make the prohibition of other employments more strict than he hath made it, but rather more lax.</p>
            <p>And upon this account, not onely Dr. <hi>Bainbrige</hi> (though a Professor of Sir <hi>Henry Savils</hi> own appointment in his life time) continued, with it, his practise of Physick (an imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of greater gain, and greater diversion, than this of <hi>Custos Archivorum)</hi> and also a place in <hi>Merton</hi> College: But also Dr. <hi>Turner,</hi> before a Committee of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, justified his holding a Fellowship (though in that Statute expresly forbid) together with his Professors place: And Mr. <hi>Greaves</hi> injoyed the profits of his Professors place, together with a Fellowship of <hi>Merton</hi> College. And though these two latter examples, being against the Letter of the Statute, might therefore be thought more disputable; yet in the present case, where no such thing is, there is no reason upon pretense of equity, to make the Statute stricter than it is.</p>
            <p>So that neither the letter of the Statute, nor the equity of it, can in reason be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to exclude the place of Savilian Professor, as inconsistent with that of <hi>Custos Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chivorum.</hi>
