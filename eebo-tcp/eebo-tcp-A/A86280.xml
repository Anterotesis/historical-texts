         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my dear Brethren, The poor Remainders of the old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and Confromable Clergy of the Church of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was fore-ſignified by the Prophet, of Chriſt our Saviour, <hi>Arundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem quaſſam non confringere, &amp;c.</hi> That he ſhould not break a <hi>bruiſed Reed,</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>quench the ſmoking flax;</hi> that is to ſay, as <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 42. 3. in <hi>Mat. 12. &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Maldionate</hi> very well expounds the place, that his goings ſhould be ſo gentle, and his weight ſo light, that though he trod upon a <hi>bruiſed Reed,</hi> he ſhould not break it; and though he walked on ſmoaking flax, yet he ſhould not quench it. Which ſhoweth <hi>(ſaith he) quam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibili manſuetudine, ac Lenitate uſurus eſſet:</hi> with what incredible meekneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable tenderneſs our Saviour ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in all his Actions. The breaking of a <hi>brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reed</hi> was unknown to Chriſt, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be more frequent in the practiſe of thoſe, who moſt pretend to be his followers in their Words and Actings. And if the <hi>bruiſed Reed</hi> ought not to be broken, if we are to carry our ſelves with the <hi>ſpirit of meekneſs</hi> towards
<pb facs="tcp:114876:3"/>
all thoſe wich have been <hi>bruiſed onely</hi> by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle uſage; with how much tenderneſs and compaſsion ſhould thoſe men be handled, who have been broken by the blows of unproſperous fortune, and cruſht almoſt to nothing by unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Preſſures. For certainly there cannot be a greater Argument of an uncharitable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian diſpoſition, then to inſult on thoſe that are oppreſſed, and add affliction unto ſuch as have ſuffered wrong; to multiply Reproaches, even on guilty perſons when they have ſatisfied the Law, and paid their utmoſt debt to juſtice. Malice in this reſpect is far worſe then Cruelty, Cruelty many times is ſatisfied with the blood and death of ſuch as have been marked out for a publick ſlaughter. But Malice commonly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives Cruelty, and will not ſuffer thoſe to remain in peace on whom the face of heaven hath frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>&amp; againſt whom the hands of men have bin lifted up,</hi> to their deſtruction and undoing.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch is the unhappy age in which we live, that nothing is more ordinary then the adding of ſorrow to affliction, and reproach to trouble; practiſed moſt commonly by thoſe men who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend moſt to follow the example of Chriſt our Saviour, of which there cannot be a clearer and more evident proof then the procedings of ſome men towards you (my dear Brethren) of the Regular, and conformable Clergy of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſmitten into the <hi>Den of Dragons,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:114876:3"/>
and almoſt broken to pieces like a <hi>Potters veſſel:</hi> For when the ſword had ſpent its fury, and the hand of power filled it ſelf with ſubverting ſo many mens eſtates, the ejecting ſome, ſequeſtring others, and ſifting almoſt every one of us to the very bran; there ſtarted up a race of men, who agreed together to afflict them in a further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſaying to one another (as did thoſe Sons of <hi>Belial</hi>) in the Book of God) <hi>Come let us ſmite them with the Tongue.</hi> The fury of the Sword and the hand of Power hath already laid them open unto want and poverty; let us expoſe them therefore to contempt &amp; ſcorn; let us add ſhame unto their ſufferings, and ſport our ſelves in their miſ-fortunes. Theſe are the men whom God hath ſmitten, and now we have them down, let us keep them under, not ſuffering them to riſe in Reputation, or revive in credit, for fear of drawing pitty towards their calamities, or ſome commiſeration at the leaſt to their grievous ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. It hath been grown into a Proverb, that when a man is once thrown flat upon his back, <hi>(qui jacet in terram &amp;c.)</hi> he could fall no lower. But theſe men are ſo croſs of nature, and have ſo long run croſs to all publick Order, that now, they will be <hi>croſſing Proverbs,</hi> to bring us lower then we are, diſabling us of all means towards our ſubſiſtence, and laying all manner of diſgraces on us, which either an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Enemy could inflict, or an impeveriſht Clergy ſuffer.</p>

much concerned; the eport was founded (as I have been nce advertized) from a paſsage in one of Squire <hi>Sanderſons</hi> Pamphlets, in which the fooliſh fellow is ſaid to affirm, That he would have ſpared his own and the Readers pains, in his <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit</hi> of me, if I had had ſo much ingenuity, as to crave pardon of him, as I did of the other, whoſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories I had alſo quarrelled.

After which preamble, I deſcended unto that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular which gave occaſion to my writing, relating wholly to a third Perſon, utterly unconcerned in the differences which were betwixt us, to which he preſently returns a very civil, full, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Anſwer: If this be craving of pardon, I am guilty of it? And for the truth hereof, I do Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> himſelf, though for my better juſtification, I could produce two ſeveral Copies of that Letter, one of them kept by my <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> here at home, the other taken by a friend in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> before it came to his hands; the certainty whereof I do moſt humbly deſire you to make known, to ſuch as come in your way, who poſsibly may not have the opportunity of peruſing theſe Papers.

            <p>But all theſe Windes ſhake no Corn of mine, who have long ſince learned to contemn thoſe Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which from my firſt appearing in the Churches ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, have been thrown upon me: Nor can I doubt of finding the like reſolution in you (my Brethren) who have

My firſt amazement being over, I began to examine my memory upon theſe two points: Firſt whether in any Book or Books of mine, I had applied the name of <hi>Puritan</hi> to any ſuch of the Clergy, who being conformable to the Church in <hi>Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> agreed not in ſome
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114876:10"/>
               <hi>Doctrinal</hi> points, with ſuch of their Brethren whom M. <hi>Baxter</hi> there brandeth with the name of <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> And ſecondly, whether in any Book or Books of mine, I had made any ſuch deſcription of thoſe <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan-Conformiſts</hi> (for ſo I may expreſs M. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s meaning) by their opinions, as might and did diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from other men; but not being able to find the remembrance (or any the leaſt foot-ſteps of it) of any ſuch application of the name, or any ſuch deſcription of the men, as is deſcribed to me in that Preface; I began to conſider with my ſelf what might be M. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s deſign in it. Doubtful I was whether it might not be his purpoſe, to render my name as unpleaſing to the conformable Clergy, by attributing to them the title of <hi>Puritans,</hi> becauſe they hold not with thoſe whom M. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> in ſome points of Doctrine, as it had been before to the <hi>Presbiterians,</hi> for ſtanding in defence of the Church, and the conformable Children of it: good ſport it would have made amongſt them, if ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">

And no leſs doubtful was I, whether it might not be done upon ſome deſign of drawing me into freſh diſputes, and multiplying thoſe invidious controverſies, which I chuſe rather to decline.

            <p>This Letter being thus diſpatched, I propoſed theſe two hopes unto my ſelf. Firſt, That M. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſeeing his miſtake, would do me right, and make me ſuch amends in a publique way, as might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the wrong he had publickly done me; or otherwiſe that without any ſuſpition of pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs, or any new deſire of being in action, I might right my ſelf. What I have done in the laſt caſe muſt be left to the Reader, M. <hi>Baxter</hi> having failed on his part of doing it for me: For after more then ſix weeks expectation, I received an Anſwer to my Letter on <hi>Saturday</hi> the thirtieth of <hi>October;</hi> In the firſt part whereof, he <hi>wiſhes he had ſpared my name</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpuring it to his <hi>temerity,</hi> that he <hi>made mention</hi> of me on that occaſion, and finally acknowledging,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114876:11"/>
               <hi>that the principal part of what he intended, was in a Book of</hi> M. <hi>Dow</hi>'s. But ſcarce had he abſolved me from it, when he indeavoured preſently to make good the charge out of ſome ſcattered paſſages, in a Book of mine againſt M. <hi>Burton,</hi> publiſhed in the year 1637. ſo that it ſeems to be my fortune to be called unto as late a reckoning by M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> for ſome paſſages in my Anſwer to <hi>Burtons</hi> moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Pamphlets, and by D. <hi>Barnard</hi> and him both, for ſome things taken up here and there out of my Hiſtory of the Sabbath, firſt publiſhed in the year 1635. And as if this had not been enough to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me to a new encounter, he paſſeth from one point unto another, charging me with profaneneſs in reproaching extemporary Prayer, and <hi>being an enemy to the holy improvements of the Lord's day,</hi> &amp;c. accuſing me for <hi>many unjuſt as well as uncharitable ſpeeches, againſt my brethren, for having ſome bloody deſires, and making ſuch rigorous Laws to hang up all that are againſt me,</hi> for ſpeaking more favourably of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> then the <hi>Protestant</hi> partie, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things intermixed here and there; in ſome of which he diſputes againſt me, and in others he deſires to be ſatisfied by me: So that taking one thing with another, he hath afforded me work enough in returning an anſwer; which being to long to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a Letter, I have digeſted it Letter-wiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſet diſcourſe upon all particulars which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to me. Now M. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Letter was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

                     <salute>Reverend <hi>SIR,</hi>
                     </salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Received yours of <hi>September</hi> 13. containing your favourable judgment of my extorted diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Religion, with your exception of that only which concerns your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elf. And firſt, you here <hi>wiſh I had ſpared your name, unleſs I could have proved you to have been one of that</hi> Religion, <hi>which y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>u think I cannot, or found ſome more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular charge againſt you,</hi> &amp;c. To which I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I now wiſh I had ſpared your name my ſelf, for the reaſon that I ſhall render you anon.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, I never gave the leaſt intimation that I took you to be of <hi>Grotius</hi> Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you need not call for proof of it; it is another ſubject (the ſenſing of the word <hi>Puri an</hi>) that I am ſpeaking of, where I mention your name: I hope you think not that I charge every man with the ſame opinion that is but named by me in the ſame Book.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Yea, I did not ſo much as charge you at all, that is accuſe you, but tell the world who you took for a Puritan; Concerning which words, in Anſwer to the reſt of your Letter, I ſhall give you the juſt account. I had read on one day (above 20. years ago, when it firſt came out) your Book againſt M <hi>Burton,</hi> and M. <hi>Dow</hi>'s Book againſt him, and I think one of M. <hi>Pocklinton</hi>'s on another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I certainly remembred the foreſaid character of a <hi>Puritan</hi> in one of them, and I was perſwaded that it was in yours, and that ſomething of it more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114876:12"/>
or leſs was in both: I now confeſs to you it was my temerity, the concomitant of haſt, to mention you upon the truſt of my memory, after above 20. years time (for I never had your Book ſince) and now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſearch I find the principal part of what I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is in M. <hi>Dow</hi>'s, who charactereth them from their Doctrines of <hi>predestination, perſeverance,</hi> or <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to fulfill the Law,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>4. But ſo much of it I find in yours, as juſtifieth what I ſaid of you, if I can underſtand you, you deal with M. <hi>Burton,</hi> as the <hi>Puritans Oracle,</hi> page 152. their <hi>ſuperintendent Champion,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Preface</hi>) And your deſcription of him containeth, firſt that he follows <hi>Illyricus</hi> in his Doctrines, <hi>providentia, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinatione, gratia, libero Arbitrio,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 182. And to ſatisfie us fully what you meant, you refer us to the <hi>Arminians, neceſſaria reſponſio,</hi> pag. 83: where (with <hi>pag.</hi> 82. 84, 85.) it is expreſly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that it is the Doctrine of <hi>Pareus</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Contra-remonſtrants,</hi> that the <hi>Arminians</hi> there do charge upon <hi>Illiricus,</hi> and conſequently that you do charge on M. <hi>Burton,</hi> the <hi>Oracle</hi> (as you call him) of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and ſo upon the <hi>Puritans</hi> with him. If you ſay, you charge not theſe on him <hi>quatenus</hi> a <hi>Puritan.</hi> I Anſwer, You carry it openly in all your Book, as if you dealt with him only as a <hi>Puritan,</hi> and ſeditious, and ſo deſcribe <hi>Puritans</hi> by him. If you mix ſuch <hi>Doctrinal</hi> charges, and afterwards tell us that you meant them on ſome other account, you ſatisfie your Reader, that underſtandeth you as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing <hi>Puritans</hi> only, when you ſo often give the perſon deſcribed that name, and profeſs to oppoſe him as ſuch, and tel us of no other ground: And what elſe you mean by <hi>their accuſtomed wreſting of the</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:114876:13"/>
                     <hi>Article in the point of predeſtination,</hi> is paſt my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, there being no accuſtomed Doctrine but the <hi>Anti-Arminian</hi> among the <hi>Puritans,</hi> in the point of Predeſtination, that you can call a <hi>wreſting of the Article;</hi> you add alſo to help us further to underſtand you, that <hi>it is falſe that</hi> D. Jackſon'<hi>s Books are to maintain</hi> Arminianiſm, <hi>pag.</hi> 122. 123.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Sir,</hi> You are the expounder of your own words, and may give us the Law in what ſenſe we ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, becauſe they are the ſigns of your own mind, which is known only to your ſelf: And if you ſhall but tell me that you meant ſomewhat elſe then your words in the common ſenſe import, I ſhall take my ſelf bound to underſtand you accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hereafter; and if you require it, I ſhall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſh an account of my miſ-underſtanding of you, with my following ſatisfaction to the world to do you right: But till you ſhall give us another ſenſe of your own, you muſt needs allow us to take your words in the common ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>6. I ſhall not trouble you with any more on that ſubject: But were it not that in your writings I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a ſpirit ſo very diſtant from my diſpoſition, that I have ſmall hopes that my words will eſcape your diſpleaſure, I ſhould on this occaſion have dealt freely with you, about many things in many of your Books, that have long been matter of ſcandal and grief, to men that have much Chriſtian meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and moderation; Many reproaches againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Prayer, the holy improvement of the Lords day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many unjuſt as well as uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ſpeeches of your Brethren, whom you took for adverſaries, are matters that I am exceeding confident you have exceeding cauſe in tears and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114876:13"/>
to bewaile before the Lord, and for which you are very much obliged to publiſh your peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential lamentations to the World; and were it my caſe, I would not for ten thouſand Worlds dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had done it; and if I erre in this, I think it not through partiality, but through weakneſs. Oh the holy breathings after Chriſt! the love to God! the heavenly mindedneſs! the hatred of all known ſin! the humility! ſelf-denial! meekneſs! &amp;c. that I have diſcerned (as far as effects can ſhew the heart to others) in abundance of thoſe people that differ from you in ſome ſmaller things, which occaſioned your frequent bitter reproaches: if God love them not, I have not yet met with the people whom I may ſay he loveth; if he do love them, he will ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take your dealing well, eſpecially when you riſe to ſuch bloody deſires, of hanging them, as the better remedy then burning their Books, as in your Hiſtory of Sabbath, <hi>pag. 254.

                  </p>
                  <p>7. I am not an approver of the violence of any of them, nor do I juſtifie M. <hi>Burtons</hi> way, nor am I of the minde of the party you moſt oppoſe in all their diſcipline (as a Book now in the Preſs will give the world an account;) but I am ſure the Church muſt have unity and charity, in the ancient ſimplicity of Doctrine, Worſhip and Government, or not at all. And if you would have men live in peace as Brethren, our union muſt not be Law or Ceremonies or ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fferent Forms; nor muſt you make ſuch rigorous Laws for all, and hang them that are againſt you: Scripture, and reaſon, and the primitive practiſe, and great experience, do lead us all to another courſe. But of theſe words if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114876:14"/>
I could procure your pardon, I expect no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our difference.</p>
                  <p>8. To paſs by many others, I am alſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied in three things you ſay concerning Popery. 1. That the Papiſt was the more moderate adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Puritan faction hurried on with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er violence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Preface to <hi>Eccleſia vindicata.</hi> 2. That you maintain againſt M. <hi>Burton,</hi> that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Papiſts is not rebellion, nor their faith faction. I prove both. 1 That Religion which defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the depoſition of Princes, and abſolving their Subjects from their fidelity by the <hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe they deny <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> &amp;c. is rebellion (<hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal;</hi>) but ſuch is the Popiſh Religion: The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> is evident: That which is defined by a Pope and general Council, is the Papiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Religion; (It is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fide,</hi> yea, and <hi>eſſential,</hi> becauſe they will have all <hi>eſſentials,</hi> and deny our diſtinguiſhing them from the reſt:) But the aforeſaid Doctrin is defined by a <hi>Pope</hi> and an approved general Council, <hi>viz:</hi> at the <hi>Laterane</hi> under <hi>INNOCENT</hi> III. That if any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers ſhould teach the ſame, that puts it not into our Creed, as this is in theirs. 2. If it be an Article of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> faith, that none are members of Chriſt and his Church, but the Subjects of the <hi>Pope,</hi> then the Papiſts faith is faction: But the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is true, being defined by <hi>Pope LEO</hi> X. in a general Council. 3. I am a ſorry Lawyer, but truly I would fain underſtand whether it be true, that written by M. <hi>Dow</hi> and you (his <hi>page</hi> 185. and yours 210. of the Hiſtory of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath) <hi>That the</hi> Popes <hi>decretals the body of the Canon Law, is to be accepted</hi> (as not abrogated) <hi>which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for the direction and reiglement of the</hi>

                  <p>But little know I by what Authority the <hi>Popes decretals</hi> are Laws to the Church in general, or to us, and I will yet hope they are not in force: But if ever I live to ſee another Parliament, if I be miſtaken, I ſhall crave a freedom from that bondage: I thought the Acts that impoſe the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> had diſobliged us from all forreign power, and nulled the <hi>Popes</hi> authority in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. I am very glad that you (who are eſteemed the <hi>Primipilus</hi> among the defenders of the late tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid and perſecuting ſort of <hi>Prelacy</hi>) do ſo freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the <hi>Grotian</hi> Religion (which I never charged you with) I hope the more confidently that moſt of the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Divines will diſown it; but if ever you put your ſelf to the trouble of writing to me again, I ſhould be glad to underſtand how you can take the <hi>Popes decretals</hi> and the body of the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> as a Law for the government of the Church in general, and here received to be ſtill ſo far in force as you affirm, and yet not hold, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Council have the power of making Laws for the government of the Church in general, and ſee that we and all other Chriſtians are his Subjects.</p>

But firſt, I muſt needs tell you, that I could not chuſe but wonder at the extream but moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary length thereof, and the impertinencies of the greateſt part of it, in reference to that Letter of mine which it was to Anſwer, and whereunto you had given ſo full an Anſwer in the firſt 25. lines (which make but the fifth part of the whole) that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114876:15"/>
there was no need of any thing to be added to it. The cauſe of my addreſs unto you was to let you know, how much I wiſhed that you had ſpared my name in your Preface to your Book of the <hi>Grotian Religion,</hi> unleſs you could have proved me to have been one of that Religion, which I thought you could not, or had had ſome more particular charge to have laid againſt me, then I ſound you had.

Thus find we in the General Preface, That the inconveniencies which the liberty hath

                     <q>That for want of a ſet form of Prayer, they did ſometimes pray ſo ignorantly, that it was a ſhame to all Religion, to hear the Majeſty of God ſo barbarouſly ſpoken unto; and ſometimes ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly, that their very Prayers were either plain libels againſt Authority, or manifeſt lies, ſtuffed with all the falſe reports in the Kingdom.</q> And what effects he found of them among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> appears by his Proclamation againſt the <hi>Directory,</hi> bearing date <hi>Novemb. 30.

or evil men, to broach their own fancies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, be they never ſo wicked and erroneous, and to miſlead people into ſin and rebellion, and to utter thoſe things even in that which they make for their Prayers, in their Congregations, as in Gods preſence, which no conſcientious man can aſſent to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to.</q> And hereunto I ſhall add no more but this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the paſſages produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of two of my Books, and countenanced both by ſad experience, and ſuch great Authorities, muſt needs be either true or falſe; if true, they can be no reproaches; if falſe, why do you not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtudy to confute them, then reprove me for them.</p>

But this you ſeem willing to decline, telling me, that if <hi>you could procure my pardon for thoſe words, you would expect no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our diſtance.</hi> My pardon is as eaſily obtained, as asked; if you conceive it worth the asking, when there is no offence either given or taken. But whether you expect any more or not, that remains wholly in your ſelf, it being a matter of your own ſeeking that you have ſo much.

great, but that we may manage theſe Pen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates without any great trouble; and the diſtance in our affections being ſo little, that I ſhall very chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully embrace the freindſhip, and ſomwhat ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſire a place in your good opinion: <hi>Diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia locorum non tollit amicitiam,</hi> is a known Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm in our <hi>Ethicks;</hi> A friendly correſpondence being once begun, cannot be intermitted by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of places, or the remoteneſs of habitations, if both parties equally endeavour to maintain the ſame.</p>
                  <p>35. And here again we might have parted, but that you have a mind (for what ends I know not) to ingage me in ſome freſh diſputes: For thinking you had <hi>ſatisfied</hi> me, you deſire that I would <hi>ſatisfie</hi> you (<hi>paſſing by many other things</hi>) in three points eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, concerning Popery, in which you ſeem to be much unſatisfied; ſuch ſatisfaction as I can, I am bound to give you, as unto any other man, who mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly ſhall require an account from me, for any thing which hath paſſed my Pen, or come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of my ſmall ability<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the firſt thing for which ſatisfaction is deſired, is, <hi>That the</hi> Papiſts <hi>are affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by me, to have been the more moderate Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries then the Puritans; and the Puritan Faction hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with greater violence,</hi> &amp;c. For this you cite the <hi>Preface</hi> of my <hi>Eccleſia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>indicata,</hi> where I am ſure there is no ſuch matter; no ſuch thing (I am ſure) delivered in ſuch general tearms as you here expreſs it; but with limitations and reſtrictions, unto one particular, which is the Argument there handled; ſo that you enter upon theſe new Diſputes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Popery,</hi> with that kind of fallacy which the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians call, <hi>A dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer:</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:114876:41"/>
And how can I hope for a fair end from ſo foul a beginning? Look on that Preface once again, and you will find, that I ſpeak not generally of all the differences which are betwixt us and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts;</hi> but only of thoſe heats which have paſſed on both ſides about the liturgie: for having told the Reader, <q>That the Liturgie was faulted by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> becauſe it had aboliſhed the Maſs, and was communicated to the people in the Engliſh tongue, and blamed by the <hi>Genevians,</hi> for having too much in it of the <hi>Roman Rituals:</hi>
                     </q> I preſently ſubjoyn, <q>That the Papiſt of the two was the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Adverſary, and ſuch whoſe edges were ſooner taken off, from the proſecution of the quarrel, then others were.</q>  Would you be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in this? You may then pleaſe to know, that after the firſt heats were over, the Papiſts preſently grew cool, and relinquiſhed the quarrel; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſeaſonably and diſcreetly, that the Liturgie being founded upon thoſe common Principles of faith and piety, in which both parties did agree, was not ſo ſubject to diſputes and contradiction, as at firſt it ſeemed: And hereupon it was that Pope <hi>PI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> IV. offered to confirm it by his <hi>Papal</hi> Authority, that the Engliſh Papiſts dilligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to it; that after the Schiſm made by Pope <hi>PI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> V. little or nothing for many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (comparatively with thoſe of the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) was writ againſt it; that being newly tranſlated into the Latine tongue, about the year 1618. it gave great content to the more moderate ſort of <hi>Papiſts</hi> amongſt the French, as Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> informeth us, in his <hi>Quo Vadis;</hi> and being tranſlated into Spaniſh (at ſuch times as his late Majeſty was in <hi>Spain</hi>) it gave

no leſs contentment to the learned and more ſober ſort amongſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who marvelled much to ſee ſuch a regular order and form of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip amongſt the Engliſh, of whom they had been frequently informed by our Engliſh Fugitives, that there was neither form nor order to be found amongſt us: But on the other ſide, the <hi>Genevians</hi> beginning to take up the cry (called <hi>Puritans</hi> upon that account) in the 6. or 8. year of <hi>Q.

Star Chamber by the late Arch Biſhop, at the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing of D. <hi>Bastwick,</hi> M. <hi>Burton,</hi> &amp;c. in which he telleth us, <q>That if we make their <hi>Religion</hi> to be <hi>Rebellion,</hi> then we make their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> to be all one; and that is againſt the ground both of State and the Law: for when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Romiſh Prieſts and Jeſuites have deſervedly ſuffered <hi>death for Treaſon,</hi> is it not the conſtant and juſt profeſſion of the State, that they never put any man to <hi>death</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> but for <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> and <hi>Treaſon</hi> only? Doth not the State truly affirm, that there was never any Law made againſt the life of a <hi>Papiſt quatenus,</hi> a <hi>Papiſt</hi> only? And is not all this ſtark falſe, if their very <hi>Religion</hi> be <hi>Rebellion?</hi> For if their <hi>Religion</hi> be <hi>Rebellion,</hi> it is not only falſe but impoſſible, that the <hi>ſame man</hi> in the <hi>ſame act ſhould ſuffer for his Rebellion,</hi> and not for his <hi>Religion:</hi> And this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </q> therefore he did not think their very <hi>Religion</hi> was <hi>Rebellion,</hi> thus he. And if for all this you ſhall thus perſiſt, and ſay that the <hi>Popiſh Religion is Rebellion:</hi> you firſt acquit <hi>Papiſts</hi> from ſuffering death, baniſhment, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, under the Raign of the three laſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for their ſeveral <hi>Treaſons</hi> and <hi>Rebellions;</hi> and lay the guilt thereof upon the blood-thirſtineſs of the Laws, and of the ſeveral Kings and Parliaments by which they were made: And ſecondly, you add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more Martyrs to the Roman Kalender, then all the Proteſtants in the world ever did beſides.</p>

                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:114876:43"/>36. But this you do not only ſay, but you prove it too (at the leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you think ſo.) Your argument is this, 1. <hi>That Religion which defineth the depoſition of Princes, and abſolving their ſubjects from their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity by the Pope, becauſe they deny Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. is rebellion doctrinal. But ſuch is the Popiſh Religion: that is to ſay,</hi> the Popiſh Religion defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Depoſition of Kings, and abſolveth their Subjects from their fidelity by the Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they deny Tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c. The <hi>Minor</hi> you ſay is evident; but I am willing to believe that you mean the <hi>Major,</hi> &amp; that this only is an eſcape of the pen, becauſe you do not go about to prove the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> but the <hi>Minor</hi> only. To the whole Sylogiſme, I anſwer, firſt, that it is of a very ſtrange comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, both Propoſitions being falſe: and therefore that it is impoſſible by the Rules of Logick, that the concluſion ſhould inſue: that the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> or the Major as they <hi>generally</hi> call it, is altogether falſe, may be proved by this; that the thing which teacheth, cannot be the thing which is taught, no more then a Preacher can be ſaid to be the word by him preached; or the Dog which hunts the Hare, is the Hare which is hunted: ſo that although the <hi>Religion</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had <hi>defined</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Kings by the <hi>Pope,</hi> for denying Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. (as it never did) yet could not the Popiſh <hi>Religion</hi> upon that account be called <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> Rebellion by the Law of <hi>England 25.

                     </hi> Therefore that <hi>Religion which defineth the Depoſition of Princes, &amp;c.</hi> neither is really or nominally to be called <hi>Rebellion;</hi> if either the laws of <hi>England,</hi> or the Civil laws do rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what <hi>Rebellion</hi> is, as I think they do. And whereas you hope to mend the matter by calling it a <hi>Rebellion doctrinal,</hi> you make it worſe on your ſide then it was before, For beſides that there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Rebell on doctrinal</hi> (though ſome Doctrines there may be too frequently preached for inciting the people to <hi>Rebellion</hi>) you find not the word <hi>Doctrinal</hi> in the propoſition which you have undertook to prove, and wh<hi rend="sup">en</hi> preſents it ſelf ſimply to you in theſe words, that the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>37. Such being the faultineſſe of your <hi>Mejor,</hi> we will next conſider whether the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> or your <hi>Minor</hi> be any thing more <hi>evident</hi> then your <hi>Major</hi> was. Your <hi>Minor</hi> is, that the <hi>Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> is ſuch, that is to ſay, ſuch a Religion that defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Depoſition of Kings by the Pope, becauſe they deny Tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c. This is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be proved, and you prove it thus, That which is <hi>defined by a Pope</hi> and <hi>General Councel, is the Popiſh Religion:</hi> But the aforeſaid Doctrine is defined by a Pope and an <hi>approved General Councel, viz,</hi> at the

And this was the occaſion of it. The <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> differing in many points from the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved opinions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſtantly denying the Popes Supremacy amongſt other things, ſome years before the calling of this Councel, was grown to a very great power and inſolencie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced therein by the two laſt <hi>Raimonds</hi> Earls of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and ſome of the Petit Lords of <hi>Gaſcoyn;</hi> all which, though abſolute enough in their ſeveral Territories in reſpect of their vaſſals, but were <hi>fuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries</hi> either to the Empire or the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> as the Lords in chief, for the reduction of theſe <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes</hi> to the Church of Rome. <hi>Dominick</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> (the Founder afterwards of the Order of <hi>Dominical</hi> Fryars) uſed his beſt endeavours in the way of Argument and perſwaſion but failing of his deſign therein, he inſtigated Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. to call this <hi>Councel, Anno,</hi> 1215. and the Prelates there aſſembled, to paſſe this Canon for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114876:45"/>
both of them and their Patrons alſo; for having ſummed up the principle heads of that Religion which was then publickly maintained in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they framed an Oath to be taken by all ſecular Magiſtrates, <hi>ut haereticos univerſos ab Eccleſia denotatos bona fide pro viribus ex terminare ſtudeant,</hi> to uſe their beſt endeavours for the exterminating of all <hi>Hereticks</hi> (that is to ſay, all ſuch as did oppoſe thoſe Doctrines before laid down) out of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: and then it followeth, as before, <hi>ſi quis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro dominus temporalis, &amp;c,</hi> 
                     <q>that if any Temporal Lord being thereunto required by the Church, ſhould neglect to purge his Territories of that Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he ſhould be excommunicated by the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> and other Biſhops of that Province in which he lived; and if he gave no ſatisfaction within the year, notice thereof was to be given to the Pope, that thereupon he might abſolve his <hi>vaſſals</hi> from their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and give their Countries to the next Catholick <hi>Invador.</hi>
                     </q> who on the rooting out of the Hereticks ſhould poſſeſs the ſame, to the end that he might keep it in the holy Faith. But this was with a <hi>ſalvojure,</hi> a preſervation of the Rights and Intereſts of the Lords in chief, if they gave no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the work. And with this clauſe, that it ſhould after be extended to thoſe alſo which had no Lord <hi>Paramount</hi> ſuperiour to them. According unto which decree, the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and their Patrons were warred on by the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> till both ſides were wearied with the War; and compounded it at laſt upon theſe conditions: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Alphonſo</hi> younger brother to King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 9. of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Joan</hi> daughter and heir to the laſt <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and have with her the full poſſeſſion of the

Country after his deceaſe; provided alſo, that if the ſaid parties died without iſſue, the whole eſtate ſhould be eſcheated to the Crown, as in fine it did, <hi>An.</hi> 1270.</p>
                  <p>39. This the occaſion of the <hi>Canon</hi> and this the meaning and the conſequent of it; but what makes this to the Depoſing of Kings and ſuch ſupreme Princes as have no Lord Paramount above them. For if you mean ſuch inferiour Princes as had Lords in chief, your argument was not home to the point it aimed at. If you alledge that Emperours and Kings (as well as ſuch inferiour Princes) are hooked in the laſt clauſe of, <hi>viz eadem nihilominus lege ſervata circa eos qui dominos non habent principales:</hi> I anſwer with the learned Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> in his book <hi>De Poteſtate Papae,</hi>

Secondly, that if any ſuch thing had been intended, it is not likely that the Embaſſadors of ſuch Kings and Emperors who were then preſent in that Councel, would ever have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it; but rather have proteſted againſt it, and cauſed their Proteſtation to be regiſtred in the Acts thereof in due form of Law. Thirdly, In one of their Reſcripts of the ſaid <hi>Pope Innocent,</hi> by whom this Councel was confirmed, in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>majores &amp; digniores ſub generali clauſula non intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligantur includi:</hi> that is to ſay, that perſons of more eminent rank, are not to be underſtood as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in ſuch general clauſes. Adde hereunto, that in the manner of the proceeding preſcribed by this <hi>Canon,</hi> ſuch temporal Lords as ſhall neglect to purge their Countries of the <hi>filth</hi> of <hi>Hereſies,</hi> were to be excommunicated by the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> and other Biſhops of that <hi>Province (per Metropolitanum &amp; ceteros com. provinciales Epiſcopos,</hi> as the Canon hath it) before the Pope could take any cognizance of the cauſe. And I conceive that no man of reaſon can imagine that the Metropolitane and Provincial Biſhops, could or durſt exerciſe any ſuch juriſdiction upon thoſe Chriſtian Kings and Emperours under whom they lived. I grant indeed, that ſome of the more turbulent Popes did actually excommunicate, (and as much as in them lay) depoſe ſome Chriſtian Kings and Emperors, ſometimes by arming their own Subjects againſt them, and ſometimes giving their Eſtates and Kingdomes to the next <hi>Invador.</hi> But this makes nothing to your purpoſe, moſt of thoſe turbulencies being acted before the ſitting of this Councel, none of them by authority from any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel at all; but carried on by them <hi>ex plenitudine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatis,</hi> under pretence of that unlimited power which they had arrogated to themſelves over all the world, and exerciſed too frequently in theſe Weſtern parts.</p>
                  <p>40. Such is the Argument by which you juſtifie M. <hi>Burton</hi> in his firſt poſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion is <hi>Rebellion:</hi> and may it not be proved by the very ſame argument, that the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>Rebellion</hi> alſo. <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf hath told us in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114876:46"/>
the cloſes of his Inſtitutions, that the 3 <hi>Eſtates</hi> in every Kingdome, (<hi>Pareus</hi> in his Comment on <hi>Rom</hi> 13.) that the inferiour Magiſtrates, and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>channan</hi> (in his book <hi>Dejure Regni</hi>) that the people have a power to curb and controll their Kings, and in ſome caſes, (as in that of Male-adminiſtration) to <hi>depoſe</hi> him alſo; which is much as any of the Popes Paraſites have aſcribed unto him: If you object that theſe are only private perſons and ſpeak their own opinions, not the ſenſe of the Churches; I hope you will not ſay that <hi>Calvin</hi> is a private perſon, who ſate as Pope over the Churches of his platform; whoſe writings have been made the Rule and Canon by which all men were to frame their judgments; and whoſe authority in this very point, hath been made uſe of for the juſtifying of Rebellious actions. For when the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners were commanded by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to give a reaſon of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt their Queen, whom not long before they had depoſed from the Regal Throne; they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified themſelves by the authority of <hi>Calvin;</hi> whereby they endeavoured to prove (as my Author hath it) <q>That the Popular Magiſtrates are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and made to moderate and keep in order the exceſſe and unrulineſſe of Kings; and that it was lawful for them to put the Kings that be evil and wicked into priſon, and alſo to deprive them of their kingdoms.</q> Such inſtances as this we may find too many, enough to prove that none of the three above mentioned (though the two laſt were private perſons) delivered their own opinions only but the ſenſe of the party.

                     <hi>Creed</hi> it is; in none of their old <hi>Creeds</hi> I am ſure of that, nor in the new <hi>Creed</hi> made by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, nor in the <hi>Roman</hi> Catechiſm publiſhed by the authority of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> nor in any other <hi>Authentick Record</hi> or publick Monument of that Church: for if this doctrine had been made a part of their Creed, as well before as ſince the <hi>Laterane</hi> Councel, ſo many learned men in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as <hi>Brian, Marſepius, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavinus,</hi> and divers others) had not writ againſt it; nor had ſo many ſecular Prieſts, living or abiding here in <hi>England,</hi> ſo freely written in behalf of the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> (in which this doctrine is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed) had it been entertained in that Church as a part of their <hi>Creed.</hi> And on the other ſide, why may we not conceive that this doctrine of <hi>Depoſing Kings</hi> is made an Article of the Creed by the Sect of <hi>Calvin,</hi> conſidering firſt how generally it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, how frequently practiſed and endeavoured by them as before was ſaid; conſidering ſecondly, that though many <hi>National</hi> and <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> have been held by them in their ſeveral and reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Churches, yet did they never in any one of them diſclaim this doctrine, or ſeek to free their Churches from the ſcandal of it. All which clearly ſhews that they did very well approve the doctrine, together with all the conſequents thereof, in the way of practice. And then, <hi>quid intereſt utrum velim fieri, an gaudeam factum,</hi> as the Orator hath it; what will the difference be I pray you between ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing before hand ſuch ungodly practiſes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of them on the <hi>poſt-fact</hi> as they ſeem to do. For were it otherwiſe amongſt them, they never had a better oportunity to have cleared themſelves
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114876:48"/>
from being enemies to <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government; from juſtifying ſuch ſeditious writings, from having a hand in any of thoſe commotions which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſturbed the peace of Chriſtendome; then in the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort, Anno</hi> 1618. where the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, or Delegates of all the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Churches, both in the higher and the lower <hi>Germany</hi> (thoſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> and the <hi>Switzers</hi> being added to them) were convened together. Their doing nothing in it then, declares ſufficiently how well they liked the doctrine, and allowed the practice.</p>
                  <p>42. Having thus juſtified M. <hi>Burton</hi> in his firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, you next proceed unto the maintenance of his ſecond; which is, that the <hi>Papiſts Faith</hi> is <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> and how prove you that? Marry thus, You ſay, if it be <hi>an article of the Popiſh Faith, that none are Members of Chriſt and his Church but the ſubjects of the Pope, then the Popiſh Faith is Faction.</hi> But the <hi>Antecedent is true, being defined by the Pope</hi> Leo <hi>the 10. in a General Councel</hi> This is the Argument by which you hope to juſtifie M. <hi>Burtons</hi> ſecond propoſition, though afterwards you would be thought to be no <hi>approver of his wayes.</hi> But let me tell you M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> your <hi>Hypothetical</hi> Syllogiſm is as faulty, and halts as much on both legs as your <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorical.</hi> For taking it for granted, that ſuch an article of the Faith was made by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. in a <hi>General Councel,</hi> yet can you not with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or juſtice, either upbraid the whole <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> with being a <hi>Faction</hi> becauſe of the obliquity and partiality of one article of it. Nor 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. can the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt <hi>Faith</hi> be termed <hi>Faction,</hi> ſuppoſing that any ſuch article had been made in that Councel; for it would follow thereupon, that if a Canon had been made in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114876:48"/>
the Convocation of the Biſhops and Clergie (which make the <hi>repreſentative</hi> body of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that whoſoever ſhould oppoſe the <hi>Rites.</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> by Law eſtabliſhed, ſhould not be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either of the Sacraments, or Sacramentals, that Canon might be called Faction; whereas the Faction lies not in the Canon, but in them that do oppoſe the Ceremonies. Or if any act or ſtatute ſhould be made in a free and lawful Parliament that every one who ſhall not pay the <hi>Subſidies</hi> and Taxes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them by the ſame ſhould be put out of the protection of the Laws of the Land; that Statute could not be, or be called Faction; becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lies not in the Act or Statute, but in them who do refuſe the payment. My reaſon is, becauſe the main body of a Church or State, or any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts or reſults thereof, cannot in any propriety of ſpeech, be held for Faction; whether conſidered in themſelves, or in relation to ſome few who diſlike the ſame, and violently purſue their diſlikes thereof. For <hi>Faction</hi> (to ſpeak properly) is the withdrawing of a ſmaller or greater number from the main body either of a Church or State, governing themſelves by their own Councels, and openly oppoſing the eſtabliſhed Government; as here in <hi>England,</hi> they who communicate not with the Church in favour of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> are commonly called the <hi>Popiſh Faction,</hi> as they are called the <hi>Puritan Faction</hi> who conform not to the Rites and Ceremonies by Law eſtabliſhed. But on the other ſide, the whole body of the Church is by no means to be called a <hi>Faction,</hi> in reference to either of the oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And then again, you ſhould have told us whether you take the word <hi>Faith</hi> in your propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114876:49"/>
for a juſtifying, hiſtorical, temporary <hi>Faith,</hi> or a <hi>Faith</hi> of Miracles; whither you take it for the Habit or Act of <hi>Faith,</hi> by which they believe, or for the Object of <hi>Faith,</hi> or that is to ſay the thing believed: If you can take the word <hi>Faith</hi> in none of theſe ſenſes (as I think you cannot) it muſt be taken in a more general comprehenſion, for the true knowledge and worſhip of God; and then it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſame with the word <hi>Religion;</hi> the Chriſtian <hi>Faith</hi> and the Chriſtian <hi>Religion,</hi> denoting but one and the ſame thing under divers names; ſo that upon the whole matter you are but where you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the <hi>Papists Religion</hi> being no more properly to be called <hi>faction</hi> in this Propoſition, then it was <hi>Rebellion</hi> in the former: Had you formed your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thus, <hi>viz.</hi> If it be an Article of the <hi>Papists</hi> faith, that none are members of Chriſt and his Church, but the Subjects of the <hi>Pope,</hi> then the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts faith</hi> (or rather that one Article of the <hi>Papists faith</hi>) tends to the making of a <hi>faction,</hi> you had come neerer to the truth; but ſtanding in the ſame tearms in which I find it, you are as far from it as ever you were.</p>
                  <p>43. Howſoever taking that your Propoſition to be undeniable, you proceed and ſay, <hi>But the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is true,</hi> &amp;c. which is a very ſtrange piece of news to me: You confeſs your ſelf to be but a ſorry Lawyer, and you have ſhewd your ſelf in this to be but a ſorry <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>44. But taking your meaning along with me, and ſuppoſing you to have ſaid the <hi>Minor</hi> (as you ought to have called it) how do you prove it to be true, becauſe ſay you, <hi>It was ſo defined by Pope Leo</hi> the 10. <hi>in a General Councel.</hi> The Councel which you mean, is called <hi>Conſilium Lateranenſe,</hi> as the other was; and you have ſhewed your ſelf as little skilled in this <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane</hi> Councel as you were in the other. So againſt that which you have ſaid in this anſwer of yours, I have theſe Exceptions; Firſt, That all things which are not determined nor defined in a <hi>General Councel,</hi> paſs not for <hi>Articles of the Faith.</hi> Secondly, The Councel held at <hi>Rome</hi> by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. was no <hi>General Councel:</hi> and Thirdly, There was no ſuch <hi>Article of the Faith defined</hi> in it, as you ſay there was: and theſe three points being proved, I ſhall cloſe the argument: <hi>Haec tria cum docuero perorabo,</hi> in the Oracles language. And firſt all things which are determined and defined in General Councels become not Articles of the Faith, though for the time they bind mens aſſent unto them until the point be further canvaſſed, and the miſtakes or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

of it manifeſted in ſome following Councel. But hereof I have ſpoken already, and ſhall adde but this, <hi>viz.</hi> That if you pleaſe to look into the Tomes of the Councels, you will find that they do more conſiſt in Laws and Canons for Reformation of Manners, then either in the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly the Councel held at <hi>Rome</hi> by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. was no <hi>General Councel,</hi> as being called on a particular occaſion, and conſiſting of ſuch a ſlender number of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, that it could hardly make good the Reputation of a <hi>National Synod:</hi> which that you may the better ſee, I muſt let you know the occaſion of the calling of that Counſel too; which was briefly this. <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12. of <hi>France</hi> having lately recovered the Dukedome of <hi>Millain</hi> to which he did pretend ſome title in the right of his Mother, was warred on by Pope <hi>Julio</hi> the 2. who liked not the neighbourhood of the <hi>French. Ferdinando</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, confederating with him in that quarrel. To curb the inſolency of the Pope, a Councel is called by the Cardinal S. <hi>Severine</hi> and <hi>Caravaiali</hi> at the inſtigation of the French King, to be held at <hi>Piſa,</hi> a Town belonging to the Seig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

dying not long after, before any thing could be done in that Councel, more then the condemning that of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and declaring all the Acts thereof to be null and void; the Cardinal <hi>John de Medices</hi> ſucceeded by the name of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. who being of a ſweeter temper then his predeceſſor, cloſed up that breach, admitting the two Cardinals and the reſt of the Aſſembly at <hi>Piſa,</hi> to a redintegration with the whole body of the Church from which they were before divided. Nothing determined in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel touching matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> but that a Decree was made againſt ſome Philoſophers (or rather phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophizing Schoolmen) what or about that time had began to teach <hi>quod anima rationalis ſit mortalis;</hi> that is to ſay, that the rational ſoul of man was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Mortality. And therefore thirdly, there was no ſuch article of <hi>Faith</hi> defined in that Councel, <hi>that none ſhould be counted members of Chriſt and his Church, but ſuch as were ſubject to the Pope.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed was there any need at that time of this Councel, that any ſuch Definitions ſhould be made; no new Hereſie, or any new doctrine which by them might be called Hereſie, being then on foot, (for <hi>Luther</hi> did not riſe in <hi>Germany</hi> till this Counſel was ended) which might create any diſturbance to the peace of that Church. If any ſuch priviledges were arrogated by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. <hi>that none ſhould be accounted members of Chriſt and his Church but ſuch as were ſubject to the Pope,</hi> which you cannot find definitively in the Acts of that Councel, you muſt rather have looked for it in the <hi>Bulls</hi> of that Pope, after <hi>Luther</hi> had begun to diſpute his power, and queſtion his uſurped authority over all the Church. In one of which <hi>Bulls</hi> you may finde ſomewhat to

                  </p>
                  <p>45. But if your meaning is (as perhaps it may be) that the <hi>Papiſts Faith</hi> may be called <hi>Faction,</hi> becauſe they appropriate to themſelves the name of the Church, and exclude all other Chriſtians from being members of Chriſt and his Church, which are not ſubject to the Pope, (as indeed they do) take heed you loſe not more in the Hundreds then you got by the County; for then it may be proved by the very ſame Argument, if there were no other: that the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faith is Faction, and ſo to be accounted by all that know it, becauſe they do appropriate unto themſelves the name of the <hi>Church,</hi> as the old <hi>Affrican</hi> Sciſmaticks confined it, <hi>intra partem Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</hi> For proof whereof, if you pleaſe to conſult B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

knowledge in that particular alſo as far as I can: and for ſo doing, I am to put you in mind, that the Popes for a long tract of time, were poſſeſſed of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical matters</hi> over all the Churches in the Weſtern and North-weſtern parts, and amongſt others, in this alſo; and that he did pretend the like authority over all the Churches in the Eaſt and South: ſo that their <hi>Decretals</hi> were made by them intentionally to ſerve for a rule and reiglement of the Church in <hi>general,</hi> but were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted only in the Churches of the Weſtern and North-weſtern parts, which did acknowledge his Supremacy, and made themſelves ſubject to his power. But having now ſhaken off his power in the three Kingdomes of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the three Realms of <hi>Denmark, Norway,</hi> and <hi>Sweden;</hi> in the united Provinces of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and many great Provinces and Eſtates of the Higher <hi>Germany,</hi> beſides ſome thouſands of the Proteſtant Churches in the Realm of <hi>France:</hi> he hath now loſt that power which before he challenged, <hi>of making laws for the Government of the Church in general; though ſuch of them as we here received, are ſtill ſo far in force,</hi> as I have affirmed; that is to ſay, according to the ſad reſtrictions and limitations before laid down. And therefore I can well maintain, that the Pope and his Councels <hi>had</hi> a power (you never heard me ſay he <hi>hath</hi>) of impoſing his <hi>Decretals and the body of the Canon law, as a law for the Government</hi> of ſo much of the Church as was then actually under his command, having been made intentionally for the reiglement <hi>of the Church in general, and that being here received, are ſtill ſo far in force</hi> (that is to ſay, in ſuch form and

univerſally received in the Church of Chriſt, and in which all parties doe agree; and then I little doubt but that the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches in <hi>Germany, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> and the <hi>Calvinian</hi> party in their ſeveral Countries, would not unwillingly take the benefit of a publick peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaving all <hi>doubtful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations</hi> to be managed in the publick Schools, not preſt with ſo much heat and with ſo little edification to the weak in <hi>faith</hi> in the common pulpits.

might ſo come to M. <hi>Baxter</hi> that it might alſo be communicated to ſuch others, as had took notice of the injury done me, and might expect to have ſome notice alſo of the right I had done my ſelf. I had ſome reaſon to believe that M. <hi>Baxter</hi> had imparted the Contents of his Letter to ſome or other of his friends before it was diſpatcht to me; to the end that they might ſee, and know, and relate to others of that party, to what a ſad reckoning he had called me. And how, unable I muſt prove to render an account of thoſe ſeveral charges, which he had juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid upon me. And I had reaſon to ſuſpect, that when he had peruſed my anſwer, and ſeen how little he had gotten by the Provocation, it might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly kept by him, or perhaps, committed to the fire for the greater ſecurity; that on the one ſide he might be held to be invincible by thoſe who look upon him as the <hi>Atlas</hi> which ſupports the cauſe, and on the other ſide I might be condemned for an <gap reason="foreign">

And other way I could find none to ſatisfie all parties and right my ſelf, then to publiſh theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges betwixt M. <hi>Baxter</hi> and my ſelf; and ſo to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them that coming, from the preſſe as M. <hi>Baxters</hi> firſt provocation had done before, it might be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally diſperſed over moſt parts of the Land. If any ſhall conceive my Anſwer to be too long, he

ſhall conceive no otherwiſe of it then I do my ſelf. But I was willing to take ſome pains with him to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him word by word, and line by line, where I found any thing conſiderable in it ſelf, or capable of receiving ſatisfaction from me. And to ſay truth, I have been the more punctual and exact in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, that M. <hi>Baxter</hi> having ſufficient <hi>meaſure, preſſed down,</hi> if not <hi>running</hi> over alſo, might reſt himſelf contented with that ſatisfaction, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede all further troubles to himſelf or me.

And if thoſe perſons whom I met with were ſo hardly ſatisfied, when they heard the ſtory from my ſelf, how much more hardly could ſuch others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction who live farther off, and could have it only from my friends But beſide this there was another motive to induce me to it, and that is the preventing of all ſuch as poſſibly may make uſe of that report to my diſadvantage; For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> (in the end of his Poſt Haſte, ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Pamphlet called the <hi>Reply,</hi> &amp;c. hath uſed ſome threats, <hi>That, whenſoever I ſhall appear armed again, he will be ready to meet me at my own weapon, be it ſharp or ſmooth</hi>) he will be apt to catch at any thing which may ſerve his turn, without examining
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114876:58"/>
the truth, or enquiring into the certainty of it. The like meaſure I may chance to have from ſome others alſo, who ſpeak as big, and threaten me as much as he, but threatened men live long, they uſe to ſay, ſo perhaps may I, and ſure I am, that none of theſe threatnings will prevail ſo far upon me, as to ſhorten the number of thoſe dayes I have to come, for your ſake therefore and for theirs, I have drawn up a full and perfect Narrative of the whole buſineſs in this manner following.</p>

               <p>The <hi>fame</hi> is, and it is made a <hi>common fame</hi> by the, ſpreading of it, That the Book called <hi>Reſpondit Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus</hi> hath been publiquely burnt, and burnt by the order of the Council: A <hi>fame</hi> which hath little truth in it, though it hath more colour for it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of it, then many other charges which have lately been laid upon me. Concerning which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, may be pleaſed to know, That on <hi>Saturday the</hi> 26. of <hi>June</hi> laſt paſt, intelligence was given to a friend of mine, that an Order was ſent by the Council to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> requiring him to ſee the Book called <hi>Reſpondit Petrus,</hi> to be called in and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114876:59"/>
publiquely burnt. Notice whereof being given to me, who was then in <hi>London,</hi> I was adviſed by ſome of my friends to neglect the matter, it being a thing that would redound unto my honour (as they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay) conſidering it might be rationally conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by all knowing me, that the Book could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſe be confuted then by fire and faggot. I knew full well what ſentence had been paſſed by <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> upon the order of the <hi>Senate</hi> or great <hi>Conſul</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for burning the Books of <hi>Cremutius Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> the Hiſtorian, <hi>Neque aliud externi Reges, aut qui eadem ſevitia uſi ſunt, niſi dedecus ſibi, a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> que illis gloriam peperere,</hi> that is to ſay, that ſuch who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had exerciſed that kind of ſeverity, gained nothing but ignominie to themſelves, and glory to all thoſe whoſe Books they burnt. But for my part I was rather of Sir <hi>John Falſtaffs</hi> minde in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and did not like ſuch grinning honour, and therefore choſe rather to prevent the obloquie, then to glory in it. In order whereunto, I thought fit to apply my ſelf to D. <hi>Barnard</hi> of <hi>Grays</hi> Inn, who as he firſt began the quarrel, in publiſhing the Book Entituled, <hi>The Judgment of the late<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord Primate,</hi> &amp;c. ſo was he ſuppoſed to have moved the firſt wheel in the Engine, although he ſtood behind the Curtain, and appeared not in it; conceiving that if he might be taken off, the whole buſineſs would ſoon come to nothing, without any more ado; upon which ground I wrote the following Letter to him on the <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> morning, and received his anſwer to the ſame in the afternoon; the Coppies of which Letter, and the anſwer to it I ſhall here ſubjoyn.</p>

                     <p>53. WIth what unwillingneſs I entred upon my anſwer to that Book of Yours, Entituled, <hi>The Judgment of the Late Lord Primate,</hi> &amp;c. I doubt not but you have found before this time, both in the Preface to it, and the two firſt Paragraphs of it. In handling of which argument, as I kept my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe within the bounds of Modeſty and Chriſtian Charity, ſo I expected I ſhould have been encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with no other weapons then ſuch as I brought into the field out of the Magazines and Store-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ancient Fathers, and ſome of the moſt Learned Writers of theſe latter times. But contrary to my expectation I was advertiſed on <hi>Saturday</hi> night, that certain Articles have been preſented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Book to the Lords of the Council, and that it is ordered thereupon by ſome of their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, that the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Weeler</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſhall ſeize upon the ſaid books and ſee them burnt. I have ſo much charity as to think that this is done without your privity and conſent, but I cannot but conceive withall that if the buſineſs be carried on to ſuch extreamities, the generality of men will not be ſo perſwaded of it; but that it will be rather thought, that ſince the matter of that book was not otherwiſe to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, it was thought fitteſt to confute it by fire and faggot. How little ſuch a courſe may poſſibly redound to your honour amongſt men of ingenuity and learning I leave you to judge. And though I
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114876:60"/>
am no fit Counſellour for ſuch a buſineſs, in which I am concerned as the principal party; yet if you pleaſe to take the matter into your ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you will perhaps find no councel more fit to be followed, then that you preſently appear in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome ſtop to thoſe proceedings; which though for the preſent they may end with ſome diſgrace to me, will bring no credit to your ſelf.

                     <p>54. FOr that Order mentioned in your Letter, I find your charity prevented me, in any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſurance of you, that I was not the mover of it. Since your Servant was here, I have further enquired after the ground of it; and this I am told, That it was not in relation to the Primate, or me, or any diſputes between us; but only to the Ordinance of the Lords and Commons, <hi>Anno 1644. For the better obſervation of the Lords day;</hi> wherein there is ſuch a clauſe as this, <hi>That whoſoever have or ſhall write againſt it, the Books ſhall be burned by the hands of juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For my part, I have no minde either by perſonal conference, or the Pen (as you write) to have any diſputes or contentions with you, in that or any other ſubject; neither do I intend to give any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your laſt Book: And had I been acquainted with you, I ſhould have adviſed you, as a friend, for your own ſake, not to have ſhewn ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection to that eminent and pious Primate; for which I find you condemned by moſt, if not by all ſorts of perſons, as the ſole man ſo declared againſt him: and as he is too high in the eſteem of the world to receive any injury by you; ſo what liberty you have been pleaſed to take in ſome expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, either in your former Book or this, I can eaſily paſs it over in ſilence, without the leaſt breach of Charity; and notwithſtanding, ſhall be ready to do you what ſervice may lye within my

               <p>55. Having received this Letter, and conſidered the contents thereof; I found it no way neceſſary nor convenient for me, to trouble my ſelf with a reply: for firſt, I was unwilling to be brought under a new temptation, in having more to do in any thing which related to the late Lord Primate, but where extream neceſſity ſhould compel me to it; though D. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> very unadviſedly (that I ſay no way) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in the laſt part of his Letter, to put me upon freſh ingagements; to what elſe tended thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings of my <hi>diſaeffction to that eminent and pious Prelate,</hi> from which I had cleared my ſelf before, and that twice for failing? His reproaches <hi>of my being condemned, for I know not what, by moſt, if not by all ſorts of perſons?</hi> Whereas I have reaſon to believe, that he hath ſpoke with very few upon that ſubject, and therefore cannot know the mind of the moſt, and much leſs of all ſorts of men; or the reiteration of the high eſteem in the world, which the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate had above me, being ſo willingly acknowledged by me in the beginning of that Book which was then in queſtion. Had I not tied my ſelf to this reſolution,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114876:62"/>
I could have directed D. <hi>Barnard</hi> to a paſſage in the Preface of a Book, called <hi>Canterburys Doom,</hi> by which he might be ſatisfied, that as I was not the firſt, ſo I am not the only one who had declared againſt his eminent pious Prelate, as he ſaith he was. But howſoever, had he been greater then he was, and I leſs then I am, I ſhould not have been terrified from writing in my own defence, or doing the beſt ſervice I was able to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Government, and eſtabliſhed Order I found ſo openly oppoſed. And ſecondly, I had the leſs reaſon to make any reply, becauſe I found no hopes that D. <hi>Barnard</hi> would be perſwaded to do himſelf or me any right in either of the ways propoſed: For firſt, he had declared before hand, when he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Lord <hi>Primates Papers,</hi> that he would not take upon him the defence of any thing contained in them: For thus he tells us in his Preface, <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Readers opinion ſhall deſcent any of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, or ſwell into an oppoſition, let him not expect any defenſive arms to be taken up by me, it being my part to declare his judgment as I find it,</hi> &amp;c. By which it ſeems that D. <hi>Barnard</hi> had no other intention, then to add more fewel unto thoſe combuſtions, which had ſo long embroyled the Church; and not to bring any water to quench the flame. Secondly, He declared in this preſent Letter, That for his part, he had no mind, either by the Pen or perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, to have any diſputes or contentions with me, in that or any other ſubject: and finally (which moſt concerned me in relation to the preſent buſineſs) he had apparantly declined to appear in any thing, for the reverſing of that Order, which was ſuppoſed to have been made by the Lords of the Councel; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114876:62"/>
improper, as he ſaith, for him to interpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with the Lords of the Council, to whom he had been no mover in it, and no more concerned in that Order then he ſaith he was; ſo that I found my ſelf neceſſitated to tack about, and try if I could ſtere my courſe by another compaſs; <hi>Hac non ſucceſſit, alia tentandum eſt, via,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Comedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>56. For D. <hi>Barnard</hi> having thus left the field, without ſo much as looking towards it at all, and left the buſineſs in the ſame ſtate in which he found it; the next morning I addreſſed ſome few lines unto the Lord Mayor, Sir <hi>Richard Chiverton,</hi> a perſon of known prudence and moderation; beſeeching him, that if any ſuch Order had been ſent unto him, from the Lords of the Council, he would be pleaſed to reſpite the execution of it for a day or two, there being litle doubt on my part, but that I might be able within that time, to procure an Order from the Council for the reverſing of that Judgment, if any ſuch <hi>judgment</hi> had been given in the caſe before: to which Letter, the Lord Mayor returned this anſwer, by word of mouth, <hi>That he would not be over haſty in a buſineſs of that nature; and that he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Book to the peruſal of ſome grave and learned Divines about the City, and that having received their opinions of it, he ſhould be better able to reſolve what he had to do.</hi> On the return of which anſwer, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently applied my ſelf to a chief Perſonage in the Council of State, from whom I might aſſure my ſelf of all lawful favours: But there I found I had been in an error all this while, as to that particular; that honourable Perſon giving me to underſtand, that no ſuch Order had been made by the Council, as to the burning of the Book; that information had been
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114876:63"/>
made by the Council, as to the burning of the Book, that information had been made to the Bar againſt it, with no ſmall importunity by him that followed the imformation: For having Order from their Lordſhips for the burning of it, according to the Ordinance mentioned in the Doctors Letter; final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Council did no more in it, then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the whole matter to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> to be proceeded in according to his diſcretion.</p>
               <p>57. Being thus aſſured from all fear and danger on that ſide, I made it my next buſineſs to enquire after the names of thoſe to whom the Lord Mayor had committed the peruſal of it; and underſtanding who they were, I was leſs ſolicitous then before: For well I knew, that men of ſo much modeſty as I knew ſome of them to be, would not be eaſily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to pronounce any thing raſhly, either of the Book, or of the Author; eſpecially conſidering, that if that Book ſhould be condemned to the fire, not only many of the Ancient Fathers, but even <hi>Calvin, Beza, Zanchius, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſſin,</hi> and many other leading men of the Reformation, muſt have ſuffered in the ſame flame alſo; being all cited by me, for the confirmation of my judgment, as to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. And ſo this buſine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s having made ſo great a noiſe at firſt, began as ſuddenly to repoſe, and in ſhort time to come to nothing, there being nothing effected by it, but a continuation of the <hi>fame,</hi> made greater by the ſpreading of it, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the more credit the farther it went, according to the nature of ſuch reports; which we have thus deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Ovid,</hi> in his <hi>Metamorphoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

According to this Character of the Houſe of <hi>Fame,</hi> the report of burning the Book aforeſaid, being taken thence, flew far, and grew the greater by the flying; affirmed ſo confidently to be true, by ſome whoſe buſineſs it was to diſperſe the <hi>fame;</hi> as if the very flame and ſmoake of the fire which burned it, might eaſily have been diſcerned at <hi>High-Gate,</hi> or from <hi>Shooters-Hill:</hi> But falſe fires are of ſhort continuance, ſo hath this been alſo; the ſooner quencht, if by my ſatisfying you, I may give ſatisfaction unto all the reſt who have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed in the report. Had D. <hi>Barnard</hi> done me right,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114876:64"/>
or conſulted his own credit in it, I might have ſaved the pains of writing, and you the trouble of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this preſent Narrative, But being as it is, we muſt thank him for it, who having ſo imprudently begun the quarrel, refuſed to juſtifie it <hi>by the pen, or a perſonal conference,</hi> which had he done, there would have been no need of any ſuch fame, which might either never have been conceived, or elſe might have been ſtrangled in the birth, without the leaſt wrong to any: But D. <hi>Barnard</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecure enough from falling into any ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, for publiſhing the Lord Primates Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as was intended to the Book and the Author of it, by which he found it to be anſwered; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleads it fitter for him to take his eaſe and let things happen as they would. In that point not ſo equal and impartial as the Heathen Orator, who held it moſt agreeable to the rules of Juſtice, <hi>

But I hope of more equality (or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality rather) from you, then I did from him: And therefore if your zeal tranſport you, to execute ſuch a private judgment upon that Book, as it hath not ſuffered in the publique, becauſe you like not the opinions therein contained, you may do well to let D. <hi>Barnard</hi>'s Book conſume in the ſame fire alſo, as having given the firſt occaſion to theſe new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances, which are the grounds of your diſlike.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>1. BEfore you had writ your Letter of the 8th of <hi>March,</hi> I had received another from an unknown hand, by which I was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that your <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Coll. had publiſhed his Pamphlet a ſecond time, and made bolder with me in the ſecond then the firſt Edition. And having given me ſome account of the Book, (which I could find no time of ſufficient leiſure to Enquire much after) he makes this requeſt, that I would undertake an anſwer to the Hiſtorical part thereof, in which he labours to Evince, that the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſtical opinions were the avowed doctrines of this Church.</hi> I had then ſome other work in hand, from which I was not willing to be taken off, by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and therefore deſired him to excuſe me from that ingagement, which he ſo zealouſly (but very modeſtly withal) recommended to me. It was not long before I had received the like Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a friend nere <hi>London,</hi> which I paſt over with as little Apprehenſion of the indignities and affronts which were done unto me, as I did the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But yours of the Date above mentioned, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing cloſe upon them, I began to conſider with my ſelfe, that there was ſomewhat more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in this invitation, in which ſo many men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred of ſuch different dwellings, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114876:67"/>
their deſigns and thoughts unto one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. I found many Reaſons in my ſelfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the buſineſs; my growing into years, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Sight, my want of neceſſary helps, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity between the perſons; and that having Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries enough already, it would be a great impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in me to encreaſe their number, and make them ſwell into an Army. But on the other ſide, I conſidered alſo, the multiplicity of your Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Charity which might be ſhown in eaſing you of ſome part of your burthen, the bitterneſs of the man againſt perſons of Eminence, on whom he ought not to have looked without veneration; but moſt eſpecially, that as I had appeared in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Church in my younger dayes, ſo it might ill become me to deſert her now, being as yet in ſome Capacity of doing that ſervice which you and others have ſo earneſtly deſired of me. <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Rem publ. Adoleſcens, non deſeram ſenex,</hi> was <hi>Cicero's</hi> Reſolution once, and ſhall now be mine. And becauſe it was your Letter which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon me more then any other, I have made bold to render my account to you from whoſe hand moſt eſpecially I received the charge. Firſt laying down the narrative of ſuch preparatory Entercourſe as paſſed betwixt me and your <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> before I ſetled poſitively on the undertaking; and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to the ſatisfaction of ſo many good friends, as far as I am able to ſerve them, and the Church in performance of it. Give me your patience for a time, whileſt I addreſs my lines unto you in my own behalf, and I ſhall little doubt of it, when I write of him, who hath made one Enemy of both. <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum a te p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Efficiam, ut contra illum cum dicam attente audias,</hi> in the Orators words. But it is time to end my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, and begin my ſtory, which is thus.</p>
               <p>2. It was by accident that Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Book of the <hi>Grotian Religion</hi> was unexpectedly offered to me, with intimation that I ſhould find ſomewhat in the preface, which concerned my ſelfe. By the like accident, and with the ſame intimation alſo I came to know of Mr. <hi>Hickmans</hi> late Book in <hi>Juſtification of the Fathers,</hi> and Schoolmen, &amp;c. It is not to be wondred if my Curioſity, or deſire of ſelf ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, firſt carried me to the conſideration of my own concernments (as before it did) or that I ſhould be much amazed to find my ſelf ſo courſely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a perſon I never heard of, nor perhaps ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver might have done, but on that account. The <hi>Poſitivity</hi> of <hi>Sinne</hi> might be a <hi>Paradox</hi> or a truth, and ſo declared on either ſide without drawing me into the Quarrel, who have not hitherto engaged on the one ſide or the other. But Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> that thinks ſo well of his own abilities, as to conceive no one man was to be looked upon as a competent Adverſary, on whom to exerciſe his Pen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt raiſe up another who had not the leaſt thoughts of contending with him. And that he might be ſure to ſharpen me to the Encounter he doth not onely touch upon me and ſo paſs it over, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did before, but ſpends the beſt part of a leafe in loading me with Reproach and infamy. He had before given this unhandſome Character of you, whom he looks on as his principal Adverſary; that you are <hi>one that drinks up ſcorning like water, and knows not how to mention the worthieſt man alive,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:114876:68"/>
                  <hi>if of a different judgment, without contempt;</hi> which he concludes with this ſmart Expreſſion, <hi>that rather then you will not fight, you would contend with your own ſhaddow.</hi> Which ſaid, he calls me a <hi>Bird of the ſame feather,</hi> makes me to <hi>take my flight from the Angel in Ivy-lane,</hi> intitles it to no ſmall <hi>wonder that a Doctor in Divinity ſhould ſo unworthily handle a Reverend Perſon,</hi> (it is the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he means) and finally declares, that a Book of mine had <hi>received the deſert of its bitterneſs, in being burnt</hi> (for ſo he ſaith he was informed) <hi>by the hand of the Hangman.</hi> But let not theſe vinegar expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be a trouble to you, which I aſſure you ſtirre not me, who have long learnt with him in the old Hiſtorian, <hi>civili animo laceratam exiſtimationem ferre,</hi> to bear with an undiſturbed mind, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Calumnies which either the tongues or pens of malitious men can lay upon me.</p>
               <p>3. For though this provocation might have been ſufficient to have awakened one of a duller ſpirit, yet I reſolved to ſleep on ſtill, and lookt no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe on this paſſage then as the inconſiderable <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſme</hi> of an <hi>Idle Dream.</hi> I had before reſolved not to put my hand to any controverſie in which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> was concerned, and ſo far ſatisfied Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the not burning of the Book, that I conceived all further anſwer to that ſcandalous charge, to be altogether as unneceſſary as the Charge was falſe. In ſatisfying him I ſhould have ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>4. But long I had not lain in this quiet ſlumber,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114876:68"/>
when I was rouzed by your Letter of <hi>March</hi> 8. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me of a ſecond Edition of that Book; in which I did not bear a part in the <hi>Prologue</hi> only, as in that before, nor was made one of the Actors only in the body <hi>Tragi-Comedy,</hi> but that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the whole <hi>Epilogue</hi> was of my miſtakings: All which I could have ſlept out alſo, if the ſame Letter had not directed me to page 23, 24. where I ſhould find a paſſage to this effect, viz. <hi>That</hi> Dr. Holland <hi>had turned</hi> Dr. Laud (the moſt Renowned Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury) out of the Schools with diſgrace, for but endeavouring to maintain, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops differed in order, not only in Degree from inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Presbyters.</hi> A ſon of <hi>Craeſus</hi> which was dumb from his very birth could find a tongue, when he perceived his Father in danger of death, whom no extremity of his own might poſſibly have forced on ſo great a Miracle: And therefore I conceive, that it will not be looked upon in me as a matter of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie, that the Diſhonour done to ſo great a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, who in his time was one of the Fathers of this Church, and the chief amongſt them, ſhould put me to a Reſolution of breaking thoſe bonds of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which had before reſtrain'd me from advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in my own behalfe. I was not willing howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to engage my ſelf too raſhly with an unknown Adverſary, without endeavouring further to inform my ſelf in his Grounds or Reaſons. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I thought it moſt agreeable to the ingenuity which I had ſhown to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> on the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to let him ſee how ſenſible I was of the injury done unto my ſelf, and the indignity offered to the fame of ſo great a Perſon, before I would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the righting of my ſelf, or the vindicating of

It was not long before I conſulted the place; in which I found mention, that a Book of mine had <hi>received the deſert of its bitterneſs, in being burnt by the hand of the publique Hangman.</hi> It ſeems you were ſo zealous in laying a Reproach upon me, that you ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not whether it were true or falſe: It was thought a ſufficient warrant to you, that you were informed ſo, without any further enquiring after it: Which pains if you would pleaſe to take, you might have learned, that though ſuch a thing was much endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, yet it was not effected, <hi>i. e.</hi> that it went no further then noiſe and fame, which ſerved to ſome inſtead of all other proofs. I was advertiſed yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day by ſeveral Letters, that the Book is come to a ſecond Edition, in which you have not only made bold with me (which I can eaſily contemn) but have laid a fouler Reproach on the Late Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in being <hi>diſgracefully turn'd out of the Schools by</hi> Dr. Holland. But Sir, however you may pleaſe to deal with ſuch a poor fellow as I am, you ought to have carried a greater Reverence towards a Prelate of ſuch eminent Parts, and Place, whoſe Memory is more precious amongſt all that love the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then to ſuffer it to be

I might have learned by my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that there was nothing to be gained by ſuch civilities, but one reproach upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, men of that ſpirit being generally for <hi>quod ſcripſi ſcripſi</hi> (as we know who was) ſeldome accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to retract or qualify what they once had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: But as my own ingenuity invited me to write the firſt, ſo to the ſending of the ſecond, I was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a manner by the <hi>Juſtificator,</hi> pag. 15. where he complains, that you, M. <hi>Peirce,</hi> did <hi>not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to purge the peccant humor by a private Letter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you made the paſſionate adventure, of calling him obſtinate:</hi> This made me not without ſome thoughts, that a private Letter might prevail upon ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who deſired not to be accounted obſtinate in his own opinions; from which modeſty I might col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a probable hope, that he would not perſevere in any error when he was once convinced of it, but rather make amends to truth, and reparation to the parties which were injured by him: The leaſt I could expect (if he vouchſaft me any anſwer) was to learn the name or names of thoſe, by whom the yong man

There is an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons ſtill in force, commanding that all Books of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion yours is of, ſhould be ſeized, and publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burnt. 2. It was commonly noiſed, that your Book againſt the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally burned. 3. I proceeded not barely upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

report, but had my intelligence from one of no mean employment, who hath his conſtant reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at <hi>White Hall;</hi> and I am pretty confident your Book had been <hi>de facto</hi> ſo diſgraced, if the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death of the late Protector, had not put the Privy counſel upon minding matters of higher concernment. And will you now ſay that I was ſo <hi>zealous in</hi> faſtening a <hi>reproach upon you,</hi> that I <hi>cared not whether it were true or falſe.</hi> You have in your own Books printed many matters of fact, with more confidence, for which you cannot pretend ſo much ground. 2. You charge me that I have made <hi>bold</hi> with you in my ſecond Edition, <hi>Novum crimen &amp; ante haee tempora inauditum:</hi> You had in your <hi>Examen Historicum</hi> beſtowed ſome ugly words up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Colledge, never to mentioned without honour and I, by a true relating the whole buſineſs, againſt which you ſo much exclaim, labour to vindicate the credit of the Society, and for this I muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>bold:</hi> Who can help it? 3. You charge me for <hi>laying</hi> a <hi>fouler reproach on the late Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury,</hi> becauſe I intimate, <hi>that he was diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully turned out of the Divinity Schooles by Dr.</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and for this you ſay, <hi>I would be troubled to produce my Author:</hi> It may be you and I are not agreed what it is to be diſgracefully turned out of the Schools; but if this be it, to be publiquely checkt for a <hi>ſeditious perſon,</hi> who would <hi>unchurch</hi> the Proteſtant Churches beyond the Sea, and ſow diviſion betwixt us and them, by a novel <hi>Popiſh Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> You cannot ſure think, that it will be any trouble to me to produce my Author: For you cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and therefore I preſume have read M. <hi>Prinne's Breviate,</hi> in which all this is extant <hi>totidem verbis;</hi>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:114876:72"/>
That Author having laid ſuch a charge, and none of the Arch-Biſhops friends having all this while plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>not guilty,</hi> I might take it <hi>pro Confeſſo:</hi> yet I muſt tell you, M. <hi>Prinne</hi>'s is not the onely Ground on which I proceed, though what my other Grounds be I ſhall not declare, till I well underſtand what uſe you intend to make of my Letters.</p>

The Deſign of the Hiſtorical part of my Book, is to prove that till Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> ſat in the Saddle, our Divines of prime Note, and Authority, did in the Five points deliver themſelves conſonantly to the determinations of the <hi>Synod of Dort;</hi> and that they were enjoyn'd Recantation, who were known either to Broach or Print that which now is called <hi>Arminianiſm:</hi> Can any one deny this?

firſt taking notice of the <hi>Proverb, Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Birds which defile their own neſts,</hi> as he thinks I do.

had I beſtowed any <hi>ugly words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>15. Let us next ſee whether the <hi>Braſier</hi> or the <hi>Tinker,</hi> make the fouleſt work. The <hi>Tinker</hi> charges it no farther then to be a <hi>Tradition,</hi> that ſome conſiderable ſumme of Mony had been left by the Founder, for the ends there mentioned. The <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier</hi> hath produced a <hi>Statute</hi> for it, to which all thoſe of that Society ought to take their Oath, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in excuſing them of <hi>Rapine,</hi> he condemns
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114876:76"/>
them of <hi>perjury.</hi> The <hi>Tinker</hi> takes no notice of any but the Fellows who had the diviſion of the ſpoil, of no more then thirty double <hi>Piſtolets</hi> to every Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and of no greater Exchange for every Piſtolet then 16 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> In which particulars he had as good intelligence as ſome Friends whom he imploy'd in the Enquiry, could return unto him. The <hi>Braſier</hi> acknowledges, that every <hi>Piſtolet</hi> was exchanged for 18 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> at the leaſt, ſome of them for 19 <hi>s.</hi> and ſome for 20 <hi>s.</hi> that every fellow had 33 peeces for his ſingle ſhare, and that the booty was ſo Rich, that even the <hi>under graduate Choriſters</hi> had their part therein; Which as it makes the crime the greater, and the more diffuſive, ſo is the guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of increaſed by the Diſtribution. The <hi>Tinker</hi> ſaith as he was inform'd, that the <hi>Old Doctor</hi> had no fewer then 100 peeces for his part of the ſpoil, of which the <hi>Braſier</hi> doth aſſure us, that little juſtice, if <hi>not great injuſtice</hi> hath been done her in it. How ſo? becauſe ſaith he, <hi>That he firſt denyed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. For taking the Gold out of the Tower.</hi> Secondly, Becauſe the <hi>Doctor, ſaid once at a publick meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> That <hi>all mony muſt be reſtored.</hi> And 3. becauſe he continued in the <hi>ſame minde, when he lay on his death bed.</hi> All which might be, or might not be, 'tis no matter which; and yet he might have no fewer then 100 of thoſe peeces for his part of the ſpoil; which with ſo little <hi>juſtice</hi> or great injuſtice is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. If any General Reſtitution hath been made of the Money, it was well done of them that did it, of which as I never heard before, (D. <hi>Croſs</hi> excepted) ſo I am glad to hear it now; though if the ſumme ſhould be made up it will not be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with ſuch care and conſcience, as in former

                     <p>19. In the next charge I cannot ſeperate my own intereſt from that of the right Reverend Father in God, D. <hi>William Burlow,</hi> once Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> though there be ſomewhat in it which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my ſelf, and ſome which relates only to that Reverend Prelate. In reference to my ſelf alone, he tells me in his ſecond Letter, That though he will not <hi>cenſure me to have no ingenuity,</hi> yet I muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him <hi>if he refuſe to give me any account of that particular,</hi> which I conceived by <hi>vertue of a promiſe</hi> he was bound to give me: Where you may ſee, that though he will not <hi>cenſure me to have no ingenuity,</hi> yet he doth not grant me to have any; which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a negative or a privative condemnation, I leave to be diſputed at the next encounter in the School of Complement. And ſecondly, you may ſee what ſhifts he hath to avoid the ſatisfying of the debt, which he cannot pay, but by putting ſuch Conditions on me as are not to be found in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation: I am charged alſo in the Book, for <hi>laſhing the Church Hiſtorians for any expreſſion that is in the leaſt favorable to the poor</hi> Puritans (as he calls them) of which let him that feels the ſmart ſeek out for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. That which concerns me in relation to Biſhop <hi>Burlow,</hi> is my acquitting him from ſhewing any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, in ſumming up the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court; a matter never charged upon him by the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction, more then twenty years after his death, and more then thirty years after the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Book; which as the Church Hiſtorian ſaith, to have been complained of, ſo doth he only
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114876:79"/>
ſay, not prove it; and affirmations or complaints are no legal evidences, where there are any reaſons of ſtrength to evince the contrary; but what he wants ſhall be ſupplied by the <hi>Antagoniſt;</hi> who fearing to be prevented in it, puts the beſt legg for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, crying out with more haſt then good ſpeed, <hi>That he will Anſwer the Doctor:</hi> Admit him to his Anſwer, and he will tell us, <hi>That the times were evil, that the prudent did think themſelves obliged to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and that God did ſo order the matter, that they loſt no credit by a quiet committing their cauſe to him.</hi> How ſo? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) D. Burlow <hi>lying on his death bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did with grief complain of the wrong which he had done to</hi> D. Reynolds, <hi>and others that joyned with him in that conference.</hi> If this be prooved, we will admit of all the reſt; but if this be not proved, all the reſt is nothing: <hi>And for the proof of this he is able</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>to give a ſatisfactory account to any perſon of ingenuity, who deſires it of him:</hi> I would have took him at his word, deſiring earneſtly to be ſatisfied in the truth thereof, preſuming that I might lay claim to ſo much ingenuity, as would entitle me to a capacity of obtaining that favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. But in this point I reckoned without my hoſt; for though I preſſed my deſire ſo far, as to conclude <hi>that if he did not gratifie me with an Anſwer, I ſhould think he could not;</hi> yet I am ſtil as far from ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as at firſt I was: I muſt firſt gratifie him, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering ſuch demands as he puts unto me, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the cauſe in hand, and ſuch as the nature of the point in iſſue cannot bind me too, by any Rule of Diſputation in the Schools of <hi>Logick,</hi> or elſe the evidence deſired muſt not be produced. I gave ſome reaſon why I was not willing to name the parties
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114876:79"/>
who received or paid the penſion, given by Biſhop <hi>Williams<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> towards the maintenance of a Scholer; two of the parties to my knowledg, and the third for any thing I know to the contrary, being ſtill alive otherwiſe I could not only name the men, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the acquittance. And for the words relating to Biſhop <hi>Prideaux,</hi> they were ſpoke at a great Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Court in the hearing of many; and being ſpoken in the Court, muſt refer only to ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons as were preached at the Court, and not to all which had been preached elſwhete, by that learned Biſhop: The Sermons will be ſhortly publiſhed, if not done already, and will be able to ſpeak as much for themſelves, as can be deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed of me to do. The witneſs in the cauſe touching Biſhop <hi>Burlow,</hi> may appear ſecurely, without drawing danger to himſelf, and will be heard, no Queſtion, both with love and freedom: For if he be a lover of the <hi>Engliſh Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Liturgie, and Ceremonies,</hi> who is to atteſt unto this truth, I know of none who can refuſe to give credit to it; but if he take up the report at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from one who told him that he took it from the Doctors mouth, and not from the man himſelf that ſpake it, his witneſs may be lyable to juſt exception, and then we are but as we were, without proof at all. He vaunts it ſomewhere in his Book, That he is furniſhed with <hi>a cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his cauſe againſt you; but in this point, and the next that follows, his <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are all in <hi>a cloud</hi> (ſhadowed as <hi>Aeneas</hi> and his followers were from the ſight of <hi>Dido</hi>) ſo that no mortal eye can ſee them. <hi>Et idem eſt non eſſe et non apparere,</hi> was the Rule of old.</p>
                     <p>21. Upon no better grounds then this, he lays a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114876:80"/>
fouler reproach on the late moſt Reverend and ſtill Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as <hi>being turned out of the Divinity Schools with diſgrace by</hi> D. Holland, <hi>in publi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cis, commitiis, for but endaevouring to maintain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Biſhops differed in order, and not in degree only, from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Presbiters.</hi> I reproved him for this in my firſt Letter, and told him how much he would be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>to produce his Author;</hi> he ſhifted it off, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he means no otherwiſe by being <hi>turned out of the Schooles with diſgrace,</hi> then that he was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely checkt by the ſaid D. <hi>Holland,</hi> for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid opinion; and having M. <hi>Prinnes Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> for the truth of this, he thinks it a ſufficient proof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo to confirm the other: but is it poſſible that any man, who pretends but to a grain of ingenuity or learning, ſhould dare to lay ſo baſe a calumnie on ſo great a perſon, and hope to ſalve the matter by ſuch a ridiculous explication, as may juſtly render him contemptible to the ſillieſt School-boy: Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly if he received a publique check, be that ſame with being diſgracefully turned out of the Schools, there muſt be more turned out of the Schools with as much diſgrace, becauſe as much reprehended and checkt as he, of whom the fouleſt mouth could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver raiſe ſo leud a ſlander. The Doctor of the <hi>Chair</hi> in the Divinity Schools at <hi>Oxon,</hi> would be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in his deciſions and determinations, were this once allowed of, then all the Popes that ever ſate in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, ſince they firſt laid claim to it.</p>
                     <p>22. But he goes on, and adds that this diſgrace was put upon him, for maintaining ſuch a <hi>novel Popiſh Poſition,</hi> as that before. Not Novel I am ſure: for the ancient Writers call the ſolemn form of conſecrating a Biſhop by no other name then that of <hi>Ordinatio</hi>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:114876:80"/>
                        <hi>Epiſcopi;</hi> and if the Biſhop at his Conſecration doth receive no <hi>Order,</hi> his conſecration ought not to be ſtyled an Ordination. And if it be not <hi>Novel,</hi> then it is not <hi>Popiſh,</hi> (for <hi>id verum quod pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> as they Father it) unleſſe he will be pleaſed to make <hi>Popery Primitive,</hi> and intitle it to the Eldeſt times of Chriſtianity. But <hi>Popiſh</hi> if it needs muſt be, then muſt the Form of Conſecration of Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. be accounted <hi>Popiſh,</hi> for which it ſtands acquitted by the Book of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and the two Parliaments of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> muſt be <hi>Popiſh</hi> alſo, by which that Form of Conſecration was confirmed and Ratified. Twice in the Preface to the Book, we find mention of three Orders, of Miniſters in the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and this diſtinction made as antient as the very times of the Apoſtles. And in the Book it ſelfe, beſides the three diſtinct forms of Ordination; the one for <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the other for <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and the third for <hi>Deacons,</hi> in one of the Prayers uſed at the Conſecrating of a Biſhop, it is diſtinctly called an Order; all w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he could not chuſe but ſee in that very Chapter of the Book called, <hi>Reſpondit Petrus,</hi> in which he finds me queſtioning the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> Iudgement, touching the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of Redemption by the death of Chriſt.

And a ſquint eye he caſts on ſome body for a <hi>Temporizer, whoſe deſign it was to ingratiate himſelf with great ones, and could complement a Prince ſo highly, as to ſtyle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his Creature, and the workmanſhip of his hands.</hi> But who it is whom he ſo decyphereth, or whether he means any one man or not, but onely caſts abroad his cenſures (as Boyes throw their ſtones) without any proper aim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or object but the love of the ſport; I am not able to find out, in my beſt remembrance. Paſſing by therefore ſuch <hi>Aenigma</hi>'s as I cannot unriddle, I muſt needs take notice, how he applyes the Character to him, of which <hi>Iſidore Peluſi.</hi>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:114876:81"/>
gives unto one <hi>Euſebus</hi> a wretched fellow of thoſe times, and one who took upon himſelf the name and office of a Biſhop; The Character to be found in the 24. Epiſtle, of his ſecond Book; and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle recommended to my diligent Reading.</p>

He tells me that the Character contained therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth two well ſuit with the Arch-Biſhop; but I find it otherwiſe. <hi>Euſebius</hi> (as the Author tells us) would not know the difference between the Temple and the Church, between the place of the Aſſembly, and the Congregation; ſparing no coſt to build, repair, and beautifie the one; but vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſquieting and expelling the righteous ſoul, to many of which, he had given great matter of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or ſcandal, <hi>dum multis offendiculis cauſam prebet, probos viros expellere,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame he flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth over again in the following words, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with this Obſervation, That in the Primitive times when there were no Temples, the Church was plentifully adorned with all heavenly Graces; but that in his time the Temples were adorned beyond Moderation; <hi>Eccleſia vero, Canviciis &amp; Cavillis in ceſſitur,</hi> but the poor Church reproached and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled upon all occaſions, ſuch is the Character which <hi>Iſidore</hi> gives to this <hi>Euſebus.</hi> But that this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſhould <hi>ſuit too well</hi> with the late Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, is a greater ſcandal then ever <hi>Euſebus</hi> gave to the weak brethren of the Church of <hi>Peluſium.</hi> For will your Adverſary confine the Church (as ſome wild <hi>Affricans</hi> did of old) <hi>intra partem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,</hi> within the Conventicles and Clancular meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction?

He tells me there, that in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical part of his diſcourſe he hath proved, that till D. <hi>Laud ſat</hi> in the Saddle, <hi>our Divines of prime Note and Authority did, in the five points, deliver themſelves conſonantly to the determination of the</hi> Synod <hi>of</hi> Dort, <hi>and that they were enjoyned Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>

But firſt if we allow this for a good and ſufficient Argument, it will ſerve as ſtrongly for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt all thoſe who laboured in the Reformation. For what one point do we maintain againſt thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> in which the <hi>Divines of prime Note and Authority</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did not deliver themſelves as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonantly</hi> to the preceding Doctrines of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there, and to the ſubſequent determinations of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> and for oppoſing which manner of Perſons, were conſtrained to a <hi>Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who either preacht or printed in defence of that which is now called Proteſtantiſm.</hi> And 2dly, if we behold the conſtitution of our Univerſity, when D. <hi>Humphrys</hi> a moderate <hi>non-conformiſt</hi> (but a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt</hi> howſoever) as M. <hi>Fuller</hi> is pleaſed to call him, poſſeſt the Divinity Chaire, for almoſt forty years; and D. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> a Rigid <hi>non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> publiquely read a Divinity Lecture, founded by Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi> (the principal Patron of the Sect) as you will find in the beginning of his Lectures on the Books <hi>Apocriphal;</hi> it is no marvail if we find that the Doctrine and Diſcipline of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> ſhould be ſo generally received by the Students there; or being ſo generally received, that they ſhould put all manner of diſgraces upon all or any of thoſe that opined the contrary.

                     <p>25. I have already written, a full diſcourſe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon what Principles and Poſitions, the Church of <hi>England</hi> did proceed at her firſt Reformation. But this being deſigned as an Ingredient to a larger work now almoſt finiſhed, I muſt not wrong that work ſo far, as to make uſe of it at the preſent, and therefore you muſt needs have patience till a further time. In the mean ſeaſon I ſhall endeavour an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all thoſe Arguments, which your Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hath made uſe of to evince the point he chiefly aims at; leaving the <hi>poſitivity</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> to your abler hand. Where by the way give me leave to tell you, that one who ſeems to wiſh me well, though known no further to me then by the firſt Letters of his name, ſignified in his Letter to me of the 3d. of <hi>March,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> was not the <hi>Author,</hi> but the <hi>Compiler</hi> of the Book, which is now before us, having <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> (as he was <hi>credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly informed</hi>) which the Univerſity could afford him.

Thirdly, taking it for granted that they maintain'd the ſame opinions in theſe points which afterwards were held forth by <hi>Calvin,</hi> yet they maintained them not as any points of Proteſtant Doctrine in oppoſition to the Errors
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:114876:85"/>
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but as received opinions of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Friars, in oppoſition to the <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans;</hi> the doctrine of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> by reaſon of their diligent Preaching, being more generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <hi>England</hi> then that of the other. Fourthly, it is to be conſidered that the name of <hi>Luther</hi> at that time was in high eſtimation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the firſt man which brake the Ice, and made the way more eaſie for the reſt that followed; who concurring in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> as to theſe particulars, drew after him the greateſt part of ſuch learned men as began to fall off from the Pope. And ſo it ſtood till <hi>Melancthon</hi> (not underſervedly called the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix of</hi> Germany) by moderating the rigours of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and carrying on the Reformation with a gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier hand, became a pattern unto thoſe who had the firſt managing of that great work in the Reign of King <hi>Edward.</hi> Fiftly, it is Recorded in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> that the blind man whom our Saviour at <hi>Bethſaida</hi> reſtored to ſight, at the firſt opening of his eyes <hi>ſaw men, as trees walking,</hi> v. 24. that is to ſay, that he ſaw men walking as trees; <hi>quaſi dicat homines quos ambulantes video, non homines ſed arbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res mihi videntur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> as we read in <hi>Maldonate.</hi> By which words the blind man declared (ſaith he) <hi>ſo quidem videre aliquid, cum ante nihil videret, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecte tamen videre, cum inter homines &amp; arbores diſtinguere non poſſet.</hi> More briefly <hi>Eſtius</hi> on the place, <hi>Nondum ita clare &amp; perfecte video, ut diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere poſſim inter homines &amp; arbores;</hi> I diſcern ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſaid the poor man, but ſo imperfectly, that I am not able to diſtinguiſh betwixt trees and men.

Darkneſs, who not being able to diſcern all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths at the firſt opening of the eyes of their underſtanding, were not to be a Rule or precedent to thoſe that followed, and lived in clearer times, and under a brighter beam of illumination then the others did.</p>
                     <p>28. In the third place he referres himſelf to our <hi>Articles, Homilies, Liturgies,</hi> and <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> for the proof of this, that the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> opinions were the eſtabliſh'd doctrines of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and if his proof holds good in this he hath gained the cauſe. But firſt he directs us to no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place in the <hi>Catechiſms, Homilies,</hi> or <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> where any ſuch matter may be found, but keeps himſelf aloof, and in <hi>generals</hi> only; and we know who it was that ſaid, <hi>Doloſus verſatur in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But firſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have obſerved two Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the one under King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. which they called the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and the other under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which they called the <hi>Calvinian.</hi> And thereupon we may conclude
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114876:86"/>
that the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article, as well as any of the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing framed, approved, and ratified under <hi>Edward</hi> 6. was modelled rather in relation to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> then <hi>Calvinian</hi> doctrines; the <hi>Reformers</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors, holding more cloſely to the Rules of Antiquity, and the practiſe of the Primitive Church, then the <hi>Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> were obſerved to do. Secondly, The 17th. Article doth viſibly preſuppoſe <hi>a curſe</hi> or ſtate of Damnation in which all Mankind was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the ſight of God, which overthrows the Doctrine of the <hi>Supra-lapſarians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In the laſt place we are to note, that there is a clauſe in the end of the Article, viz. <hi>that we are to receive Gods promiſes in ſuch wiſe as they be generally ſet forth to us in holy Scripture;</hi> then which nothing can be more contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſarians,</hi> which reſtrains Election unto life to few particulars without reſpect had to their <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Chriſts</hi> death for them; and extendeth the Decree of <hi>Reprobation</hi> to the far greateſt part of Manking without relation to their incredulity or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. And though your adverſary tells us, that he who <hi>reads the common Prayer Book with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind, cannot chuſe but obſerve divers paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which make for a perſonall and eternal Election;</hi> yet I find but little ground for the affirmation, the Promiſes of God as they are <hi>generally</hi> ſet forth unto us in Holy Scripture, being the ground of many Prayers and Paſſages in the Publique <hi>Liturgie;</hi> for in the General Confeſſion it is ſaid expreſly that <hi>the Promiſes of God, in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi> (not to this or that man particularly) but to <hi>all mankind;</hi> declared to <hi>all,</hi> becauſe firſt made to <hi>all mankind in</hi> Adam, in the promiſe of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the <hi>ſeed of the woman,</hi> Gen. 3. 15.

Can your Antagoniſt read this Prayer, and obſerve thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and think the Liturgy ſo contradictory to it ſelf, as to afford him any proof, that ſuch a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Election from all Eternity, as an <hi>unprejudiced mind</hi> may deſire to meet with. If not, why doth he talk ſo confidently of divers paſſages which a careful Reader cannot chuſe but obſerve in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer Book which enclines that way; yea, let him direct us to thoſe paſſages, and reconcile the differences which he finds betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>30. And though it was not my intent to produce any arguments at this time in Juſtification of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by you maintained; yet ſince your Adverſary ſtands ſo much on the 17th. Article, and thinks it makes ſo ſtrongly for defence of the <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> I will here lay down the Judgment of two Godly Martyrs, who had a chief hand in the Great Work of this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and therefore muſt needs know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church therein more then any of us. The firſt of theſe ſhall be Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> who in the Preface to his Expoſition on the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath expreſly told us, <q>That <hi>Cain</hi> was no more excluded from the Promiſe of Chriſt, till he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:114876:88"/>
excluded himſelf, then <hi>Abel, Saul,</hi> then <hi>David, Judas,</hi> then <hi>Peter, Eſau</hi> then <hi>Jacob;</hi> that God is ſaid to have hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> not becauſe he was diſ-inherited of Eternal Life, but in laying his <hi>Mountains and his Heritage waſte for the Dragons of the Wilderneſs,</hi> Mal. 1. 3. that the threatnings of God againſt <hi>Eſau</hi> (if he had not of his own wilful malice excluded himſelf from the Promiſe of Grace) ſhould no more have hindred his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation then Gods threatnings againſt <hi>Nineve,</hi> &amp;c. That it is not a Chriſtian mans part to ſay that God hath written Fatal Laws as the <hi>Stoick,</hi> and with neceſſity of deſtiny violently pulleth the one by the hair into Heaven, and thruſteth the other headlong into Hell, that the cauſe of Rejection or Damnation is Sin in man, which will not bear neither receive the Promiſes of the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> And ſecondly we ſhall find Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> in his Sermon on the third Sunday after the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> ſpeaking in this manner, viz. <q>That if the moſt are damned the fault is not in God but in themſelves; For, <hi>Deus vult omnes homines ſalvos fieri,</hi> God would that all men ſhould be ſaved; but they themſelves procure their own Damnation, and deſpiſe the paſſion of Chriſt by their own wicked and inordinate living.</q> He telleth us alſo in his fourth Sermon preached in <hi>Lincoln ſhire,</hi> 
                        <q>That Chriſt only, and no man elſe, merited Remiſſion, Juſtification, and ſound felicity for as many as will believe the ſame; that Chriſt ſhed as much blood for <hi>Judas,</hi> as for <hi>Peter;</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> believed, and therefore was ſaved; that <hi>Judas</hi> did not believe, and therefore was condemned; the fault being in him only and in no body elſe.</q> More to which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114876:88"/>
purpoſe I have elſewhere noted (as afore was ſaid) and give you this only for a taſt to ſtay your ſtomack. And though Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> the principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect in the work, ſpent his endeavours chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> yet that moſt holy Martyr tells us ſomewhat in his fifth Book againſt <hi>Gardiner, fol.</hi> 372. which doth directly look this way. Where ſpeaking of the ſacrifice which was made by Chriſt, he lets us know, <q>That he took unto himſelf not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their ſinnes that many years before were dead, and put their truſt in him; but alſo all the ſinnes of thoſe, that until his coming again, <hi>ſhould truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Goſpel,</hi> ſo that now we may look for no other Prieſt nor ſacrifice to take away our ſins, but onely him and his ſacrifice; that as his dying once was offered for all, ſo as much as pertained unto him, he took all mens ſinnes unto himſelf.</q>  In all which paſſages, and many others of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the other two: there is not any thing which makes for ſuch a perſonal, abſolute, and irreverſible decree of Predeſtination, as <hi>Calvin</hi> hath commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us; and therefore no ſuch meaning in the 17th. Article, as his Diſciples and adherents (in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of themſelves, and their opinions) would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon it. For if there were, your Adverſary muſt give me ſome better Reaſon then I think he can, why <hi>Cranmer, Ridly, Hooper,</hi> and the reſt that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in this Reformation, ſhould command the Paraphraſes of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> to be tranſlated into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, ſtudied by Prieſts, and ſo kept in Pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be read by the People, whoſe Doctrines are ſo contrary in all theſe particulars to that of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and his followers.</p>

But I return again unto your Adverſary, who in the next place remembreth us of a Catechiſm, publiſhed by <hi>John Poynet</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> which he ſets forth with many circumſtances to indear it to us; as <hi>namely, that it was publick in the next year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the paſſing of the Book of Articles in the Reign of K.</hi> Edw. 2dly. <hi>That being by that King commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the peruſal of certain Biſhops; it was by thoſe Biſhops certified to be agreeable to the Scriptures, and Statutes of the Realm. and</hi> 3dly, <hi>That upon this Certificate</hi> the <hi>King prefixt his Royal Epiſtle before it, charging their moral Schoolmaſters within his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, that diligently and carefully they ſhould teach the ſame.</hi> Thus have we ſeen the <hi>Mountain,</hi> now comes out the <hi>Mouſe;</hi> for having thus ſwelled our expectation, we had reaſon to look for ſome great matter but finde none at all. Inſtead of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down ſome clear paſſages out of <hi>Poynets</hi> Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, which might evince the point he aims at: he asks the Queſtion, (anſwer him any man that dares) <hi>How do the Maſter and the Scholar plainly declare themſelves to be no friends to any of the Tenents M.</hi> P <hi>contends for?</hi> A Queſtion which a very well ſtudied man may not eaſily anſwer, that Catechiſm being ſo hard to come by, that ſcarce one Scholar in 500. hath ever heard of it, and hardly one of a thouſand hath ever ſeen it. But your <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> hath good reaſon for what he doth, there being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in that Catechiſm, which more confirms the points M. <hi>Pierce</hi> contends for then he is willing to make known, witneſs this Paſſage of the Catechiſm in the <hi>Anti-Arminianiſm</hi> (from which your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary makes the greatſt parts of his proofs &amp; evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)

After the Lord God</hi> (faith the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm) <hi>had made the Heaven, Earth he determined to have for himſelf a moſt beautiful Kingdom and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commonwealth. The Apoſtles and ancient Fathers that wrote in Greek, called</hi> it Eccleſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are in this faith ſtedfaſt were fore-choſen, prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and appointed to everlaſting life before the world was made.</hi> For though he ſeems to make ſuch onely to be the members of the Church, as were predeſtinated unto life from all Eternity, yet we muſt underſtand it of them chiefly (as being the moſt Excellent Members of it) not of them alone: For afterwards he enlargeth the acception of the word <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> according to the natural and proper conſtruction of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> telling <hi>us that the Church is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of thoſe who are</hi> called <hi>to eternal life by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> The company of <hi>all</hi> thoſe which are <hi>called</hi> to Eternal life, and therefore not of thoſe onely which are choſen or elected out of the number; <hi>For many are called but few are choſen,</hi> ſaith our Lord and Saviour. Secondly, it is not ſaid, that ſuch as are Members of this Church were <hi>choſen</hi> to this end and purpoſe, that they might be <hi>ſtedfaſt in the Faith,</hi> and being <hi>ſtedfaſt in the faith,</hi> might in the end ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:114876:90"/>
everlaſting life; but that being <hi>ſtedfaſt in the faith,</hi> that is to ſay conſidered and beheld as ſuch in the eternal Preſcience, or fore-knowledge of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, they were predeſtinate and appointed to eternal life before the beginning of the world. And Thirdly, if theſe words or any other which he finds in <hi>Poynet,</hi> may be drawn to any other conſtruction, which may ſerve his turn, he muſt be made to ſpeak contrary, to the three Godly Biſhops and Martyrs before remembred, who being men of greater age and more experience in the affairs of the Church, the chief Architects in the Great work of Reformation, &amp; withal being three for one, are more to be relyed on for delivering the true ſence of the Church, then any one ſingle witneſs who ſpeaks o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of it. 31. For whom ſpeaks <hi>Poynet</hi> in this place, for M. <hi>Peirce</hi> or Mr. <hi>Hickman?</hi> If he had ſpoke for M. <hi>Hickman,</hi> we ſhovld have heard of it more at large, as in that which followeth out of <hi>Nowel;</hi> and if he do not ſpeak for him, it muſt ſpeak for you more plainly, ſpeak the Anſwers unto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Queſtions, to which M. <hi>Prinne</hi> directs him in the end of the Bible Printed by <hi>Robert Barker, Anno</hi> 1607. But the worſt is they ſignifie nothing to the purpoſe which they were produced for. For I would fain know by what Authority thoſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Anſwers were added to the end of that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? If by Authority, and that ſuch Authority can be proved, the Argument will be of force which is taken from them; and then no queſtion but the ſame Authority, by which they were placed there at the firſt, would have preſerved them in that place for a longer time then during the ſale of that Edition.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:114876:90"/>
The not retaining them in ſuch Editions as have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſince, ſhow plainly that they were of no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in themſelves, nor intended by the Church as a Rule to others; and being of no older ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then the year 1608. they muſt needs ſeem as deſtitute of Antiquity as they are of Authority. So that upon the whole matter your Adverſary hath limited me with a very ſtrong argument, that they were foyſted in by the fraud and practiſe of ſome Emiſſaries, of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, who hoped to have them paſs in time for Canonical Scripture, ſuch <hi>piae Fraudes,</hi> as theſe are, we have too many, were thoſe once allowed of; ſome prayers, were alſo added at the end of the Bible in ſome Editions, and others at the End of the publick Liturgie; which being neglected at the firſt and afterwards beheld as the authorized prayer of the Church, were by command left out of thoſe Books and Bibles, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Compoſitions of private men, not the Acts of the Church, and never ſince added as before.</p>
                     <p>32. In the next place it is ſaid, That <hi>the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the 39.

And ſecondly, it cannot rationally be inferred, from his being Prolocutor in that Convocation, and the knowledge which he needs muſt have of all things which were carried in it; that therefore nothing was concluded in that Convocation, which might be contrary to his own judgement as a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; admitting that he was inclinable to <hi>Calvin</hi> in the points diſputed, which I grant not neither. For had he been of his opinions, the ſpirit of that Sect is ſuch as could not be reſtrained from ſhowing it ſelf dogmatically, and in terms expreſs, and not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally onely, or upon the by; and that too in ſuch general terms, that no particular comfort for your Adverſary can be gathered from them.

To the Church do all they properly belong, as many as do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear, honour, and call upon God, altogether apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their minds to live holily and Godly, and with put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all their truſt in God, do moſt aſſuredly look for the bleſſings of Eternal life, they that be ſtedfaſt, ſtable and conſtant, in this faith, were choſen and appointed,</hi>

                        <hi>and (as we term it) predeſtinate to this ſo great feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi> The ſecond which follows not long after (as his Book directeth) is this that followeth, <hi>viz. The Church is the body of the Chriſtian Commonwealth,</hi> i. e. <hi>the univerſal number and fellowſhip of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whom God through Chriſt hath before all begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of time appointed to everlaſting life.</hi> And here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain we are to Note, that the Firſt of theſe two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages not being to be found in the Latine Edition, nor the Engliſh Tranſlation of the ſame, is taken almoſt word for word out of <hi>Poynets</hi> Catechiſm, and therefore to be underſtood in no other ſence then before it was: And that the ſecond makes the Church to conſiſt of none but the <hi>Elect,</hi> which the nine and tenth Article makes in a more comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſignification. So that to ſalve this ſore, he is fain to fly to the deſtinction of a <hi>viſible,</hi> and <hi>inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Church, fit for his definition unto that which he calls <hi>inviſible;</hi> making the viſible Church of Chriſt to conſiſt of ſuch as are aſſembled to hear the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt ſincerely taught, to call on God by prayer, and receive the Sacraments. Which perſons ſo aſſembled together, are by the Article called a <hi>Cong egation of faithful men,</hi> as well as thoſe which conſtitute and make up the Church <hi>inviſible.</hi> And yet I doubt your Adverſary will not not grant them all to be in the number of the Elect. But granting that the Church doth conſiſt of none but the Elect, that is to ſay, of none but ſuch who have been through Chriſt <hi>appointed to everlaſting life from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all time,</hi> as is there affirmed; yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all this, which juſtifieth the abſolute and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpective decree of the <hi>predeſtinarians, nothing</hi> of Gods invincible workings in the hearts of his choſen

Whereon a motion made by <hi>D. Reynolds,</hi> about <hi>falling from Grace,</hi> 
                        <q>The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (this very <hi>Bancroft</hi> whom we ſpeak of) took occaſion to ſignifie to his Majeſty, how very many in theſe days, neglecting holineſs of life, preſumed too much of perſiſting <hi>Grace.</hi> If I ſhall be ſaved, I ſhall be ſaved, which he tearmed a <hi>deſparate Doctrine,</hi> ſhewing it to be contrary to good <hi>Divinity,</hi> and the true Doctrine of Predeſtination: Wherein (ſaith he) we ſhould reaſon rather <hi>aſcendendo,</hi> then <hi>deſcendendo,</hi> thus; I live in obedience to God, in love with my neighbour, I follow my vocation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore I truſt that God hath elected me and predeſtinated me to ſalvation: Not thus, which is the uſual courſe of argument, God hath predeſtinated and choſen me to life, therefore though I ſin never ſo grievouſly, yet I ſhall not be damned:</q> for whom he once loveth, he loveth to the end; ſo little a friend was this great Pralate to the <hi>Calvinian Doctrine</hi> of Predeſtination, and perſiſting Grace.</p>
                     <p>37. But your Adverſary not content with this, hath found ſome proofs, as he conceives, That <hi>Bancroft</hi> hated that which he calls <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme like the ſhadow of death,</hi> he telleth us that in his time came out the Book called, <hi>The Faith, Religion, Doctrine, profeſſed in the Realm of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and Dominions thereof.</hi> In this as much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as in that before, that Book being publiſhed in the time of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift, Anno</hi> 1584, as he might have found in Mr. <hi>Fullers</hi> Church Hiſtory <hi>lib. 9 fol.</hi> 172. being twenty years almoſt before <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi> came to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and 12. at leaſt

he might have found upon further ſearch, that the meeting at <hi>Lambeth</hi> had been held on the 26th of <hi>November,</hi> 1595. that D. <hi>Richard Fleſher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> was then the Lord <hi>Elect</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and that D. <hi>Bancroft</hi> was not made Biſhop of that See, till the 8th of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1697.</p>

That which was moſt aimed at in thoſe times in the preferring men to the higheſt dignities of the Church and the chief places in the Vniverſities, was their zeal againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and ſuch a ſufficiency of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as might enable them to defend thoſe points, on which our ſeparation from <hi>Rome</hi> was to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the Queens intereſs moſt preſerved. The Popes ſupremacy &amp; the Maſs, with all the points and niceties which depended on it juſtification by faith the marriage of Prieſts, Purgatory, and the power of the civil Magiſtrate, were the points moſt agitated. And whoſoever appeared right in thoſe, and did withal declare himſelf againſt the corruptions of that Church in point of manners, was ſeldome or never looke into for his other opinions, until the Church began to find the ſad conſequents of it, in ſuch a general tendency to innovation both in doctrine and diſcipline as could not eaſily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be redreſſed.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114876:98"/>
Concerning which your Adverſary tells us many things which muſt be examined.</p>
                     <p>41. For firſt he tells us, that his <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> did not only <hi>loſe him from his place but loſt him the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the Univerſity. But I muſt tell him, that his <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> as he calls it, cauſed not the loſing of his place; for I am ſure he held his place till the expiring of the term, allowed by the Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> Statute, whoſe profeſſor he was; Which term expired, he left it in a juſt diſdain, of ſeeing himſelf ſo over-powered, and conſequently expoſed unto contempt and ſcorn, by the Arts of his Enemies. Secondly, If he loſt the affection of the univerſity, which is more then your Adverſary can make proof of, unleſs he mean it of that part of the univerſity onely which conſpired againſt him, yet gained he as much love in <hi>London,</hi> as he loſt in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> For dying there within few years after, it was ordered by Biſhop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> that moſt of the Divines in the City ſhould be preſent at his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which may be a ſufficient argument that not the Biſhop onely, but the moſt eminent Divines of <hi>London</hi> were either inclinable to his opinions, or not ſo much averſe from them, as not to give a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn attendance at the time of his Funeral. In the next place he quarrels with Biſhop <hi>Mountague</hi> of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> for ſaying that thoſe Articles were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forbid by Authority, and brings in M. <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, making himſelf angry</hi> with the Biſhop for the <hi>when</hi> and the <hi>where, thinking it ſtrange that a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition ſhould be conſpired ſo ſoftly that none but he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhould hear it.</hi> But firſt the Biſhop living in <hi>Cambridge</hi> at that time, might hear it amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114876:98"/>
others, though none but he were pleaſed to give notice of it, when it came in queſtion. And Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the noiſe thereof did ſpread ſo far, that it was heard into the Low Countries; the making of theſe Articles, the Queens diſpleaſure, when ſhe heard it, her ſtrict command to have them ſpeedily ſuppreſt, and the actual ſuppreſſion of them, being all laid down diſtinctly in a Book, publiſhed by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants of Holland</hi> Entituled, <hi>Neceſſaria Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio,</hi> and Printed at <hi>Leyden,</hi> 1618. almoſt ſeven years before the comming out of <hi>Mountague's</hi> Book.</p>
                     <p>42. And now I am fallen upon this Biſhop, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice of your adverſarys moſt unequal dealing againſt him and you; in his diſcrediting that part of your Argument, which contains K. <hi>James's</hi> Judgment of him, the incouragement he gave him to proceeed in his appeal, and his command to have it Dedicated unto him; to which you might have added, for further proof of the Kings concurring in opinion with him, that he had given him his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge or <hi>quietus eſt</hi> from all thoſe calumnies of his being a <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Arminian,</hi> which by the two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> had been charged upon him. And ſecondly, that the appeal being recommended by that King, to D. <hi>Fr. White,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Carliſle</hi> (exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cried up at that time, for his zeal againſt Popery) was by him licenſed to the Preſs, as containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſame, <hi>but what was agreeable to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith, Doctrine and Diſcipline, , eſtabliſhed in the Church of</hi> England. And whereas your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary doth not think, <hi>that the King ſhould command any Book, written by a private Subject to be Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> to himſelf (which to my knowledge is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114876:99"/>
not without examples) he doth not ſo much claſh with you, as put a lye into the mouth of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelate, from whoſe hand you took it. That Biſhop certainly muſt be a man of an unheard of and unparalleld impudence, in putting ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth on the King deceaſed, to gain no greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from the King then Raigning, then what of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe might have been preſumed on.</p>
                     <p>43. For other points, which are in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you upon this account, I leave them wholly to your ſelf, advertiſing you only of theſe two things; Firſt, that when King <hi>James</hi> publiſhed his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riſtius,</hi> in which there are ſo many bitter Expreſſions againſt <hi>Arminius, Bertius,</hi> and the reſt of that party, he was much governed by the Counſels of Dr. <hi>James Montague,</hi> who having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been a great ſtickler againſt <hi>Barnet</hi> and <hi>Baroe,</hi> in the ſtirrs at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was afterwards made <hi>Dean</hi> of the Chappel, Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and at laſt of <hi>Winton;</hi> an excellent Maſter in the art of inſinuations, and the Kings <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Favourite till the time of his death, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 19th. of <hi>July</hi> 1618. Secondly, that the Reaſon why King <hi>James</hi> ſo branded the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants in the Declaration, <hi>That if they were not with ſpeed rooted out, no other iſſue could be expected then the curſe of God, in making a perpetual rent and deſtruction in the whole body of the ſtate,</hi> pag. 39. was not becauſe they were ſo in and of themſelves, but for other Reaſons, which our great Maſters in the Schools of policy, called <hi>Reaſon of State.</hi> That King had ſaid as much as this comes too, of the Puritans of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whom in the ſecond Book of his <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon</hi>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:114876:99"/>
                        <hi>Doron, he calls the very peſts of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whom no deſerts can oblige, neither Oaths nor Promiſes bind, breathing nothing but ſedition and calumny,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Adviſing his Son Prince</hi> Henry <hi>then Heir of the Kingdom, not to ſuffer the Principles of them to brook his Land, if he liſt to ſit at reſt; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he would keep them for trying his patience, as</hi> Socrates <hi>did an evil wiſe.</hi> And yet I trow your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary will not grant, upon theſe expreſſions (though he might more warrantably do it in this caſe then he doth in the other) that <hi>Puritans</hi> are not to be ſuffered in a State or Nation, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch a State, which hath any mixture in it of Monarchical Government. Now the Reaſon of State which moved King <hi>James</hi> to ſo much harſhneſs againſt the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> or <hi>Arminians,</hi> call them which you will, was becauſe they had put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Patronage of <hi>John Olden Barnevelt,</hi> a man of principal authority in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whom the King looked upon as the profeſs'd Adverſary of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> his dear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate and Ally, who on the other ſide had made himſelf the Patron and Protector of the Rigid <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts.</hi> In favour of which Prince, that King did not only preſs <hi>the States to take heed of ſuch infected perſons,</hi> as he ſtiles them, <hi>which of neceſſiry would by little and little bring them to utter ruine, if wiſely and in time they did not provide againſt it;</hi> but ſent ſuch of his Divines to the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> as he was ſure would be ſufficiently active in their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By which means having ſerved his own turn, ſecured that Prince, and quieted his neighbouring provinces from the preſent diſtemper, he became eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:114876:100"/>
day more willing then other to open his eyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truths which were offered to him, and to look more carefully into the dangers, and ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the oppoſite Doctrines, deſtructive in their own nature of Monarchial Government; a matter not unknown to any, who had acquaintance with the Court in the laſt times of the King. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> makes it any thing againſt you that his Majeſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the Articles of the Creed two or three days before his death, ſhould <hi>ſay with a kind of ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and vivacity,</hi> that he believed them all in that ſenſe which was given by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>that whatſoever he had written of</hi> this <hi>faith in his life, he was now ready to ſeal with his death.</hi> For firſt the Creed may be believed in every part and article of it according as it is expounded in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> without reflecting on the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and the points depending thereupon. And ſecondly I hope your Adverſary doth not think that all the bitter ſpeeches and ſharp invectives which that King made againſt <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants,</hi> were to be reckoned amongſt thoſe Articles of his faith which he had <hi>writ of in his life,</hi> and was reſolved <hi>to ſeal with his death;</hi> no more then thoſe reproachful ſpeeches which he gives to thoſe of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, in the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, the <hi>Baſilicon Doron</hi> (for which conſult my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> neer 29.) and elſewhere, <hi>paſſim</hi> in his Writings.</p>
                     <p>44. The greateſt part of his Hiſtorical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being thus paſſed over, we will next ſee what he hath to ſay of his Late Majeſties Declaration,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:114876:100"/>
printed before the Articles, <hi>An.</hi> 1628. and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto the reſt. He tells us of that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how <hi>he had learned long ſince that it was never intended to be a two edged Sword, nor procured out of any charitable deſign to ſetle the Peace of the Church, but out of a Politique deſign to ſtop the mouths of the Orthodox, who were ſure to be cenſured, if at any time they declared their minds, whilſt the new upſtart Arminians were ſuffered to preach and print their Heterodox Notions without controul.</hi> And for the proof hereof, he voucheth the Authority of the Late Lord <hi>Faulkland,</hi> as he finds it in a Speech of his delivered in the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> Anno 1640. In which he tells us of theſe Doctrines, that though <hi>they were not contrary to Law, yet they were contrary to cuſtome, that for a long time were no ofter preached then recanted.</hi> Next he obſerves that in the Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation made by Mr. <hi>Thorne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ford,</hi> it is not charged upon them, that they had preached any thing contrary to the Doctrine of the Church, according to the ancient Form of the like Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions enjoyned by the ancient Proteſtants (as he calls them) but onely for their going againſt the Kings Declaration, which but only determined, not having commanded ſilence in thoſe points. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>Prelatical oppreſſions</hi> were ſo great in preſſing this Declaration, and the other about law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sports, as were ſufficient in themſelves to <hi>make wiſe men mad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>45. For anſwer to theſe Arguments, if they may be called ſo, I muſt firſt tell you that the man and his Oratour both have been much miſtaken, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Majeſties Declaration was no <hi>two edged</hi>
                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:114876:101"/>
                        <hi>ſword, or that it tyed up the one ſide and let looſe the other;</hi> for if it wounded Mr. <hi>Thorn</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions on the one ſide, it ſmote as ſharply on the other againſt Dr. <hi>Rainford,</hi> whoſe Recantation he may find in the Book called <hi>Canterbury's Doome,</hi> out of which he hath filched a great part of his ſtore. He is miſtaken ſecondly in ſaying that this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>determined nothing;</hi> for it <hi>determineth that no man ſhall put his own ſence or Comment to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Article, but ſhould take it in the Literal and Grammatical ſenſe,</hi> which Rule if the <hi>Calvinians</hi> would be pleaſed to obſerve we ſhould ſoon come to an agreement. Thirdly, if the ſuppoſition be true, as I think it be, that the Doctrines which they call <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> be not againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> but <hi>contrary to cuſtome only,</hi> then is the <hi>Law</hi> on our ſide, and nothing but <hi>cuſtome</hi> on theirs; and I think no man will affirm that <hi>Cuſtome</hi> ſhould be heard or kept when it is againſt <hi>Law.</hi> But fourthly, if the noble Oratour were miſtaken in the <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> I am ſure he is much more miſtaken in the <hi>propoſition,</hi> theſe Doctrines being preach'd by Biſhop <hi>Latimer,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, by Dr. <hi>Harſnet</hi> and <hi>Peter Baroe</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, by Dr. <hi>Howſon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> in King <hi>James</hi> his time, none of which ever were ſubjected to the infamy of a Recantation. Fiftly, if the Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by Mr. <hi>Thorn</hi> and his companions impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not a retracting of their opinions (as he ſaith they did not) it is a ſtrong argument of the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Majeſties Government, and the great Moderation ſhown by Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> in the uſe of his power, in not compelling men to ſay or do any
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:114876:101"/>
thing againſt their Conſcience; a moderation which we find not amongſt thoſe of the Sect of <hi>Calvin,</hi> when any of the oppoſite party fell into their hands: Sixthly, whereas it might be thought, that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Proteſtants</hi> (as he merrily calls them) had paſt many ſuch ſevere cenſures upon thoſe whom he ſtiles <hi>Arminians,</hi> he inſtanceth in none but in <hi>Barret</hi> and <hi>Bridges,</hi> which make too ſmall a number for ſo great a bragg. <hi>Quid dignum tanto,</hi> and the reſt. And finally for anſwer to the <hi>Prelatical oppreſſions,</hi> I ſhall referre you to my former Diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Baxter (num.</hi> 20, 21, 23) repeating only at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that the Proceeding of the Biſhops were mild and gentle compared with the unmerciful dealings of the <hi>Preſbiterians;</hi> by whom more Orthodox, Learned, and Religious Miniſters, were turned out of their Benefices within the ſpace of three years, then by all the Biſhops in <hi>England</hi> ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                     <p>46. But the King muſt not think to carry it ſo, the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction being generally <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> in Doctrine as well as in Diſcipline, prevailed ſo in the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Jan.</hi> 28. 1628. that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon this Counterpoiſe or Anti-declaration following, viz. <hi>We the Commons now aſſembled in Parliament, do claim, profeſs and avow for truth the ſenſe of the Articles of Religion, which were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Parliament,</hi> 13. Eliz. <hi>Which by the publick Acts of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the general current Expoſition of the Writers of our Church have been delivered to us; and we reject the ſenſe of the</hi> Jeſuites <hi>and</hi> Arminians, <hi>and all other wherein they differ from us.</hi> Which counterpoiſe made in direct
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:114876:102"/>
oppoſition to the Kings Declaration, your adverſary makes a product of the <hi>Civil Authority;</hi> whereas the Houſe of Commons was ſo far at that time, from being looked on as the <hi>Civil Authority</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that it was of no <hi>Authority</hi> at all, nor could make any Order to bind the Subject or declare any thing to be Law, and much leſs Religion, till it was firſt countenanced by the Lords, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally confirmed by the Royal aſſent. But this he doth in correſpondence to the ſaid Proteſtation, in which the Articles of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> are called <hi>the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Acts of the Church of</hi> England, though made by none but the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> two Biſhops (of which onely one had actually received Conſecration) one Dean, and half a dozen Doctors, and other Miniſters, or thereabouts, neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to any ſuch thing by the reſt of the Clergy, nor authorized to it by the Queen. And therefore their determinations, can no more properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Acts of the Church,</hi> then if one Earl, with the eldeſt Sons of two or three others meeting with half a dozen Gentlemen in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, can be affirmed to be in a capacity of making Orders, which muſt be looked on by the Subject as Acts of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>47. Your Adverſary begins now to draw toward the Lees, and in the Dreggs of his diſcourſe offers ſome Arguments, to prove that thoſe doctrines and opinions which he calls <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> were counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced to no other end but to bring in <hi>Popery.</hi> And for the proof hereof, he brings in Mr. <hi>Prinn</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the Houſe of Commons in the Caſe of <hi>Montague.</hi> An. 1626. In which it is affirmed, <hi>that</hi>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:114876:102"/>
                        <hi>the whole frame and ſcope of his book was to diſcourage the well affected in Religion, and as much as in him lay, to reconcile them unto Popery.</hi> He gives us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly a fragment of a ſcattered Paper, pretended to be written to the Rector of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Colledge in <hi>Bruxels.</hi> In which the Writer lets him know that they had ſtrongly fortified their Faction here in <hi>England, by planting the Soveraign Drug Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm, which he hoped would purge the Proteſtants from their Hereſie.</hi> Thirdly, he backs this paper with a clauſe in the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Anno</hi> 1628, where it is ſaid that <hi>the hearts of his Majeſties Subjects were perplex'd in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the dayly growth and ſpreading of the faction of</hi> Arminianiſm, <hi>that being as his Majeſty well knew</hi> (ſo they ſay at leaſt) <hi>but a cunning way to bring in Popery.</hi> All which he flouriſhes over by a paſſage in the Lord <hi>Faucklands</hi> Speech before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, in which it is affirmed of ſome of the Biſhops, <hi>that their work was to try how much of a Papiſt might be brought in without Popery, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy as much as they could of the Goſpel without bringing themſelves in danger of being deſtroyed by the Law,</hi> &amp;c. To all which, being but the ſame words out of divers mouths, I ſhall return one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer only, which is briefly this. Your adverſary cannot be ſo ignorant, as not to know that the ſame points which are now debated between the <hi>Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and the Old <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> between the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> and <hi>Contra-remonstrants</hi> in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, and finally, between the <hi>Rigid</hi> and <hi>Moderate Lutherans</hi> in the upper <hi>Germany,</hi> have been as fiercely agitated between the <hi>Franciſcans</hi>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:114876:103"/>
and <hi>Dominicans</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the old Engliſh <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>Lutherans,</hi> agreeing in theſe points with the <hi>Franciſcans;</hi> as the <hi>Engliſh Calvinists,</hi> the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants,</hi> and the <hi>Rigid Lutherans,</hi> do with the <hi>Dominicans:</hi> So that there is a complyance on all ſides, with one of the ſaid two parties in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore why a general <hi>compliance</hi> in theſe points with the <hi>Friers</hi> of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> (the principal Sticklers and Promoters of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi>) ſhould not be thought as ready a way to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> as any ſuch compliance with the <hi>Friers</hi> of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> I would fain have your Adverſary tell me when he puts out next.</p>

For take the ſtory as it ſtands apparell'd with all its circumſtances, and we ſhall find ſuch an encroachment on the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal power and jurisdiction, as was not to be expiated with a gentler ſentence.

What fortune will befall my ſelfe upon this encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I am not able to determine; having done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to deſerve the juſt diſpleaſure and little hoping to obtain the favour of thoſe men, who ſhall think themſelves concerned in it, ſome men are ſo in love with their own opinions, that they do not onely <hi>hate</hi> to be <hi>Reformed</hi> in the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> Language, but carry an evil eye towards thoſe who have laboured in it; looking upon them with as much diſdain &amp; indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>Hanun</hi> the King of <hi>Ammon</hi> did on <hi>Davids</hi> Meſſengers when he returned them to their Maſters with their beards half ſhaven, and their Garments cut off in diſgrace to their very buttocks, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 4. But be my fortune what it will, it will, be a moſt infinite content unto me, that by my weak endeavors I have contributed any thing to the Glory of God, the vindication of the truth, the edification of the Church, and the ſatisfaction of thoſe pious ſouls who heartily do pray for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and moſt effectually endeavor to promote the Work. Amongſt which number there is none who can more poſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſire to be entertained, then</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AFter I had diſpatched the Papers foregoing to the Preſs, I called to mind a paſſage in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſent from Dr. <hi>Ridley, then Biſhop of London,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Hooper, Biſhop of Gloceſter</hi> (which you ſhall find, amongſt many others, in the <hi>Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents</hi>) in which he ſignifieth unto him, that though they had ſometimes differed in matter of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, yet there had been an uniform conſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in matter of Doctrine: So that unto the teſtimonies of Arch Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi> in maintenance of the cauſe which you contend for: you may add alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Biſhop <hi>Ridley;</hi> whoſe judgement in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Reformation, was of ſuch Authority, that <hi>Canmer</hi> more relied on him then on any other.</p>
               <p>I have been alſo further advertiſed of two Letters, which are to be ſeen of M. <hi>Barrets</hi> own hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the one to D. <hi>Goad,</hi> Maſter of Kings Colledg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other to Mr. <hi>Chatterton,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> in which he plainly lets them know, That he would never yield to make that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, to which for fear of loſing his fellowſhip, and being expelled the Vniverſity, endeavoured to draw him; as alſo that D. <hi>Coſens</hi> and D. <hi>Martin,</hi> making a diligent ſearch into the Regiſters of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity, could never find any ſuch Recantation, to have been made by the ſaid <hi>Barret,</hi> as is exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us in the <hi>Anti Arminianiſm,</hi> &amp; from thence taken by M. <hi>Hickman,</hi> though he do not ſo much as once acknowledg by whom he profiteth: &amp; I am the more apt to believe, that <hi>Barret</hi> never made the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:114876:109"/>
which is fathered on him; becauſe it appears clearly by the Acts themſelves, that though he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Doctrines wherewith he was charged, to have been poſitively and expreſly delivered by him, yet he averreth as expreſly, <hi>Quod contenta in iiſdem Religione Eccleſiae Anglicanae omnino noti repugnant,</hi> That they contained nothing contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that I find in the ſaid Acts, is the enjoyning of a Recantation, the drawing of it into form, and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of it to <hi>Barret</hi> on the 5. of <hi>May,</hi> by him to be publiſhed in S. <hi>Maries</hi> Church on the <hi>Saturday</hi> after; and all this done, when neither the <hi>Margaret</hi> Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, was of the ſame judgement with <hi>Barret,</hi> nor the Vice-Chancellor himſelf, whom it concerned as much as any, were conſulted in it: But that <hi>Barret</hi> ever made this Recantation, or that this Recantation was the ſame in all particulars with that which he was required to pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſh, depends upon the credit of a ſcattered Paper; thoſe which have moſt inſiſted on it, appealing rather to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Authors for the proof thereof, then to the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Records of that Vniverſity: So that when it is ſaid ſo poſitively by M. <hi>Prinne,</hi> that this Recantation was made by M <hi>Barret,</hi> on the 10th of <hi>May,</hi> 1595. in the Univerſity Church of S. <hi>Marys</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> &amp; out of him repeated by Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> with as great a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they do both wrong the dead, and abuſe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. For it appeareth by a Letter ſent from the heads of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chancellor of that Univerſity, that <hi>Barret</hi> had not made that Recantation on the 8 of <hi>March,</hi> which was full ten months after the ſaid 10 of <hi>May,</hi> in which the publiſhing of this Recantation is affirmed of him. <hi>About a year paſt,</hi> ſay they, <hi>(amongſt divers others, who here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted publickly to teach new and ſtrange opinions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) one M.</hi> Barret <hi>more boldly then the reſt, did preach</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:114876:110"/>
                  <hi>divers Popiſh Errors in St.</hi> Marys, <hi>to the juſt offence of many, which he was joyned to retract, but hath refuſed ſo to do in ſuch ſort as hath been preſcribed him.</hi> Out of which Letter bearing date the 8th of <hi>March,</hi> 1595. exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by M. <hi>Prynn</hi> in the <hi>Anti-Arminianiſm</hi> (254) and therefore ſeen by M. <hi>Hickman</hi> in the courſe of that Book, I conclude three things. 1. That M. <hi>Prinne,</hi> and M. <hi>Hickman</hi> have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aid a Defamation upon <hi>Barret,</hi> which they cannot juſtifie, as being contrary to their own knowledge in that particular. 2. That beſides <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> there were <hi>diuers others who preacht the ſad new and ſtrange opinions in Religion,</hi> as the Letter calls them, though not ſo confidently and boldly, as <hi>Barret</hi> did; and 3. That it is not ſaid in the Letter, that <hi>Barrets</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines <hi>gave offence to all,</hi> or the greateſt part, but that they <hi>gave offence to many;</hi> and if they gave offence but to many onely, there muſt be <hi>many</hi> others (and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the greateſt part) in that Univerſity, to whom they gave no offence at all.</p>
               <p>I find alſo in the Title to this Recantation as it ſtands in the <hi>Anti-Arminianiſm (p.</hi> 56.) that M. <hi>Harſenet</hi> of <hi>Pembrook-Hall,</hi> is there affirmed to have maintained, the ſuppoſed Errors for which <hi>Barret</hi> was condemned to a Recantation: And 'tis ſtrange that <hi>Harſnet</hi> ſhould ſtand charged in the Tiltle of another mans ſentence, for <hi>holding</hi> and <hi>maintaining</hi> any ſuch points as had been raked <hi>out of the Dunghil</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> as was there affirmed; for which he either was to have been queſtioned in his own perſon, or not to have been condemned in the title to the Sentences paſſed on another man. Which circumſtance, as it diſcredits the Title, ſo the title doth as much diſcredit the reality of the recantation: <hi>Adeo mendaciorum natura eſt, ut cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere non poſſint,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lactantius</hi> truly. Beſides it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Harſnet</hi> did not only maintain the ſaid Opinions in the Vniverſity, but preacht them alſo at S.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114876:110"/>
                  <hi>Paul's</hi> Croſs, <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. not ſparing any of thoſe dious aggravations, with which the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines in thoſe points hath been charged by others; and yet we cannot find that any offence was taken at it, or any recantation enjoyned upon it, either by the <hi>High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> or the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> or any other having Authority in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as certainly there would have been, if the matter of that Sermon had been contrary to the rules of the Church, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of the ſame: And thereupon we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude (were there no proof elſe) that where Doctor <hi>Baroe</hi> had for 14. or 15. years (as is ſaid in that Letter) maintained thoſe Opinions in the Schooles, which M. <hi>Hickman</hi> noveliſeth by the name of Arminians; and ſuch an able man as <hi>Harſnet,</hi> had preached them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any control, and the greateſt Audience of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did ſtand to him in it, There muſt be many more <hi>Barrets</hi> who concurred in the ſame opinions with them in that Vniverſity, though their names through the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of thoſe times are not come unto us.</p>
               <p>And this appears more fully by that which followed on the death of D. <hi>Whitacres,</hi> who died within few days after his return from <hi>Lambeth,</hi> which the nine Articles ſo much talkt of: Two Candidates appeared for the Profeſſorſhip after his deceaſe, <hi>Wotton</hi> of <hi>Kings Colledge,</hi> a profeſſed <hi>Calvinian,</hi> and one of thoſe who wrote againſt <hi>Mountague</hi>'s Appeal, <hi>Anno</hi> 1626. Competitor with <hi>Overal</hi> of <hi>Trinity Colledg,</hi> as far from the Calvinian Doctrine in the main plat-form of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, as <hi>Baroe, Harſnet, or Barret</hi> are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be. But when it came unto the vote of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, the place was carried for <hi>Overal</hi> by the major part, which plainly ſhows, that though the Doctrines of <hi>Calvin</hi> were ſo hotly ſtickled for by moſt of the heads, yet the moſt part of the members of that learned body entertained them not.</p>

                  <p>HOw great a loſs I had in the death of my moſt dear and honoured Friend, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Father, no man is able to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but he that hath ſuffered in the like. So af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable was his converſation, his diſcourſe ſo rational, his Judgment ſo exact in moſt parts of Learning, and his affections to the Church ſo exemplary in him, that I never enjoyed a greater felicity in the company of any man living, then I did in his: In which reſpects I may affirm both with ſafety and modeſty, that we did not onely take <hi>ſweet counſel together, but walked in the Houſe of God as Friends,</hi> I muſt needs ſay, I was prepared for that great blow, by the loſs of my preferment in the Church of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which gave me the opportunity of ſo dear and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved a neighborhood; ſo that I loſt him partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dyed, which made the miſery the more ſupportable, when I was deprived of him for alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But I was never more ſenſible of the infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then I am at this preſent, in reference to that ſatisfaction, which I am ſure he could have given the Gentleman whom I am to deal with: His eminent abilities in theſe Political Diſputes, exemplified in
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:114876:113"/>
his judicious obſervations on <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Politiques; as alſo in ſome paſſages on <hi>Grotius, Hunton, Hobbs,</hi> and other of our late Diſcourſers about Formes of Government, declare abundantly how fit a Man he might have been, to have dealt in this cauſe, which I would not willingly ſhould be betrayed by unskilful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>The Anſwer of <hi>P. H.</hi> D. D. to the Letter of <hi>J. H.</hi> Eſq; The Introduction of the whole.</head>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AT my coming to <hi>London</hi> about Midſommer laſt, I found ſome Papers left for me in the way of a Letter (at my accuſtomed Rendezvouz) with this following Title, viz. <hi>The Stumbling Block of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Rebellion, cunningly imputed by</hi> P. H. <hi>unto</hi> Calvin; <hi>Removed in a Letter to the ſaid</hi> P. H. <hi>from</hi> J. H. By which Title of Superſcription, it was eaſy to know whom you had deſigned for your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary in the two firſt Letters; and it was not hard for me to find by the two laſt Letters, with whom I was to deal, having received ſome advertiſment of it from a friend in <hi>Oxon,</hi> before I ſet forwards on my journey. The Papers being put into my hands,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:114876:114"/>
I could no longer defer the curioſity of having them read over to me, then the withdrawing into a more convenient room muſt of neceſſity admit; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had them read over to me. I found my ſelf preſſed with this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> that either I muſt return an anſwer to you, or confeſs the whole Book to be anſwered by you. I found no reaſon for the laſt, and therefore thought it more convenient to give you content in the firſt with as much conveniency as I could. But I had then other fiſh to fry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of perhaps you may have taſted before this time. Nor was I without other buſineſſes, which as they brought me to the City, ſo they occaſioned a longer ſtay there then I firſt intended. In the mean time a book of one Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s was by chance offered to my peruſal, in which I found my ſelf concerned, and ſo concerned, that I thought it ſafer to venture ſomewhat on your patience, then to ſink under thoſe Reproaches which were laid upon me. In which till I had ſatisfied both my ſelf and him, I could not give my thoughts the leaſure of rendering you that ſatisfaction which you had required. But having now diſpatch'd with him, I ſhall be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable to attend your Motions; and ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow after you ſtep by ſtep as you move be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. I muſt confeſs you are an Adverſary whom I look'd not for,
<q>Non expectato vulnus ab hoſte venit.</q>
In the Poets words; but then I muſt confeſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that I am fallen into the hands of a generous Adverſary, of whom I am ſure of fair quarter, if
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:114876:114"/>
I ſhould be vanquiſhed, and no reviling Language (as I have had of late from others) ſhould I win the day; and to be overcome by ſuch an enemy, is a kind of Victory. With this encouragement I put my ſelf into the liſts, notwithſtanding all thoſe diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which appear againſt me; You coming freſh into the field, well ſeconded, and dayly exerciſed in thoſe <hi>Political</hi> Diſputes, which either I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver managed, or (being tired and broken with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſineſſes) have long ſince diſ-uſed.</p>
                  <p>2. But firſt I am to purge my ſelf (according to the old known Laws of <hi>Duel</hi>) from having about me any ſpells, any charmes or <hi>Magical ſpells,</hi> from being guilty of that cunning and indirect proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which you put upon me. Thoſe two words, <hi>cunningly imputed,</hi> which I find in your Title, are many in effect, though few in number, and tend to render me ſhſpected of <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>forgery,</hi> as if I had laid a <hi>ſtumbling block</hi> before <hi>Calvins</hi> doors, which bind no <hi>Grammatical</hi> Conſtruction, or by any <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi> inference can be gathered from them. But if you look upon us both with a ſingle and impartial eye, you will find no ſuch <hi>cunning</hi> in me, (for I am not of his mind) who ſaid,
<q>Dolus an virtus quis in boſte requirat.</q>
Nothing but plain and down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> right dealing, nothing but what the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners collected from thoſe words of <hi>Calvin</hi> to juſtifie their diſobedience and rebellion againſt their own moſt rightful Queen, whom they had perſecuted, and depoſed, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of her Kingdom; a full account whereof
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:114876:115"/>
I have given elſewhere, both in the Preface to that book of which you have undertaken the Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the 128<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section of my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Letter, in either of which you may conſult it. And ſecondly, I muſt crave leave accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Laws of <hi>Duell,</hi> to take the length of your weapon, that I may fit my own unto it. I mean, that with your leave and liking, I may take the meaſure of your Letter, tranſcribing it line for line, and word for word, as it came unto me, that my anſwer may be fitted and proportioned to it. Without which I can neither manage the Combate, as I ought to do, nor the ſpectators be delighted with the ſight thereof as they ought to be; Nor ſuch as are to judge between us can be enabled to determine as of right they ought, to whom the victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth.

                        <p>I Gave my Judgment upon your late Book (that I mean againſt <hi>Calvin</hi>) in ſuch manner among ſome Gentlemen, that they deſired me to write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in anſwer to it, which if there happen to be need, I may; In the mean time, it will perhaps be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if I acquaint you with as much as I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them.

ſome things as a <hi>Polititian</hi> only, others as a <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> and a Divine too. Now to repeat a few, and yet as many I think as are needful of each kind, I ſhall begin with the former.</p>
                        <p>The Riſe, Progreſs, and Period of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> is obſervable in Authors by theſe ſteps.</p>

                        <p>All which happened within the compaſs of 800 years.</p>
                        <p>To the firſt you ſay, <hi>That the Spartan Kings were as abſolute Monarchs as any in thoſe times, till</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytion <hi>or</hi> Eurypon <hi>to procure the good will of the Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal-rabble</hi>

                        <p>It is true that <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſays that <hi>Eurypon</hi> was the firſt, who to obtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the people, let looſe the reins of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this he ſaith there without ſhewing any neceſſity that lay upon the King ſo to do; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs that ſuch neceſſity there was, is apparent in <hi>Agis,</hi> where he affirmeth, that a King of <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> could never come to be equal unto any other King, but only by introducing equality among the people; foraſmuch as a Servant or Lievtenant of <hi>Seleucus</hi> or <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> was worth more then ever were all the Kings of <hi>Sparta</hi> put together. Which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:114876:116"/>
latter ſpeech, if a man conſider the narrowneſs of the <hi>Laconick Territory,</hi> being but a part of <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneſus,</hi> muſt needs evince the former action to have been not ſo voluntary in <hi>Eurypon,</hi> as in prudence unavoidable. But <hi>Eurypon</hi> having by this means ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confeſſed the infirmity of the Monarchy, then introduced any cure of the Government, it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the people, not yet brought under fit or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, muſt needs remain in diſorders, as they did, till the Inſtitution of the Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>The Monarchy that is or can be abſolute muſt be founded upon an Army planted by Military Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, upon the over-ballance of Land, being in the Dominion of the Prince, and in this caſe there can neither be a nobility, nor a people to gratifie, at leaſt without ſhaking the foundation, or diſ-obliging the Army. Wherefore the <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings having a Nobility or People to gratifie, were not abſolute. It is true you call the Kings of <hi>France</hi> abſolute, ſo do others, but it is known that in the whole world there is not a Nobility nor a People ſo frequently flying out or taking Arms againſt their Princes, as the Nobility and people of <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Monarch that is founded upon a Nobility, or a Nobility and the People (as by the riſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the <hi>Norman Line</hi> in our Story is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary) muſt gratifie the Nobility, or the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and the People, with ſuch Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as are fit for them, or the Government, as we have known by experience, is found in <hi>France,</hi> and no doubt was ſeen by <hi>Eurypon,</hi> becometh tyrannical, be the Prince otherwiſe never ſo good a man.</p>

                        <p>In which firſt you make that to be a practiſe of the Kings againſt the Senate, which by your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is plain to have been a combination of the Kings and the Senate againſt the people; for the people upon the inſolency and predominancy of the Kings and the Senate, fell, as in that caſe, the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable nature of them, upon counſel how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, and ſo aſſumed the power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Hereupon the Kings <hi>Theopompus</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> would have added unto the tenour of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that if the people went about by debate to change the propoſitions of the Senate, it ſhould be lawful for the Kings and Senate to null the reſult of the people, which practiſe if it had paſt, muſt have made the Kings and the Senate altogether uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable. Wherefore the people incenſed at it, <hi>put a bitt into the mouth of the Senate by the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the</hi> Ephori.

having created the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and being told by his Queen, he had done that which would leave narrower power to his children, anſwered well, that it would leave narrower but longer.

                        <p>The ruine of this Ballance, and corruption of the Common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>wealth you wholly omit, to the end, that picking up your objections againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in vigour.

                        <p>But the truth is thus recorded by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Agis.</hi> So ſoon as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having ruined <hi>Athens,</hi> became ſo full of gold and ſilver, the Common-wealth began to break; Nevertheleſs the lots and diviſion of Lands made by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> yet remaining, the equality of the foundation held good till <hi>Epitadeus</hi> an ill natured fellow became <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore,</hi> and having a mind to diſ-inherit his ſon, got

a Law to paſs, whereby any man might diſpoſe of his lot as he pleaſed: This by him purſued of meet malice to his ſon, was hurried on by the avarice of others whoſe riches came thus to eat the people out of their lands, that in a ſhort time there remained not above an hundred Free holders in all <hi>Sparta.</hi> This he ſhews to have been the riſe of the <hi>Oligarchy.</hi> The <hi>Oligarchy</hi> thus ballanced totally excluded the people, and murthered <hi>Agis</hi> the firſt King that was ever put to death by the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and to theſe times (about which <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> lived) relateth that tyranny which they who (as was ſhown) commended the <hi>Ephorate</hi> in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, now laid unto it in <hi>Oligarchy.</hi> Thus have you fetcht an argument againſt a Common-wealth that are nothing to it. Again, whereas <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> by the reſtitution of the lots of <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> were Aſſerters of popular power, you inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them to have been Aſſerters of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> ſuch is your play with humane Authors, or as a <hi>Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> Now let us ſee, whether you have dealt any thing better with Scripture, or been more careful as a Divine.

                  <p>Some things (you ſay) I writ <hi>as a Polititian</hi> (a ſilly one I am, God help me) and <hi>ſome things as a Polititian,</hi> and <hi>divine too.</hi> And as a Polititian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am charged by you to have affirmed, <hi>that the</hi> Spartan <hi>Kings were as abſolute Monarchs as any in thoſe times,</hi> till <hi>Euripon</hi> the 3d. King of the Race of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> and the 2d. King of the younger houſe, to <hi>procure the favour and good will of the</hi> Raſcal rabble looſened <hi>the raigns of Government,</hi> and thereby much diminiſhing the Regall power. This I affirm indeed, and this you deny; but you neither Anſwer my Authorities nor confute my Reaſons; my Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities I derive from <hi>Plutarch</hi> firſt, who ſpeaking of the ſaid <hi>Euripon,</hi> whom he calleth <hi>Eurition</hi> affirms, that till his time the Government of <hi>Sparta</hi> was, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſufficiently Monarchical, if it were not more. (And ſecondly, from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who calls the Government of <hi>Charilaus,</hi> the ſixt King of that Houſe (who as you ſay was generally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be a good man) by the name of a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And if it might be called a Tyranny then when the Regall power was under ſuch a diminution by the folly of <hi>Euripon,</hi> there is no queſtion to be made but that the <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings were abſolute Monarchs before any ſuch diminution had been made. To theſe two proofs you anſwer nothing, nor ſay you any thing at all in confutation of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:114876:127"/>
Reaſon by me brought to prove it: Which is, <hi>That having acquired the Eſtate by conqueſt, and claiming by no other title then by that of Armies, there was no queſtion to be made, but that they Governed in the way of abſolute Monarchs; it being not the guiſe of ſuch as come in by conqueſt, to covessant and capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with their Subjects, but to impoſe their will for a Law upon them:</hi> This being the cuſtome of all Kings who claim by conqueſt, it muſt belong to you to prove the contrary, and tell me why the <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings ſhould not obſerve the ſame rule in the Acts of Government as all others did. Crowns which are purchaſed by the Sword ſeldome ſit faſt upon the head of the Conquerors, if they deliver up that Sword by which they were purchaſed: And therefore it was noted for a great error in <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi> (a man of greater parts and power then a King of <hi>Sparta</hi>) to hope that he might hold that ſupream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by love of the people, which he got by force of Arms, and was ſo to hold it.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this you object, Firſt, <hi>That the Spartan Kings could not be abſolute, becauſe they had a Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ple to gratifie.</hi> But then you ſhould have told us by what rule in Government, the Spartan Kings who preceded <hi>Eurypon,</hi> could be obliged to gratifie either the People or Nobility of that Country, which they had conquered by the Sword. And whereas you alledge in defence of <hi>Eurypon, That his letting looſe the Reines of Government,</hi> to obtain favour with the people, <hi>was a confeſſion of the infirmity of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> and that his Action in ſo doing, <hi>was not ſo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary in it ſelf, as unavoidable imprudence.</hi> It was indeed a plain confeſſion of the <hi>infirmity of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:114876:127"/>
in not being able to hold the Kingdom in the ſame Eſtate, in which it had been held by his Father and Grand father: Of the infirmity of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, that is to ſay, the form of Government by them eſtabliſhed, and to which the <hi>Spartans</hi> formerly had been accuſtomed, I cannot think it to be any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion at all; nor can I ſee how that imprudent <hi>Act</hi> of his, can be affirmed to have been unavoidable in point of prudence, by that which you produce from the words of <hi>Agis,</hi> the five and twentieth King of <hi>Sparta</hi> of the younger houſe, where he affirms, that a King of <hi>Sparta could never come to be equal unto any other King but only by introducing equality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people.</hi> But firſt a King of <hi>Sparta</hi> might be as <hi>abſolute</hi> in his own Dominions as any other King whatſoever of a larger Territory, with whom he could not be thought equal in power and Riches: The <hi>abſoluteneſs</hi> or <hi>Autocraty</hi> of Kings (if I may ſo call it) depending not upon the greatneſs of their revenues, or extent of Empire, but only in their form of Government. And ſecondly, I would fain know how by the <hi>introducing an equality among the people,</hi> could render a poor King of <hi>Sparta equal to any</hi> other King, either of any greater power or larger Territory. It was not poſſible for <hi>Agis</hi> (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:114876:128"/>
probably might make him a great King in the love and eſtimation of the common people (for I muſt no longer call them the <hi>Raſcal rabble</hi>) though in no bodies elſe. Nor could the low condition of the Kings of <hi>Sparta</hi> impoſe any ſuch neceſſity upon <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rypon</hi> to change the Government, as you ſay it did; neither <hi>Eurypon</hi> nor any of his Succeſſors encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either in power or riches, by the alteration; and finally, whereas you ſeem to juſtifie this neceſſity by thoſe words of <hi>Agis,</hi> in which he told his Mother, <hi>That a Servant or Lievtenant of</hi> Selinus <hi>or</hi> Ptolomey <hi>was worth more then ever were all the Kings of</hi> Sparta <hi>put together.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Agis</hi> ſpeaks not of any of the Lievtenants of thoſe two Princes, who poſſibly might amaſs more treaſures then all the Kings of <hi>Sparta</hi> had done before, but only of the Servants of thoſe Leivtenants; for it is <hi>Satraparum famuli, &amp; ſervi Procuratorum,</hi> in the tranſlation of <hi>Xyland,</hi> with which (not having the Greek by me) I content my ſelf. And ſecondly, theſe words being ſpoken of the Servants of ſuch Lievtenants, and of the Servants of ſuch great Perſons, which lived under either of thoſe two Kings, muſt needs have more of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique in them then of real truth: For <hi>Agis</hi> did not only tell the people, when he came to put this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in execution, that he would devide amongſt them his own Fields and Paſtures, of which he had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many in his own poſſeſſion; but that he would deliver up ten thouſand Talents, to be put into the common Treaſury: And if this one King were ſo rich in Lands, and ſo ſtored with Money (<hi>Dives agris, dives poſitis in ſoenore nummis</hi>) it muſt be very ſtrange to think that a Servant of any of the Princes, or
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:114876:128"/>
Lievtenants of either of the ſaid two Kings, <hi>ſhould be worth more then all the Kings of</hi> Sparta, <hi>were they put together.</hi>

                  <p>4. But here before we can proceed, I muſt clear my ſelf from that Parentheſis of yours, in which you ſay, that I commonly call the people by the name of <hi>Raſcal rabble,</hi> as in another place you tell me that I have no better name for them then that; but I hope you do not, and I am ſure you cannot gather out of any ſuch words, that I beſtow that title on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally, which either make up the main body of a Common wealth, or comprehend all ſorts of people which are not in the Rank and order of titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nobility.

                  <p>5. In the next place you let us know, <hi>That the Monarchy that is or can be abſolute, muſt be founded</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:114876:129"/>
                     <hi>upon an Army planted by military Colonies upon the over balance of Land being in the Dominion of the Prince.</hi> And ſo far I concur in opinion with you, (ſeeing it proved by late experience amongſt our ſelves) that no Prince can be an abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch without an Army; that is to ſay without ſome ſtanding Forces, to be ready at command up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions. But then what reaſon have you to think that <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> having conquered the Realm of <hi>Sparta,</hi> did not withal keep up his Army to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the conqueſt, and that this Army or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not kept on foot, till the time of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripon,</hi> who being either of weaker parts, or more apt to be wrought on, or elſe unwilling to be at the continual charge of paying an Army; might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it an high point of Husbandry, to disband his Forces, and caſt himſelf entirely on the love of the people. And ſecondly, Admitting that of the two former Kings, what reaſon can you give me why that Army ſhould be planted in <hi>Colonies;</hi> the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Sparta</hi> (as you ſay your ſelfe) being very narrow, and conſequently not much room, nor any neceſſity at all for many ſuch Colonies to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it. A ſtanding Army anſwerable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Country, and the number of the old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, diſpoſed of in their Summer Camp, and their Winter-Quarters, would have done the work, and done it with leſs charge and greater readineſs, then diſperſed in Colonies. And therefore when you ſay in ſuch general terms, That <hi>the Monarchy that is or can be abſolute, muſt be founded upon an Army planted by military Colonies upon the over balance of Land being in the Dominion of the Prince;</hi>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:114876:129"/>
I muſt profeſs my ſelf to differ in opinion from you. For then how could a Prince poſſeſſed of his Kingdom from a long deſcent of Royal Anceſtors, and exerciſing abſolute power upon his people, be ſaid to be an an abſolute Monarch, becauſe his ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forces cannot be ſetled or diſpoſed of in any ſuch Colonies, <hi>upon the over balance of Land within his Dominion.</hi> In Countrys newly conquered, or farre remote fom the chief reſidence of the Prince, or the ſeat of the Empire, ſuch Colonies have been thought neceſſary in the former Ages; the wiſdome of the <hi>Romans</hi> not finding out any better or more preſent way to ſerve their Conqueſt. But then ſuch Colonies wanted not their inconveniencies, and may in time produce the different Effect from that which was expected of them. For being poſſeſſed of City, and indowed with Lands, and challenging a property in thoſe Lands and Cities, they came in tract of time by intermariages and alliances to be all one with the old Natives of the Country, and ſtood as much upon their terms againſt the incroachments of thoſe Princes under whom they ſerved, and by whoſe Anceſtors they were planted. A better Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whereof we can hardly find then in thoſe <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Colonies</hi> which were planted in <hi>Ireland</hi> at the firſt conqueſt of that Kingdom; many of which by mutuall correſpondency and alliances became ſo imbodied with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that they degenerated at the laſt, from the manner and civility of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Nation,</hi> and (paſſing by the name of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-Iriſh</hi>) proved as rebellious (if not more then the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves. What therefore hath been found defective in Colonies, in reference to the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

                  <p>6. But for a further proof of your poſition, that is to ſay, that there can be no <hi>abſolute Monarch who hath a Nobility and People to gratifie,</hi> you firſt inſtance in the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> which I as well as <hi>others,</hi> (and <hi>others</hi> then as well as I) do account for <hi>Abſolute:</hi> But <hi>it is known</hi> (ſay you) <hi>That in the whole world there is not a Nobility; nor a People, ſo frequently flying out, or taking Arms againſt their Princes, as the Nobility and People of</hi> France. This I acknowledge to be true, but affirm withall, that the <hi>frequent flyings</hi> out of that <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>People</hi> againſt their Kings, proceed not from any infirmity in the Monarchy, but from the ſtirring and buſie nature of the <hi>French</hi> in general, who if they make not Wars abroad, will find work at home; ſo that we may affirm of them as the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> doth of the Ancient <hi>Spaniaras, Si foras hoſtem non habent, domi quaerunt.</hi> And this the wiſe Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood well enough, when having diſmantled <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> reduced ſuch Peers as remained in the hands of the <hi>Hugonets,</hi> and cruſht the Faction of the Monſieur now Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> he preſently engaged that King in a War with <hi>Spain;</hi> that ſo
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:114876:131"/>
the hot and fiery ſpirits of the <hi>French</hi> might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporated and conſumed in a forrain War, which otherwiſe had they ſtayed at home, would ever and anon have inflamed the Kingdom.

Nor ſtaid he here but to prevent all practiſes and contrivances which might be hammered in the night (which the eye of no humane providence could be able to ſee into or diſcover) he commanded that no light or fire ſhould be ſeen in any of their Houſes after the ringing of a Bell at eight of the clock, called thence the <hi>Cover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>few,</hi> or the <hi>Cur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>few</hi> Bell, as it is called to this very day.

What you intend by theſe words (<hi>we have known by experience</hi>) as I am loth to underſtand, ſo I am not willing to enquire. What had been ſeen by <hi>Eurypon</hi> (though you make no doubt of it) I believe you know as little as I; but what was practiſed by the <hi>Normans,</hi> I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps know as much as you; and if I know any thing of them and of their affairs, I muſt needs know this, that the firſt Norman Kings did never Court the Nobility or the people of <hi>England,</hi> by gratifying <hi>them with ſuch Laws and Liberties</hi> as you ſpeak of here, but governed them for the moſt part by the <hi>Grand Cuſtomeiur</hi> of the Normans, or in an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, as to them ſeemed beſt: For though ſometimes for quietneſs ſake, they promiſed the aboliſhing of <hi>Dane gelt,</hi> and the reſtoring the Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor; yet neither was the one aboliſhed till the Raign of King <hi>Steven</hi> (who
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:114876:133"/>
came in upon a broken Title) nor the other reſtored, though often promiſed, till the time of King <hi>John,</hi> and then extorted from him by force of Arms; ſo that by this account, the Government of the firſt ſinking of the <hi>Norman</hi> Race, muſt become Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, becauſe they <hi>gratified not the people with ſuch Laws and Liberties, as</hi> (in your judgment) <hi>were fit for them:</hi> For having gained the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> with the other <hi>Charta de Foreſta in the time of King</hi> John, and being frequently called to Parliaments by the Kings which followed, they had as much as they had reaſon to expect in thoſe early days. Where by the way (that I may lay all things together which relate to <hi>England</hi>) I would fain know what ground you have for the poſition which you give us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that is to ſay, That King <hi>Henry</hi> 3. inſtituted his Parliament to be aſſiſtant to him in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our ancient Writers tell us, that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments or Common Councils, conſiſting of the Prelates, Peers, and other great men of the Realm, were frequently held in the time of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Kings; and that the Commons were firſt called to theſe great Aſſemblies at the Coronation of King <hi>Henry</hi> 1. to the end that his ſucceſſion to the Crown being approved by the Nobility and People, he might have the better colour to exclude his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And as the Parliament was not inſtituted by King <hi>Henry</hi> 3. ſo I would fain know of whom you learnt, <hi>that it was inſtituted by him, to be aſſiſtant to him in his Government,</hi> unleſs it were from ſome of the Declaration of the Commons in the late long Parliament, in which it is frequently affirmed, <hi>That the fundamental Government of this Realm was by</hi>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:114876:134"/>
                     <hi>King, Lords and Commons:</hi> For then what did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Government of this Kingdom under <hi>Henry</hi> 3. when he had no ſuch Aſſiſtants joyned with him; or what became of the foundation in the intervals of following Parliaments, when there was neither Lords nor Commons, on which the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be laid: And therefore it muſt be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly neceſſary, either that the Parliaments were not inſtituted by King <hi>Henry</hi> 3. to be his <hi>Aſſiſtants in the Government,</hi> and that the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were not a part of the <hi>foundation</hi> on which the <hi>Government is built;</hi> or elſe that for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſpace of time ſince King <hi>H.</hi> 3. the Kingdom hath bin under no Government at all for want of ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants, and ſuch a Principal part of the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals as you ſpeak of there. The Government of ſuch times muſt be in obeyſance at the leaſt, as our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers phraſe it.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe you make your Propoſition in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neneral terms, and uſe the <hi>riſe and progreſs of the</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>line,</hi> for an inſtance onely: I would fain learn who ſhould be Judge, touching the <hi>fitneſs</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs</hi> of ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> by which the people, <hi>or the Nobility and the People,</hi> are to be gratified by their Kings. For if the Kings themſelves muſt judge it, it is not like that they will part with any of their juſt prerogatives, which might make them leſs obeyed at home, and leſſer feared abroad; but where invincible neceſſity, or violent importunity might force them to it. And then the Laws and Liberties which were ſo extorted, were either vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated or anulled, whenſoever the Granter was in power to weaken, or make void the grant; for <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:114876:134"/>
                     <hi>diuturnitatis eſt cuſtos metus,</hi> as you know who ſaid, But if the people muſt be judges of ſuch laws and liberties as were fitteſt for them, there would be no end of their demands, reaſonable in their own nature, and in number infinite. For when they meet with a King of the <hi>giving hand,</hi> they will preſs him ſo to give from one point to another, till he give away <hi>Royalty</hi> it ſelf; and if they be not ſatisfied in all their askings, they will be pleaſed with none of his former Grants.</p>
                  <p>9. But you go on, and having told us that in ſuch caſes, as before, the <hi>Government becomes tyrannical, be the Prince otherwiſe never ſo good a man,</hi> you prove it, firſt by inſtancing in <hi>Carilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> in whoſe <hi>raign the Common-wealth was inſtituted by</hi> Licurgus, <hi>who is generally affirmed to have been a good man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet is ſaid by</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>to have been a Tyrant,</hi> and then conclude, <hi>that it remaines with me to ſhew how a good man can otherwiſe be a Tyrant then by holding Monarchicall Government, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſufficient balance.</hi> But certainly no ſuch thing remains to be ſhown by me, there being no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given you to require it of me, in the Book againſt <hi>Calvin</hi> (by which name you call it) which your letter undertakes to anſwer. The difference between us is, whether the <hi>Ephory</hi> were ordained by the Kings of <hi>Sparta,</hi> to curb the Senate, or by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to oppoſe and controul their Kings; of which hitherto you have ſaid nothing; If you put an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred queſtions on the by, I am not bound by any rule of Diſputation to make anſwer to them, or ſo much as to any one of them as it comes in my way. But in this point I ſhall not leave you without ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:114876:135"/>
In order whereunto you may do well to call to mind, that the word <hi>Tyrant</hi> at the firſt was uſed to ſignifie a juſt and lawfull King (<hi>qui poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam tecta Tyranni intravere ſui,</hi> as we find in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) though afterwards more frequently uſed to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſuch Princes onely, who having ſuppreſt the popular Government, in ſome Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the power unto themſelves, or otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained the people from running in to ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order to which they had formerly been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but at the laſt to ſignifie ſuch mercileſs men, who having unjuſtly gained the ſupream Authority by blood and violence, continued in the ſame with the like cruelty and injuſtice. Thus in the ſecond ſence and ſignification of the word, we find mention of the <hi>Tyrants</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> (though ſome of them were juſt and moderate Princes) as alſo of <hi>Nabis</hi> the <hi>Tyrant</hi> of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Tyrant</hi> of <hi>Pherae;</hi> And finally the 30. Magiſtrates which were ſent from <hi>Sparta,</hi> to govern the affairs of <hi>Athens</hi> (which was before the moſt <hi>Popular</hi> and <hi>Democratical</hi> Government that ever was) are beſt known by the name of the 30. <hi>Tyrants</hi> till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time. And in this ſecond ſence of the word, the Government of <hi>Carilaus,</hi> is by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid to be a <hi>Tyranny,</hi> not becauſe he ſuppreſt any popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which had before been ſetled in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> but becauſe he reſtrained the people from having their own wills as before they had in the time of ſome of his predeceſſors, or from living under ſuch an <hi>Anarchy</hi> as they moſt deſired. And in this ſence and ſignification of the word, any good Prince may be called a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> if he <hi>gratifie</hi>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:114876:135"/>
                     <hi>not his people, or his Nobility and People with ſuch Laws and Liberties as</hi> they conceived <hi>to be</hi> fitteſt <hi>for them;</hi> or ſhall endeavour to retain ſo much of that ſoveraign power, derived upon him by a long deſcent of Royal Anceſtors, by which he may be able to defend and protect his ſubjects. But when you preſs me to this point, that if I do not grant the former, <hi>I muſt needs confeſs, that not the favour of the Princes, nor the uſurpation of the People, but the infirmity of the Monarchy cauſed the Commonwealth of</hi> Lacedemon, I ſhall in part confeſs it, and in part deny it. For I ſhall willingly confeſs that the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Monarchy might occaſion the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Commonwealth, looking upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, as it was broken and unſetled during the raign of <hi>Carilaus;</hi> and yet ſhall abſolutely deny that there was any ſuch <hi>infirmity</hi> or <hi>inſufficiency</hi> in the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> till the reins of Government were let looſe by the folly of <hi>Euripon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10 More then this is not ſaid by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> where he tells us that both Kings &amp; People agreed upon the calling home of <hi>Licurgus,</hi> for remedying ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders as were grown amongſt them. And leſs is not ſaid by <hi>Plutarch</hi> then is ſaid by me, where I affirm that whatſoever the Kings loſt, the people got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the alteration, as being left out of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in affairs of State, and having thirty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters inſtead of two, which you pronounce to be a <hi>ſtrange Affirmation,</hi> becauſe, ſay you, it was ordered by the Oracle, that when the people were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. <hi>The Senate ſhould propoſe and diſmiſs the people without ſuffering</hi> them to debate; and if they were not ſuffered to debate ſuch buſineſſes as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:114876:136"/>
by the Senate, what other imployment could be left them in affairs of State, <hi>praeter obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quii gloriam,</hi> beſides the Reputation of obedient Citizens: But for this ſore <hi>you have a plaiſter, and tell us that if the people had had no right to debate, they muſt therefore have had the right to reſolve, or elſewhere to be aſſembled for nothing.</hi> It may be neither ſo nor ſo, but that the common people of <hi>Sparta</hi> were called unto the publick aſſemblies, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England</hi> were antiently and originally ſummoned to the Court of Parliament, that is to ſay, <hi>Ad conſentiendum, &amp; faciendum</hi> to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and yield obedience to thoſe Lawes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which by the Great Council of the Peers and Prelates (<hi>de communi conſilio regni noſtri</hi>) as the Writ ſtill runneth) ſhould be concluded and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on. So that you might have ſpared the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Explication of it, or the deſtant of <hi>Tyrteus</hi> upon the ſame; unleſs you could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from any of them, or from altogether, that the people of <hi>Sparta</hi> were poſſeſſed of a <hi>negative voice,</hi> and therewith of a power to fruſtrate the proceedings of the Kings and Senate, which if they had, the <hi>ultimate Reſult</hi> (as you truly ſay) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the ſoveraign power in Government muſt remain in them: And then the Government of <hi>Sparta,</hi> had been as meerly Popular and <hi>Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> as of moſt other Cities in <hi>Greece;</hi> but by no means to be accounted for an <hi>Ariſtocratie,</hi> by which name <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe, and moſt of our great Maſters in the Schools of <hi>Politie</hi> do moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call it. And therefore when <hi>Iſocrates</hi> ſaith, (as here cited by you) <hi>that the</hi> Lacedemonians

                     <hi>flouriſh'd for this cauſe eſpecially that their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Popular.</hi> The word (<hi>Popular</hi>) is not to be underſtood in the ſtricter ſence, as differing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from that which they called an <hi>Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> conſiſting of ſome part of the people, though the wealthier, better, and more underſtanding men amongſt them, but as it did diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>Regall</hi> or <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government in which neither the whole body of the People, nor any of the better, wealthier, and more ſober men could pretend a ſhare.</p>
                  <p>11. And now at laſt you come to the inſtitution of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> affirmed by me (and I had <hi>Plutarch</hi> for my Author) to be ordained by <hi>Theopompus</hi> the 9th. <hi>King</hi> of the ſecond Houſe (with the conſent of <hi>Polydorus</hi> his Colleague) to curb the inſolencies of the Senate, in which (you ſay) that <hi>I make that to be a practiſe of the Kings againſt the Senate which by your Author is plain to have been a combination of the Kings, and the Senate againſt the people:</hi> If ſo, my Author muſt contradict himſelf, I am ſure of that, For poſitively, he aſcribes the inſtitution of the <hi>Ephori</hi> to no other end but the controlling of the Senate, nor unto any other perſon or perſons, then to <hi>Theopompus,</hi> as out of my Book againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> you relate the ſtory: That which you tell us out of <hi>Plutarch</hi> in another place, is told by <hi>Plutarch</hi> upon another occaſion; which was indeed a <hi>combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings and Senate</hi> againſt the people, and a juſt one too. For as your ſelf relates the paſſage out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> the people upon the inſolency and predominancy of the Kings and the Senate fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on councel how to defend themſelves, and ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:114876:137"/>
the power of Debate; and that <hi>hereupon the Kings</hi> Theopompus <hi>and</hi> Polydore <hi>would have added unto the tenour of the Oracle; that if the people went about by debate to change the Propoſitions of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, it ſhould be lawful for the Kings and the Senate to null the Reſult of the people.</hi> This I acknowledg to be true. But this makes nothing to the inſtitution of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> of which <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaks nothing in that place, though he did ſoon after. But whereas you ſubjoyn that the <hi>people incenſed</hi> at <hi>the practiſe,</hi> put a <hi>bit into the mouth of the Senate by the inſtitution of</hi> the Ephori, you make therein a groſſer addition to the words of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> then the two Kings and the Senate did to the words of the Oracle: And then whereas you tell us out of <hi>Plato, that the</hi> Ephorate <hi>was ſet up againſt the haereditary power of the Kings;</hi> you either do miſtake your Author, or elſe muſt make him contradict himſelf as much in this place, as you did <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the other: <hi>Plato</hi> affirming in the place which you find cited in the Margin of the Book, againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> (ſo you pleaſe to call it) that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did not onely ordain the Senate, but that he did alſo conſtitute the <hi>Ephorate</hi> for the ſtrength and preſervation of the Regal power. But granting, that it may be ſaid by <hi>Plato</hi> in his 3 <hi>de legibus</hi> (as you cite the place) <hi>that the</hi> Ephorate <hi>was ſet up againſt the Hereditary power of Kings;</hi> what reaſon have you to believe, but that <hi>Plato</hi> might as well be miſtaken in the end and purpoſe, for which the <hi>Ephori</hi> were ordained, as in the firſt Author of that inſtitution, which he makes to be <hi>Lycurgus</hi> himſelf, contrary to <hi>Ariſtotle, Plutarch,</hi> and all other writers. And finally, whereas you tell
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:114876:137"/>
us, That <hi>Cicero</hi> (agreeing in this point with <hi>Plato</hi>) hath affirmed, that the <hi>Ephori</hi> in <hi>Lacedemon were ſo oppoſite to the Kings, as the</hi> Tribune <hi>in</hi> Rome <hi>to the</hi> Conſuls: You make therein an Argument againſt your ſelf; and I prove it thus. As the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were firſt ordained to oppoſe the <hi>Conſuls,</hi> ſo were the <hi>Ephori</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> inſtituted to oppoſe the Kings; but the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were not ordained at firſt to oppoſe the Kings, but only to interpoſe in behalf of the people; therefore the <hi>Ephori</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> were not inſtituted to oppoſe the Kings.</p>

The conference between <hi>Theopompus</hi> and his Queen, touching his unadviſedneſs in ordaining theſe popular Officers, and that which might enſue upon it, you relate them no otherwiſe then I do; but that you ſlight the womans foreſight into buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as not worth the noting; indeed it had not been worth the noting, if ſhe had reproved that in the King, which was the fact of the people only: nor have you made any Anſwer to the other two Arguments, by which I prove that the <hi>Ephori</hi> were inſtituted by the Kings, and by none but them; which might make a credulous man believe, that they are unanſwerable, becauſe unanſwered: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being of ſuch weight, I ſhall add nothing to them, to make them more weightier then they be, but an explication of the ſecond: That ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument I derive from the words of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> (as they ſtand in <hi>Plutarch</hi>) in which he lets the people know, that one reaſon why the <hi>Ephori</hi> were inſtituted by the former Kings, was, that the Kings being inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in forreign wars, might have ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain friends to ſit in judgment in their ſtead, whom
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:114876:138"/>
they called <hi>Ephori.</hi> And hereupon I may very well infer thus much, That if the people had firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this <hi>Ephori</hi> (as you ſay they did) they would have choſen them out of ſuch of their own number whom they might confide in; and not have choſen them out of thoſe, who being the Kings eſpecial friends, muſt have a different intereſt from that of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>13. Your diſcourſe about the <hi>Ephori</hi> drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an end, you charge me with <hi>omitting as well the ruine of the Ballance, as the corruption of the Common wealth,</hi> which did thence ariſe; and you charge it on me to this purpoſe, <hi>That picking up my objections againſt the Government in vigor, out of the rubbiſh and diſſolution of it, I may caſt ouſt in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The firſt of which two charges is againſt all Reaſon; for why ſhould I be charged with omitting that which was extrinſecal unto my project and deſign, it being no part of my intent, to take notice of the ſeveral changes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the State of <hi>Sparta;</hi> but only of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> their inſolencies towards their King, and their final ruine. And the other of theſe charges is againſt all truth; for how doth it appear, or poſſibly can be made apparent, that I have uſed any Article for caſting duſt into mens eyes, the better to perſwade them to give credit to any thing which may ſerve my turn; when I have ſaid nothing in all this buſineſs about the <hi>Ephori,</hi> but what is juſtified by the Authority of the moſt famous <hi>Stateſ-men,</hi> and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:114876:138"/>
renowned Writers, who have committed to our knowledge, the true condition of Affairs in that Common-wealth; ſo that you might have ſpared the ſtory of <hi>Hipitadeus,</hi> the ſelling of his lot or his portion of Lands, contrary to the Laws of <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> the following of that bad example by other men, and the reducing of all the Free-holders in that Common-wealth, to the number of 100. only, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you had found any thing in that Book of mine, which had ſounded contrary unto it: But whereas you infer in that which followeth, That the ingroſſing the Lands of that Common wealth into ſuch few hands, altered the Government into an <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> that by this it was no <hi>Oligarchy</hi> that <hi>Agis</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and that in reference to this <hi>Oligarchy, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> called the Government of <hi>Sparta</hi> by the name of Tyranny; in all theſe things you may be ſaid to caſt duſt into the eyes of the Readers, that they may not ſee the light of truth: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Government of the State of <hi>Sparta,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the Kings and Senate, remained only as it was before by the Laws of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> (the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the <hi>Ephori</hi> being added to it) not altered any thing at all, by the ingroſſing of the Lands of that Common-wealth into thoſe few hands: Nor was it by the Authority of thoſe ingroſſers (whom you call the <hi>Oligarchy</hi>) though poſſible enough at their inſtigation, that <hi>Agis</hi> was murthered by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori:</hi> nor was it finally in relation to theſe Ingroſſers that the Government of <hi>Sparta</hi> was called a tyranny (there was no reaſon why it ſhould) both by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> but only in reference to the unparaleld cruelties and abominable inſolencies of the <hi>Ephori,</hi>

                     </gap>, that the <hi>Ephorate</hi> (and not the <hi>Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> of Ingroſſers) was an abſolute Tyranny. <hi>Thus have you fetcht Arguments against an</hi> Oligarchy in the State of <hi>Sparta,</hi> which you find not in it: And for the cloſe of all, you ſay, <hi>That whereas</hi> Agis <hi>and</hi> Cleomenes, <hi>by the reſtitution of the Lots of</hi> Licurgus, <hi>were</hi> aſſertors <hi>of</hi> popular <hi>power,</hi> they are <hi>inſinuated by me, to have been</hi> aſſertors <hi>of</hi> Monarchy. But firſt, <hi>the reſtitution of the Lots of</hi> Licurgus, by the induſtry and endeavours of thoſe two Kings, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not at all the power of the people, who were ſtill kept under as before, but only reduced them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that equality in reſpect of Riches, which might ſecure them from being trampled on, and inſulted over by their fellow Commoners. And ſecondly, it appears by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that the deſigne of thoſe two Kings in that reſtitution, was to get glory to the one, and preſervation to the other; which could not be effected, but by gaining the good will of the common people, and make them ſure unto their ſide, whenſoever they ſhould be ready for that great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of deſtroying the <hi>Ephori.</hi> And ſo much in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that part of your Letter, which concerns the riſe, inſolencies, and deſtruction of thoſe <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Villains,</hi> which <hi>Calvin</hi> makes his firſt example for <hi>oppoſing Kings.</hi>
                  </p>

was ſaid before. And having laid down the words of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which occaſioned this diſcourſe between us. you cannot but confeſs that what he ſaith of <hi>Demarchy</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> is a plain miſtake, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers (as you truly ſay) of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and then why he may not be as much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in the <hi>Spartan Ephori,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,</hi> as in the <hi>Athenian Demarchy</hi> you can ſhow no reaſon.

                     <hi>world can</hi> be able to <hi>ſhow</hi> me. And this we may the better ſee by looking on their power in matters which concern the publique, in the Realm of <hi>Spaine;</hi> the Kings and people whereof (thoſe of <hi>Portugal</hi> excepted onely) are of <hi>Gothick</hi> race, and therefore likely to retain moſt of the <hi>Gothick Moddels:</hi> And looking on it, we ſhall find firſt, that their <hi>Curias</hi> or General conventions conſiſt there (as in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) of the three Eſtates, Prelate, Peer, and People.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, that though the Government of that King, be not ſo Arbitrary <hi>Deſpotical</hi> as it is in <hi>France;</hi> yet, he both rules and manageth thoſe Conventions to his own contentment. For neither can they meet together but by his appointment; nor are their acts and conſultations of any effect, further then as they are confirmed by the Kings conſent; nor finally can they ſit any longer, or depart any ſooner, then as it may ſtand moſt with the Kings conveniency. But <hi>Bodin</hi> goes a little further. And having ſhowed us with what Reverence and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the the three Eſtates of <hi>France</hi> addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th. in a convention held at <hi>Tours,</hi> (at what time the Authority of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies was greater and more eminent then it hath been ſince) affirms expreſly, <hi>Majorem etiam Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiam &amp; majus obſequium Hispanorum regi Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiberi.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath more obedience and obſervance from his three Eſtates, then that which was afforded to the King of <hi>France.</hi> The General conventions of both Kingdoms being much alike, may ſeem to have been caſt in the ſame mould (for the <hi>French</hi> neighbouring the <hi>Goths,</hi> who then poſſeſt thoſe Provinces in the Realm of <hi>France</hi> which lie on
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:114876:140"/>
the weſt ſide of the <hi>Loire,</hi> could not but know the manner of thoſe Aſſemblies which <hi>Charles Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi> thought good to introduce, and ſettle in the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> that giving them ſome influence in the publick Government, and binding them unto him by ſo great a favour, he might make uſe of their Authority to preſerve his own, as his Son <hi>Pepin</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did to obtain the Crown. But that the. Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Eſtates in either Kingdom did take upon them to fine, impriſon, or to depoſe or murder any of their Kings, as the <hi>Tribunes</hi> ſometimes did the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, and the Ephori did the Kings of <hi>Sparta,</hi> you cannot eaſily prove out of all their ſtories.</p>
                  <p>15. But you go on (and tell me firſt, that <hi>the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in a</hi> Gothiſh Moddel, <hi>are ſuch by virtue of their eſtates,</hi> that is of their <hi>over ballance in dominion;</hi> and then you put it upon me to ſhow both <hi>why the over ballance in dominion ſhould not amount to Empire,</hi> and <hi>practically that it amounteth not to</hi> Empire in quiet and well governed times. But this, by your leave, is a ſtrange way of Diſputation, by cutting out what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>work you pleaſe, and ſending it to me to make it up as well as I can: But being ſent to me, I am bound to diſpatch it out of hand for your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then firſt, that the Eſtates in a <hi>Gothiſh Moddel,</hi> are not ſuch by virtue of their Eſtates, that is to ſay, by being above the reſt of the people in titles of Honour and Revenue, which you call an <hi>over ballance in Dominion.</hi> For were it ſo, they were of power to exerciſe the ſame Authority, as you ſuppoſe the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and the <hi>Ephori</hi> to have done before them in all times alike, and not when
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:114876:141"/>
they are called together by the Kings command. For being Maſters of their Eſtates, as well out of as in thoſe Generall Aſſemblies and Conventions, and conſequently in all times alike; what reaſon can you ſhow me that they ſhould make no uſe of that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which belongs to them in right of their Eſtates, but in thoſe General Aſſemblies and Conventions onely.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If they have that power <hi>by virtue of their Eſtates,</hi> and yet cannot exerciſe, but in ſuch <hi>Conventions;</hi> how doth it come to paſs that ſuch Conventions are not of their own appointment, but onely at the pleaſure and command of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kings?</p>
                  <p>And Thirdly, If they hold and enjoy that Power <hi>by virtue of their ſaid Eſtates,</hi> you may do well to ſhow ſome reaſon, why all that are above the reſt of the people in Titles of Honour and Revenue, ſhould not be called to thoſe aſſembly of Eſtates, but onely ſome few out of every Order, (as in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>) to repreſent the reſt of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Orders: For being equal or ſomewhat near to an equality with one another in Eſtates and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, thoſe which were pretermitted have the greater wrong, in not being ſuffered to make uſe of that natural power which their <hi>over balance in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> hath conferred upon them. And then I would be glad to right whether this <hi>over ballance in Dominion</hi> be aſcribed unto them, in reference to the King or the common people: If in relation to the King, you put the King into no better condition then any one of his ſubjects by making him accomptable to ſo many Maſters; who may ſay to him whenſoever
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:114876:141"/>
they ſhall meet together, <hi>Redde rationem villicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis tuae,</hi> and tell him plainly, <hi>That he muſt give up an account of his ſtewardſhip,</hi> for <hi>he ſhall be no longer ſteward.</hi> And then have Kings done very ill in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo many of their ſubjects to ſo great a Power, and calling them together to make uſe of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which they may make uſe of if they pleaſe to his deſtruction. And if they have this <hi>over-ballance of Dominion,</hi> in reference onely to the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, above whom they are raiſed in Eſtates and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; what then becomes of that natural liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mankind, that underived Majeſty of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people which our great Maſters in the School of <hi>Politie</hi> have ſo much cryed up. The people muſt needs take it as ill as the King, to be deprived of their natural Liberty, without giving their conſent unto it, or to be depoſed from that Majeſty which is inherent in themſelves, without deriving it from any but their firſt Creator. But on the other ſide, if the three <hi>Eſtates in a Gothick Moddel,</hi> receive that power, which they enjoy in thoſe Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons either from the hands of the King, as the Lords Spiritual and Temporal (which make up two of the three Eſtates) did here in <hi>England,</hi> or from the hands of the People, as the 3d. <hi>Eſtate</hi> have done in all Kingdoms elſe, (which is the generall opinion and practiſe of all Nations too) you muſt ſtand ſingle by your ſelf in telling me that they have that power <hi>by virtue of thoſe Eſtates</hi> which they are poſſeſt of. And this may alſo ſerve to ſhow you, that an <hi>over ballance in Dominion,</hi> or the greatneſs of <hi>Eſtate</hi> which ſome ſubjects have above the reſt, amounteth not to ſuch an <hi>Empire</hi> as may give them
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:114876:142"/>
any power over Prince or people, unleſs it can be ſhowed as I think it cannot, that the King doth not over ballance them in the point of Dominion, as they do the reſt of their fellow ſubjects, or that the whole body of the people cannot as well pretend to Dominion over themſelves, as any of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubjects can pretend to have over them: And then if this Dominion do amount to an Empire alſo, we ſhall have three Empires in one Kingdom; that is to ſay, the King, the three Eſtates, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, I have not weigh'd all Orders and degrees of men in ſo even a ſcale as to reſolve which of them ballanceth, counter-ballanceth, or over-ballanceth the other; which muſt be various and uncertain, according to the Lawes of ſeverall Countrys, and the different conſtitutions of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Governments. And I conceive it altogether as impoſſible to make a new Garment for the Moon, which may as well fit her in the full, as in her wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and increaſings; as to accommodate theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphiſical ſpeculations to the rules of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which varying in all places muſt have different forms: And having different forms, muſt have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ballances according to the Lawes and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of each ſeveral Country. And yet I am not altogether ſo dimme ſighted as not to ſee what theſe <hi>new Notions</hi> (which otherwiſe indeed would prove new Nothings) do moſt chiefly aim at; the chief deſign of many of the late Diſcourſes, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently no other then to put the ſupream Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the hands of the common people, or at leaſt into the hands of thoſe whom they ſhall chuſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:114876:142"/>
for their Truſtees and Repreſentors; which if it could be once effected, the underived Majeſty of the common people would not appear ſo viſibly in any one perſon whatſoever, as in thoſe Truſtees and Repreſentors, and then the King or ſupream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate being thus out ſhined, would ſeem no other then a Star of the leſſer Magnitude, which though moving in an higher ſphere, ſhould neither give the light nor impart ſuch influences to the world, as the two Great <hi>Luminaries</hi> (ſuch as you fancy the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates</hi> in a <hi>Gothick Moddel</hi>) in caſe he prove not rather a <hi>falling Star,</hi> as perhaps he may. But ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping you will pardon this irruption in me, I proceed unto the ſecond part of your Letter, in which I am ſaid to ſpeak rather like a Divine then a Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: And yet not like a Divine neither, <hi>but like a Divine as I ſuppoſe,</hi> and no more then ſo.</p>
                  <p>17. But letting all things be as they may, you tell me that I aske of <hi>Calvin,</hi> in <hi>what part of the word of God we may finde any ſuch Authority given to popular Magiſtrates as he tells us of.</hi> And for an anſwer hereunto, you prepare the <hi>way</hi> by laying down the conſtitution of the Government of the people of Iſrael, which you affirm to have been founded on a popular ballance. And were it ſo, there is no queſtion to be made, but that a <hi>popular ballance</hi> even by <hi>the Ordinance of God himſelf in Scripture,</hi> both did and may <hi>amount to Empire; for who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rt thou O man, which diſputeſt with God,</hi> or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt in queſtion any of the Divine Acts of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly providence. The Queſtion will be onely this, Whether the Government of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:114876:143"/>
founded in a popular ballance, which you ſay it was, and I think rather that it was not: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I think ſo I ſhall ſhow anon, and in the mean time I will look upon the Argument which you ſuppoſe it to be proved, <hi>We find</hi> (ſay you) <hi>the people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>iudging the tribe of</hi> Benjamine, <hi>and by the Oracle of God leavying War againſt them;</hi> Which being <hi>an act of ſoveraign power,</hi> declares that Government <hi>to be founded on a popular ballance.</hi> But firſt, it appears not by the text, that all the people of Iſrael did ſit as Judges on the tribe of <hi>Benjamine,</hi> the judgement might be paſſed (for what you can ſay to the contrary) by the <hi>Elders</hi> onely, that is to ſay, the heads or chiefs of the ſeveral families of the tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and nothing but the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſentences by them committed to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It appears not by the Text, that the War was leavied againſt the <hi>Benjamites</hi> by any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of God, but the contrary rather; For it is ſaid, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were gathered <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one man,</hi> at a place called <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> that they reſolved upon the War, and concluded how to have it carried before they asked Councel of the Lord, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. 18. And when they asked councel of the Lord, it was not whether they ſhould proceed in the War or not, (that being a thing reſolved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand) but which of the tribes ſhould <hi>go up firſt to the battail again the children of</hi> Benjamin, as in the Book of <hi>Judges, Cap</hi> 20. 18. which probably might be the cauſe of their ill ſucceſs in the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, as having engaged themſelves in a bloody War againſt their brethren, before they ſought for
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:114876:143"/>
councel at the Oracle of God, as they ſhould have done. And therefore, Thirdly, this rather ſhowes the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be under no Government at all, then to be governed by a Democratical or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular form; and ſerves as a moſt excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on the laſt words of the book of <hi>Judges,</hi> viz: <hi>In thoſe dayes there was no King in</hi> Iſrael: <hi>every Man did that which was right in his own eyes.</hi> Had it been under any one form of Government; (<hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular</hi> or <hi>Democratical,</hi> call it what you will) every man <hi>durſt not to have done that which is right in his own eyes,</hi> though there had been at that time no King in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And as they were not under any popular Government, by which they might have been reſtrained from doing <hi>what was right in their</hi> own eyes; ſo you confeſs that they were not at that time under the Government of the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> for ſpeaking of that paſſage in the firſt of <hi>Judges, where</hi> Judah <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Simeon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Brother, come up with me into my lot, that we may fight againſt the</hi> Canaanites <hi>and I likewiſe will go with thee into thy lot, ſo</hi> Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>went with him, &amp;c.</hi> you thereupon infer, that <hi>by this leaguing at their pleaſure one with another, it was plain the</hi> Sanhedrim, <hi>their common Ligament was broken,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> being broken, the Kings not inſtituted, nor any form of popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſet up among them by common conſent; nothing remains, but that they muſt be governed by the Heads or Chiefs of the ſeveral Families into which the Tribes were Generally divided in thoſe times. Had there been any ſuch Councel, or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht body, as that of the Generall Eſtates of the united Provinces; or that of the <hi>Cantons</hi> and their

                  <p>18. And here I ſhould proceed to the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that part of your Letter which concerns the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> as being the point of greateſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between us in the preſent buſineſs. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that you have ſpent ſo much of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, about the Original inſtitution and authority of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and conſequently of all thoſe who have enjoyed that power and dignity in their ſeverall Countrys; I ſhall firſt lay all together which you have deliver'd on that ſubject, with my opinion in the ſame as it comes before me. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereunto, I am firſt to ſay, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that people, when they were in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was under the Heads or Chiefes of their ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, who by a paternal right derived on them from their firſt Father <hi>Adam,</hi> challenged and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd a Fatherly authority over all thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of them: And unto theſe did <hi>Moſes</hi> addreſs himſelfe, when he was to communicate from the Lord that moſt joyful news of their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> called by the name of <hi>Elders</hi> in the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> 3. 16. &amp; 4. 29 not called ſo onely, <hi>becauſe they were in honour onely amongſt the reſt of the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> (as you ſeem to ſay) but becauſe they were above them alſo in this point of power. The people elſe had had no remedy in any differences and debates which might riſe amongſt them, but
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:114876:144"/>
ſuing in the Courts of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> which it was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for them to do, as it was amongſt the Primitive Chriſtians, to go to Law with one another in <hi>Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> differences, and that before the <hi>unbelievers.</hi> But this diſperſed authority being united in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (as many lines united in one <hi>Center</hi> from a large <hi>circumference</hi>) the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people did remain in him till by the advice of <hi>Jethro,</hi> they were divided and ſub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>divided into ſeveral Companies. Each of them having over him their appointed Rulers; By Gods appointment afterwards, a ſtanding Court of 70. <hi>Elders,</hi> which they called the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> were choſen to bear part of the publick Government (but whether choſen out of the <hi>Jethronian</hi> Judges or not, we ſhall ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non) <hi>Moſes</hi> being dead, and <hi>Joſuah</hi> who ſucceeded in the ſupream Authority, being alſo gathered by his Fathers, the authority of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> dying alſo with them, as your ſelf confeſſeth; the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Government returned again to the heads of the ſeveral Families, as before in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary being veſted in thoſe ſeveral Judges, whom God raiſed up from time to time, to free them from the power of thoſe cruel Enemies, from whoſe <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> they were not able otherwiſe to have freed themſelves.

                  <p>19. Before this time, that is to ſay, after the deaths of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> (who were <hi>Kings</hi> in fact, though not in title) the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had no <hi>King</hi> to Raign over them but the Lord himſelf; from whom they firſt received their Laws, from whoſe mouth they received direction in all caſes of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and from whoſe hands they received protection in all times of danger: And when they had any viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge or ſupream Governour, God did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raign in their perſons, in regard of that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate vocation which they had from him; but alſo of the gifts of the Spirit, and the co-operation of his Grace and Power: In which reſpect, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Iſraelites, during that interval of time, is called by many learned Writers, by the name of <hi>Theocratie,</hi> or the immediate Government of the Lord himſelf: And this the Lord himſelf not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely intimates, when he ſaid to <hi>Samuel, They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me,</hi> ne reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſuper eos, <hi>that I ſhould not raign over them.</hi> I know the general ſtream of Writers, do underſtand theſe words as words of diſlike and indignation, in that the people ſeemed to be weary of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in their deſire of having a King, like to other Nations; but I conceive (with all due reverence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:114876:145"/>
thoſe who opine the contrary) that God ſpake theſe words rather to comfort <hi>Samuel,</hi> whom he found much diſpleaſed and troubled at the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elders, as if a greater injury had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to himſelf, then was done to the Prophet; then out of any diſlike which he had of the matter: For if he had diſliked the matter, that is, that they ſhould have a King like other Nations; he neither would have fore ſignified it as a bleſſing on the ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Gen.</hi> 17. or as prerogative of <hi>Judah, Gen.</hi> 49. nor have foretold the people, that when they ſhould deſire a King, <hi>they ſhould ſet him to be King over them, whom the Lord their God ſhall chuſe, Deut.</hi> 17. nor would he have commanded <hi>Samuel</hi> to give them a King as they deſired, nor have directed him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to that very man whom he had deſigned for the Kingdom. But on the contrary ſay you, we find it otherwiſe in the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> where the Lord ſaid unto the people, <hi>That he had given them a King in his anger</hi> (that is (as you affirm) in <hi>Saul) and that he took him away in his wrath</hi> (that is (ſay you) in the Captivity) <hi>Hos.</hi> 13. 11. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you alledge another paſſage in the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>ch. 8. v.</hi> 4. where it is ſaid, <hi>They have ſet up Kings, and not by me; they have made Princes and I knew it not:</hi> But for all this, your explication of the one Text, and your application of the other, are alike erroneous. The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Jerohoam,</hi> ſon of <hi>Joah,</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and directed the words of his Propheſy to the people chiefly, as they were ſeparated and abſtracted from the Realm of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And firſt, beginning with the laſt, it appears plainly by the verſe foregoing, that
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:114876:146"/>
the words by you cited, are addreſſed particularly to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and it had been hard dealing in the Prophet, to charge the ten Tribes with ſetting up of Kings, but not by him, had it been ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Saul,</hi> as you ſay it was; when it was the fault (if it were a fault) of all the twelve; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith S. <hi>Hierome, Poteſt hoc quod dicit (ipſi reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naverunt, &amp; non, &amp;c.)

And then the meaning of the other Text will be plainly this, <hi>I gave thee</hi> (or I gave thee leave to have) <hi>a King in mine anger,</hi> that is to ſay in <hi>Jeroboham</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who by with-drawing the people from the worſhip of God, to worſhip the golden Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> is ſaid to have made Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſin, and thereby plagued them irremediouſly (without repentance) into the heavy anger and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the Lord their God: <hi>And I took him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in my wrath,</hi> that is to ſay, in the perſon of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheah,</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> carried away captive, together with the greateſt part of his people, into the land of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> the people being diſperſed

in the ſeveral Provinces of that <hi>Empire,</hi> never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning ſince that time, to their native Country, nor having any King of their own to raign over them as afore they had. Not to ſay any thing of many of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> treacherouſly ſlain by their own ſubjects, out of an ambitious deſire to obtain the Kingdom; of whom it may be juſtly ſaid, That God <hi>took them away in his wrath,</hi> before they had lived out their full time in the courſe of nature. Nothing in theſe two Texts which relates to <hi>Saul,</hi> and the captivity, that is to ſay, the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> as you underſtand it. <hi>Such is your play with</hi> holy Scripture, when you ſpeak (<hi>as you ſuppoſe) like a Divine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. But you have another uſe to make of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> whoſe words you cite unto a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he never meant, namely to prove that Kings are not of <hi>Divine Right:</hi> For having ſaid, that ſuch <hi>Divines who will alwaies have Kings to be of divine right, are not to be hearkned too, ſeeing they affirm that which is clean contrary to Scripture;</hi> you add, <hi>that in this caſe,</hi> ſaid Hoſea, <hi>they have ſet up Kings, and not by me, they have made Princes, and I knew it not.</hi> But firſt, theſe words are not ſpoken by the Prophet touching the inſtitution of Kings in General, but onely of a particular fact in the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by with drawing themſelves from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and ſetting up a King of their own without conſulting with the Lord, or craving his approbation and conſent in the buſineſs. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If it may be ſaid that Kings are not of <hi>Divine Right</hi> and inſtitution, becauſe God ſaith here by the Prophet, that ſome Kings have been ſet up, but
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:114876:147"/>
not by him, you have more reaſon to affirm, that Kings are of <hi>Divine Right</hi> and inſtitution, becauſe he ſaith in another place, leſs capable of any ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction as you make of this) <hi>by me Kings reign.</hi> All Kings are ſaid to reign by God, becauſe all reign by his appointment, by his permiſſion, at the leaſt. And yet ſome Kings may be truly <hi>ſaid not to reign by him,</hi> either becauſe they are <hi>ſet up</hi> by the people in a tumultuous and ſeditious way, againſt the natural Kings and Princes; or elſe becauſe they come unto their Crowns by uſurpation, blood, and violence, contrary to his will revealed, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht Laws of their ſeverall Countrys. Which Argument if it ſhould be good, we could not have a ſtronger againſt ſuch <hi>Papiſts</hi> as <hi>hold alwayes</hi> (for it ſeems no mater if they did hold ſo but ſomtimes) that the Pope by <hi>Divine right</hi> is head of the univerſall Church; then by ſhowing them out of their own Hiſtories, how many Popes have raiſed themſelves into that See, either by open faction, or by ſecret bribery, and by violent and unjuſt intruſion. Of whom it may be ſaid, and that not improperly, that though they pretend to be <hi>Chriſts</hi> Vicars, and the ſucceſſors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> yet were they never plac't by Chriſt in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair. Now to diſpute from the <hi>perſons</hi> to the <hi>power,</hi> and from the unjuſt wayes of acquiring that <hi>power,</hi> to the original right and inſtitution of it, is ſuch a ſorry piece of <hi>Logick,</hi> as you blaming thoſe <hi>who diſpute from the folly of a people againſt an Ordinance of God.</hi> For upon what ground elſe do you lay the foundation of the legall Government (eſpecially amongſt the <hi>Hebrews) but on the folly of the people.</hi> p. 11. the <hi>imprudence and importunity of the people</hi> p. 14. upon which
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:114876:147"/>
ground alſo you build the ſupream authority of the Judges, who onely by the meet <hi>folly of the people came to be ſet up in Iſrael,</hi> p. 13. But certainly if their deſires to have a King were <hi>folly,</hi> and <hi>impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in them, it muſt be <hi>felix fatuitas,</hi> a very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>imprudence,</hi> and a ſuccesful <hi>folly,</hi> I am ſure of that, that people never live in a ſettled condition till they come to the Government of Kings. For was it not by the fortunate conduct of their Kings, that they exterminated the reſt of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> broke the <hi>Amalekites</hi> in pieces, and cruſht the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the <hi>Phyliſtins,</hi> growing by that means for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable unto all their Neigbours? Was it not by the power and reputation of their Kings, that they gained ſome ſtrong Towns from the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and enlarged their Territories by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of ſome parts of <hi>Syria;</hi> that they grew ſtrong in ſhipping, and mannaged a wealthy trade from <hi>Eſion-Geber,</hi> in the ſtreights of <hi>Babel-Mandel,</hi> to the Land of <hi>Ophir,</hi> in the remoteſt parts of <hi>India?</hi> Proſperities ſufficient to juſtifie and endear ſuch bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, as by the alteration of the Government might be ſaid upon them.</p>
                  <p>21. From ſuch Divines in Generall, as will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways (I muſt keep that word) have Kings to be by <hi>divine Right,</hi> you come to me at laſt in my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, charging me <hi>that at a venture I will have Kings to be of Divine Right, and to be abſolute; whereas in truth</hi> (ſay you) <hi>if Divine Right be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto Kings from theſe of the Hebrews onely, it is moſt apparent that no abſolute King can be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt to anſwer for my ſelf (for having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

been a Parſon, (I ſhall take leave to Chriſten my own Child firſt) I think that I was never ſo raſh, nor ſo ill adviſed, as to ſpeak any thing at <hi>aventure in ſo</hi> great a point, as the originall inſtitution and <hi>divine right</hi> of Kings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I am ſure I have not ſo little ſtudied the Forms of Government, as to affirm any where in that Book againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> as you call it, that all Kings be <hi>abſolute.</hi> The ſecond Sect. of the ſixt Chapter, of that Book, being ſpent for the moſt part, in ſhewing the differences between conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Kings, and an abſolute Monarch.</p>
                  <p>And Thirdly, They muſt be as ſorry <hi>Divines,</hi> and as bad Hiſtorians as my ſelf, who aſcribe the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> Power, or the <hi>Divine right</hi> of Kings, to the firſt inſtitution of a King amongſt the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> For who knows not (if he know any thing in that kind) that there were Kings in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Scycionia</hi> in <hi>Peleponeſus,</hi> not long after the Flood; Kings of the <hi>Aborigines,</hi> and the <hi>Trojan</hi> race in <hi>Italy;</hi> in that of <hi>Athens, Argos</hi> and <hi>Micenae</hi> amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> of the <hi>Parthians, Syrians,</hi> &amp;c. in the Greater, and of <hi>Lydia</hi> in the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> long time before the Raign of <hi>Saul</hi> the firſt, King of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> all which were abſolute <hi>Monarchs</hi> in their ſeveral Countrys. And as once <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nulla gens tam barbara,</hi> that never Nation was ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but did acknowledge this principle, that there was a God; ſo will you hardly find any barbarous Nation, who acknowledge not the ſupream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Kings: And how then all Nations ſhould agree in giving themſelves over to the power and Government of Kings; I believe none cannot
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:114876:148"/>
ſhow me a better reaſon, then that they either did it by the light of natural reaſon, by which they found that Government to be fitteſt for them, or that the firſt Kings of every Nation, were the heads &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that retained that paternal right over all ſuch as deſcended of them, as might entitle their authority to <hi>divine inſtitution.</hi> For proof whereof, (ſince you have ſuch a prejudice againſt Divines) you need look no farther then your ſelf, who tells us <hi>p.</hi> 12. That <hi>Kings no queſtion, where the ballance is Monarchical, are of</hi> Divine right; and <hi>if they be good,</hi> the greateſt bleſſing that the Government ſo ſtanding can be capable of; or if you will not ſtand to this, then look on the firſt Chapter of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Politicks, where he makes the Regall Government to ſtand upon no other bottom then paternal Authority. <hi>Initio civitates regibus parebant,</hi> &amp;c. At the firſt (ſaith he) Cities were Governed by Kings, and ſo ſtill at this day are ſuch Nations, as deſcended of men accuſtomed to the King by Government. For every houſhold is governed by the eldeſt, as it were by a King, and ſo conſequently are the Colonies or Companies multiplyed from thence, governed in like ſort for Kindreds ſake. Which words of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſeconded by the general practice of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I look on as a better Argument of the Original inſtitution &amp; <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Kings (that great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in the 4th.

from a <hi>contingent</hi> caſe to a matter of abſolute neceſſity (as from the making of the firſt King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of making Kings in all other Nations) unleſs you could have found ſome adverſary to contend withal. And with like thrift you might have ſaved your ſelf the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of proving that the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut. 17. v.</hi> 18. touching recourſe to be had unto the Judge (which ſhould be in thoſe dayes) in ſome certain caſes, inferred not a neceſſity, of having any ſuch ſupream Judge as God raiſed up from time to time, to govern and avenge his people in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt miſery, unleſs you have met with any (which I know not of) which truſt as much to that Text of Scripture for thoſe ſupream Judges, as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it for the Court of <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> of which more anon. The corollary wherewithal you cloſe this paſſage; I like well enough, had you grounded your diſcourſe on ſome clearer Text: For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as <hi>well as you, that thoſe Judges are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated by the will of God, but foreſeen onely by his providence, not impoſed by the Law, but provided by i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that the Reſtitution of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was fore-ſignified in theſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Hoſea, I will be thy King,</hi> cap. 13. 10. But if you have no better grounds for the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> then for the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of this Common-wealth, they are too weak for foundation of ſo great a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The Prophet ſpeaks in that place particularly to the houſe of <hi>Ephraim, v.</hi> 1. the people of the Realm of <hi>Iſrael v.</hi> 9. as appears more diſtinctly by their <hi>kiſſing the Calves</hi> (the Golden Calves <hi>of Dan and Bethel</hi>) v. 2. Of whoſe reduction to their native Country after their being carried away captive by <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> there is nothing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Scripture in the way of propheſie, nor no relation of it as a matter of Fact. Nor can you ſhow me any clear and evident text, by which I may be ſure that this <hi>Commonwealth</hi> was inſtituted by God, conſidering that <hi>Moſes</hi> during the whole time of his life governed authoritatively and ſupreamly without any <hi>appeal</hi> unto the people, or unto any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power either co-ordinate with him, or ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to him; which I believe is more thenyou can ſhow me in any Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> or any <hi>State-holder</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> or any other Prince in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which onely ſerve as ſecond Notions in a

And as for your <hi>Agrarian</hi> laws (your <hi>Popular Ballance,</hi> as elſewhere) upon which this Commonwealth is ſuppoſed to be ſettled; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it will be very hard for you to prove that alſo. For though the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was divided by <hi>Lot</hi> amongſt the Tribes, yet neither had the Tribes themſelves their equal portion, nor every family in thoſe Tribes, their equal ſhares in thoſe une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual <hi>portions</hi> with one another; ſome of the Tribes enjoying little or nothing of the <hi>lot</hi> which had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len unto them, and ſome of the Families of thoſe Tribes, being ſcattered up and down the Country, as <hi>Jacob</hi> had propheſied of <hi>Simeon</hi> in the Book of <hi>Gen.</hi> which utterly deſtroyes that <hi>popular Agrarian</hi> on which this Common-wealth is ſuppoſed to be founded, and in which (you ſay) they might have continued, but that they deſired to have a King like other Nations.</p>
                  <p>23. Your ſecond Argument for a preferring a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Eſtate before a Monarchy is derived from reaſon, and that reaſon grounded on the natural li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of all mankind; which cannot better be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

them in <hi>popular</hi> Governments. <hi>God never required</hi> (as you ſay). <hi>of any Man, or any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that they ſhould live otherwiſe then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their eſtate, that there are rules in Scripture to ſhow the duty of a ſervant</hi> to ſuch <hi>whoſe wants have made them ſervants;</hi> but that there is no <hi>rule in Scripture that obligeth</hi> a man unto the duty of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which can live of himſelf. And finally having askt this queſtion, <hi>whether God hath leſs regard of a Nation, then he hath of a man;</hi> you tax the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites for making themſelves ſervants by deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>a King</hi> to be ſet over them, when they might have continued as they were in a free condition. But firſt that natural liberty of Mankind, which our great <hi>Polititians</hi> ſo much talk of, hath no ground in nature, for as ſervants are bound by poſitive Lawes to obey their Maſters, ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> women are bound by the law of Nature to <hi>ſubmit themſelves unto their Husbands,</hi> and children by the ſame law to be obedient to their parents; This if the Scripture had not taught you, you might have learnt from <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> as he did from <hi>Homer,</hi> who in the ninth Book of his <hi>Odyſſees,</hi> gives this Aphoriſm, <hi>viz <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xori &amp; natis jus dicit quiſ<expan>

(<hi>Lex,</hi> being ſo called a <hi>Ligando,</hi> ſay the old <hi>Grammarians</hi>) in all ſuch caſes, concerning which the Laws are made by what power ſover.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:114876:151"/>24. But then ſay you, theſe laws are of their own making, not impoſed by others, which makes no alteration in the caſe at all; my fetters not being the eaſier to me, becauſe they are of my own mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then if they were made by the next Smith, or provided for me by ſome others: Beſides which you your ſelf have told us, that all ſuch Kings as claim by Scripture can be but regulated Monarchs, and <hi>could of right enact no Law, but by the ſuffrage of the people,</hi> pag. 15. Which is as notable a preſervative of the peoples liberty, as ever was enjoyed by them in a popular Government. O but ſay you, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a popular Government have a power to chuſe the Senate, which they have not in chuſing of their King, and that the people with ſuch a Senate, have power to make what Laws they pleaſe; and what can follow thereupon, <hi>but that a Government ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a Senate and people</hi> muſt be accounted for a Divine Inſtitution, and be called the <hi>Government of God,</hi> becauſe it is the <hi>Government of Laws and not of men,</hi> as you tell us, <hi>pag.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, how may we be aſſured, That a Senate ſo eſtabliſhed will not Lord it over the people with greater inſolency, and put more heavy preſſures on them then ever they ſuffered under Kings; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many in number, and all equal in power, every one of them will endeavour to enrich himſelf, and ſerve their turn upon the people, there being no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour power to controul them for it.</p>
                  <p>And next, how may we be aſſured, That the people (I mean the whole body of the people) have any power to chuſe their Senate, or that the Senate being choſen, they have a power in voting with them
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:114876:152"/>
for the making of Laws. The Famous Senate of the Romans, was ordained by Romulus their firſt King, their number doubled by <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus,</hi> and a third hundred added by <hi>Brutus,</hi> which continued in the firſt times of the <hi>Conſular</hi> Government, the people having no hand at all in the nomination: nor was it otherwiſe at <hi>Athens,</hi> though that was the moſt popular and <hi>Democratical</hi> Eſtate that ever was in the World; the main body of the people in each Citty, having as little to do in the choiſe of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as they had in making of their Laws.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, in the making of their Laws, none of the City of <hi>Athens</hi> were permitted to vote (or to give their voices) but ſuch as were accounted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled for Citizens; and none were either ſo enrolled or reckoned but the Chief of the City, all Servants, Labourers, Handicrafts-men, and Artificers (which make the far greater part in every City) not paſſing in account for Citizens, and conſequently having no voice nor power, either in making Laws, or elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, as it was in the <hi>Democratie</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> ſo was it in the <hi>Timocratie</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> the infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greateſt part of the Inhabi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s having no hand at all in the making of Laws, or in any other Act of Government, of what kind ſoever: For if a Law were paſt in Senate, none of inferiour Order had a ſuffrage in it: If it were made in the general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Centuries, thoſe of the Nobility agreeing together, might paſs a Law without the reſt; and whither they agreed or not, the Law was always p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſed by the other Centuries, before it came to the ſixt, conſiſting of the poorer ſort, which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:114876:152"/>
called unto the vote: They did in number far exceed all the other five Centuries.</p>
                  <p>And finally, if the Law were made in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Tribes, as all the poorer ſort (which made up the far greater part of the City) could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make any uſe of their voices in the Aſſembly of Centuries, ſo the Nobility (which made up the moſt conſiderable part of the City) were quite excluded from having any ſuffrage or voice at all in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Tribes. Admitting finally, that all the Inhabitants of <hi>Rome, Athens, Syracuſe,</hi> &amp;c. had vote in the Election of their Magiſtrates, and in the making of their Laws; yet what makes this unto thoſe multitudes of people, which live diſperſed in the Territories of thoſe mighty Cities, or in any of the remoter Provinces which were ſubject to them; who being infinitely more in number then the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of thoſe ſeveral and reſpective Cities, unto which they were ſubject, had neither voice in the Election of the Senate, or in the making of their Laws, or in any matter of concernment to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations; but will they, nill they, they muſt ſubmit to the will and pleaſure of their great Maſters in thoſe Cities, under whom they ſerved, though otherwiſe as able to ſubſiſt of themſelves, as any of the common ſort of people in thoſe Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. The like may be obſerved alſo, in ſome Common-wealths of a later ſtanding, in which the greater part of the people have no voice at all, as to the making of their Laws, or chuſing ſuch as are to make them for the uſe of the publique; and therefore are ſo far from having any part in the publique Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that for the moſt part they are Governed

againſt their wills. Such an imaginary ſpeculation, ſuch an empty nothing, is the ſuppoſed liberty of the people in a popular Government.</p>
                  <p>25. We muſt next ſee (notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid) how much you vilifie and contemn the <hi>Regal</hi> Government, in reſpect of that popular, which you chiefly drive at: For having told us, <hi>That the Government of the Senate and the people, is that only which is or can be the Government of Laws, and not of men; and that the Government of the Laws, and not of men, is the Government of God, and not of men;</hi> You tell us out of <hi>Ariſtotles Politiques, That he that is for the Governmens of Laws, is for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God; and he that is for the Government of a man, is for the Government of a Beaſt:</hi> But <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s words muſt be underſtood according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s time, <hi>Cum arbitria Principum pro legibus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> when the Subjects were Governed by no other Law, then the will of the Prince, and cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to any King or Monarch in the Chriſtian world, which have not only the Law of God for a rule in Government; but many poſitive Laws of their own eſtabliſhing, for the well ordering of the people in their ſeveral Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>You tell us ſecondly, That when the ballance is popular, as in <hi>Iſrael, in the Grecian in the Scicilian Tyrannies, Kings are the direſt curſe that can befall a Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But firſt (to pretermit the extream harſhneſs of the expreſſion) ſo far were Kings from being a curſe to the people of Iſrael, that (admitting the former Government to have been ſetled on <hi>Popular Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> as it never was) they proved the greateſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

I any where, that I can remember) that there lay an <hi>appeal</hi> from the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> unto <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe, though I make no queſtion but there did, and you have ſaid nothing to prove the contrary. For what makes this unto the purpoſe, that becauſe ome of the <hi>Iewiſh Rabbines</hi> &amp; the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> out of them, have told us, that as in the place of the <hi>Jethronian</hi> Judges, ſucceeded their Judges in the Gates, ſo the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> ſucceeded in the place of <hi>Moſes;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there lay no <hi>appeal</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> from the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi> or 70. <hi>Elders.</hi> For firſt, this may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, no otherwiſe, then that they came into the place of <hi>Moſes,</hi> after his deceaſe, or rather after the death of <hi>Joſuah,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Moſes</hi> till the firſt 70 were deceaſed. And Secondly, it may be underſtood, that <hi>they ſucceeded in the place of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, during that interval of time which paſt between the deſtruction of the Temple, and the captivity of the People, until the ſetling of the Government in the Race of the <hi>Maccabees:</hi> &amp; that which happened from the Reign of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, to the finall rooting out of that Nation by the Emperour <hi>Aerian,</hi> of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> times moſt of your great <hi>Rabines</hi> ſeem to ſpeak, &amp; in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> times neither any of the Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> after their reftitution by <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> or any of the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans</hi> were in place and power. <hi>Moſes</hi> had otherwiſe made himſelfe of no ſignificancy in the publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſtood but for a Cypher in the Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick of State, if he had not kept unto himſelf the <hi>Dernier Reſort</hi> in receiving any juſt appeals from that higher Court, as that both lawfully might, and did from the Courts beneath them. Which ſoleciſm in the Arts of Government had been committed by
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:114876:159"/>
                     <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> alſo, if he had left the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted power, from which there could be no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal (either <hi>Agrarimine</hi> or <hi>Sententia</hi>) to the Kings themſelves.</p>
                  <p>29. But then you ſay, That we need not go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Scripture for the certainty hereof, <hi>where the ſeventy are choſen, not to ſtand under</hi> Moſes, <hi>but with him; not to diminiſh his burden, or bear it under him, with an appeal in difficult caſes to him; as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Election of the</hi> Jethronian <hi>Elders; but to bear it with him, with out any mention of ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal:</hi> On which diſtinction, between bearing the burden <hi>with him,</hi> and <hi>under him,</hi> you raiſe this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>That if the ſeventy Elders were indeed insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to bear the burden with</hi> Moſes, <hi>therefore thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth lay no appeal unto him.</hi> But this foundation is too weak, for any Argument of weight to be built upon it; there being no ſuch difference betwixt the tearms, but that by bearing the burden <hi>with him,</hi> they might alſo bear it <hi>under him,</hi> as indeed they did. When <hi>Romulus</hi> ordained the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Aſſiſtants to him in the Government, and to bear part of the burden <hi>with him,</hi> did they not bear it alſo <hi>under him,</hi> aſwel as <hi>with him?</hi> And when a King elects ſome principal perſons to be of his Council, and to bear ſome part of that great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which is laid upon him, do they not therefore bear their part of the burden, as inferiour Miniſters or Counſellors of Eſtate, but as equals to him? I believe not ſo; I might enforce this matter further, but that the Scripture is ſo evident and expreſs againſt you. You grant that the <hi>Jethronian</hi> Judges did bear their part of the burden under <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:114876:159"/>
yet the Scripture ſays expreſly, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 22. that they did bear the burden with him; and therefore it muſt follow alſo, that though the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> was ſaid to ſtand with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to bear part of the burden <hi>with</hi> him, yet they did bear it <hi>under</hi> him alſo, as the others did; which notwithſtanding you conclude, <hi>That if the ſeventy Elders were indeed inſtituted to bear the burden with</hi> Moſes, <hi>there thenceforth lay no appeal unto</hi> Moſes. But then you hope to mend the matter, by telling us, that <hi>Moſes</hi> gained in wiſedom what he loſt in power, and ſo the change was for the better: For whereas it was ſaid by God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 11. viz. <hi>And I will take of the ſpirit which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and I will put it upon them;</hi> theſe words are ſo interpreted by all ſorts of Expoſitors, as not to tend unto the diminution of the power of <hi>Moſes,</hi> God's Spirit reſting on him in as full a manner as before it did: This you are pleaſed to grant, and more; for you ſay it reſted in a fuller. How ſo? Becauſe (ſay you) you do believe, <hi>his wiſedom was the greater for this diminution of his power:</hi> Where firſt you take for granted, that the power of <hi>Moſes</hi> was diminſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the inſtitution of the ſeventy Elders, which hitherto you have not proved; and then believe that his wiſedom was the greater for it, which is as hard to prove as the other is, For if the Spirit of God, which before reſted upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> was not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by any communication of it to the ſeventy Elders, as the text doth not ſay it was, you have no reaſon to believe, that any ſuch comunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to others, to ſo many as ſeventy, ſhould make it reſt upon him in a fuller meaſure then it did before; or if you mean that his wiſedom was the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:114876:160"/>
greater, becauſe he had ſo many able Aſſiſtants in the Government with him, you ſhould then turn the Text, and ſay that God took of the Spirit which was upon the ſeventy Elders, and put it upon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> for otherwiſe his wiſedom cannot be ſaid to have been greater, for having ſo many wiſe Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, no more the perſonal vallour of a Prince may be ſaid to be greater then it is, by having many men of valour in his Council of War, or the beauty of a Queen ſaid to be greater then before, by having many beautiful Ladies attending on her. And ſo your argument againſt apealing from the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> as the ſupream Court, to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the ſupream Prince, is brought to nothing: Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding you conceive ſo highly of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> becauſe it hath ſome reſemblance to the Senate in a popular eſtate, that you make it to be a State diſtinct from the reſt of the people; and all this to no other purpoſe, but to multiply the number of eſtate in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation, that Kings, and ſuch as have the power of Kings, may not be ridden only with the bitt and bridle, but a <hi>Martingal</hi> alſo: For if the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, in Law to be made, had ſuch power as was ſhown</hi> (but whither it be ſhown in your Papers or any where elſe, I am yet to ſeek) and that in Law ſo made, <hi>the ultimate appeal lay unto the Sanhedrim</hi> (as you can never prove it did, when there was any King in Iſrael) you ask this Queſtion, <hi>Why are not here two Eſtates in this Common wealth each by Gods own Ordinancce, and both plain in Scripture?</hi> Which Argument or Queſtion needs no other Anſwer, but that, <hi>a male ſuppoſitis ad non valet Argumentum. ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If ſo there could but ſix Prieſts and Levites be choſen into that great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, admitting that the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were at that time reckoned to be one of the Twelve; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very improbable, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> ſhould ſtand here for all the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> but if the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were not accounted, at that time amongſt the Twelve (as they were not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) then could there be no <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Levites</hi> in that Court at all, at the firſt inſtitution of it; though afterwards when Ten of the Twelve Tribes were fallen from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> might be taken in to make up the number.

                  <p>Secondly, It is affirmed by ſome Chriſtian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> here mentioned, are to be underſtood in their ſingle capacities, and not as parts and members of the <hi>Iewiſh Sanhedrim;</hi> for when a <hi>matter</hi> ſeemed <hi>too hard</hi> to be determined

by the inferiour Judges, they are enjoyned (ſaith <hi>Deodat.</hi>) to go to the Prieſts by way of conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Enquiry, to be informed of the true ſence and meaning of Gods Laws: The Prieſts (being great Lawyers among the people) underſtanding and experienced in the meaning of Gods Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which judgement was to be given in all the caſes comprehended therein; for which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a better proof then that of the Prophet <hi>Mal. cap.</hi> 2. 7. where it is ſaid, that <hi>the Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth; for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Nor is it ſo certain as you make it, that <hi>by the Judge who ſhould be in thoſe dayes,</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the ſupream Judge or Judges, or any of them, who governed the affairs of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. For <hi>Ainſworth</hi> who had well ſtudied the Iewiſh <hi>Rabbines,</hi> underſtands theſe words of the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi> it ſelf: <hi>By the</hi> Judge (ſaith he) <hi>is underſtood the high Councel or Senate of</hi> Judges, <hi>which were the Chiefs or Heads of the Fathers of</hi> Iſrael. And this he doth not onely ſay, of his own Authority, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf in generall to the <hi>Hebrew Records,</hi> and more particularly to <hi>Rubbige Maimony</hi> in his tract of Rebels, <hi>ca. 1. Sect.</hi> 4. By both it is agreed, that this direction is not given to the parties themſelves, who had any ſuit or controverſie depending in the low Courts, but to the Judges of thoſe Courts, and to them alone; for which I muſt confeſs I can ſee no reaſon in the Text or context.</p>
                  <p>31. For if you look into the firſt words of that chapter, we ſhal find it to be a general direction to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by which they are commanded <hi>not</hi>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:114876:163"/>
                     <hi>to ſacrifice to the Lord their God any bullock or ſheepe wherein is blemiſh or any ill favouredneſs, &amp;c.</hi> which no man can conceive to relate onely to the Judges of the lower Courts. Nor find I any variation in the reſt that follows, no nor in that which comes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neiher, <hi>v.</hi> 14. where thoſe directions do begin which concern the people (and not the Prieſts or Judges onely) in the Election of their King. And therefore give me leave to think, (and laugh not at me I beſeech you for my ſingularity) that there is no other meaning in that Text but this, <hi>i e.</hi> That if a doubt or ſcruple ſhould ariſe amongſt them in their ſeverall dwellings in matters which concerned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the right underſtanding of the law of God, they ſhould have recourſe to the Prieſts and Levites, for ſatisfaction in the ſame, according unto that of the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> that <hi>the people were to ſeek the Law from the mouth of the Prieſt,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had it. But if it were a civil controverſie, matters of difference, which they could not end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, and by the interpoſition of their friends and Neighbours, they ſhould refer it to the Judge or Judges, in whoſe times they lived to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally decided by him. And for this Expoſition I have not onely ſome authority, but ſome reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: My Authority ſhall be taken from the words of <hi>Eſtius,</hi> who makes gloſs upon the Text, <hi>viz. Haec ſententia modo ſacerdotem modo judicem nominat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter duplicem magiſtratum qui erat in populo dei; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram &amp; civilem; quamvis contingeret aliquando du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicem magiſtratum in eandem perſonam concurrere.</hi> My reaſons ſhall be taken firſt from that paſſage in the 12. verſe, in which it is ſaid, that the man that

will do preſumptuouſly, and will not hearken unto the Prieſt (that ſtandeth to Miniſter there before the Lord thy God) &amp;c. Where the Prieſt ſeems to be conſidered in perſonal capacity, as he ſtands mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring before the Lord at his holy Altar, not as he ſits upon the bench, and acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>with other of the Judges in an open Court. But whether that be ſo or not; certain I am, that many inconveniences muſt needs happen amongſt the people, if the Text be no otherwiſe to be underſtood, as you would have it. It is confeſt on all hands, that there was ſome intervall of time from the death of every one of the ſupream Judges and the advancing of the next, though in Chronologies the years of the ſucceeding Judges are counted from the death of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. And you your ſelfe confeſs, <hi>p.</hi> 14. that the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim</hi> did not continue long after <hi>Joſuah:</hi> And I can find no reſtitution of it till the time of <hi>Iehoſhaphat.</hi> For though you tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 16. that <hi>never any King, except</hi> David, <hi>had Seſſion or Vote</hi> in this Councel, by which you intimate, that the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> was on foot again in the time of <hi>David.</hi> Yet you have ſhewed us neither reaſon nor authority for it. And therefore <hi>you may do me a greater favour</hi> (as your own words are) <hi>then you ſuddenly imagine, to tell me really</hi> in what Book of Scripture, or in what other Author I may find it written, that either the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> was on foot again in the time of <hi>David,</hi> or that <hi>David</hi> did at any time ſit and vote amongſt them. Hereupon I conclude at laſt, that if the Text be to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as you would have it; and as you ſay it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>in the ſence of all Authors both Iewiſh and Chriſtians,</hi> then muſt the people be without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:114876:164"/>
(at the leaſt without remedy of Appeal) in their ſuits and controverſies during the interval of time betwixt the Judges, and without remedies alſo in their doubts &amp; ſcruples touching the meaning of the Law, for the whole ſpace of time which paſt betwixt the death of <hi>Ioſuah,</hi> and the raign of <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> which comes to 511. years, or there abouts, which I deſire you ſeriouſly to conſider of.</p>
                  <p>32. And yet the matter were the leſs, if having given the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> the <hi>Dernier</hi> Reſort, or the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power in all appeals; you did not aſcribe to them an authority <hi>alſo to controul their Kings.</hi> For proof whereof you tell us that both <hi>Skickardus</hi> and <hi>Grotius, with the full conſent of the</hi> Talmudiſts, <hi>have aſſured you, that if the King came to</hi> violate the Laws and the Statutes, it was in the power of the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim to bring him unto corporall puniſhment.</hi> How far <hi>Skickardus</hi> hath aſſured you I am not able to ſay, not being directed by you to any Book or Books of his where it may be found. But if you find no more in <hi>Skickardus</hi> then you do in <hi>Grotius,</hi> you will have little cauſe to brag of this diſcovery.

Nothing in all this which concerns the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> nothing which
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:114876:165"/>
ſpeaks of ſuch a power as <hi>the bringing of the Kings unto corporal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>puniſhment;</hi> this puniſhment being onely ſuch as the Kings had condemned themſelves unto in the way of penance, for their tranſgreſſion of the Laws: This is enough to ſhow how little credit is to be given to the full and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> whom <hi>Grotius</hi> builds upon, for proving the ſupream power in the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> in bringing their Kings to corporal puniſhment which they never had. And yet to make the matter clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, he preſently ſubjoyns theſe words unto thoſe before (but whether they be his own words, or the words of ſome of his <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers, let them judge that liſt) <hi>viz. a paenis autem coactivis adeo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri erant reges, ut etiam excalceationis lex quippe cum ignominia conjuncta in ipſis ceſſaret.</hi> There Kings (ſaith he) were ſo far exempted from the coactive power of Law, that they were not liable to the penance of going barefoot, becauſe it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with it a mark of infamy. If there be any other place in <hi>Grotius,</hi> which may ſerve your turn, you muſt firſt direct me where to find it, before you can expect it ſhould have an anſwer.</p>
                  <p>33. The <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> having failed you, you have recourſe unto the Scripture, and to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> a right good Hiſtorian, but with no more advantage to the point in hand, then if you had never lookt upon them: You tell us of a Reſtitution of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> was made by King <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat,</hi> as I think it was, for ſo I find it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Moreover</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>did</hi> Jehoſhaphat <hi>ſet of the Levites, and of the Prieſts,</hi>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:114876:165"/>
                     <hi>and the chief of the Fathers in Iſrael, for the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, and for controverſies when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to</hi> Jeruſalem. But how can you inferre from hence, that by the manner of this <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that it relates unto the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> as I think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it may, though other Writers make it doubtful) doth ſo <hi>plainly ſhow that ever under the Monarchy the power of the Sanhedrim was co-ordinate with that of the King,</hi> which conſequent if it can be rationally collected from that text of Scripture, or any which depends upon it, I have loſt my Logick. <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> though a juſt King, and a godly man, could neither be ſo unskilful in his own affairs, or ſo careleſs of the regalities of his poſterity, as to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect another power which might be <hi>co-ordinate</hi> with his own, and might hereafter give a check to himſelf and them in all Acts of Government; But then ſuppoſing <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> to be ſo improvident, as to erect a power which was to be <hi>co-ordinate</hi> with him; yet being but a co-ordinate power, it gave them no <hi>Authority to bring their King to corporal puniſhment,</hi> as you ſay they did. I know it is a rule in Logick, <hi>Co-ordinate ſe invicem ſupplent,</hi> that one co-ordinate doth ſupply the defects of another. But I never heard of any ſuch Maxime, as, <hi>Co-ordinata ſe invicem tollent,</hi> that one co-ordinate power may deſtroy the other; and if it hath no power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the other, then can it pretend to no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer correcting the other, which is the next degree to a totall deſtruction. For, <hi>par in parem non habet poteſtatem,</hi> as the ſaying is; Beſides all which, if any ſuch power had been given the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the firſt inſtitution of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Almighty God,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:114876:166"/>
or at the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> by <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> there is no queſtion to be made, but that we ſhould have either found it in the Original Grant, or by ſome exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of it in point of practiſe; but finding neither of the two in the Book of God, or in any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved humane Authors, I take it for a very ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that no ſuch power was ever given them, <hi>Non apparentium, &amp; non exiſtentium, eandem eſſe rationem,</hi> was a good maxime in the Schools, and I build upon it.</p>
                  <p>34, But on the contrary, you hope to help your ſelf by two examples, one of them being taken out of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the other out of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Antiquities; you inſtance firſt in <hi>Zedekias,</hi> who to the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> demanding the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> made anſwer, <hi>Behold he is in your hands; for the King is not he that can do any thing without you.</hi> Out of which words you would infer, Firſt, that the King (according to the opinion of ſome of the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiſts) was not to judge in ſome caſes;</hi> which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was or not, is not much material; moſt Kings conceiving it moſt agreeable to their own eaſe, &amp; the content of their Subjects, to divolve that power upon their Judges, obliged by oath to adminiſter equal Juſtice betwixt the King and his people. You infer ſecondly from thoſe words, that the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> were co-ordinate with the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> though there be no ſuch matter in them. My anſwer unto this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and my reaſons for it, you muſt needs have met with in the Book againſt Calvin, as you call it; of which ſince you have took no notice, I am forced to bring them here to a repetition. My anſwer is, That <hi>Calvin</hi> (whom it moſt concerned to have it ſo)
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:114876:166"/>
finds fault with them who did expound the place, to that end or purpoſe which you moſt deſire, or though the King did ſpeak ſo honourably of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>ac ſi nihil iis ſit negandum,,</hi> as if nothing was to be denied them; whereas he rather doth conceive that it was, <hi>amarulenta Regis quaerimonia,</hi> a ſad and bitter complaint of the poor captivated King againſt his Councellors, by whom he was ſo over-ballanced, <hi>ut velit nolit cedere iis cogeretur,</hi> that he was forced to yield to them, whether he would or not; which he punctually and expreſly calls, <hi>inexcuſabilem arrogantiam,</hi> an intolerable piece of ſawcineſs in thoſe Princes, and an excluſion of the King from his legal rights. This makes the matter plain enough, that the Princes (by whom you underſtand the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim</hi>) had no ſuch power in <hi>Calvins Judgment,</hi> as might make them equal to the King, or legally ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to controul his rections; but the reaſon which I there give makes the matter plainer; and my reaſon is, that <hi>Calvin,</hi> who is ſaid by ſome, to have compoſed his Expoſitions on the Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of his inſtitutions, would not have loſt ſo fair an evidence, for the advancing of his popular Magiſtracy, and conſequently of the three Eſtates in moſt Chriſtian Kingdomes, had he conceived, he could have made it ſerviceable to his end and purpoſe: for then how eaſy had it been for it, in ſtead of the Demarchy of Athens, in which you ſay he was miſtaken to have underſtood the Jewiſh <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> in which he could not be miſtaken, if you judge aright: Beſides we are not very ſure, that the Princes mentioned in that place, did make up the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or came unto the King in the name of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:114876:167"/>
Councell, of which ſome of them might be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but rather that they were the Peers and moſt powerful men of the Realm of <hi>Judah,</hi> out of whoſe Families the Kings did uſe to chuſe their wives. Who being incenſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt the Prophet, and knowing that the King was not able to diſpute the point with them, as the caſe then ſtood, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the executing of their malice againſt the one, before their duty to the other. But granting that by <hi>Princes</hi> here, we muſt mean the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and that the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> taking the advantage of thoſe broken and unſetled times carried ſome things with an high hand againſt that King, yet this is no ſufficient proof, that either by the rules of their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> or their Reſtitution, they were co-ordinate with their Kings, or ſuperiour to them. Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, commonly are intent upon all advantages, by which they may improve their power, as in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of Kings, or the unſetledneſs of the times, or when they meet with ſuch weak Princes, who either for want of natural courage, or a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own affairs, ſuffer them by little and little to get ground upon them. But then I hope you will not argue a <hi>facto adjus,</hi> that becauſe they did it therefore they might lawfully do it; that maxime of the <hi>Civil</hi> Lawyers, <hi>id poſſumus, quod jure poſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> being as undeniably true in the caſe of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or any other publick Council, as in that of any private perſon.</p>
                  <p>35. Your ſecond example is that of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Hircanus,</hi> which you found alſo in the Book againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> by which name you call it; but preſs it quite beyond my purpoſe. <hi>Baronius</hi> had affirmed of the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:114876:167"/>
                     <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> (as you alſo do) <hi>Eorum ſummam eſſe poteſtatem qui de lege cognoſcerent, &amp; Prophetis &amp; ſimul de regibus judicarent,</hi> that they had power of judicature over the Law, the Prophets and the Kings themſelves, which falſe poſition he confirms by as falſe an inſtance, affirming in the very next words, <hi>horum judicio Herodem regem poſtulatum eſſe,</hi> That <hi>Herod</hi> being then actually King of <hi>Jurie,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by them, for which he cites <hi>Joſephus</hi> with the like integrity, ſo that I had no other buſineſs with <hi>Baronius,</hi> then to prove that <hi>Herod</hi> was not King, when he was ſummoned to appear before the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim;</hi> and having proved that point, I had done my buſineſs without any ſhufflings and Evaſions as you put upon me. But ſince <hi>Hircanus</hi> muſt be brought in alſo to act his part in a controverſie of which I was not bound to take any <hi>notice.</hi> I muſt let you know, that if <hi>Hircanus</hi> could not by power ſave <hi>Herod</hi> from the hands of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and therefore ſhifted him away, as you ſay <hi>by art;</hi> it was not for want of power in the King, but for want of ſpirit in the man. For firſt, <hi>Hircanus</hi> at that time was no more King of the Jews then <hi>Herod</hi> was, though he be ſometimes called ſo by my ſelf, and others, becauſe he ſucceeded in the Kingdom, and was actually in poſſeſſion of it, upon the death of <hi>Alexandra.</hi> But having afterwards relinquiſhed the Kingdom to <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> and not reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by <hi>Pompey,</hi> when the differences betwixt them came to be decided, he was forced to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Dignity and Title of High Prieſt, and was no other at ſuch time as this buſineſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

in a broken and diſtracted time, and being a Prince of little judgement and leſs courage, every one had their ends upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made him yield to any thing which was offered to him. So that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument comes into as little purpoſe as that before of <hi>Zedekias;</hi> and therefore for a further anſwer to it, I refer you thither, without giving any more trouble to my ſelf or you. But when you <hi>add,</hi> and <hi>add</hi> it out of <hi>Grotius,</hi> that this Court continued till <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>G.</hi> who cauſed them all to be put to death except <hi>Sameas</hi> only; it muſt needs follow hereupon, that <hi>Herod</hi> did not onely deſtroy the Members of that Court, but the Court it ſelfe. For when you ſay, <hi>that this Court continued till</hi> Herod <hi>the Great,</hi> you tell us in effect that it contiued no longer; and by ſo doing, you muſt either contradict the four <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> who make frequent mention of this Councel, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 47. &amp;c. or the general current of Interpreters which have written on them. Nor am I much moved with that which you ſay from <hi>Grotius</hi> (ſuppoſing that he hath the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> or his Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the perſons, or actions of ſoveraign Princes, as <hi>Calvin</hi> hath aſcribed unto them.</p>
                  <p>36. But you draw towards a concluſion, and ſo do I, you tell me upon confidence of your former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and take it as a matter proved, that there <hi>never lay an appeal from the</hi> Sanhedrim <hi>unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>nor to any other Magiſtrate</hi> (excepting one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they lived under the Provincial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome forrain Princes) as alſo that they had power upon their Kings. You tell me that I muſt confeſs that the three Eſtates concerned in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any other Popular Magiſtrate <hi>Calvin</hi> doth dream of, are to be left in that condition in which <hi>Calvin</hi> finds them. And ſo perhaps I may when I ſee this proved, which as yet I do not, though there be no neceſſity on my part to make ſuch confeſſion, and much leſs to acknowledge that the whoſe book is anſwered, by your endeavour to make anſwer to ſome paſſages in it. Had it been proved (unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably that the <hi>Ephori</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> by the firſt Rules of their inſtitution, had a jurisdiction over their Kings, and the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> alſo over theirs, which are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two points to which you have endeavoured to return an anſwer) you have no more reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I ſhould acknowledge the whole Book to be fully anſwered, then that you or any man may be ſaid to have confuted all the Works of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> becauſe he hath confuted two or three of his chief Objections. And thus in order to your expectation of <hi>hearing further from me,</hi> which you ſeem to hope for, rather then out of any deſires engaging my ſelf either with freſh Adverſaries or
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:114876:169"/>

               </head>
               <p>1. IT is obſerved of <hi>Cicero</hi> that renowned Orator, that having ſpent the greateſt part of his life, in the ſervice of the Commonwealth, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of many of the principal Citizens whoſe cauſe he pleaded, when they ſtood in need of ſo great an Eloquence: there was none found to advocate in his behalf, when his occaſions moſt required it, <hi>Cum ejus ſalutem nemo defendiſſet qui per tot annos, &amp; publicam civitatis, &amp; privatam Civium defende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> as <hi>Paterculus</hi> hath it. An infelicity, which I have ſome reaſon to expect, though I do not fear it: when after ſo many ſervices to the Church in Generall, and appearing in defence of ſo many particular perſons of moſt note and eminence, I ſhall be loaded with reproach by ſome, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by others. Two adverſaries I have lately drawn upon me for my love to truth, my zeal unto the Church, and the injured Clergy: By one of which (notwithſtanding my Reſpectful uſage of him) I have been handled in ſo rude and ſcurrilous a
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:114876:170"/>
manner, as renders him uncapable of any honeſt correction, there being no Pen foul enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with him, which would not be made fouler by engaging in ſo foul a ſubject. From the other (though more exaſperated) I have received a well ſtudied Anſwer, compoſed with ingenuity and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not ſtanding wilfully in an Error of which he finds himſelf convinced, though traverſing many points in debate between us, which with more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the truth might have been declined. And in the end thereof, I find a Letter directed or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto me, tending eſpecially to the begetting of ſuch a friendly correſpondence betwixt us, as may conduce to the eſtabliſhment of a following Peace. Which Letter I ſhall firſt lay down, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome conſiderations had and made on the book it ſelf, I ſhall return as fair an Anſwer. Now the words of the Letter are as followeth.</p>

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:114876:181"/>
certainly M. <hi>Fuller</hi> is more out of the way then he was before, and cannot but give us a taſt of his old zeal to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Party upon all occaſions. We find a Letter in his <hi>Cabala,</hi> from the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi> to the Marqueſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> p. 66. <q>wherein he makes many juſt objections againſt <hi>Murreys</hi> preferment to that place, ſuſpecting him to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from the Church-Government, and adding, that if it ſhould be ſo, his advancement to that place (conſidering the number of Fellows and Students there) would be the greateſt blow which had been given to the Church in 50. years.</q> In a Poſtſcript to which Letter he ſubjoyns this Note, that M. <hi>Murrey</hi> had ſince come to him, and that he <hi>had ſchooled him ſoundly againſt Puritaniſm, which he diſſavowed, though ſomewhat faintly.</hi> Call you me this the taking of an Oath, or the proſeſſing in it of a good affection to the Engliſh diſcipline? An Oath he poſſibly might take at his admiſſion, to keep the Statutes of the Colledge; but there is no ſuch oath as binds him to profeſs a liking of the Engliſh Diſcipline. And theſe being all the knots which he can find in this Bulruſh, are neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo many, nor ſo hard to unty, as the Reader might have been perſwaded, by the firſt overture which was made of this <hi>Calmne Diſcovery.</hi>

               <p>17. I could not ſo much forget my ſelf to be a Parſon, as not to Chriſtian my own child firſt; which chare being done, I am the moſt at leiſure to attend my Adverſary, of whoſe parts and praiſe I ſhall not ſpeak, becauſe I would not take a work our of his hands, which he thinks no man ſo fit to do as himſelf. And therefore I ſhall onely take ſuch a
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:114876:182"/>
meaſure of him as he makes of himſelf in this <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal;</hi> where he ſpends much more time in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Errors, falſities and miſtakes which are charged upon him, then would have ſerved to have written a far better Hiſtory. In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we find a preparation couched in fourteen Chapters, to ſmooth the way before his favourable Readers, that they might judge the more indulgent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his ſlips and failings. Such care and pains for beſpeaking friends in his excuſe, argues him conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to himſelf of far more Errors then he is willing to confeſs in the face of the World. The like may be collected alſo from the fear he had of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> which takes up the whole ſecond Chapter of his <hi>Apparatus;</hi> and where there is a fear, there muſt be ſome guilt, ſome doubt at leaſt that all is not well as it ſhould have been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Animadvertor</hi> was not of ſuch eager ſpirit, as to let fly at every one which came in his way, and poſſibly might never have heard of this Church Hiſtory, (living far of, and no ſuch tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Books of the time) if the frequent cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the wrongs done to the Church and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy had not come to his ears before the Book it ſelfe had been brought to his hands. And when it was brought into my hands, it found me ſo far unreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do any thing in it, that nothing but invincible importunity could have drawn me to the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. The <hi>Appealant</hi> therefore may be ſure, that I never ſent him any ſuch meſſage, <hi>as that if I had not been viſited with bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ndneſs, I would have been upon his bones before that time;</hi> of which, whoſoever did it from him, he knew as little of my corporal blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:114876:182"/>
which I thank God is not yet fallen on me, as he did of my ſecret intentions, as to that particular, ſo far as I was from ſending anyſuchmeſſage to him, that I reſolved not to be known for the Author of thoſe <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> whenſoever they ſhould come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and to diſguiſe my ſelf the better, related in the Margin to a paſſage in my own <hi>Coſmogrophy,</hi> fol. 19, which now the <hi>Appealant</hi> chargeth on me, as a ſoleciſm in point of <hi>Heraldy, in laying mettal upon mettal,</hi> p. 2. fol. 12.</p>
               <p>18. My Authors firſt fears being fallen upon him, he finds himſelf brought under a new debate, whether he ſhould return an Anſwer to the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions,</hi> or ſit down in ſilence. The cauſe being pleaded on both ſides, he reſolves at <hi>laſt to return a plain full and ſpeedy Anſwer,</hi> fol. 3. <hi>Full</hi> enough I confeſs of needleſs queſtïons and diſputes, which rather ſhowed a Reſolution not to bear the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, then an ability to maintain it. I remember I have ſomewhere read of a famous Wraſtler, who being many times overthrown, who did ſuddenly ſtart up, and by an Eloquent Oration, perſwaded the people, that he rather fell by the ſlip of his own foot, then by the ſtrength of his Adverſary: Such a wraſtler I have met with in the preſent <hi>Appealant,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes all his faults to <hi>slips,</hi> ſlips of the Pen, ſlips <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> (as he words it) and <hi>ſlips of memory.</hi> To which three heads the Greateſt Errors and miſtakes which occurs in the faltieſt and falſeſt writing, may notun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly be reduced, ſo much the <hi>fuller</hi> in regard he hath incorporated the greateſt part of the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions</hi> into the body of his Book; which if ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:114876:183"/>
from the reſt of the Authors, one would make the Greater Book of the Law (upon a juſt a perfect Calculation of the line and folio's) by one part in five, <hi>Fuller</hi> then otherwiſe it needed, or could have been by making uſe of ſuch of the additionall Notes intended more for ſupplement and illuſtration, then the diſparagement of the Author, or diſgrace of the work. But my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thinks his work ſo perfect, as to ſtand no more in need of Illuſtration, then it doth of Correction; ſupplements ſuppoſing ſome defects, as Corrections preſuppoſe ſome Errors. Onely I hope the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions</hi> will be well paid for before all is done, the Authors being ſo well paid for the firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal (as is ſaid before) and the <hi>Appealant</hi> better paid by the Book-ſellers, and his many Patrons (to whom they are preſented like the prayers of ſome old <hi>Mendicants</hi> at the doors of their good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Dames) for the tranſcript of them.</p>
               <p>19. But whether it be <hi>full</hi> or not, I am ſure it is more <hi>full</hi> then <hi>ſpeedy:</hi> For though the <hi>Appealant</hi> would be thought to be furniſhed with the Pen of a <hi>ready Writer;</hi> yet had he time and leiſure more then enough for a greater Work, conſidering what helps he had to ſet it forward, and therefore I may ſay in the words of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> that if he had <hi>not ploughed with my heifer,</hi> he muſt have askt more time (though otherwiſe he had time enough) to have <hi>read my Riddle.</hi> If <hi>Maſon,</hi> one of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors to ſome Preſſes in <hi>London,</hi> had not falſely and unworthily communicated the ſheets to him as they came from the Preſs, we might have heard of this <hi>Appeal</hi> about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> next, in caſe it had
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:114876:183"/>
not <hi>cooled</hi> in the <hi>heats</hi> of Summer, and been retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the leiſure of a long vacation. But making uſe of this Advantage, and having all ſuch other helps as the Libraries and ſhops in <hi>London,</hi> the uſe of his own hands and eyes, the contribution of his friends, and an excellent memory to boot could ſupply him with, it could not come abroad againſt Eaſter term, without the <hi>Midwifery</hi> of three Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to aſſiſt at the <hi>Labour:</hi> The making of a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>ſpeedy</hi> Anſwer (for it muſt be both) could not elſe have agreed with that <hi>want of leiſure,</hi> his many various imployments, and coming twice a Lords day to the Pulpit, (which without oftentation, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to in that very Chapter) But ſome like <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſops</hi> fellow ſervants (whom he tells me of) preſumes ſo much upon themſelves, as to promiſe <hi>that they can do all things,</hi> and that whatever thing they do ſhall be <hi>full</hi> and ſpeedy, though there be little <hi>ſpeed</hi> and leſs <hi>fulneſs</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>20. So much being ſaid of the <hi>Appealant</hi> in reference to his engaging and diſpatch; let us behold him next in his qualifications. One of the <hi>fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> a <hi>fellow ſufferer</hi> with him in the cauſe of the King, and one of the <hi>ſame party in the Church.</hi> All this I am very glad to hear of, and am ſorry I did not hear it ſooner, eſpecially if there be any truth (as I hope there is) in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation. My <hi>fellow ſervant</hi> if he were, it muſt not be in the capacity of a Chaplain in <hi>Ordinary</hi> (for I never ſaw his name in the liſt of the forty eight) accompanied with his fixt times of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, as the others were, but ſupernumerary and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:114876:184"/>
at large, of whom there is no notice taken in the Court, though they may make ſom noiſe in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And a ſufferer he could not be, becauſe he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly relinquiſheth both his cure and prebend, which he advanceth by the name of none of the worſe Benefices, and one of the <hi>beſt Prebends</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> not holding both or either of them, till they were forcibly taken from, him as well as from the reſt of his brethren, <hi>fol.</hi> 2. no ſuffering where no injury or wrong is offered, and there can be no injury done in diſpoſing that which he ſo willingly abandoned, as he ſaith himſelf; for <hi>volenti non fit injuria,</hi> as the ſaying is, never applyed more aptly then on ſuch emergencies: And if he were of the ſame Party in the Church; (as he ſaith he was) he would have ſhow'd ſome greater zeal in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the intreſs and concerments of it, ſome greater meaſure of compaſſion towards thoſe poore men, who being ſpoiled of their Goods and Livings by the infelicity of the times, muſt afterwards be ſpoil'd of their good name, and living fame, by ſuch undeſerved reproaches as he layes upon them. He ſpeaks unto us now in the voice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but in the Hiſtory he handleth both the Church and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, even from the higheſt to the loweſt with the hands of <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſo that it might be ſaid two juſtly, <hi>quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi> What credit may be given to words, when they are confuted by our Actions.</p>
               <p>21. But whatſoever ſuſpitions and ſiniſter opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might formerly have been conceived of him, he either is not the ſame man he was, or hath been hitherto miſtaken for the man he was not. At the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:114876:184"/>
leaſt intimation of <hi>diſloyal thoughts,</hi> he flyes out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an open defiance, <hi>fol.</hi> 55. and wiſhes <hi>that the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of the valley</hi> (who he beholds as Loyal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) would in vindication of the <hi>Eagle their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, pick out his eyes.</hi> If any ſuch <hi>Rebellious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> can be found in his book, as he conceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be charged withal by the <hi>Animadvertor, fol.</hi> 45. He now profeſſeth that he doth not derogate in the leaſt degree from the power of the Church, <hi>fol.</hi> 55. and wiſhed (without <hi>Phariſaical</hi> pride) that his Mother would not <hi>onely ſpit in his face, but ſpew him alſo out of her mouth, if either by his Pen or practiſe, he had done any thing unworthily (to the beſt of his knowledge)</hi> to the deſtroying of her intereſs by his Pen or his Practiſe, <hi>fol.</hi> 14. He now declares himſelf ſo well affected to the late Arch-Biſhop, as to have ſpoken two and twenty lines in his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>fol.</hi> 46. Referring us to the places in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, where they are to be found and rancking them under four Heads in as many Columes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his <hi>Naturals, Morals Intellectuals,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituals,</hi> fol. 67. ſo much affection he expreſſeth for the ſequeſtred Clergy, <hi>that he appealeth to the ſearcher of all hearts, if he did not deſire to do them all juſt favour, as he hoped to find favour from him when he moſt needed it;</hi> ſo far forth as it might be done <hi>without running himſelf into apparent danger;</hi> aſſuring all who chance to read him, <hi>that his Tongue and Pen hath been, and ſhall be tender of their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> p 3. fol. 56. He now declares that he doth <hi>cordially wiſh well</hi> to the cauſe of the <hi>Hierarchy, fol.</hi> 46. and affirms abſolutely not onely that he hath <hi>not in any place of his Books declared himſelf for a</hi>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:114876:185"/>
                  <hi>Presbyterian in point of Government;</hi> but that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he had <hi>ſcattered ſuch a ſyllable which might coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſuch preſumption, he would preſently ſnatch it up again,</hi> for fear (if I rightly underſtand him) of giving ſcandal to himſelf, and offence to others, <hi>p. 2. fol.</hi> 91. Yet as <hi>Baſurius</hi> in the Comedy, ſaid of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Beſſus,</hi> that he was none of thoſe that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his <hi>converſion from Coward;</hi> ſo I much fear that very few will believe any <hi>converſion</hi> in our preſent <hi>Appealant,</hi> as the former paſſages and proteſtations do pretend unto. But for my part, I have ſuch an eaſineſſe of nature in me, as to give credit to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſeverations, though many paſſages in this <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> might encline me otherwiſe, not being willing to force any man out of the Church (as was <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> by the continual clamours and reproaches of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy) as long as he deſires to remain in the boſome of it. All therefore I ſhall ſay at the preſent time, is that which he himſelf hath ſaid of Dr. <hi>Theodore Price,</hi> (with a little variation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that is to ſay, That if he be a true Sonne of the Church, <hi>'tis the better for him; but the contrary hath been generally reported, Printed, and believed,</hi> p. 3. fol. 79.</p>
               <p>22. Theſe preparations being thus laid down, the points which he denyeth ſtill remain in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us will be very few. His Confeſſions being all allowed (as of common courſe) be <hi>Traverſes</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Rule of the Court. His firſt <hi>Avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> being offered to the judgement, and his laſt preſented and directed to the Eye of the Reader. And firſt beginning with the <hi>Brittains,</hi> the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he hath offered, againſt the judgement
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:114876:185"/>
of Biſhop <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> two Right Learned Antiquaries, prove nothing to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that which I have affirmed; that is to ſay, that though the <hi>Brittains</hi> had many <hi>Topical</hi> and Tutelar Gods; yet that the <hi>Druides</hi> inſtructed them in the knowledge of one ſupream deity, as had been taught by many of the learned Gentiles both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> no more then it may be truly ſaid of the preſent <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that they acknowledge and adore but one ſupream God, notwithſtanding their ſuperſtitious worſhipping of ſo many Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Typical, and Tutelor Saints, whom they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace as Patrons of their perſons, and their ſeveral Countrys. And as for his Derivation of the name of <hi>London,</hi> from the weſtern <hi>Llan-dian,</hi> it ſtands but as it did before as a fancy onely; no proof being made that <hi>Diana</hi> was known by that name amongſt the <hi>Brittains,</hi> before the coming of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 2 p. 52.</note> The great Welſh Antiquary whom he ſpeaks of, might ſay well enough, that the <hi>Brittains</hi> called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> by the name of <hi>Dain,</hi> but proves not that ſhe was ſo called before the <hi>Romans</hi> came amongſt them; the Argument which he brings from <hi>Guarthey De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mol,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Diana's Caſtle,</hi> being ſo farre fetched (conſidering the little or no <hi>Analogy</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiwixt <hi>Dain</hi> and <hi>Demol</hi> that nothing can be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Nor finds he any countenance in it from the Annotations of the famous <hi>Selden</hi> and the <hi>Polyol bion.</hi> For <hi>Selden</hi> was not <hi>Selden,</hi> when he made thoſe Notes, which were were written in the year 1612. as one of the firſt Eſſayes of his Great Abilities. And being that the whole depends on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Brute,</hi> which all our learned Antiquaries have
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:114876:186"/>
exploded as an idle fiction, the Derivation from <hi>Llan-Dian,</hi> falls together with it. For <hi>Selden</hi> doth otherwiſe plead for the ſtory of <hi>Brute</hi> for to come up to the deſign of <hi>Drayton;</hi> or to ſhow rather how much he could be able to ſay in defence of a truth, who hath delivered ſo much Learning, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a Fable, as commonly men ſpend their greateſt wits in maintaining <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> When M. <hi>Fuller</hi> can point me out to that Iſle of <hi>Largeria,</hi> where <hi>Bruit</hi> is ſaid to make his Prayers unto <hi>Diana;</hi> I ſhall not only entertain the ſtory of <hi>Bruit,</hi> and the Etymologie of <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Llan-dian,</hi> but ſhall give that Iſland ſome fit place in my Coſmography, whenſoeuer it ſhall come to a new Edition; till then I muſt behold it as one of thoſe Iſlands, which is not to be found in all or any of our Mapps, as Don <hi>Quixot</hi> ſaid right truly to <hi>Sancho Pancha.</hi>

                  <hi>Banchor</hi> (which in a man who wholly truſts to the eyes of a mother, may be eaſily pardoned) it makes no difference in the caſe for which it was produced by the Andimadvertor; rather it makes for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the point which is there delivered, <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> being brought in as the principal wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by whom the Jurors were to be directed in the courſe of their evidence. The converſion of the <hi>Saxons</hi> being thus paſſed over, the Author ſpeaks of the beginning of the ſeveral languages, how truly, let the Reader judge, by comparing the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereupon, with the Anſwer to them; and in particular affirms, that the Hebrew was the common tongue of all the world, before it was incloſed into ſeveral Languages, <hi>Ch. Hiſt. lib. 2. fol.</hi> 65. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſeeming groundleſs to the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> he took occaſion to diſcourſe upon theſe four Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Firſt, Whether the Hebrew were the tongue which was ſpoken in Paradiſe. Secondly, Whether it were the common language in all the World, before the confuſion. Thirdly, whither it were appropriated to <hi>Heber</hi> and his Poſterity, as the proper Language of that line. Fourthly, Whether <hi>Abraham</hi> brought it into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> with him, or found it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Natives at his coming thither? The two firſt of theſe four Queſtions, are held in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by the <hi>Church Hiſtorian,</hi> and for the proof thereof he pretends unto ſome Authorities; which whether they be ſtrong enough to conclude the point, is left (as all the other points betwixt us) to the Readers Judgment. But the <hi>Appealant</hi> being unwilling to take any information from the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvertor,</hi> and yet not able to confute the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:114876:187"/>
by him alledged, againſt the common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the other two, he is fain to ſhift off that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute in ſuch a way, as would have been called a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giverſation in another man: For mark the weighty reaſons which induce him to decline that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and not to *<note place="margin">p. 2. fol. 14.</note> gratifie the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> with a better Anſwer, <hi>till either it ſhould come in his way or make for his wiſh,</hi> which happy conjuncture we may hear of at <hi>New-years-tide</hi> next: The firſt whereof is to ſhow his <hi>liberty,</hi> that he is <hi>free-born,</hi> and not <hi>bouod to Lacquey after the</hi> Animadverſions, <hi>when he hath other buſineſs of his own.</hi> The ſecond is to wean the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> from his <hi>moreſeneſs,</hi> by not indulging too much to his humour therein. The laſt to time his own and his Readers pains, that he may more ſeaſonably ſpend them hereafter on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of more importance.

With how much greater care of preſerving his credit, might he have cut of this unluckie ſection with a thrifty &amp;c. as he doth ſome others, or totally pretermitted it as not worth the looking after; which prudent omiſſion he makes uſe of frequently, when he meets with any knot which he cannot untye: Or rather how happy had it been, if he had entered on theſe conſiderations, before he ventured on the work; and in like manner paſſed over all the reſt of the Animadverſions; by doing which he might have more gratified himſelf, by ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo much pretious time to a better purpoſe, then he hath gratified the Animadvertor in the want of an <hi>Anſwer:</hi> But he proclaims himſelf free-born, and

more remote by two degrees from King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second then the other was. By which proximity of blood, as <hi>Edward</hi> the Third laid claim to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the Second carried the Crown of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> the Crown of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> againſt the <hi>Balions;</hi> ſo I am confident of ſome ability to prove, that <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bullingbrook,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> had a better Title to this Crown, then the houſe of <hi>Mortimer.</hi> For thoughby the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of <hi>England</hi> he may find it otherwiſe, yet there are many things in the common Law, which cannot extend to the ſucceſſion of the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> as in the caſe of Aliens, which was that of King <hi>James,</hi> or in the caſe of <hi>Parſeners,</hi> as in that of the two Daughters of King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. or in that of the half blood in the caſe of the ſiſters of King <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6. and finally in that of the tenure by cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie in the caſe of King <hi>Philip</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had been Mother of a living Child. And now I am fallen on theſe matters of <hi>Heraldy,</hi> I will make bold to take in a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Houſe of the <hi>Mountagues,</hi> deſcended in the Principal branches of it, from a Daughter of King <hi>Edw.</hi> the Third, concerning which, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells us, that I have made up ſuch a heap of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors as is not to be paralelled in any Author, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the emendation of another,</hi> p. 2. fol. 37. How ſo? becauſe forſooth I have made Sir <hi>Edward Mountague</hi> the Grand-child of the Lord chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the firſt Lord <hi>Mountague</hi> of <hi>Broughton,</hi> not to have been the elder Brother of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> but their Brothers Son.

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:114876:189"/>
in a <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> to the <hi>Examen Hiſtoricum,</hi> before he could accuſe me of it, and conſequently he doth but <hi>Actum agere,</hi> and fit a Plaiſter for that ſore, which had before been cured by a better Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Secondly, This can be at the moſt but a ſingle Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, in caſe it had not been retracted, and therefore no ſuch heap of Errors, as is not to he paralelled in any other.</p>
               <p>And Thirdly, It appears by another paſſage in this preſent <hi>Appeal, p.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 96. that he had ſeen the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Examen,</hi> which rendereth him the more inexcuſable, by raiſing ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry on no occaſion. In which paſſage he taxeth me with ſallery in my <hi>third endeavour,</hi> touching the late Barons of that Houſe, in making the ſaid Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mountague,</hi> to be Lord <hi>Mountague</hi> of <hi>Broughton</hi> in Northamptonſhire, which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for one of his Mannors, but not his Barro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. For I knew well that <hi>Broughton,</hi> and not <hi>Broughton</hi> gave the nomination to this branch of that Family (having never heard before of any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate they had in <hi>Broughton.</hi>) And therefore I muſt needs charge this Error, which he ſo triumpheth at, as one of the <hi>Errata's</hi> which were made at the Preſs, though not obſerved when the ſheets were read over to me, and ſo not Printed with the reſt. Leſs candidly deals he with me in another place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the miſtaking of a number, that is to ſay, 1555. for 1585. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 41. The Errors being meerly <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> (as is own phraſe is) And this he could not chuſe but ſee, though he can winck ſometimes when it makes beſt for his meeting of that precedent once again, on a more particular occaſion then was given
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:114876:190"/>
at the preſent, where the time thereof is truly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and where he ſpends ſome few lines in relation to it, ſo that the motion was <hi>direct,</hi> not <hi>Retrograde,</hi> but that he had a mind to pull me a little back, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much I had got the ſtart of him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent race. And as for the Error in the <hi>Errata,</hi> I know not how it came; but a friend of mine in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over the firſt ſheets as they came from the Preſs, had put a Quere in the Margin, whether <hi>Melkinus,</hi> or <hi>Felkinus;</hi> and that afterwards by the ignorance, or incogitancy of my <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> it might be put in amongſt the reſt of the <hi>Errata,</hi> which is all that I am able to ſay, as to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>26.

Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wilfully the point in difference between us. For if the Reader mark it well, the queſtion is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther St. <hi>Davids</hi> or <hi>Canterbury,</hi> were the Ancienter Archi-Eſpiſcopal See, or how many hundred years the one was elder then the other; but for how long time <hi>Canterbury</hi> had continued Pagan, when the other was Chriſtian, which he acknowledgeth to be no more then 140 years, as was before obſerved by the <hi>Animadvertor.</hi> And though <hi>Caerleon</hi> upon <hi>

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:114876:190"/>
thing our Author can affirm to the contrary, and was undoubtedly ſuch at the firſt coming in of the <hi>Saxons</hi>) though afterwards for the ſpace of 140. years, as before is ſaid, it remained <hi>Pagan,</hi> ſo that our Author might have ſpared his pains in proving the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> to be ſucceſſors unto them of <hi>Caerleon</hi> (which was never denyed) unleſs he could infer from thence, that <hi>Caerl on</hi> was Senior in Chriſtianity unto <hi>Canterbury</hi> for four hundred years (as he expreſly ſaith it was) as well as in the <hi>Metrapolitical</hi> Dignity inveſted in it. And this if he can do, I ſhall conclude him willingly for a ſubtle Logitian, though I ſhall hardly ever allow him for a ſound Hiſtorian.</p>
               <p>27. The like imperfect defence he makes about the time when <hi>Lillies</hi> Grammer was impoſed by King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. on all the Grammer Schools of <hi>England,</hi> plac'd by him in the 11th year of that King, <hi>Anno</hi> 1619 which was full eleven years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ordered by the Convocation of the year 1630. <hi>ut una edatur formula, Authoritate hujus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crae Synodi, &amp;c.</hi> that one onely form of Teaching Grammer ſhould be enjoyned from thenceforth by the authority of the Convocation to be uſed in all the Grammer Schools of the Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> And queſtionleſs the Clergy in their Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation would not have troubled themſelves, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering one onely Form of Grammer to be taught in all the Schooles of the Province of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> if the King ſo many years before had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Lillies</hi> Grammer to be uſed in all the Schools of <hi>England.</hi> Conſidering therefore, that this order of the Convocation, preceded the command of King

                  <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. and that <hi>Lilly</hi> dyed ſome years before the making of this Order (as our Author plainly<note place="margin">Appeal. p. 2. f. 56.</note> proves he did) the difference between us may be thus made up, that <hi>Lillies</hi> Grammer being one of thoſe many, the multiplicity whereof had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of in that Convocation, was choſen out of all the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt, by the Convocation, as fitteſt for the publick uſe, and as ſuch Recommended by the King to all the Grammer Schools within his Dominions. The Animadvertor was miſtaken, in making <hi>Lilly</hi> to be living after the Convocation, who was dead before. And yet he diſcovers no ſuch <hi>indiſcretion,</hi> not made any ſuch <hi>cavelling at a well timed truth</hi> in the Authors Book, as the <hi>Appealant</hi> lays upon him; the time of the impoſing, and not the making of <hi>Lillies</hi> Grammer, being the matter in diſpute, in which the <hi>Appealant</hi> muſt be found as much miſtaken for the Reaſons formerly laid down, as the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor</hi> in the other.</p>
               <p>28. His next defence is worſe then this, becauſe he finds not any ſhift to convey himſelf out of the Reach of the <hi>Animadverſion,</hi> For finding it ſo clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved from the words of the inſtrument, that the payment of the 100000. for the Province of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> was to be made in five years, and not in four, which he held moſt probable, he hopes to ſave himſelf, by ſaying, that <hi>not reckoning the firſt</hi>

And then I am ſure he muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them to be in a capacity of doing much good, and no harm at all, which is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his firſt Poſition. That the <hi>Homilies</hi> had been Reproached by the name of <hi>Homily Homilies,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction; I have often heard, but never heard before, that they had been called ſo by any of the ſame party with the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> and am as farre as ever I was from knowing whom that one man ſhould be who did call them ſo, he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing named by the <hi>Appealant,</hi> Where by the way the Author hath uncaſed himſelf, &amp; appears in his own proper perſon, without any diſguiſe: for having firſt told us in the ſecond Chapter of his <hi>Apparatus,</hi> that he was one of the <hi>ſame party</hi> with Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi>

This Paſſage with ſome other, which are next to come, begin to ſtagger me, and make me very apt to think that the Lord <hi>Bacurius</hi> was in the right, when he delieved there was no ſuch converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from coward in Captain <hi>Beſſus,</hi> as report made of it. For look upon him in his judgement about
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:114876:194"/>
the power of the Church, and we ſhould find but little cauſe to give much credit to his proteſtations, and Declarations, as to that particular. He tells us, <hi>p. 1. fo.</hi> 45. that he never deprived the Church of her authority, and <hi>fo.</hi> 53. that he derogates not in the leaſt degree from the power of the Church; and <hi>p. 2. fo.</hi> 55. that if his Back would Buttreſs it up, it ſhould not be wanting, wiſhing (as formerly was noted) that if by his Pen or practiſe he had done any thing <hi>unworthily to the betraying of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>that the Church would not onely ſpit in his face, but ſpew him out of her mouth,</hi> fol. 14. But for all this he ſtill perſiſts in his own Error, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any power to the Church of making Canons, which are of force to binde the ſubject till confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament. In defence whereof, he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtereth all his ſtrength together, <hi>p. 2. fo</hi> 28 as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>fo.</hi> 67. 68. 69. Declaring plainly, <hi>fo.</hi> 67. in that in all the <hi>Animadvertors</hi> long diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſubject, he finds very little <hi>that he hath learnt thereby, and leſs (if any thing) which he is to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid by the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> touching the not expiring of the Convocation, <hi>An.</hi> 1640. by the death of the Parliament; yet he reſolves upon the queſtion, that after the diſſolution of the Parliament, <q>the Clarks thereof elected for their ſeveral Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals, and reſpective Dioceſſes, deſiſted from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publick perſons, and loſt the notions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, and returned to their private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:114876:194"/>
except the reſpective <hi>Cathedrals</hi> and <hi>Dioceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> had re elected them; which had it been done, they might no doubt have juſtified the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving away of <hi>Subſidies,</hi> as authorized thereunto, though the Parliament had been diſſolved.</q>
               </p>
               <p>33. So the <hi>Appealant</hi> hath reſolved it, and if old <hi>Nicholas Fuller</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inne,</hi> whom he ſo much magnifieth (that <hi>Fuller of Devotion,</hi> if I much miſtake not, of whom I find ſuch honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Verſes on the Parliament <hi>F</hi>—) were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live again, he could not have mooted on the point with more zeal and ignorance.

Which argues them to have a power over the property of the Clergy in their ſeveral Dioceſſes; and ſuch a power as had no ground to ſtand on, but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Canons, which conferred it on them.

In which we find ſix Canons in a row, one after another, for providing the Book of Common Prayer, the Book of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, the Bible of the largeſt Edition; a Font for Baptiſm, a fair Communion Table, with a Carpet of Silk, or other decent ſtuff to be laid upon it; a Pulpit for Preaching of Gods Word, a Cheſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the alms for the Poor, and finally for repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Churches or Chappels, whenſoever they ſhall fall into any decay; all theſe proviſions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to be made at the charges of the ſeveral and reſpective Pariſhes, according to ſuch rates as are indifferently aſſeſt upon them by the Church war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Sides men, and ſuch other Pariſhioners as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly convened together in the caſe, which rates if any did refuſe to make payment of, they were compellable thereunto, on a preſentment made to the Ordinary, by the ſaid Church-wardens, and other ſworn Officers of the ſeveral and reſpective Pariſhes. And yet thoſe Canons never were confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Act of Parliament, as none of the like nature had been formerly in Queen <hi>Eliz:</hi> time, though of a continual and uncontroled practiſe upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

of Dr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> Fancies.

               <p>35. But our Author hath a help at Maw, and making uſe of his <hi>five fingers,</hi> hath thruſt a word into the propoſition in debate between us, which is not to be ſound in the firſt drawing up of the iſſue. <hi>The Queſtion at the firſt was no more then this, whether ſuch Canons as were made by the Clergy in their Convocations, and authorized by the King under the broad Seal of</hi> England, <hi>could any further bind the ſubject, then as they were confirmed by Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Secondly, <hi>Whether ſuch Canons could ſo bind, either at ſuch times as the Clergy acted their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or after their admiſſion to King</hi> Hen. <hi>the 8. in ſuch things as concerned Temporals or temporal matters, otherwiſe then as they were confirmed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Cuſtomes;</hi> that is to ſay, as afterwards he expounds himſelfe, <hi>until they were conſirmed by Act of Parliament.</hi> Which points being ſo clearly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> in behalf of the Church, that no honeſt evaſion could be found to avoid his Argument; the <hi>Appealant</hi> with his five fingers, layes down life at the ſtake; and then cryes out that the <hi>Animadvertor arrogates more power unto the Church then is due unto it, either by the laws of God or man;</hi> maintaining, (but he knows not where) <hi>that Church men may go beyond</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, <hi>even to the</hi> limbs <hi>and</hi> lives <hi>of ſuch as are</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants

And having taken up the <hi>ſcent,</hi> he <hi>hunts</hi> it over all his Book with great noiſe and violence, aſſuring us that ſuch <hi>Canons were conſtantly checkt and controlled by the Laws of the Land, in which the temporal Eſtate, life and limbs of perſons were concerned,</hi> p. 2. fol. 27. As alſo, that the King and Parliament, though they <hi>directed not the proceedings of Eccleſiaſtical Courts in caſes of Hereſie</hi> (which is more then his Hiſtory would allow of) <hi>yet did they order the power of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops over declared Hereticks, without the direction of the Statute, not to proceed to limb and life,</hi> p. 2. fol. 45. And finally reduceth the whole Queſtion to theſe two <hi>Propoſitions, viz.</hi> 1. <hi>The proceedings of the Canon Law, in what touched temporals of life, limb, and eſtate, was alwayes limited, with the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Laws and national Cuſtomes of</hi> England.

In confutation of which <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> is cunningly tempted to write <hi>two or three ſheets,</hi> upon aſſurance, that it will be richly worth the Writers and the Readers pains, and the hope of having an anſwer to it from no worſe a hand then that of the <hi>Appealant</hi> himſelfe.

The firſt relates to Dr. <hi>Hackwel,</hi> whom he affirms to have been put out of his Chaplains place, for oppoſing the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Match</hi> when firſt tendred to Prince <hi>Henry:</hi> But<note place="margin">p. 2 f. 101</note> by his leave, Dr. <hi>Hackwel</hi> was not put out of his <hi>Chaplains place</hi> for oppoſing the Match, but for ſome indiſcretion in the managing of it, for having written a well ſtudyed peece againſt that Match, not without ſome reflections on the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which could not be pleaſing to the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he to whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſented it, the King ſoon undermined him, and blew him up. For finding it to be tranſcribed in a very fair Character, he gave the Doctor thanks for it within few days after; adding that he had ſeen few great Scholars which were Maſters of ſo good a hand. To which when the Doctor modeſtly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it was none of his own hand-writing, but that he was fain to make uſe in it, of another

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Relates to Dr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salum,</hi> whom he affirms to have received conſecration from Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> notwithanding the Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under which he was ſuppoſed to lie, by ſome <hi>ſquemiſh and nice conſcienced Elects,</hi> which before refuſed it. But our Author is as much out in this, as in any thing elſe: for firſt we find in the late. Arch-biſhops <hi>Breviat</hi> publiſhed by M. <hi>Prinne, An</hi> 1644. that he (the ſaid Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>) was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Biſhop of S. <hi>Davids</hi> at the Chapel in <hi>London</hi> Houſe, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 18. 1621: the ſolemnities of the Conſecration being performed by the Biſhops of London, <hi>Worceſter, Chicheſter, Ely, Landaff</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Archbiſhop being thought irregular for caſual Homicide.

with him, relates unto his making dependance of the Kings <hi>Coronation</hi> upon the <hi>ſufferage</hi> of the People. Diſproved by ſuch paſſages as occur in the ſame particular in the Coronations of King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. But neither being willing to acknowledge the dangerous conſequences of that Error, nor able to deny their words, with which he was charged, he hopes to reconcile all parties, by making <hi>little or no difference,</hi> betwixt the peoples <hi>acknowledging their Allegiance to their Soveraign,</hi> when required to do it at the Solemnities of the Coronation of the ſaid two Kings, and <hi>the ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their conſent unto it,</hi> as is affirmed by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor<note place="margin">p. 3. f. 5.</note> in the caſe of King <hi>Charles.</hi> Which words or Phraſes he finds to encline to an agreement, there being, as he ſaith, not onely a <hi>vicinity,</hi> but an <hi>affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> betwixt them, and much condemns the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvertor</hi> for endeavouring to make the difference to <hi>be vaſt, exceeding vaſt,</hi> and utterly againſt <hi>the will of the words.</hi> But fearing that theſe Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſpeculations would be no fit plaiſter for the ſore, he hopes to ſalve the help of an old <hi>Receipt</hi> taken out of <hi>Mills,</hi> but in what age he hath not told us; in which it is recorded, <hi>That after the King had a little repoſed himſelf in the Chair or Throne, erected upon the Scaffold, then the Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>ſhall go unto the fore-ſquares of the Scaffold, and with a loud voice ask</hi> the good liking of the people, <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Coronation of the King</hi> To which it will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily anſwered, that when the <hi>good liking</hi> or conſent of the People, was publickly required to a Coronation, it was at ſuch times onely, and in ſuch caſes, when the Kings came in by broken Titles, for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:114876:200"/>
whereof the favour and conſent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeemed moſt conſiderable; which <hi>conſent</hi> I find to have been asked at the Coronations of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and K. <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. to whoſe times it is very poſſible that the old precedent found in <hi>Mills</hi> is to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; ſuch arts were uſed by <hi>Otho</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory, ſcattering abroad his Complements, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Embraces, proſtituting the moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate pledges of love and friendſhip, <hi>&amp; omnia ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter pro dominatione,</hi> as it is in <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Courſes not uſed by any of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> who claimed the Crown in their own Right, as their lawful inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and not as Tenants to the people.</p>
               <p>41. The next particular which we meet with, is the ſubſtituting of Viſcount <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> whom he makes to be aſſiſting at his late Majeſties Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. 1625. by virtue of an office which his<note place="margin">p. 3. f. 4.</note> Father, is affirmed to have had in the Wardrobe. But I muſt needs confeſs my ſelf to be much unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the one and the other, the charge of the <hi>Wardrobe</hi> being at that time in the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and Viſcount <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> two young to perform that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. When I have more of Aſſurance of the truth hereof, I ſhall conceive the place to be rightly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but till then I ſhall ſuſpend my beliefe therein. The next thing which occurreth, comes in upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Biſhop <hi>Andrews;</hi> the footſteps of whoſe moderation are propoſed as a part of thoſe who ſo much admire him; <hi>content with the enjoying, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>

him in that paſſage, <hi>confeſſing that he had an eye in that expreſſion</hi> to another perſon, relating unto Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Andrews;</hi> whom ſince he doth forbear to name, I ſhall not force him to it by my Reply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well able by this ſhort Character to find out the name, as he is to direct me to him. But then the Reader is to know, that though the <hi>Appealant</hi> hath transferred the charge, from one man to another, yet it lies as heavy where he leaves it, as it did before, and that perſon whoſoever he is, muſt be Reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with enjoyning his own <hi>private Practiſes</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions</hi> upon other men. And this he is ſo farre from retracting, and thereby making Reparation to the party wronged, that he reſolves to ſtand his Ground. <hi>To which end he telleth us, that the controverſie in hand is about additional Ceremonies, enjoyned by no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.

As much unprofitable paines he takes in making Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi> to be born (about <hi>Bath</hi>) in <hi>Gloceſterſhire;</hi> And unto this expreſſion he reſolves to ſtand, though ſatisfied that <hi>Bath,</hi> is a chief City in the County of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> accuſing the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor</hi> to have dealt diſingeniouſly with him touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that particular.

Hiſt. Lib. 11: 163: <hi>Thus was the Scotiſh Nation full of diſcontents, when this Book being brought amongſt them, bare the blame of their breaking forth into more dangerous deſignes; as when the Cup is brim full, the laſt (though leaſt) ſuperadded drop, is charged alone to be cauſe of all the running over;</hi> and then he adds, <hi>Till then that the word</hi> primarily <hi>can be produced out of my Book, let the</hi> Animadvertor be held primarily as one departed from truth, <hi>and ſecondarily, as a cauſleſs accuſer of his brother.</hi> I have ſtood behind the Curtain all this while, to hear the <hi>Appealant</hi> rant himſelf out of breath, without fear of diſcovery; and that being done, I ſhall take him gently by the hand, and walk him to the beginning of the Scotiſh tumults, where we find thus, <hi>viz.</hi>

Hiſt.

were <hi>occaſioned primarily</hi> by ſending a new Liturgie to the Kirk of <hi>Scotland, :</hi> For firſt, in Marſhaling the Cauſes of thoſe miſeries and ruines in which both Kingdoms were involved, he makes the ſending of the Book of Service and new Liturgie thither, to be the prime cauſe both in order and nature, of the whole diſturbance. Secondly, he ſpeakes plainer in theſe words to confute himſelf, then had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly obſerved by the <hi>Animadvertor;</hi> the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor</hi> charging him for no more then ſaying, that thoſe <hi>calamities</hi> and <hi>miſeries</hi> were <hi>occaſioned</hi> by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the new Liturgie thither, which now he plainly doth affirm to be cauſed by it. And thirdly, though the word <hi>primarily</hi> be not found in that paſſage, yet he muſt be a very charitable Logician, who will not find it in the order and method of Cauſes, which are there offered to his view; deduced they may be from his book, though it cannot be produced out of it; and therefore he may take the departure from the truth on himſelf alone, and ſend for the accuſer of the Brethren to keep him company.</p>
               <p>45. Concerning the releaſe of the twelve Biſhops (for now he grants them to be twelve, which before he did not) he hopes to have me upon ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for denying them to have continued eighteen moneths in the Tower, without any intermediate diſcharge, <hi>pro tempore;</hi> but not being willing out of his abundant charity, to have me perſiſt wilfully in any error, he directeth me to be informed by Biſhop <hi>Wrenn,</hi> that none of them were releaſed before <hi>May</hi> 6. And from that reverend Prelate I could as willingly take my Information, if I had any conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:114876:204"/>
opportunity to ask the Queſtion, as from any other whoſoever; but being I am at ſuch a diſtance, I muſt inform my ſelf as well as I can by my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who in his Breviate tels us this. That on <hi>February</hi> 14. 1641. there came an Order, that the twelve Biſhops might put in bail if they would, and that they ſhould have their hearing upon <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and that on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 15. they went out of the Tower: Aſſuredly my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> cannot be thought to be ſo ignorant in the affairs of his Brethren, being then fellow Priſoners with him, as not to underſtand their ſucceſſes, whether good or bad, or to be of ſuch a careleſs Pen, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo groſs an error in matter of fact, eſpecially in ſuch things as were under his eye; and therefore I reſolve as before I did (till I ſhall ſee ſome better reaſon to the contrary, then I have done hitherto) that there was a general Order for the diſcharge of the twelve impriſoned Biſhops, on <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. and that they were remanded back again, by the power and importunity of the Houſe of Commons, upon the reaſons formerly laid down in the <hi>Animadverſions.</hi>

                  <hi>Author</hi> was ſomewhat more then half aſleep when this note fell from him; for otherwiſe me thinks he could not be ſo much a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the affairs of the Church, as not to know, that ever ſince the time of <hi>William</hi> the ſecond (for ſo long that ill cuſtome hath continued) nothing hath been more ordinary with the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> then to enter on the temporalities of all vacant Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks, whether it be by death, promotion, or what way ſoever, and to receive the mean profits of them, till the new Biſhop after the doing of his homage, hath taken out a writ for their reſtitution.</p>
               <p>47. Our Author now drawes toward an end, and for a concluſion to his Book (contrary in a manner to all former Precedents) addreſſeth an Epiſtle, <hi>To the Religious, Learned, and judicious Reader.</hi> In which he feeds himſelf and his Reader alſo, with the hopes of this, that there are no more Errors to be found in his Hiſtory, then thoſe which have been noted in the <hi>Animadverſions.</hi> 
                  <q>This I will add, ſaith he, (for thus he doth beſpeak his Reader) for my

comfort, and thy better confidence in reading my Book, that according to the received rule in Law, <hi>Exceptio firmat Regulam in non exceptis;</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth proportionably, that <hi>Animadverſio firmat Regulam in non Animadverſis.</hi> And if ſo, by the Tacit conſent of my Adverſary himſelf, all other paſſages in my Book are allowed ſound and true, ſave thoſe few which fall under his reproof.</q> But if ſo (as it is much otherwiſe) the paſſages which fall under the <hi>Reproof of the Animadvertor,</hi> are not ſo <hi>few,</hi> as to give the Reader any confidence, that all the reſt are to be allowed for ſound and true. <hi>Non omnem molitor quae fluit unda videt,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb hath it; <hi>The Miller ſees not all the water which goes under his Mill,</hi> much of it paſſing by without obſervation, and <hi>if the blind eat many a fly,</hi> as the Engliſh <hi>Adage</hi> ſaith he doth, he may ſwallow many an Error alſo, without diſcovery, when he firſt finds them in his diſh. And ſo it was with me in the Review of our Authors Hiſtory, the ſecond peruſal whereof preſented many Errors to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which had not been noted in the firſt. And ſince the publiſhing of the <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> I have fallen accidentally upon divers others, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, of which I ſhall advertiſe him in a private way, whenſoever he ſhall pleaſe to deſire it of me.</p>
               <p>48. And here I thought I ſhould have ended, but the <hi>Appealant</hi> puts me to the anſwering of two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the Biſhops, having place in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a third Eſtate. Which two Objections may be Anſwered without being heard, as being made
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:114876:206"/>
againſt the clear letter of the Law, the expreſs words of ſeveral Statutes and Records of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as alſo againſt the poſitive determination of Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> the moſt learned Lawyer of our times, whoſe judgement in that point, may ſeem to carry the authority of a Parliament with it, becauſe by Order of this Parliament his Books were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be Printed; But ſince the <hi>Appealant</hi> doth require it in the way of curteſie, I will ſerve him in it as well as I can, at the preſent, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging my ſelf in any further enquiry after thoſe particulars. And firſt as to the Biſhop of <hi>Man,</hi> the reaſon why he hath no vote in Parliament, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not hold his Lands <hi>per integram Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iam,</hi> as is implyed in the Objections, but becauſe he doth not hold his Lands of the King at all. The Biſhop of <hi>Man</hi> is Homiger to the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> (as the chief Lord of the Iſland) of his ſole nomination and dependance; and therefore there could be no reaſon which might induce the King of <hi>England</hi> to admit thoſe Biſhops to a place and vote in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who held nothing of them, and of whoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and affections they could promiſe little. And ſo much I remember to have read in the learned Work of <hi>Francis Maſon, de Miniſterio Anglicano,</hi> building therein (if my memory do not too much fail me) upon the judgement and authority of the learned <hi>Andrews,</hi> in his Elaborate <hi>Apologie</hi> againſt Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:114876:206"/>
therefore that the Biſhops ſit not in the Parliament, as a third Eſtate: I ſhall for brevity ſake refer the <hi>Appealant</hi> to my anſwer, to the Book called, <hi>The ſtumbling Block, &amp;c. cap. 5. Sect. 7. 8. &amp;c.</hi> where he ſhall find the point diſcourſed more at large then theſe ſhort Remembrances can admit of. I ſhall onely now adde thus much, that in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation made by the twelve Biſhops, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled amongſt the Records of that houſe, they thereby entred their Proteſt <hi>againſt all ſuch Laws, Orders, Votes, Reſolutions, and determinations, as in themſelves null and of none effect, which in their abſence ſince the 27th. of</hi> December, 1641. <hi>as were already paſſed; and likewiſe againſt ſuch as ſhould hereafter paſs in that moſt honourable houſe during the time of their forced and violent abſence from it, &amp;c.</hi> Which certainly ſo many Grave, Learned, and Judicious men would never have done, if they had not looked upon themſelves in the capacity of a third Eſtate, according to the Laws of the Realm, expreſt in ſeveral Acts and Records of Parliament. And whereas he requeſts me when my hand is in, to anſwer an Objection taken from a paſſage in the Parliament at <hi>Northampton,</hi> under <hi>Hen.</hi> the ſecond, in which the Biſhops claimed their place not as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, but Barons (<hi>Non ſedemus hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For that the Biſhops ſat in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a double capacity, will be no hard matter to evince; conſidering that they ſat as Biſhops in
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:114876:207"/>
all publick Councels, before the entrance of the <hi>Normans;</hi> and that when <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror changed their tenure, from <hi>Frank Almoigne,</hi> to <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But this diſpute is out of doors, as the caſe now ſtands, which makes me willing to decline all ſuch further trouble, which the <hi>Appealant</hi> ſeems deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to impoſe upon me.</p>
               <p>50. That which I have already done in Order to his ſatisfaction, is more then he can challenge in the ordinary courſe of Diſputation, or hath deſerved at my hands in the managing of it. He tells us in the Third Chapter of his <hi>Apparatus,</hi> that finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe neceſſitated to return an anſwer to the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions,</hi> he was reſolved firſt to abſtain from all Rayling, that being a <hi>ſick wit,</hi> or the <hi>ſickneſs of wit,</hi> as he truly notes; And ſecondly, not to be <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt the Credit of the Animadvertor,</hi> though perchance he may have ſomething tart to quicken the Appetite of the Reader.

               <p>53. Till this was done, I could not think my ſelfe in a condition to embrace any of thoſe civil and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious overtures which are made in the <hi>Appealants</hi> Letter. And yet there was ſome other reaſon, which made this ſhort anſwer ſeem ſo neceſſary, as not to
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:114876:209"/>
be honeſtly avoided; A report being ſpred abroad and printed in one of Squire <hi>Sanderſons</hi> bald and ſcurrilous Pamphlets, that I had begged pardon of the <hi>Appealant</hi> by a ſupplicatory and ſubmiſſive Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for my writing againſt him, which baſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Report might have found belief (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my labouring to decry it in the general Preface to this book, before the <hi>Appealants</hi> was ſent to me) if I had not ſhowed my ſelfe in this ſhort Reply, to be as free from any fear of Mr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> as I conceive my ſelf to be out of his Danger. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I be out of his danger or no, muſt be referred to the equal and impartial Reader, whom I beſeech not to be wanting to himſelf in a diligent compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> with this Anſwer to it, in every branch and clauſe of either as they lye before him; And then I ſhall not doubt of ſuch a favourable ſentence, as on an equal hearing, can be given in Chancery to an honeſt cauſe. Which brief account being offered to <hi>Examination,</hi> will prove, I hope, as ſatisfactory in the <hi>ſumma Totalis,</hi> as if the ſeveral <hi>Items</hi> had been ſpecified, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up particularly, whenſoever any equal &amp; judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Auditor,</hi> ſhall trouble himſelf in caſting up the <hi>Reckonings</hi> which are between us.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AT the End of your <hi>Appeal</hi> (which came not to my hand till Friday the ſixt of this moneth) I find a very civil Letter directed to me, in which you propoſe a <hi>breathing time,</hi> after ſome wearineſſe in the encounters which have paſt between us; and the ſuſpending of ſuch <hi>Animoſities</hi> as we may be ſuppoſed to harbour againſt one another. But for my part as I have had no ſuch long breathing time, (ſince thoſe Papers which relate to you firſt paſt my hands) as might make me the more ready for this ſecond onſet; ſo you may take as long or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, as you pleaſe, to conſider of it, before you return to the encounter. <hi>Animoſities</hi> I have none againſt you, and therefore none to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in this <hi>Inter-Parleance:</hi> My affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair to your perſon, though not to the cauſe, for which you ſeem moſt to have appeared in the whole courſe of your Hiſtory: And if you had appeared ſo, onely to my apprehenſion, I had been the more inexcuſable both to God and Man; and the more accomptable to you, for conceiving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:114876:210"/>
of you, then you had deſerved. But I am confident there are very few true Sonnes of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who could make any other judgement of you, out of your Hiſtory, then was made by me; and therefore you muſt thank your ſelfe, if any greater noiſe hath been made about it, then you could willingly have heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You know what <hi>Caeſars</hi> Reſolution was about his wife, for having her as free from the <hi>ſuſpition,</hi> as the <hi>crime</hi> of <hi>Incontinency;</hi> and therefore if your Conſcience do acquit you, from the crim it ſelf, in Acting any thing againſt the Intereſt of the Church your Mother, you had done very well, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, had you kept your ſelfe free from the <hi>ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> alſo of ſuch diſaffections.</p>
               <p>You tell me, <hi>that you are cordiall to the Cauſe of the Engliſh Church, and that your hoary hairs will go down into the Grave in ſorrow for her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi> But then as <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 14.</note>

                     </gap>in my Ears, and the lowing, of Oxen which I heare.</hi> What mean thoſe dangerous Poſitions, and thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconvenient expreſſions (that I may give them no worſe name) which occur ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your Book, and which no man, who is <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial to the Cauſe of the Engliſh Church,</hi> can either read with patience, or paſs over with pardon. If you would be believed in this, you muſt not ſpeak the ſame Language in your ſecond Edition, as you have done in the firſt, or leave ſo much in it of the former <hi>Leven</hi> as may <hi>ſoure</hi> the <hi>whole lumpe</hi> of your performance. Nor would I have you
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:114876:210"/>
think it to be any diſhonour to caſt aſide thoſe <hi>ſoure Grapes,</hi> whenſoever they ſhall come to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond gathering, at which ſo <hi>many of the teeth</hi> of your <hi>Mothers</hi> Children <hi>have been ſet on edge:</hi> there being no greater Victory to be gained in the World, then what a Man gets upon himſelf. You have ſaid as much as could be in your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and therefore may come off with ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your ſelf and others. In altering all or any of thoſe paſſages, which have given occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the moſt of your brethren. And you may take this occaſion for it, not as neceſſitated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the force of Argument, but as <hi>Sylla</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his <hi>Dictator-ſhip,</hi> rather out of his good affections to the peace and happineſs of the Common-wealth, then compelled by Arms.</p>
               <p>You are pleaſed to take notice of ſome <hi>Parts</hi> that God hath given us, thinking we might have uſed them better, then in theſe Pen Combates; and that the differences betwixt us will occaſion ſuch <hi>Rejoycings</hi> in the common Enemy, as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Trojans,</hi> on the fallings out of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles.</hi> But I hope you doe not think in earneſt, that either of us are ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the ſight of our Enemies, as thoſe Great Commanders were in theirs, or that any great matter of <hi>Rejoycings</hi> can be given them by our weak contentions. In which what ſatisfaction you are able to give your ſelfe for ſpending ſo much of your <hi>Parts, Pains,</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> in the drawing up of your <hi>Appeal,</hi> is known onely to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:114876:211"/>
God and your own Conſcience. But for my part, I am not conſcious to my ſelfe of any miſpendings in that kind, in reference to the writing of my <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dverſions;</hi> in which as I had no other end, then the vindicating the truth, the Church, and the injured Clergy; ſo I can confidently ſay, that I have writtten nothing in the whole courſe of that Book (to the beſt of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) which was not able to abide the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of truth, whenſoever it was brought unto it. The ſmalleſt truth is worth the ſeeking, and many truths are worth the finding: No loſs of time, or miſ-imployment of our parts or pains, to be complained of in that purſuit. And therefore I ſhall ſay in the Words of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Doctor <hi>Hackwell,</hi> 
                  <q>That ſuch is the admirable Beauty and Soveraignty of truth in it ſelf, and ſuch infinite content doth it yeild the ſoul being found and embraced; that had I propoſed no other end to my ſelf in this preſent Treatiſe then the diſcovery and unfolding thereof, I ſhould hold it alone a very ample recompenſe and ſufficient reward of my labour.</q> 
                  <hi>Fracta, vel leviter imminuta Auctoritate veritatis, omnia dubia remanebant,</hi> as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath it.</p>
               <p>You tell me alſo, that as you know, I will not allow you to be my equal, ſo you will not acknowledg me to be your ſuperiour; whereby you tacitly conclude your ſelf for the better man, as much above me in the fortune and ſucceſs of the preſent Duel, as <hi>Ceſar</hi>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:114876:211"/>
was above <hi>Pompey</hi> in the War between them: In which though I may ſuffer you to enjoy the jollity of your own opinion; yet it is more then probable, that ſuch as have obſerved the conduct of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on either ſide, may think otherwiſe of it: Which being referred to the finall ſentence of thoſe only who are made Judges of the field, I ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſhut up the Quarrel, upon ſuch conditions as are propounded in your Letter, one only of my own being added to them: &amp; I conceive, that having offered theſe ſhort notes to the publick view, I might do it without any diſadvantage of reputation. By ſome paſſages in your Book and Letter: I find that you take notice of a remedileſs infirmity, and decay of ſight, which is fallen upon me, rendring me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly unfit for further engagements of this nature; and I finde alſo on the other ſide that you have many advantages above me, both in friends and Books, of both which by the plundering of my Library, and the nature of a Country life, I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt totally unfurniſhed: Which though it may give you many fair and flattering hopes of an eaſie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, whenſoever you ſhall enter the Liſts again; yet as unfurniſhed as I am of all humane helps, but ſuch as I have within my ſelf, I little doubt of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good the cauſe againſt you, if every point there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould ſtand in need of re-examining, as I think none doth: However I have learned of Chriſt our common Maſter, <hi>to agree with mine Adverſary while I am in the way with him,</hi> eſpecially where it may be done, not only <hi>ſalva Charitate,</hi> but <hi>ſalva Veritate</hi>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:114876:212"/>
alſo; where the agreement may be made, as well without any loſs to truth, as improvement to charity. I muſt needs ſay you have offered me very fair conditions, whereby I am put into the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this agreement, which I ſhall follow with the greater chearfulneſs (you may call it paſſion if you pleaſe) when I ſhall ſee ſome good effects of your <hi>Proteſtations,</hi> ſuch reparation made to <hi>INJ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RED INNOCENCE,</hi> as is profeſſed in your <hi>Appeal.</hi> Which happy hour whenſoever it comes, I ſhall not only give you the right hand of Fellowſhip, as the Apoſtles did to <hi>Paul,</hi> when from a Perſecutor of the Church, he became one of the chief Pillars in it, but the right hand of precedency<note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 48. 14</note> alſo, which the old and dim-ſighted Patriarch gave to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> though the younger Brother. We ſhall not then enter into the Diſpute, which of us goes firſt out of the field, or turn our backs toward one another, according to your Emblem of the two Lions endorſed (which you have very well noted out of <hi>Gerrard Leigh</hi>) for avoiding contentions in the way; but hand in hand together as becometh Brethren, the Sons not only of the ſame Father, but of the ſame Mother too. Nor ſhall we then enter into a Diſpute, which of the two ſhall be reputed for the good <hi>Philemon,</hi> or which the Fugitive <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus;</hi> there being as great a readineſs in me, to ſubmit unto you in all points of civility, as there can be averſneſs in you to acknowledg me for your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour by way of Argument. So doing we ſhall both be Victors, though neither can be ſaid to be
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:114876:212"/>
vanquiſhed, and ſhall conſolidate a friendſhip, without the intervening of a reconcilement. And on theſe tearms none ſhall be readier to preſerve either a valuable eſteem whilſt we live together, or a fair memory of you, if you go before me, then</p>
