         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Introduction.</head>
               <p>THE Ingenious Author of this Treatiſe has herein laid a great many Experiments and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations together, in order to prove
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57199:3"/>
that Water is the only firſt Material Principle of Natural Bodies; and that all the other pretended Hypoſtatical Principles are ultimate and reducible into mere Elementary Water. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to give a brief and perſpicuous account of his Reaſonings upon this Subject, he has thought it expedient to reduce them to the following Propoſitions.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>Sect. I.</head>
               <head type="sub"> The Ardent Spirits of Vegetables are nothing elſe but the Oleous Particles of theſe Vegetables ſubtilized by Fermentation, and thereby diſſolved in, and united to ſome part of their own Phlegm.</head>
               <p>FOR <hi>Lavender, Rue, Marjoram,</hi> &amp;c. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled without addition, and without a previous Fermentation, afford an Oyl, but never yield any burning Spirit. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as after Fermentation they yield an ardent Spirit, but no Oyl; which is a manifeſt proof, that the inflamable Oyl is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into an inflamable Spirit: eſpecially, ſince by the laſting action of the Air upon this Spirit, the Oleous part will at laſt be brought to ſeparate it ſelf from the phlegm
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57199:3"/>
and ſwim above it. Moreover if you pour Oyls in ſmall quantity upon Fermenting Vegetables, they will come over in Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the form of Spirits.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>the Spirits of</hi> Aniſeeds, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and ſuch other <hi>Oleous and Aromatick Vegetables,</hi> that are <hi>prepared with Spirit of Wine without any previous Fermentation</hi>; they <hi>are nothing elſe but the Oyls</hi> of theſe Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables <hi>that the Spirit of Wine has imbibed and carried up along with it in Diſtillation.</hi> For this Spirit, being it ſelf no other thing than the Oyl of Wine Diſſolv'd in Phlegm, will preſently imbibe any Aromatick Oyl dropt into it. Hence it is, that, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Spirit of <hi>Aniſeeds,</hi> the Oleous part of the Spirit of Wine imbibes as much of their Oyl as it can receive, and the reſt (for they abound with Oyl) being joyn'd with the Phlegmatick part of the Spirit of Wine, compoſe a Milk-coloured Liquor, (as all Oyls do when they are mixed with Water, which we ſee daily in the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Emulſions) whoſe Oily parts may be imbibed by freſh Spirit of Wine, and by that means yield Spirit of <hi>Aniſeeds</hi> anew.</p>
               <p>Finally, 'tis upon the account of their Oleous nature, that ardent Spirits are ſo Inflamable; and that they ſo much weaken
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57199:4"/>
the Corroding Acidity of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> as to render it innocent enough to be taken inwardly, though they themſelves be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a certain Volatile Acid.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>Sect. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Spirits of Vegetables, made by Incineration, are nothing elſe but the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salts of the Tartar of theſe Plants, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in their own Phlegm.</head>
               <p>FOR they conſiſt of the <hi>Effluvia</hi> that aſcend from the Plants, while their Tartar is a Calcining into a fixt Salt, <hi>kept</hi> from flying away into the Air, by reaſon of the peculiar ſtructure of the Furnaces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> imployed in this kind of Incineration: and are therefore altogether of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Spirit of Soot, or even with the genuine bitteriſh Alcaline Spirit of <hi>Tartar of Wine. N.B.</hi> Since in the Juice of Grapes, the Alcali and Acid, mutually Coagulated, obtain the name of <hi>Tartar,</hi> Why ſhould not the ſame Salts, con-coagulated in the Juices of other Vegetables, though endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with very different Seeds, obtain the ſame Appellation, rather than that of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Salts?</hi> For there is really, in the Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all Vegetables, a Tartar not unlike to that of Wine. So that the Spirits, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Incineration of Plants, do,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57199:4"/>
like that of <hi>Vinous Tartar,</hi> proceed from the Tartars of theſe Plants; which ſeeing they conſiſt of the ſame Salts, namely Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly and Acid, thoſe Spirits are indeed nothing elſe but theſe Salts in a Fluid ſtate. Hence if genuine <hi>Spirit of Tartar</hi> be drawn off from an Alcaliſate Salt, the Volatile Acid being left in the fixt Alcaly, <hi>it</hi> will ſtrike your Noſe with the pungent ſcent of a Volatile Urinous Salt.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>Sect. III.</head>
               <head type="sub"> The Alcaline <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinous Spirits of Animals are nothing elſe, but the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salts of theſe Animals, diſſolved in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of their own Phlegm.</head>
               <p>[FOR, 1. If you put Spirit of Urine, or any other Urinous Spirit, well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, into a glaſs conveniently ſhaped, a gentle heat will ſublime good ſtore of dry Volatile Salt into the ſlender neck of the Glaſs, leaving a weak Phlegmatick Liquor in the bottom; which would be mere inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Phlegm, if it could be perfectly freed from the Volatile Salt that 'tis yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with, and from the ſubtle Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Oyl that generally, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, aſcend together with theſe Spirits, and continue inviſibly mixed with them (though never ſo well rectified, even to a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57199:5"/>
perfect tranſparency) for a long time, 'till at length by the action of the Air, or evaporation of the Volatile Salt (if the Glaſs be not very well ſtop'd) or the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine motion of the parts of the Liquor, <hi>though</hi> it <hi>be,</hi> the Particles of Oyl begin to ſeperate themſelves from the reſt of the Liquor, and gather together into nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous little drops, which, though they be ſingly inviſible, yet render the whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor muddy and of a reddiſh colour. 2. In the Diſtillation, for inſtance, of Fermented Urine, or of Sal Armoniack mingled with a fixt Salt, uſually the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt ſublimes at firſt in a dry form; but if you continue the Diſtillation, ſo much of the Phlegm will aſcend as ſhall diſſolve all your Volatile Salt, and waſh it it down into the Receiver, where you have it in the form of a Spirit. 3. If you diſſolve, in common Water Diſtilled, as much Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt of Human Blood (for inſtance) as it will take up, and Diſtil this mixture, you will by that means obtain a Liquor, that by its ſmell, taſt, and divers Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, appears to be a good brisk Spirit of Human Blood; as that incomparable promoter of Experimental Philoſophy, Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> has obſerved in his late uſeful Treatiſe about <hi>Human Blood.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57199:5"/>
                  <hi>The ſame is to be ſaid of the Alcaline Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that are Diſtilled from</hi> Peas, Beans, <hi>and ſome other Vegetables:</hi> For they appear by divers effects to be much of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Urinous Spirits.]</p>

               <head type="sub">The Acid Spirits of Minerals (as Sea-ſalt, Vitriol, Sulphur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Acid Salts of theſe Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals freed from the more Terrestrial Parts, united with a little Phlegm, and ſo reduced into a fluid ſtate by the force of the fire.</head>
               <p>FOR you may reduce them to a dry Salt by pouring them upon an Alcaly. For inſtance, Spirit of Vitriol, after it has been imployed to corrode Iron, and the ſuperfluous moiſture evaporated, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porifies into Vitriol. And Spirit of Nitre, ſatiated with Salt of Tartar or any other fixt Salt, turns into Nitre again after eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. Moreover theſe Acid Spirits are often found upon the Corks (that ſtop the Glaſſes wherein they are kept) in a dry ſaline form.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of the <hi>Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Vegetables,</hi> as that of <hi>Vinegar, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, Guaiac,</hi> &amp;c. which <hi>are nothing elſe but Eſſential Salts diſſolved in Phlegm.</hi>

               <head>Sect. V.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Oyls or Sulphurs of Vegetables are nothing elſe but Volatile Salts concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, in union with an unctuous inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Acid; <hi>which by its unctuoſity hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them to mix readily with Water, as all Salts uſe to do.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THerefore <hi>Helmont</hi> often affirms, that Vegetable Oyls may be turned into Volatile Salts. But however that be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned with fixt Salts, they turn into a Soap; and if they be frequently drawn off, they are thereby at laſt reſolved into mere Elementary Water: which is alſo true of all Fermented ardent Spirits, ſince they are but Oyls diſſolved in Phlegm. Thus Spirit of Wine, drawn off from Salt of Tartar, leaves its ſeminal Acid behind it, and comes over weak and Phlegmatick: and if this abſtraction be often reiterated, it is thereby at length reſolved into pure Elementary Water, as will be more fully declared hereafter.</p>
               <p>There is a certain Vegetable Sulphur, found in Charcoals before they be burnt to aſhes, by vertue whereof they glow. It is ſeparated by means of Alcali's and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation. This <hi>Sulphur</hi> is of a golden colour, and of no contemptible uſe: but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57199:6"/>
if the Charcoal be Diſtilled in a Retort with an open fire, <hi>it</hi> turns, like all other Sulphurs, into an Acid Spirit, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poured upon the fixt Salt of the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> makes an efferveſcence with it, and ſo is Coagulated into a Salt.</p>

               <head type="sub">The fixt Salts of Vegetables, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by Calcination, were not naturally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent in that form, but are produced of the Volatile Salts, colliquated amongſt themſelves and with the Earthy Particles, by the force of the Fire.</head>
               <p>'TIS true, there naturally exiſts, in the Juice of Grapes and of all other Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, a Tartar ſo fixt as to be inodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and to endure the Air (though not the Fire) without flying away. Which fixtneſs proceeds from the Acid, that ſatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the Volatile Alcali of this Tartar; as we ſee in the Volatile Salt of Urine, Soot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being ſatiated with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt, are thereby fixed into Sal-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, that has no ſmell. The Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the Juices, preſſed out of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Pears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a manifeſt proof of this Tartarous Salt; for there can be no Fermentation without Acid and Alcaly, which are the conſtituent Principles of Tartar. But there is no Salt, pre-exiſtent to Calcination in any Vegetable, ſo fixt as to endure the Fire as well as the Air. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ordinary way of preparing fixt Salts, is, by burning the dried Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57199:8"/>
to Aſhes in an open Fire, Lixiviating theſe Aſhes by decoction in common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and expoſing this Lee to ſome heat, 'till the greateſt part of the Water being Evaporated, the ſaline Particles, formerly diſperſed in the Pores of the Liquor, unite together for want of room into Cryſtals, of different Figures, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the ſeminal Acid. Others Diſtill a certain Acid ſeminal Spirit from the Plant, reduced to Aſhes by a moderate Fire, and Lixiviate the Salt that remains in the retort with this Spirit. Again others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this Acid, caſt a little <hi>Sulphur</hi> upon the Salt, when 'tis highly Calcined, <hi>whoſe</hi> ſeminal Acid gives a certain <hi>form</hi> to the Salt, in place of <hi>that</hi> which the extreme Calcination had deſtroyed; leſt, if the Salt were wholly deſtitute of a ſeminal Acid, it ſhould reſolve into Elementary Water, as ſhall be made out hereafter. But <hi>Tachenius</hi>'s method is the beſt; namely, <hi>to</hi> reduce the Plants, whilſt they are freſh and green, into black Aſhes with a very gentle Fire, ſo as they may not break out into a manifeſt flame; <hi>to</hi> Calcine theſe Aſhes to whiteneſs in an Earthen Pot over the fire, ſtirring them ever now and then; after this <hi>to</hi> Lixiviate them with common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>to</hi> evaporate the Lee to the conſiſtence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57199:9"/>
of Honey; then <hi>to</hi> urge it with a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fire to browneſs: and laſt of all <hi>to</hi> diſſolve and Chryſtalliſe it. One pound of Aſhes, prepared after this manner, will yield near four ounces of very pure fixt Salt: whereas four pound Calcined by the former methods, will ſcarce yield one ounce. The reaſon of ſo great a difference, depends partly upon the greenneſs of the Plants, and partly upon the moderateneſs of the Fire imployed to Calcine them. For dried Plants (for inſtance <hi>Wormwood)</hi> do always afford leſs fixt Salt than green ones; whence it manifeſtly follows, that by Exſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iccation ſome Saline Particles are carried away with the Aqueous ones, which would have compoſed a part of the fixt Salt, if the Plant had been Calcined while it was green: now theſe Salts could not fly away unleſs they were Volatile. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as the Volatile Salts of a Plant are ſpent by the action of the Air in Exſiccati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo are they likewiſe by the action of the Fire in Calcination; and this ſo much the more, by how much the Fire is more violent; for the Particles of a <hi>manifeſt flame,</hi> being in exceeding quick motion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Volatile Salts to a ſwifter motion, and conſequently a more copious avolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than thoſe of a gentle ſmothering Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57199:9"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you take the <hi>Soot</hi> that aſcends in the Calcination of Tartar, (otherwiſe called the <hi>Spirit of Tartar,</hi>) and put it back again to the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> you will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much increaſe the quantity of the fixt Salt: And if all the Volatile ſaline Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Tartar could be kept from flying away in Calcination, they would all turn into a fixt Salt. But if all of them were driven away, 'twere not poſſible to obtain one grain of fixt Salt: which yet never happens, becauſe they cannot all fly away at once, but one after another; ſo that thoſe, which were to fly away laſt, are by reaſon of their longer ſtay in the fire, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquated, and ſo fixed; and that partly by the Acid Particles that feed the flame (and condenſe the ſmoak into Soot) and partly by the Earthy Particles, commixed with the Volatile Salts that are Coagulated in the Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis impoſſible to extract one grain of fixt Salt from any Vegetable, not yet calcined to Aſhes, that is, ſo long as there remains any ſmoke, or the leaſt motion, of the Vegetable Particles (ſuch as we ſee in glowing Charcoal;) but when this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ceaſes, 'tis a ſign that all the remaining Particles are Coagulated and fixed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57199:10"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Soot is nothing elſe but a heap of Volatile Particles Coagulated together, and yet by Calcination it affords a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity of fixt Salt; which muſt proceed from the Colliquation of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salts, ſince there can be none but ſuch in Soot: for fixt Salts are ſo conſtant in the Fire that they cannot aſcend in the form of Flame or Smoak, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot enter the compoſition of Soot. And that the <hi>Salts</hi> of Soot are Volatile, is alſo manifeſt from hence, that, by means of Spirit of Salt, <hi>they</hi> may be turned to Sal-Armoniack, and conſequently (when the Acid Spirit is ſeparated by the addition of a fixed Alcali) into a Volatile and highly Urinous Salt. So that the matter, of which the fixt Salt of Soot conſiſts, are theſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salts of Soot, one Acid and another Urinous, Colliquated together and with the Terreſtrial Particles, by the force of the Fire. Nor can it be ſaid, that the <hi>fixt</hi> Salt of Soot was carried up by the <hi>Volatile</hi>; for (beſides that there was no fixt Salt pre-exiſtent in the mixt Body) by this means it would be no more a fixt but a Volatile Salt: and if we conſider the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the fixt Salt of Soot to the weight of the Soot it ſelf, it will eaſily appear, that Soot contains not enough of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57199:10"/>
                  <hi>Volatile</hi> Salt to elevate ſuch a quantity of <hi>Fixt,</hi> ſince <hi>that</hi> ought to exceed <hi>this</hi> almoſt in a triple proportion. Thus <hi>though</hi> if you mingle fixt Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> with a ſufficient proportion of <hi>its own,</hi> or any other, Volatile Salt, and commit this mixture to ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Author denies not but that ſome parts of the fixt Salt will be elevated by the other Salt; <hi>yet</hi> he affirms, that theſe are not integral parts, but have loſt the nature of a fixt Salt, and are really turned into a <hi>Volatile</hi> one, becauſe this ſublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeparates them from the Terreſtial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, their union with which was the only thing that kept them in a fixt ſtate. In the like manner <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> being digeſted with fixt Salt of Tartar, and drawn off by Diſtillation, carries along with it ſome of the ſaline Particles (whence <hi>it</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Tartaris'd,)</hi> but no Terreſtrial ones, and conſequently no fixt Salt but a Volatile. <hi>Again, as 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to obtain one grain of fixt Salt from Soot, before a violent Calcination, ſo the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the fixt Salt is increaſed by all the ſame methods that reſtrain the Volatile from flying away in this Calcination:</hi> namely if it be Calcined in a cloſe Veſſel, with an intenſe Fire at the beginning, (that the Volatile Salts may be the ſooner colliquated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57199:11"/>
they can have time to fly away) then beaten, and kept ſtirring over the Fire 'till it be of a cineritious colour. The Soot alſo, that aſcends in the Calcination of Soot, being put back again to the <hi>Caput Mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> increaſes the quantity of the fixt Salt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, Whatſoever ſeparates the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial parts from any fixt Salt, does at the ſame time deſtroy its Fixity, and Volatiliſe the ſaline parts.</hi> Which our Author makes out by ſeveral Experiments. 1. If you pour Spirit of Salt, by degrees, upon a Lee of Salt of Tartar, (or of any other Alcaliſate Salt,) 'till it be almoſt ſatiated, (which is known by the abating of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence,) you ſhall obſerve a kind of Earth precipitate out of the fixt Salt, (namely becauſe, <hi>upon the mutual conflict, between an Acid and an Alcali, whatſoever heterogeneous ſubſtance is contained in either of them uſes to precipitate.)</hi> The <hi>Earthy</hi> part of the Salt of Tartar being thus ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the <hi>ſaline</hi> part is thereby render'd Volatile, and would actually fly away, were it not for the Acid that fixes <hi>it</hi> anew: and if you ſeparate this Acid, by the addition of new Salt of Tartar, it will by this means be ſet at liberty, and ſtrike your Noſtrils with an Urinous odour. Thus, if you ſeparate the Liquor from the precipitated
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57199:11"/>
Earth by Filtration, then reduce it to Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals by evaporation, and laſt of all, mingle an equal quantity of Salt of Tartar, with theſe Cryſtals in a Mortar; the Acid rit Spirit will joyn it ſelf to this new Salt of Tartar, and ſo the Volatile Alcali, being freed from the Acid, flies away. Nor can it be ſaid, that the forementioned Earth did but externally adhere to the Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and was not intimately united with it by Colliquation; ſince the experiment ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> though it be clear and limpid like Rock-water: but obſerve, that the Earth does not fall out of the Pores of the Oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, 'till the Salts have attain'd the point of ſaturation, and then the Liquor, that was lympid before, begins to look troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and when the Glaſs has ſtood a while, a whitiſh colour'd ſubſtance ſettles to the bottom. But the Volatile Salt, that is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Oyl of Tartar, is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker than that which is ſeparated from the dry Salt; becauſe Salts approach ſo much the nearer to the nature of Elementary Water, by how much the eaſier they run <hi>per deliquium.</hi> 2. In the very ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and for the ſame reaſon, a Volatile Urinous Salt may be obtain'd from the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of Sal-Armoniac, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57199:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of new fixt Salt. For in Sal-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack there is a ſomewhat fixt Acid Spirit, combined with the Volatile Salt of Urine and Soot; which Acid, being imbib'd by the Salt of Tartar, (that is mingled with the Sal-Armoniack immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Diſtillation,) the Volatile Salt is ſet at liberty, and preſently flies away. And in the mean time, the forementioned Acid diſſolves the Union, between the Earthy and Saline Particles of the Salt of Tartar, and thereby renders the ſaline ones Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; which therefore, ſo ſoon as they are freed from this Acid, by the addition of new Salt of Tartar to the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> do preſently aſcend, even without Fire, with a moſt piercing Urinous odour. And even from this ſecond <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> you may obtain a Volatile Salt, by the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a third portion of Salt of Tartar. 3. The Volatiliſation of Salt of Tartar, by the help of Vinegar, depends upon the ſame Principle. For they pour Vinegar upon the Salt of Tartar, and draw it off very Phlegmatick; for the Acid Salt is left in the Salt of Tartar. Then they pour on freſh Vinegar, and abſtract it as before; and reiterate this Operation ſo often, 'till the Vinegar came over as Acid as when it was poured on: which is a ſign that the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57199:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Salt of Tartar is now ſatiated with the Acid of the Vinegar, and conſequently Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latilis'd by the ſeparation of the Earth that fix'd it. For if you pour Vinegar upon the Lee of Tartar, to the point of ſatura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Earth of the Tartar will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently precipitate. 4. The Preparation of <hi>Balſam of Samech</hi> is of no ſmall affinity to this; namely, the Volatiliſation of Salt of Tartar, by a frequent abſtraction of Spirit of Wine from it. For the Spirit that is firſt poured on, though it were highly rectifi'd, comes off Phlegmatick, with very great loſs of its igneous vertue; becauſe 'tis in great part turned into a Water, by being rob'd of its ſeminal Acid. But, ſo ſoon as the Salt of Tartar is fully ſatiated with this Acid, (which cannot be without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterating the abſtraction of freſh Spirit a great many times, ſince Salt of Tartar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a great quantity of the ſtrongeſt Vinegar to ſatiate it, though the Acidity of Vinegar be manifeſt and more fixt, whereas that of Spirit of Wine is occult and Volatile,) and the Spirit comes off without loſs of ſtrength, the Alcali of the Tartar is found to have been Volatilis'd, by being ſeparated from the Earth that fix'd it. Hence you may obſerve a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Spirit of Wine Tartariſed,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57199:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which argues, that the Acid Particles of the Spirit are Converted into ſweet ones, by being Coagulated in the Alcaliſate ones of the Salt of Tartar that aſcend with them; in like manner as when Vinegar is Coagulated in <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars.</hi> N. B. 'Tis not neceſſary, in this Operation, to ſeparate the Acid from the Volatilis'd Alcaly, before this Alcaly can be made to aſcend, as it was in the Experiments made with Spirit of Salt and Vinegar; becauſe the <hi>Acid of the Spirit of Wine</hi> is much more Volatile than that of Spirit of Salt or Vinegar, and therefore, tho' <hi>it</hi> be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated in the Volatilis'd Alcaly, yet <hi>it</hi> hinders not it's Volatility. 5. The ſame Obſervation holds of Oyl of Cinnamon (and the like Diſtil'd Oyls) which being long Digeſted and Circulated with it's own <hi>Fixt Salt,</hi> Volatilizes <hi>it,</hi> and is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>it</hi> totally converted into a Volatile Salt, if <hi>Helmont</hi> rightly informs us, And 'tis eaſy to underſtand the reaſon of this, if we conſider that there is an Acid in all diſtill'd Oyls, as well as in Spirit of <hi>Wine and</hi> all other Inflamable Subſtances; which we ſhall manifeſtly prove hereafter. 6. In the Fermentation of Salt of Tartar with its own proper Ferment, namely Crude Tartar; the Acid
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57199:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the latter Precipitates the Earth of the former; (from eight ounces of each the Author has ſeen two Drams of Earth ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated) but the Volatilis'd Alcaly, being kept under the power of this Acid, does not yet manifeſt it ſelf: ſo that the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Urinous Salt which is obtain'd from hence, does not ſo much proceed from the Salt of Tartar, as from the Crude Tartar, on which the Salt of Tartar operates in this caſe, much after the ſame manner as it uſes to do as <hi>Sal-Armoniac.</hi> Which is the more probable, becauſe a very piercing Urinous Salt may be obtain'd from Crude Tartar alone, without any Salt of Tartar, only by the addition of an equal weight of Crude Alum, as <hi>Dan. Ludovicus</hi> informs us. 7. Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted with Flowers of Sulphur in a gentle heat, emits Particles extremely Urinous; which effect the Author attributes to the Acid of the Sulphur: and adds, that, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had occaſion to reduce <hi>faetid Oyl</hi> of Harts-horn into a ſoap with a certain Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caliſate Salt, the Glaſs grew warm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any External Heat, and a ſtrong Urin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Odour pierc'd his Noſe. [I am apt to think that this Odour came not from the Alcaliſate Salt, as the Author ſeems to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but from the Oyl of Harts-horn,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57199:14"/>
which without doubt contains an Urinous Salt in it. And if it contain an <hi>Acid</hi> alſo, as the Author thinks it does, the Incaleſcence might proceed from ſome conflict betwixt this &amp; the Alcaliſate Salt, which being united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Urinous Salt was perhas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſet at liberty from the Acid that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly detain'd it.] The like Odour is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the Salt produc'd by frequent abſtraction of Spirit of Wine from Salt of Tartar: Where the Author obſerves that ſome, after they have ſeveral times pour'd Spirit of Wine upon warm Salt of Tartar and abſtracted it again, do laſt of all pour on Oyl of Vitriol, and then obtain the Volatile Salt by the addition of freſh Salt of Tartar. Which Experiment, tho' the Author has not try'd, yet he judges it may ſucceed; ſince the Tereſtrial parts of the Salt of Tartar may be ſeparated by the <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> and the Alcaline parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united with this Acid, may be ſet at liberty by the addition of new Salt of Tartar.</p>
               <p>Here the Author takes occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Vertues of <hi>Salt of Tartar Volatilis'd,</hi> and affirms that <hi>it</hi> has no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Effects, (neither in the Curing of Diſeaſes, nor in the Diſſolution of Bodies,) but what other Urinous Salts do likewiſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57199:14"/>
produce. But yet he acknowledges a Specifick Difference between them, upon the account of the Seed in the Acid of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, which differs from the Seeds of other Acids: and in this reſpect other Urinous Salts do alſo differ from one another; ſince the renowned <hi>Boyl</hi> has obſerv'd, that <hi>the Volatil Salt of Harts-horn</hi> reſembles a <hi>Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelopiped,</hi> but <hi>that of Human Blood,</hi> digeſted with Spirit of Wine, is like a <hi>Rhombus.</hi> This diverſity of Figure is owing to the different Seeds or <hi>Idea</hi>'s, as reſiding in the Acids, that are the cauſes of the Solidity and Coagulation of theſe Salt: Wherefore the Fixt <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> Criſtallis'd does alſo reſemble a <hi>Rhombus,</hi> becauſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Acid of this Salt, is of the ſame kind with that of the Spirit of Wine, which being ſtronger than the Seminal Acid of the foremention'd Volatile Salt of Blood, this Salt is Coagulated according to the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Vinous Acid: even as, when Spirit of Nitre is pour'd upon Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the Acid of the former being the more powerfull, forms the Cryſtals of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long figure like Nitre, but not like Salt of Tartar, which reſembles a <hi>Rhombus.</hi> The Author concludes, that this Seminal difference of Volatile Alcalies is of little moment in Medicine, ſince all Alcalies,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57199:15"/>
even the pureſt, are endow'd with ſo much of a Seminal Acid, as does indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from a Spontaneous reſolution, into Elementary Water, but yet hinders them not from being in a capacity to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe this or that Hoſtile Morbiſic Acid indifferently. The ſame thing is to be ſaid of the fixt Alcaliſate Salts of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, for the Seminal Vertues are loſt in the Calcination, and there remains only ſo much of a ſeminal Acid, as keeps them from relapſing into Elementary Water, and does indeed cauſe them to differ ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically from one another, but not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce different Effects in Medicine.</p>
               <p>From all the foremention'd Particulars, concerning the <hi>Volatiliſing of Fixt Salts,</hi> our Author concludes, that there can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be any Method found out to effect <hi>it,</hi> but by ſeparating the Terreſtrial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. As for <hi>Zwelfers Volatile Salt of Tartar,</hi> prepar'd by often reiterated So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions (<hi>per deliquium</hi>) and Abſtractions, he affirms that 'tis nothing elſe but <hi>uſeleſs Elementary Water</hi>; as will manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him that conſiders, that <hi>Alcaliſate Salts are fundamentally nothing elſe but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Particles, converted by a little Seminal Acid into rigid Salts, which, as ſoon as the Acid is deſtroy'd, turn again into Water:</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57199:15"/>
wherefore the more violent the Calcinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, and by conſequence the greater your loſs is of this ſeminal Acid, they are the more eaſily reſolv'd <hi>per deliquium</hi> in moiſt Air, which by it's vertue, as a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> does in great part conſume the little Acid that remains and thereby reſolve a great part of the Alcaliſate Salt into Elementary Water, wherein the other Particles, not yet depriv'd of their Seed, do ſwim, (for when Salts approach to the nature of Water, they are readily diſſolv'd in it;) but if the Water be abſtracted from them, and they expos'd to the Air again, their remaining Acid is deſtroy'd, and they reſolv'd into Water in great part: and if they run <hi>per deliquium</hi> and be abſtracted often enough, all the Seminal Acid will be at length deſtroy'd, and nothing remain but bare Elementary Water, which will all of it eaſily aſcend. And by this means any Fixt Alcaliſate Salt may be totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into Elementary Water.</p>

               <p>ACID Salts, made fluid by the force of Fire, and drawn off from fixt Alcalies, may be thereby ſo rob'd of their Acid, that nothing will aſcend but Elementary Water.

               <p>
                  <hi>ALL Mixt Bodies are made up of Water, as the only first Material Principle and Seeds</hi> (which differ according to the differing <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Bodies) <hi>as the Formal Principle, united together by means of Acid Ferments:</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>Water</hi> is <hi>Coagulated</hi> into a Plant, <hi>by the Ferment of a Vegetable</hi> Seed; into a Metal, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by that of a <hi>Mineral</hi> Seed; and into Fleſh, Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an <hi>Animal Seed.</hi> For in all Mixt Bodies there are certain <hi>Acid Particles, wherein</hi> the Seeds or <hi>Ideas</hi> of Natural things do reſide, and which, <hi>in</hi> Coagulating the approximated <hi>Aliment,</hi> do follow the draught of theſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> and ſo are thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to give <hi>it</hi> the form of this or the other Vegetable Mineral, or Animal. Thus in a <hi>Mans Stomach,</hi> for example, there lurks a certain <hi>Acid,</hi> that diſcovers it ſelf by the ſour belches of healthy men, and by the Vomiting of Coagulated Milk, tho' it were taken fluid. This Acid eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Alcalical <hi>Particles</hi> of the Meat extracted by (the Alcalical <hi>Menſtruum</hi>) the Spittle, and imprints the <hi>Idea</hi> of its own Seed upon <hi>them,</hi> by which <hi>they</hi> are determin'd to nouriſh Man only, and no other Animal; as afterwards, when they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57199:17"/>
come to every particular Part of the Body, by the Circulation of the Blood, <hi>they</hi> are determin'd by the ſeminal Acid reſiding in <hi>that Part,</hi> to nouriſh <hi>it</hi> rather than any of the reſt. And that Aliment, which has once receiv'd the Seal or Impreſſion of the ſeminal <hi>Idea</hi> of any Animal <hi>in the Stomach,</hi> or of any part of the Animal <hi>in that ſame Part</hi>; will never receive the <hi>Idea</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animal, nor of another Part of the ſame Animal, unleſs it be ſuppreſs'd by a more powerfull Ferment; as when Sheeps Bones, tho' furniſh'd with their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Ferment and Idea</hi> yet, being unable to reſiſt the <hi>stronger one</hi> of a Dogs ſtomach, are therein turn'd into fit nouriſhment for the Dog, and afterwards for his Muſculous Fleſh it ſelf and other Parts, as well as for his Bones. In like manner Graſs has its own Ferment and <hi>Idea</hi> ſuppreſs'd by that of a Cows ſtomach, which ſeals it with ſuch an Impreſſion, as renders it fit Nouriſhment for a Cow, but not for any other Animal. But if the ſame Graſs had been taken into the ſtomach of a Horſe, it would have been turn'd into Nouriſhment fit for a Horſe, but unfit for a Cow or any other Animal. Again common <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is the Nouriſhment of <hi>Metals,</hi> is converted into this or the other Metal,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57199:17"/>
according to the diverſity of the Acid ſeminal Sulphur that Coagulates it. Finally all <hi>Vegetables</hi> alſo are endow'd with a ſeminal Acid, and therefore their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd Juices do, after long Fermentation, taſt Acid. And in the Fermentation of Cream of Tartar with Salt of Tartar, the <hi>Seed, Idea</hi> or <hi>Archeus,</hi> that reſide in the Acid of the Tartar, forms certain Bubbles very much reſembling natural Grapes.</p>
               <p>All this will be better underſtood here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, from the Authors particular expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the nature of the foremention'd Seeds, Ideas and Ferments: But now, to put it paſt all doubt, that Water is the only Material Principle of all Mixt Bodies, the Author has not only prov'd that all Subſtance's that Mixt Bodies can be reſolv'd into by the Chymical Art, are totally reducible into Elementary Water; but likewiſe he proves particularly, that</p>
            </div>
            <div n="14" type="proposition">
               <head>Prop. XIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Water is the only and Catholic Nouriſhment of all Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals.</head>
               <p>AND 'Tis manifeſt that every Body conſiſts of the ſame Matter that nouriſhes. 1. As for <hi>Vegetables, Helmonts</hi> Experiment proves this beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; namely, he put 200 pound of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57199:18"/>
Earth (dry'd in an oven) into an earthen veſſel, moiſten'd it with Rain-water, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in the trunk of a <hi>Willow Tree</hi> weighing 5 pound, and let it alone there for 5 years time, only watering it, as need requir'd, with Rain-water or diſtill'd Water. [And to keep the neighbouring Earth from gett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, he imploy'd a plate of Iron tin'd over and perforated with many holes.] At the 5 years end he found the Tree had grown ſo well, that it weighed 169 pound and three ounces: And yet the Earth, being dry'd again, weigh'd but two ounces leſs than it had done at firſt: ſo that above 160 pound of <hi>Wood, Bark, Root,</hi> &amp;c. had grown up out of mere Water, Coagulated by the Seminal Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Vegetable into the ſeverall <hi>Subſtances</hi> newly mention'd. Hence <hi>Rain</hi> does wonderfully refreſh, envigorate and advance the growth of, all ſorts of Plants, and without <hi>that</hi> they decay, wither and dye. For Water is indifferent to them all, till it be turn'd by the Ferment of the Vegetable Seed into <hi>Leffas,</hi> as <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> calls the Juice that is the immediate Aliment of the Plant. Thus <hi>Wolf-bane Aconitum</hi> and <hi>Lavender,</hi> for inſtance, growing in the ſame Soyl, are both nouriſh'd by the ſame Rain-water, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57199:18"/>
by the Ferment of the one is Coagulated into a poyſonous Herb, and by that of the other into a wholſome one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Animals</hi> are nouriſh'd with Water alone, appears in <hi>Fiſhes</hi>; for they live only in the Water, and yet have no food ſupply'd them from any where elſe, nor is there any Rudiment of it to be found in their Stomachs, as <hi>Helmont</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. [And tho' ſome Fiſhes feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, yet theſe others feed only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Water, and therefore are materially nothing elſe but Water.] As for <hi>Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Animals; ſome</hi> of them, as <hi>Horſes, Cows, Sheep,</hi> &amp;c. feed wholly upon Water and Graſs, which the Author has already prov'd to be materially nothing elſe but Water, and therefore that which grows in well water'd places, proſpers beſt, <hi>others,</hi> as a <hi>Lyon, Wolf,</hi> &amp;c. tho' they be not nouriſh'd by Graſs and Water only, but feed upon other Animals, yet ſtill their food is materially nothing elſe but Water, being that theſe Animals live only upon Graſs and Water, except when they are too young to digeſt Graſs, that they are nouriſh'd by their Mothers <hi>Milk,</hi> which alſo is materially nothing elſe but Water, ſince it is generated of the Mothers nutriment. [The ſame things are eaſily
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57199:19"/>
applicable to <hi>Birds</hi>;] and to <hi>Men,</hi> which feed only upon Vegetables, Fiſhes, and the Fleſh of Beaſts that are nouriſh'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Vegetables.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for <hi>Minerals</hi>; Mercury is the immediate Aliment of <hi>Metals,</hi> and ſome other Minerals, and the neareſt Matter of which they are produc'd. Now <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is nothing but Elementary Water, Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by a certain Metalline and Arſenical Sulphur</hi> into ſuch a Water as does not wet the Hands: <hi>and by other various Sulphurs 'tis further Coagulated into Antimony and divers Metals.</hi> Hence Mines are never found but where there is a great conflux of Water. <hi>Gold</hi> is gather'd out of the Sands of ſome Rivers. <hi>Sand</hi> abounds no where ſo much as near the Sea and great Rivers. <hi>Stones</hi> are nothing elſe but ſand compacted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. [And the illuſtrious <hi>Mr. Boyle</hi> has fully prov'd in a moſt ingenious as well as judicious Diſcourſe about the <hi>Origine and virtues of Gems,</hi> that many <hi>Gems</hi> and <hi>Medical Stones</hi> were once fluid Bodies. But 'twere too long, here to give an account of the many cogent Arguments he there imploys to prove this Aſſertion, which very much countenances our Authors <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</hi>] The experienc'd <hi>Helmont</hi> informs us, that it often happens in Mines when
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57199:19"/>
the Workmen are breaking the Rocks, that the Wall cleaves, and a little water of a whitiſh green Colour flows out of the cleft, &amp; preſently thickens like liquid Soap; afterwards it growes yellow or white or of a deeper green. This Juice he calls <hi>Bur,</hi> and affirms it to be the neareſt Matter of all Minerals, and to be nothing elſe but <hi>Water Coagulated by a Mineral Ferment,</hi> as <hi>Leffas</hi> is by a <hi>Vegetable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make it yet more evident, that <hi>Water is the only firſt Material Principle of Natural Bodies</hi>; the Author undertakes to prove that</p>
            </div>
            <div n="15" type="proposition">
               <head>Prop. XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">All Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals are ultimately reſoluble into Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Water.</head>
               <p>[FIRST the ſubſtances that <hi>Animals</hi> are reſolv'd into by Diſtillation, are Phlegm, Volatile Salt, Urinous Spirit, Oyl, and Earth or <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> but very little if any Fixt Salt. The <hi>Phlegm</hi> is nothing elſe but Elementary Water, except in as far as it partakes of the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt and Oyl, of which it always carries up ſome Particles, nor can it ever be perfectly ſeparated from them.] 2. The <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> of Animals is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with <hi>that</hi> of Vegetables, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57199:20"/>
Colliquated by the force of the Fire with Acid and Earthy Particles, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by turn'd into a Fixt Salt. And this fixt Salt being frequently deliquated, and the Phlegm as often abſtracted, is at length totally reſolv'd into Elementary Water. All this was abundantly prov'd before; as alſo that 3. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is nothing elſe but Volatile Salt diſſolv'd in Phlegm. 4. The <hi>Oyly</hi> and Fat parts of Animals may be united with an Alcaliſate Salt into Soap, from which being often abſtracted, they turn at length into meer Elementary Water. And this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd of all the Fats of Animals, that by frequent Circulation with Salt of Tartar they are converted into Water. 5. [<hi>As for the Fixt Salt of Animal Subſtances,</hi> 'tis the common Opinion that <hi>none can be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from them</hi>; perhaps becauſe all their <hi>Saline Parts</hi> are ſo Volatile, that (to ſpeak conſonantly to our Authors <hi>Hypotheſis</hi>) they cannot ſuſtain a Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation with the Earthy Parts, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince there are very few, if any, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly Acid ones to concur to <hi>their</hi> Fixation. But that indefatigable Searcher into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Mr. Boyle,</hi> informs us, that by an obſtinate Calcination of eight ounces and a half of <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of Human Blood,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57199:20"/>
he obtain'd above ſeven drams of <hi>Salt,</hi> which, tho it were not truly Lixivial, but rather of the nature of Sea-ſalt, yet it was Fixt enough to endure a Calcination for two days together, without flying away. However, 'tis probable, that <hi>this</hi> was nothing elſe but ſome unalter'd part of the Sea-ſalt that ſeaſon'd the Aliments, that the perſon or perſons whoſe the Blood was fed upon.] 6. The Earth alſo may be totally reſolv'd into Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Water, by being depriv'd of its ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal vertue by means of the <hi>Alcaheſt,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Van Helmont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence tis that dead Animals, when they putrify, are reſolv'd into an Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subſtance. And <hi>Helmont</hi> has deliver'd a notable Experiment to this purpoſe, namely, that if you dig up a Frog at full Moon, in the coldeſt time of Winter, (<hi>atrociſſimo hyemis borea</hi>) waſh it, and tye it to a ſtick in the Fields, the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'twill be turnd into a white and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Mucilage, not unlike to liquifi'd Gum Tragacanth, but retaining the figure of a Frog. Yea he affirms that the <hi>Cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> of a Man or Beaſt, exposd all night to the Rayes of the Moon, will in the Morning be almoſt fluid with rottenneſs, (<hi>putrilagine diffluet:</hi>) ſo great power
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57199:21"/>
has the <hi>Moon to reduce dead Bodies into an Aqueous Mucilage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[Secondly, <hi>Vegetable Subſtances</hi> Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally <hi>analyſ'd,</hi> yield Phlegm, Volatile Salt, Spirit of ſeveral ſorts, Oyl, Fixt Salt, and Earth. To the firſt, ſecond, fourth and ſixth may be apply'd what was ſaid of the <hi>Phlegm, Volatile Salt, Oyl,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> of Animal Subſtances. The <hi>Fixt Salt</hi> may be totally reſolv'd into Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Water, by reiterated Solutions in the Air, and Abſtractions, as above. There are 4. <hi>ſorts of Spirits afforded</hi> by Vegetable Subſtances. 1. <hi>Vinous</hi> inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Spirits, which were formerly prov'd to be nothing but Oyls diſſolv'd in Phlegm by Fermentation: as alſo that 2. <hi>Volatile Saline</hi> Spirits, as Spirit of <hi>Soot,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Beans</hi> (that have been kept in a <hi>dry</hi> place for ſome Months) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Volatile Salts diſſolv'd into Phlegm. And that 3. <hi>Acid</hi> Spirits, as Spirit of Vinegar, Spirit of <hi>Beans newly gather'd,</hi> &amp;c. Are nothing but Acid Salts in a fluid ſtate and united with Phlegm: and being pour'd upon <hi>Fixt Salts,</hi> they are together with <hi>them</hi> ultimately reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble into Elementary Water. 4. <hi>Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphorous</hi> Spirits of <hi>Box, Guaiacum</hi> &amp;c. Which the judicious <hi>Mr. Boyle,</hi> who was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57199:21"/>
the firſt Obſerver of them, ſuſpects to be generated of the finer parts of the Oyl of the Wood, reduc'd to an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſmallneſs, and by that means exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely mix'd with the Plegm the juice of Grapes affords: all theſe 4 ſorts of Spirits, as <hi>Mr. Boyle</hi> has obſerv'd in his excellent Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Producibleneſs of the Chymical Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, As for <hi>Minerals</hi>; We muſt rely upon the teſtimony of <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> whom <hi>Mr. Boyle</hi> concludes to be a vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Author,</hi> (except in that extravagant Treatiſe of the <hi>Magnetical Cure of Wounds,</hi>) from the ſucceſs he has had in trying ſome of <hi>his</hi> Experiments, that might ſeem not the moſt likely to ſucceed: [and I think we may juſtly lay great weight upon the judgement of ſo experiencd and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a perſon as <hi>Mr. Boyle,</hi> concerning the ſincerity of any Chymical Author.] <hi>Helmont</hi> then in ſeveral places informs us, that <hi>all Stones, Gems, Marcaſites, Metals</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may be tranſmuted into an aequiponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Salt, and this into Inſipid Water.</hi> And as for <hi>Metals,</hi> it ſeems indeed that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Mercury</hi> is their neareſt Matter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they may be reſolv'd by the ſeparation of their <hi>Coagulating Salts</hi>: and the famous <hi>Langelot</hi> has made an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this in the <hi>Regulus of Antimony.</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57199:22"/>
Now if the other <hi>Metals</hi> alſo may be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd into Mercury by depriving them of their Sulphurs,</hi> and the <hi>Mercury</hi> it ſelf be <hi>reducible into Water,</hi> (<hi>by robbing it of the Sulphurs</hi> yet remaining in it,) as <hi>Mr. Boyle</hi> ſomewhere affirms, it may in great part, and as ſeveral other Authors of good credit atteſt; then it can no more be doubted, that all Minerals are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible into Water.</p>
               <p>[It will not be unſeaſonable in this place to mention a few Experiments, deliver'd in <hi>Mr. Boyles Septical Chymiſt,</hi> that do very much countenance the three laſt Propoſitions. That excellent Author then informs us, that about the middle of May he caus'd his Gardiner, to dig out ſome good Earth, dry it well in an Oven, weigh it, put it in a very ſhallow Earthen Pot, and ſet in it a Seed of <hi>Squaſh</hi> (a ſort of Indian Pompion that grows apace) which he water'd only with Rain or ſpring Water. And tho the haſtning Winter hinder'd it from attaining any thing near its wonted magnitude, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken up about the middle of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Pompion together with the Stalk and Leaves weighed three pound wanting a quarter. And yet the Earth, being very well dry'd in an Oven, was found to have loſt little or nothing of its
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57199:22"/>
firſt weight. He try'd the like Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with two <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> which being taken out of the Earth wherein they had grown, weighed (together with the Roots and Branches) fourteen pound and ſix ounces; and yet the Earth had loſt but a pound and a half of its firſt weight, which the Gardiner judg'd to have been in great part waſted in the ordering. But granting that ſome of the Earth, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the diſſoluble Salt harbour'd in it, was waſted in the nouriſhment of the <hi>Plant</hi>; yet 'tis plain, that the main Body of <hi>it</hi> conſiſted of traſmuted Water. This Experiment may be try'd with the Seeds of any Plant that is bulky and grows haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Likewiſe <hi>A top of Spearmint</hi> of an inch long, being put into a vial full of Spring-water with <hi>its</hi> lower part immers'd, did in a few days ſhoot forth numerous Roots into the <hi>Water,</hi> (as if <hi>it</hi> had been Earth,) and diſplay it ſelf upwards into many Leaves, with a pretty thick ſtalk. The ſame Experiment has alſo ſucceeded with <hi>Marjoram</hi> (tho' more ſlowly) <hi>Balm,</hi> and <hi>Peniroyal,</hi> to name no more. One of theſe Vegetables cheriſh'd only by Spring-water, and that never renew'd, afforded by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation (beſides Phlegm) an Empyreu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Spirit, an aduſt Oyl, and a <hi>Caput
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57199:23"/>
mortuum,</hi> that appearing to be a Coal, conſiſted no doubt of Salt and Earth. And if <hi>Helmont</hi> had diſtill'd the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd <hi>Tree,</hi> no doubt it would have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the like diſtinct Subſtances as <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of the ſame kind. But a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Inſtance (to prove that all ſorts of Bodies are nothing elſe but Water ſubdu'd by Seeds) than any yet mention'd, is afforded us by <hi>Mr. de Rochas,</hi> who tells us, that he took ſimple <hi>Water,</hi> that he well knew to be mix'd with no other thing but the Spirit of Life, and having with a heat Artificial, Continual, and Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, prepar'd <hi>it</hi> by the Graduations of Coagulation, Congelation, and Fixation, which he had ſpoken of before, untill <hi>it</hi> was <hi>turn'd into Earth</hi>; this Earth <hi>produc'd Animals</hi> that mov'd of themſelves, <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables and Minerals.</hi> The <hi>Animals</hi> he found, by a Chymical Anatomy he made of them, to be compos'd of much Sulphur, little Mercury, and leſs Salt; and the <hi>Minerals</hi> (which were ſolid and heavy, and began to grow, by converting into their own Nature one part of the Earth thereunto diſpos'd) of much Salt, little Sulphur, and leſs Mercury. And tho the judicious <hi>Mr. Boyle</hi> has ſome ſuſpitions of this ſtrange Relation, yet as to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57199:23"/>
of Animals and Plants, he thinks it not incredible, ſince <hi>common Water</hi> (which is indeed often impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with variety of Seminal Principles and Rudiments) long kept will putrify and ſtink, and then perhaps too produce Moſs and little Worms, or other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, according to the Nature of the Seeds that were lurking in it. And tho' the Diſtillation of <hi>Eels</hi> yielded him ſome Oyl, Spirit, Volatile Salt, and <hi>Caput mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> yet were all theſe ſo diſproportionate to the Phlegm (in which at firſt <hi>they</hi> boyl'd as in a pot of Water) that <hi>they</hi> ſeem'd to have been nothing but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated Phlegm; which does likewiſe ſtrangely abound in <hi>Vipers,</hi> as hot in their operation and as vivacious as they are.</p>
               <p>And <hi>ſeven ounces and a half of Human Blood yielded near ſix ounces of Phlegm,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of the Spirits began to ariſe, and require the Receiver to be chang'd. <hi>Corroſive Acid Spirits,</hi> tho they ſeem to be nothing but Fluid Salts, yet you'l find them to <hi>abound with Water,</hi> if either you entangle, and ſo <hi>ſix their Saline part</hi> by making them corrode ſome idoneous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or <hi>mortify it</hi> with a contrary Salt. Thus in making of <hi>Balſamus Samech</hi> with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57199:24"/>
                  <hi>distill'd Vinegar</hi> inſtead of Spirit of Wine, the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> from which it is diſtilld, will, by mortifying and retaining the Acid Salt, turn near twenty times its weight of the Vinegar into worthleſs Phlegm, before <hi>it</hi> be ſatiated. And in making the <hi>true Balſamus Samech</hi> (which is nothing but <hi>Salt of Tartar dulcifi'd, by</hi> diſtilling from it <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> till it be glutted with the <hi>Vinous Sulphur,</hi>) as ſoon as the Spirit of Wine is depriv'd of its Sulphur by the Salt of Tartar, the reſt (which is incomparably the greater part) remigrates into Phlegm: ſo that if <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi> proceſs be true (which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to <hi>Mr. Boyle</hi> by a ſober and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Spagyriſt, who did indeed prepare the Spirit and Salt by a way that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhort nor eaſie, but added nothing to them) <hi>Spirit of Wine ſeems to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially nothing but Water under a Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſguiſe,</hi> tho' being ſo igneous that it will totally flame away, 'tis of all Liquors the moſt likely to be free from Water. But <hi>Helmont</hi>'s grand Argument for his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> is taken from the operation of the <hi>Alcaheſt</hi>; which, he ſays, does ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately reſolve Plants, Animals, and Minerals into one Liquor or more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral internal Diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57199:24"/>
of Parts, (without <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> or the deſtruction of their ſeminal vertues;) and that the <hi>Alcahest</hi> being abſtracted from theſe <hi>Liquors</hi> in the ſame weight and vertue wherewith it diſſolv'd them, <hi>they</hi> may by frequent Cohobations from <hi>Chalk</hi> or ſome other fit ſubſtance, be totally depriv'd of their ſeminal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, and by that means reduc'd to Inſipid Water. Here <hi>Mr. Boyle</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly obſerves, that it may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether this Water, becauſe inſipid, muſt be Elementary; ſince the candid <hi>P. Laurembergius</hi> affirms that he ſaw an inſipid <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that was a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Diſſolvent: and the Water which may be drawn from Quickſilver with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out addition, tho' almoſt taſtleſs, will manifeſt a very differing nature from ſimple Water, if you digeſt in it appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated Minerals. However the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond Experiments concerning the growth of Vegetables, do ſufficiently prove that Salt, Spirit, Earth, and Oyl (which are four of the pretended Chymical Principles) may be produc'd out of ſimple Water. But to return to our Author.]</p>
               <p>Having prov'd, That <hi>Water is the only Material Principle of Bodies uſually calld Mixt,</hi> by three Arguments. 1. Becauſe

none of the other pretended <hi>Chymical Principles</hi> have a right to that <hi>Title; ſome</hi> of them not being naturally pre-exiſtent in the Bodies from which they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; and <hi>all</hi> of them being reducible to Elementary Water. 2. Becauſe <hi>Water</hi> is the only <hi>Nouriſhment</hi> of all <hi>Animals, Plants,</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi>; and by conſequence the only <hi>Matter</hi> of which they conſiſt.

               <head type="sub">Fire is nothing but an Acid Volatile Sulphur very ſwiftly mov'd.</head>
               <p>FOR there is a certain <hi>Sulphur</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Inflamable Body, which takes fire as ſoon as 'tis put into a rapid moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whatſoever the Cauſe be that excites it to that motion. This appears <hi>in</hi> the ſtriking of fire by the colliſion of two <hi>Flints</hi>; in the firing of the <hi>Axel-tree</hi> of a Mill or Coach, that ſometimes happens upon a long continued and vehement attrition; and in many other ſuch obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inſtances. <hi>Oyl of Vitriol</hi> contains a great many Acid Sulphureous Particles, proceeding as well from the Embryonat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Acid, that Corroded the Iron or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Oar in the Bowels of the Earth, as from the Iron or Copper it ſelf: theſe Particles, being excited to motion by the affuſion of Oyl of Tartar (or even genuine Spirit of Tartar) produce a notable heat and Efferveſcency. The Sulphur of <hi>Quick-lime</hi> (whether it be innate, or adventitious from the fire) conceives a vehement Heat, as ſoon as 'tis excited to motion, by the Alcaline Lixivial Particles ſet at liberty by the affuſion of Water. Finally (to add no
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57199:26"/>
more) <hi>Butter of Antimony</hi> conſiſts chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Sulphureous Particles</hi> of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> and the <hi>Salino-Acid</hi> ones of the <hi>Mercury Sublimate</hi>: the <hi>latter</hi> being waſh'd off with Water, the <hi>former</hi> do more manifeſtly appear, (namely in <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> which cauſes Vomiting without any danger of Corroding the Bowels:) and <hi>both</hi> of them being vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently mov'd by the affuſion of Spirit of Nitre, there is an intenſe heat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>the Formal nature of Fire or Heat conſiſts in Motion.</hi> Now that <hi>the Sulphureous Particles of which Fire is material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtituted, are of an Acid nature,</hi> will abundantly appear from the enſuing Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The particles of the <hi>Flame of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sulphur,</hi> being receiv'd and <hi>Condens'd</hi> in a Glaſs Bell, do compoſe a very pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Acid Liquor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. There are not any Bodies more akin to <hi>Fire,</hi> than the totally inflamable <hi>Spirits</hi> of fermented Vegetables. And yet <hi>all the Principal Effects of theſe Fermented Spirits, depend upon a Volatile Acid.</hi> For 'Tis upon the account of its Acid Salt, that <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> is <hi>Coagulated</hi> in Spirit of Urine or Salarmoniac, or <hi>in any</hi> other
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57199:26"/>
                  <hi>Volatile Alcali,</hi> as alſo, that it loſes its ſtrength by diſtillation from Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, which imbibes and retains the Acid, and receives an increaſe of weight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And Generous Wine, that is turgent with this Spirit, being drunk mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, ſends a Volatile Acid to the Brain, that makes a ſubtile efferveſcence with the (Alcaline) Animal Spirits, and thereby produces Cheerfulneſs and a Vigorous Promptitude to Action; (as on the contrary, the Sadneſs of Melancholy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons proceeds from the Fixation of the Animal Spirits by a more Fixt Acid.) But upon exceſſive Drinking, that <hi>Volatile Acid</hi> aſcends too copiouſly to the Brain, conquers and fixes the Animal Spirits, and ſo ſtupefies the Organs of Senſe and Motion: yea ſometimes <hi>it</hi> may Suppreſs the Vital Acid (or Innate Heat) of the <hi>Blood,</hi> and at length totally Coagulate <hi>it</hi>; eſpecially if the Wine be endow'd with a ſtrong Acid, as the <hi>French,</hi> and chiefly the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Wines are wont to be. And indeed, that <hi>the Inebriating vertue of Wine</hi> (and all other ſtrong Drinks) <hi>is entirely owing to a Volatile Acid,</hi> may be prov'd by many Arguments. 1. Hence 'tis, that <hi>Volatile Alcaline Salts do prevent Drunkenneſs,</hi> eſpecially Spirit of Salt-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57199:27"/>
if ſome drops of it be now and then mingled with the Drink. 2. <hi>Bitter Almonds and other Oleous things,</hi> do <hi>likewiſe</hi> prevent Drunkenneſs, by weakning and <hi>ſuppreſſing the vaporous Acid</hi> of the Wine, ſo that it cannot reach the Brain. 3. The ſame Acid inflames Drunkards Faces, and adorns them with purulent Pimples, like ſo many Gems. For the whitiſh colour'd Matter, contain'd in theſe Pimples, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds only from the Volatile Acid of the Wine that infects the ferment of the Muſcles of the Face, coagulates and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates the <hi>Blood</hi> that comes thither for Nutrition, and ſo changes <hi>its</hi> Purple Colour into a whitiſh one. For proof of this Aſſertion, 'tis to be noted, that the Purple Colour of the Blood proceeds from the reſolution of the Sulphurous Acid Parts by the ferment of the Heart, which ſets them at liberty, ſo as that they may mix <hi>per minima,</hi> and make a ſubtile efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence with the Alcaline Spirits: as when Spirit of Salt-Armoniack or of Harts-horn, or any other that is Alcalical, is digeſted with Spirit of Wine, they produce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a very red Tincture, becauſe the Acid Sulphur of the Wine, being by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion intimately mix'd, and making a ſubtile efferveſence with the ſubtil Alcaly,
<gap reason="missing" extent="1+ pages">
                     <desc>〈1… pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:57199:27"/>
is at length ſo reſolv'd as to manifeſt it ſelf by tinging the whole Liquor: after the ſame manner, in the Tincture of the Salt of Tartar, the Spirit of Wine is <hi>ting'd</hi> by the Volatilis'd Alcaly of Tartar: and common Sulphur boyl'd in the <hi>Lixivium</hi> of any Fixt Salt, is thereby exalted to a Red Colour; but becauſe the Alcaline Salt is ſo ty'd to the Terreſtrial Particles, that it cannot penetrate the Sulphur <hi>per minima,</hi> therefore the Colour is obſcure and dark. Now, if you pour another Acid Liquor upon theſe Sanguine Tinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, immediately they become of a Milk-white Colour. Juſt ſo it happens, when the Blood is extravaſated, and putrefi'd in any Part of the Body, the Acidity, that ariſes from this Putrefaction, Precipitates the Sulphur that ting'd the Blood, and thereby turns it into white ſtinking <hi>Pus</hi>; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as common Sulphur, when it is Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated out of any <hi>Lixivium</hi> by the affuſion of Vinegar, ſtrikes the Noſe with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Odour, tho it was utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorous before: ſo that <hi>Pus</hi> is nothing but Blood, whoſe vital Alcaline Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Spirits are ſuppres'd by an hoſtile Acid, and the tinging Sulphureous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles Precipitated in Wounds &amp; Abſceſſes, while the <hi>Pus</hi> is a making, the motion of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57199:28"/>
the Acid Particles do often produce a Symptomical Feaver, an Inflammation in the Part affected, Convulſive Motions in the Brain, and Pains in the Nervous Parts: but theſe Symptoms abate as ſoon as the <hi>Pus</hi> is made, and the motion of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ceas'd. 4. Amongſt the External Medicins, that are wont to be apply'd to the foremention'd <hi>Pimples</hi> in the Face, the <hi>Preparations of Saturn</hi> are the chief; becauſe they imbibe the Acid of the Wine, or other Inebriating Liquor, <hi>that</hi> inflames the Face. For <hi>Saturn readily receives all ſorts of Acids or Sulphurs,</hi> even thoſe of Metals, as is well known to the Refiners. Thus the unripe <hi>Sulphurs of Metals,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated in Saturn, do compoſe <hi>Litharge. Vinegar,</hi> Coagulated in Saturn, produces <hi>Sugar of Lead.</hi> And all <hi>Acids</hi> in general, <hi>Coagulated in Saturn, Mars, or any other Body</hi> whatſoever, <hi>are</hi> wont to be dulcifi'd thereby. For all <hi>Sugars are nothing but Acid Salts Coagulated in other Particles</hi>: whence 'tis, that they are reſolv'd by Diſtillation into a very <hi>Ardent</hi> and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>Inebriating Spirit</hi>; and are extream ſit to promote or even begin <hi>Fermentations</hi>: and therefore 'tis, that the <hi>Syrups</hi> of the ſhops have a manifeſtly <hi>Acid</hi> Taſt; and <hi>Sugar</hi> is very <hi>hurtful</hi> to <hi>Scorbutical</hi> perſons,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57199:28"/>
becauſe upon the account of its Acidity it <hi>excites</hi> divers vitious <hi>Efferveſcencies,</hi> produces Tumors of the Bowels <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And vitiates the Vital Ferment of the Stomach.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That the Particles of Fire are of an <hi>Acid</hi> Nature, may evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from all other <hi>Inflameable Subſtances,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that are <hi>Oyly</hi> and <hi>Fat,</hi> as well as from common <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in the firſt place, 'tis certain, that <hi>Oleous</hi> and <hi>Fat Bodies</hi> are really <hi>endow'd with an Acid</hi>; as appears from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſons. 1. Chirurgions obſerve, that Oyls, and fat Subſtances, are very <hi>noxious</hi> to the <hi>Bones,</hi> (eſpecially the <hi>Skull,</hi> which is a Porous Bone) and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are apt to make them <hi>Carious</hi>; which muſt happen upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Corroding Acid. And for the ſame reaſon, they render <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers ſordid,</hi> by increaſing the Corroding Acid. 2. What elſe is that Greenneſs, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to Lamps, but the Acid of the Oyl-Olive Coagulated in the Particles of the Metal, that it has Corroded? whence comes the <hi>Blew</hi> Colour of <hi>Oyl of Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil</hi> diſtill'd in <hi>Copper</hi> Veſſels, but from ſome Particles of the <hi>Veins</hi> Corroded by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57199:29"/>
the Acidity of the Oyle? 3. The <hi>Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> (<hi>Ardor Ventriculi</hi>) is often occaſion'd by Fat things, (eſpecially if you drink after them, becauſe the Acid Salts are thereby diſſolv'd and put into a ſwifter motion) as well as by auſtere and ſouriſh Wines: and the Remedy, in both Caſes, is, to uſe things fitted to Precipitate the Acid. 4. Oleous and Fat things are hurtful in <hi>Eryſipelatous</hi> Diſtempers, (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Coagulation of the Blood by an Acid,) becauſe they increaſe the Peccant Acidity, whence the Putrefaction is increas'd, the Bones are corroded, and the Natural Heat of the Part is at laſt totally ſuppreſs'd, and mortify'd. (Yet the Author denyes not, but theſe Effects do alſo partly depend upon the <hi>Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Pores of the Part, by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Fat ſubſtances, ſo that the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> wont to tranſpire through the Pores, being detain'd in the Body, and inordinately mov'd, do increaſe the Feaver.) 5. 'Tis likewiſe upon the account of their Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, that Oyls are hurtful to all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations,</hi> without ſuch a Preparation as conſumes or corrects their Acid. Thus <hi>Lin-ſeed Oyle</hi> mingl'd with an equal weight of <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and boyl'd (with continual ſtirring) till the Spirit
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57199:29"/>
be conſum'd, is us'd ſafely and ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both inwardly and outwardly, in <hi>Pleuriſies, Peripneumonies, Inflammations of the Liver</hi> &amp;c. becauſe the Coagulating Acid is readily imbib'd by this Oyl, that has been depriv'd of its own Acid by the Spirit of Wine, which, being a much more Volatile Oleous Body than the <hi>Oyle of Lin-ſeed,</hi> evaporates before <hi>it,</hi> and carryes <hi>its</hi> Acid along with it; even as the ſame Spirit, being mingl'd with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> and diſtill'd in a Cucurbit, aſcends before <hi>it,</hi> and carrys a great part of <hi>its</hi> Acidity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, inſomuch that the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> becomes a very ſafe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Medicine, tho' before, the ſmell of it only would cauſe an <hi>Atrophia</hi> in the whole Body. The ſame Oyl of Lin-ſeed is alſo Corrected, by frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing red hot <hi>Steel</hi> in it, till it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the ceaſing of the hiſſing &amp; ſmoke, that the Acid Particles are either Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in ſmoke and ſpent by Deflagration, or Coagulated in the <hi>Mars.</hi> And if after this it be Diſtill'd from <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> that if any Acidity yet remains, it may be therein Coagulated, the <hi>Oyl of Lin-ſeed becomes an excellent Remedy</hi> for Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Burns and the like: as <hi>Oyl-Olive</hi> alſo <hi>does,</hi> by Diſtillation from <hi>Quick-lime.</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57199:30"/>
And this laſt nam'd Oyl, being <hi>imbib'd</hi> in old <hi>Tyles</hi> or <hi>Bricks</hi> (which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of all moiſture by their having been long expos'd to the heat of the Sun) heated red hot, and quench'd in it, and then <hi>diſtill'd</hi> in a Retort, is thereby robb'd of all its Acidity, and acquires a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Vertue in the <hi>Palſey, Gout, Cramp</hi> &amp;c. And all Oyls are wholſomer boyl'd than crude, becauſe a great part of the Acid is exhal'd in the boyling. 6. <hi>Helmont</hi> teaches that Diſtill'd <hi>Chymical Oyls,</hi> which are otherwiſe very hot, may by an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial <hi>Circulation</hi> for three Months time with an <hi>Alcali</hi> Salt be turn'd into a very <hi>temperate Volatile Salt</hi>: namely becauſe the hot Acid of the Oyl is Saturated by the Alcali, and by that means reduc'd temperate. Nor can there be any other Reaſon given, why the Alcaly ſhould have this effect upon the Oyl, but that the Acid of the Oyl corrodes the Alcaly and is Coagulated in it.</p>
               <p>Now in the next place, That <hi>the Heat and Inflammability of Oyly Subſtances de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Acid,</hi> that the Experiments, newly deliver'd, prove to be contain'd in them, may be evinc'd from thoſe ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments; moſt of which do not only prove, that <hi>Oleous and Fat Bodies</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57199:30"/>
with an <hi>Acid,</hi> but likewiſe, that the effects uſually aſcrib'd to the hot Quality of theſe Bodies, do indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this <hi>Acid</hi>; and that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mitigates or deſtroys this Acid, does at the ſame time weaken or deſtroy their <hi>Heating Power.</hi> And 2. that this may alſo be truly apply'd to their <hi>Inflammability,</hi> and that the <hi>Acid Particles</hi> contain'd in <hi>Oyly and Fat Subſtances</hi> are really the <hi>Matter</hi> of which the <hi>Flame</hi> of theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (when they are burning) conſiſts, does plainly appear by the <hi>Abſtraction</hi> of Oyls from <hi>Spirit of Wine, Quick-lime,</hi> or <hi>Bricks</hi>; for, being by this means depriv'd of their Acid, they become leſs Inflammable than the crude Oyles were. And Candles made of Sheeps Tallow, burn ſooner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way than thoſe made of any other Tallow, becauſe there is greater ſtore of <hi>Acid Particles</hi> in it; as appears by the <hi>Griping of the Guts,</hi> which cannot happen without a <hi>Corroding Acid,</hi> (for all the Medicines, effectual againſt this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per teſtify <hi>that</hi> to be the Cauſe of it) and which is very often occaſion'd by eating <hi>Fat Mutton,</hi> eſpecially if the Acid Salts be diſſolv'd by drinking after <hi>it,</hi> in like manner as when Salt Butter is ſweetned by melting it, and pouring it into water,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57199:31"/>
and thereby diſſolving the Salt. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>recent Fat,</hi> or Oyl burns ſooner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, than that which has been <hi>long kept,</hi> and thereby loſt much of its Volatile Acid. <hi>N.B.</hi> Since Tallow, as well as every other Body, is materially nothing elſe but water Coagulated by a ſeminal Acid, and ſince 'tis only the <hi>Acid Particles</hi> that feed the Flame; it follows, that when <hi>they</hi> are conſum'd, he remainder, being robb'd of, the Coagulating, Acid muſt return into Elementary Water, and therefore 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly diſſipated like a Vapour: even as the water of Spirit of Wine kindled vaniſhes into a Vapour.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Particles of Fire being fix'd or Coagulated in any Body whatſoever, do plainly manifeſt themſelves to be Acid, as appears from the following Inſtances. 1. <hi>Fire Coagulated in Mars,</hi> turns it into a <hi>Crocus,</hi> that differs nothing from Ruſt, (which proceeds always from an Acid) and is every way like to that <hi>Crocus</hi> which is prepar'd with Acids, and endow'd with the ſame Medicinal Vertues. <hi>V. Tachen. Hipp. Chym. cap.</hi> 28. 2. Fire Coagulated in <hi>Saturn is ſeparated</hi> by means of a Fixt <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly,</hi> or even of <hi>Venetian Borax</hi>; for <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> (which receiv'd its <hi>red</hi> Colour from the <hi>Sulphur of the Coals,</hi> even as the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur

               <p>As for <hi>Animals,</hi> and particularly <hi>Man</hi>;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57199:33"/>
the <hi>Feminine ſeed</hi> is a limpid Liquor, contain'd in the little <hi>Eggs,</hi> that are found in the Teſticles. This Seminal Liquor contains in it ſelf an exact <hi>Idea</hi> of an entire Human Body (of the femal ſexe,) conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of as many particular diſtinct <hi>Ideas,</hi> as there are different Parts in a Human Body, which all together concur to make up one entire <hi>Idea</hi> of an entire Woman: ſo if it were poſſible for us to contemplate this <hi>Idea</hi> with our <hi>Bodily</hi> Eyes, as well as we can do with our <hi>Intellectual,</hi> we might diſcern in it ſenſible ſignatures of all the Parts of the Body, alltogether making up a lively repreſentation, and as 'twere exact <hi>Model,</hi> of an entire Woman. The <hi>Idea</hi> of every particular Part in this Seed, is a Particle of the <hi>Idea</hi> that reſides in that ſame part of the Womans Body that generates this Seed. For <hi>every Part</hi> of a Womans (Mans, or any other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals) Body, whether <hi>Similar</hi> or <hi>Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, has its own Idea reſiding in it,</hi> in which <hi>Idea</hi> is imprinted upon, or (which is all one) communicates a Particle of it ſelf unto the <hi>Blood,</hi> that Circulates through the <hi>Part</hi>; and the <hi>Blood</hi> carryes all theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> to the <hi>Teſticles,</hi> where they are gather'd together, diſpos'd into the ſame Order that the Parts, they come from, have in the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57199:34"/>
                  <hi>Womans Body,</hi> and ſo united into one entire <hi>Idea,</hi> which is inclos'd within the Tunicles of the <hi>Egg,</hi> that being defended from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries thereby, the particular Parts of it may be able to retain their due ſituation, and may not be lyable to be confounded one with another or miſplac'd. This <hi>Idea</hi> is endow'd in the <hi>Teſticles</hi> with a particle of that moving <hi>Vital Spirit,</hi> which is the Principle of all Vital Actions, and the only Mover of all Seeds, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, are Barren and Unfruitful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot unfold themſelves. But yet this <hi>Plaſtick Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Feminine Seed</hi> is too <hi>weak</hi> for to accompliſh the evolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Ideas,</hi> without it be <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd,</hi> Actuated, and Fecundated by that more powerfull <hi>Spirit</hi> which the <hi>Maſculine Seed</hi> is impregnated with. All that has been ſaid of the Feminine Seed, is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable alſo to <hi>this,</hi> ſaving, that it <hi>contains Ideas</hi> of all the Parts of a Human Body of the <hi>Male Sex</hi> only, <hi>not</hi> of the <hi>Female</hi>; and that theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> are <hi>confounded</hi> one with another, becauſe the Seed not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd in Tunicles in the form of <hi>Eggs,</hi> but contain'd in the Teſticles in a liquid form, <hi>they</hi> fluctuate and cannot retain any certain Order. Hence it is, that as the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57199:34"/>
Feminine Seed alone can never be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, till its weaker Spirit be corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Conjunction with the Maſculine; ſo neither can the Maſculine Seed alone ever produce a <hi>Foetus,</hi> till its confus'd <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> be reduc'd into due Order by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Feminine, each <hi>Idea</hi> taking its own proper place, by applying it ſelf to the correſpondent <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Feminine Seed. In ſhort, the <hi>Maſculine</hi> Seed cannot reduce the confus'd <hi>Ideas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Order, but being ſet in Order by the Feminine, <hi>it</hi> can explicate or unfold them, which the Feminine cannot. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Maſculine Seed muſt be injected into the <hi>Womb,</hi> whence it emits a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Vital <hi>Spirituous Exhalation</hi> through the <hi>Tubi Fallopiani</hi> into the <hi>Teſtes</hi> or <hi>Ovarium,</hi> where one (or more) of the <hi>Eggs,</hi> being impregnated with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation, and foecundated <hi>thereby,</hi> is thruſt out of its place, and falls into the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the <hi>Tubus Fallopianus,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys it to the Womb. For tho' the two Seminal Spirits be now united into one, yet even this is not ſufficient for the Evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the <hi>Ideas</hi>; till it be excited to motion by the Heat of the Womb; and then it begins the Evolution of the <hi>Ideas,</hi> by Coagulating the approximated Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57199:35"/>
into a ſubſtance agreeable to the particular <hi>Ideas,</hi> and applying it to them: by which means the <hi>Ideas,</hi> that were utterly inſenſible before, do quickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a viſible bulk: inſomuch that <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kringius</hi> tells us of a <hi>Foetus,</hi> but four days old, wherein the diſtinction of the Parts was plainly diſcernible. This Appoſition of Aliments to, and gradual Evolution of the <hi>Ideas,</hi> begins at the firſt Conception, and continues after the Child has left the Womb, till the Body have attain'd its full ſtature; (that is, to a perfect Evolution of the <hi>Ideas,</hi> for when the <hi>Ideas</hi> are not capable of any further Evolution, the Growth of the Body muſt ceaſe.) So that <hi>Ganeration</hi> is really nothing elſe, but the <hi>firſt Nutrition</hi>; or the Appoſition of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>to</hi> and Evolution <hi>of</hi> the <hi>Ideas</hi> while they are yet inſenſible: and on the other ſide, <hi>Nutrition</hi> is nothing but a <hi>continued Generation.</hi> For 'tis the ſame <hi>Plaſtick Spirit,</hi> guided by the ſame <hi>Ideas,</hi> that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulates and Applyes the Aliment to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Part, <hi>both in and out of the Womb.</hi> And the immediate Aliment of all the Parts in both ſtates is the ſame, namely <hi>Blood,</hi> but with this Difference, that the <hi>Embryo</hi> is <hi>nouriſh'd</hi> with the <hi>Mothers Blood,</hi> communicated to it by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbilical Vein</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57199:35"/>
from the <hi>Placenta <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terina</hi>: whereas, after the Child is born, it takes in various <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the Mouth,</hi> and makes <hi>Blood</hi> of them it ſelf for its own Nouriſhment. This <hi>Blood</hi> is already <hi>determin'd</hi> to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the <hi>Human</hi> (and no other Animals) <hi>Body,</hi> by the Impreſſion that the <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Stomachal Ferment</hi> has ſeal'd the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is made of, with; but is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> to all the <hi>Parts</hi> of the Human Body, till it come to be determin'd to the Nouriſhment of particular Parts by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtamp'd (as it were) with the Seal of the particular <hi>Ideas</hi> reſiding in them. For every <hi>Organ</hi> hides in its Ventricle an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> of its own Body, that regulates the Appoſition of the Aliment to that <hi>Part,</hi> (and is the ſame that regulated the firſt Formation of it.) And the <hi>Native Heat,</hi> or <hi>vital Spirit</hi> of every different Part, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulates the Blood into a differing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and applyes it in a differing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, according to the diverſity of that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> which guides the Motions of this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating Spirit.</hi> Theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created with the Parts of the firſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals. And after what has been ſaid, 'twill not be difficult to conceive, <hi>how they</hi> were folded up (as it were) and united into one entire <hi>Idea</hi> in the Seed of theſe

                  <hi>first</hi> Individuals: <hi>how</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> were generated by the gradual unfolding again of the ſame <hi>Ideas,</hi> &amp; appoſition of Aliment to them: in a word, <hi>how</hi> by the convolutions and Evolutions, (ſo to ſpeak) of thoſe <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,</hi> the Propagation of Mankind has been continu'd to this day. (And the ſame is to be ſaid of all other Animals, as well as of all Vegetables.)</p>
               <p>This is as brief and clear an <hi>Account,</hi> as I could give of the Authors Notion of the Generation of Animals: <hi>which</hi> tho' it may ſeem already more prolix than is agreeable to the Deſign of this Treatiſe, yet, becauſe the Theory of Generation is ſo difficult, and becauſe I have not elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where met with ſo intelligible an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>Ideas</hi> that <hi>Helmont</hi> ſo often ſpeaks of; I thought it would not be foreign to my Deſign, if I inſiſt a little longer upon a Theory, that will ſo much conduce to facilitate the Reading of an Author, that many are deterr'd from, by the Obſcurity of his Notions, and that has deliver'd ſo many and ſo conſiderable <hi>Chymical Experiments</hi>; for the obſcure hints he gives of ſome of the <hi>Principal,</hi> will be much better underſtood by one that <hi>is</hi> acquainted with His Notions, than by one that <hi>is not, caeteris paribus.</hi> Wherefore I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57199:36"/>
ſhall proceed, without any farther Apology, to deduce, from the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, an explication of ſome of the chief <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Generation; continuing to inſiſt upon one ſingle Inſtance, taken from the chief <hi>Species</hi> of Animals, <hi>Man:</hi> for the ſame things, that are here deliver'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Man, may, with a little alteration, be eaſily apply'd to other Animals.]</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sexe</hi> of the <hi>Foetus</hi> is <hi>determin'd</hi> by the <hi>prevalency</hi> of the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Fathers, or of thoſe of the Mothers Seed. If there be a parity of both, the <hi>Foetus</hi> will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of both Sexes.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Mole</hi> happens, when an <hi>Egg falls</hi> out of the <hi>Ovarium</hi> into the Womb, merely <hi>by the irritation of Luſt,</hi> without congreſs with a Man: for the Tunicles of this Egg ſwell and are extended in the Womb; but the moving Spirit of the Maſculine Seed is wanting, to unfold the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Egg and apply Aliment to them: for the <hi>Ideas,</hi> tho' they give the due Figure to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Part, yet they cannot unfold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and the <hi>Feminine Spirit</hi> in the Egg is not vigorous enough to do it; tho' it have really ſome activity, whereby it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with the <hi>Maſculine</hi> in the formation of a true <hi>Foetus,</hi> and makes itſelf alone ſome unperfect evolution of the <hi>Ideas</hi> in a

'Tis becauſe of this ſtrength and vigour of the Spirit of Mens Seed, that they are ſaid to be of a hotter temperament than Women; and that Eunuchs turn Effeminate in their voice, manners, and diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abortion</hi> happens upon the leſt <hi>manifeſt Acidity</hi> of the Aliment of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> for <hi>this</hi> Coagulates and ſuffocates the Spirit, that by its <hi>occult</hi> and milder <hi>Acidity</hi> ſhould Coagulate the Aliment, and apply it to the Nouriſhment of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> Hence a four Scorbutick diſpoſition of the Blood makes Women ſubject to miſcarry; and the uſe of red Coral, Mother of Pearl, and the like is good to prevent it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Plurality of Foetus</hi>'s happens when <hi>more Eggs</hi> than one are <hi>foecundated</hi> by the Mans Seed, and fall out of the <hi>Ovarium</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Womb. For the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Mans Seed, being to be reduc'd into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by application to thoſe of the Womans, every particular <hi>Idea</hi> may be divided, and apply it ſelf to the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent <hi>Idea</hi> of ſeveral Eggs. This is manifeſt in the Seed of a <hi>Cock,</hi> which if the Hen have but once receiv'd, it ſuffices
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57199:38"/>
oftentimes to make her Eggs fruitful for a whole year thereafter. So that every particular <hi>Idea</hi> of his Seed, muſt have been divided into as many Particles, as there were Eggs <hi>foecundated</hi> by it. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Marci, De Ideis operatricibus,</hi> aſcribes the plurality of <hi>foetus</hi>'s to the <hi>Plurality of Hearts</hi> in the Seed, howſoever this be occaſion'd; for the <hi>Heart</hi> being the <hi>Center of Evolution,</hi> as many Hearts as there are, ſo many Centers of Evolution, and by conſequence ſo many <hi>Foetus</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>The <hi>monſtrous Plurality of Parts</hi> in one <hi>Foetus</hi> happens, when the <hi>Ideas of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Seed are not exactly apply'd to the correſpondent Ideas of the Feminine Seed</hi>; but decline to the right or left hand; ſo that, being ſeparately unfolded, they make up diſtinct Parts.</p>
               <p>The want of a particular Part (as Arms, Legs &amp;c.) happens, when the <hi>Idea</hi> of that Part is not unfolded for want of Aliment; or is extinguiſh'd by ſome impure Acid Particles of the Aliment, or by the force of the Mothers Imagination of ſome perſon preſented to her, that has (by an Accident perhaps,) loſt that Part.</p>

If this <hi>Idea</hi> take root in one Subject, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated to Poſterity, till it be extinguiſh'd by a ſupervening <hi>Idea</hi> of greater Force.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, a <hi>Gigantine Stature</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Evolution of the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Idea</hi> beyond its due bounds; which <hi>Marcus Marci</hi> aſcribes to two Cauſes, namely, either the <hi>Refraction of the Ideal Rayes</hi> by falling into a diſſimilar <hi>Medium,</hi> or the <hi>Mothers</hi> ſtrong <hi>Imagination</hi> of ſome huge Statue.

And there are many Relations of <hi>White Women,</hi> that by reaſon of a ſtrong <hi>Imaginative Idea,</hi> occaſion'd by the frequent, or unexpected and affrighting ſight of <hi>Blackamores,</hi> have brought forth black Children. This <hi>Imaginative Idea</hi> continues, till it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd by the acceſſion of another more powerfull <hi>Idea.</hi> The Author tells us of a Woman with Child, affrighted at the ſudden coming of a <hi>Blackamore</hi>; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſently waſhd all over, by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent advice of a By-ſtander, did ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine the waſhing off of the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hereby, that the <hi>Idea</hi> of Blackneſs, formerly conceiv'd, and already imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Foetus,</hi> was by this means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd; for ſhe brought forth a white Child, but ſpotted between the Fingers and Toes, and in a few other Parts that the waſhers hand had miſs'd.

a ſtrong <hi>Idea</hi> of any Thing, whether by a longing deſire after it, or being affrighted at the ſight of it &amp;c. the Child ſeldom fails to have a Mark in ſome part of its Body, repreſenting that thing both in Colour and Figure; whether it be a <hi>Cherry, Mouſe,</hi> or any other ſuch like thing: and if the Thing, that ſurpriſes the Mother, fall upon or hit againſt a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Part, the <hi>Idea</hi> of it will be impreſs'd upon that ſame Part of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> [An Eye-witneſs related to me, that a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Woman, that had been affrighted with a <hi>Cat</hi> ſuddenly thrown upon her lap, brought forth a Child with two Marks, one above each Knee; which Marks, when the Knees were brought together (into the ſame poſture that the Mothers were in, when the <hi>Cat</hi> affrighted her) did exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent an entire <hi>Cat,</hi> with the Head above the one Knee, and the Tail above the other, in the very ſame poſture that the <hi>Cat</hi> fell in. But, tho' it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from theſe and many more ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that the Mothers Imagination has a powerfull influence upon the <hi>Foetus</hi>; yet to give a clear and intelligible Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Manner how it produces ſuch Effects, is a matter of no ſmall diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; and our Author gives but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57199:41"/>
of it. However I ſhall offer ſome Conſiderations, that may ſomewhat leſſen this Difficulty, tho' I ſhall not pretend to give a clear and ſatisfactory Solution of it. Firſt of all then, I conſider, that, ſince the <hi>Formation of the Foetus</hi> is wholly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the <hi>Seminal Ideas,</hi> 'tis eaſy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conceive, that an <hi>Imaginative Idea,</hi> impreſs'd upon the Seed, may have a conſiderable Influence in the Formation of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> For Inſtance, the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Blackamore</hi> (ſimply as ſuch, regarding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Colour of his skin, and not the figure, proportion, and other <hi>Qualities</hi> of the Parts of his Body; or at leaſt, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſtrong in regard of them, but that other different, and more prevalent <hi>Ideas</hi> of theſe Qualities, may render this inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, as to <hi>them</hi>: this <hi>Idea</hi> (I ſay,) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd upon the Seed, may determine the <hi>Formative Spirit</hi> to form the <hi>Foetus</hi> with a black skin; ſince it has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly prov'd, that all the Modifications (and conſequently the Colour) of every Part, depend intirely upon the <hi>Ideas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in the Seed. In the next place I conſider, that, ſince 'tis highly probable, that the Animal Spirits, which come from the Brain through certain little Nerves to the <hi>Teſtes,</hi> do there mingle themſelves
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57199:42"/>
with the ſpirituous part of the <hi>Blood,</hi> brought thither by the Arteries, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with <hi>it</hi> to make up the Matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Seed conſiſts: and ſince the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Blackamore</hi> (to keep to the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) is convey'd to the Brain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed there by the Animal Spirits, which receive it from the <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> painted in the bottom of the Eye, upon the <hi>Tunica Retina</hi> or (as others think) the <hi>Choroeides,</hi> by the Rayes of Light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from the <hi>Blackamores</hi> Body: it may be eaſily enough conceiv'd, that the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits may alſo convey the ſame <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> from the Brain to the <hi>Teſtes,</hi> and there impreſs it upon the Seed. For if the Animal Spirits of the <hi>Optick Nerves</hi> tranſmit this <hi>Idea from the Eyes to the Brain,</hi> and there imprint it; why may not the Animal Spirits of the <hi>Par vagum</hi> tranſmit the ſame <hi>Idea</hi> from <hi>the Brain</hi> (through certain little Branches that reach,) <hi>to the Teſtes,</hi> and there communicate it to the <hi>Seed.</hi> And ſince the <hi>Rayes of Light,</hi> that come from the Object, may be <hi>Reflected from a Specular Body to the Eye,</hi> without loſing thereby that Figuration, Motion, or whatever other <hi>Modification</hi> it be, that qualifyes them to <hi>paint an exact Idea</hi> of the Object, they receiv'd it from, <hi>upon the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57199:42"/>
Retina or Choroeides</hi>: why may not the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> that receive the very ſame <hi>Modification</hi> from the Tunicle of the Eye, be <hi>Reflected from the Brain to the Teſtes,</hi> and there <hi>impreſs the ſame Idea upon the Seed.</hi> Nor can it be ſaid, that the Seed is not a Subject <hi>capable</hi> of ſuch <hi>Ideas,</hi> ſince (as was noted before) the <hi>Animal Spirits are Part of</hi> the Matter whereof <hi>it</hi> conſiſts, ſo that by taking them into its own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it muſt receive the <hi>Ideas</hi> they bring along with them. And 'tis moſt certain, that many Impreſſions, made in particular Parts of the Body, and tranſmitted to the Brain, do not ſtop there, but are Reflected back to the ſame, or to other Parts, where they often produce very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Effects; &amp; that barely by the ſtrength of the Impreſſion, without any concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Wills Determination, yea many times in direct oppoſition to it. And tho' the <hi>Subſtance of the Brain</hi> ſeems very remote from being <hi>Specular</hi>; yet ſince that Quality depends upon ſuch a Modification of the ſurface of any Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Body, as qualifies it to Reflect the Rayes of Light in the ſame order they fell in, without at all confounding them, or altering the Modifications they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the Object; 'tis plain that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57199:43"/>
the <hi>Brain,</hi> if it be at all capable of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting the Impreſſions that come from viſible Objects,</hi> (as certainly it is) muſt, <hi>as well as Specular Bodies,</hi> tho' perhaps upon very different accounts, be qualify'd to Reflect them <hi>without confounding or altering them</hi>; for if the Brain ſhould confound or alter them, there could be no true diſtinct <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Objects, they come from, form'd in it.</p>
               <p>All theſe Conſiderations may be alſo apply'd, to leſſen our wonder at the powerful <hi>Influence of the Mothers Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon the Foetus in the Womb already form'd.</hi> For ſo long as the <hi>Foetus</hi> is in the Womb, it may very juſtly be conſider'd as a <hi>Part of the Mothers Body</hi>; ſince her Blood Circulates through and nouriſhes it, as well as the other Parts of Her Body. And being 'tis very probable, that the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> convey'd by the Nerves to every Part of the Mothers Body, do there mingle with the <hi>Blood</hi> brought thither by the Arteries, and <hi>concur</hi> with it to the <hi>Nutrition</hi> of the Part: I may very reaſonably ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> that come to the Womb, may there mingle with the <hi>Arterial Blood,</hi> and be traſmitted together with it by the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical Vein into the Body of the <hi>Foetus</hi> for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57199:43"/>
its <hi>Nouriſhment.</hi> And if there be a <hi>ſtrong</hi> Impreſſion of any <hi>Idea in the Brain,</hi> the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> may (as was formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd with relation to the <hi>Teſtes</hi>)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </hi> it upon the Body of the <hi>Foetus</hi>; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſoft and <hi>tender,</hi> may upon that account be more ſuſceptible of any ſuch Impreſſion, than the other Parts of the Mothers Body; eſpecially ſince Her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſolicitous Thoughts of the Womb, and the <hi>Foetus</hi> therein contain'd, may determine the Animal Spirits to flow more copiouſly thither than to other Parts, and keep thoſe Pores of the Brain that lead thither more open: ſo that the Reflection of any Impreſſion, made upon the Brain, may have a freer courſe that, than any other way. And tho' the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> made upon the <hi>Foetus</hi> be but weak at firſt, yet it may be afterwards ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <hi>confirmd</hi> by often <hi>reiterated Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</hi> Finally, tho' it be very little at firſt, yet it may increaſe daily as the <hi>Foetus</hi> grows: which may be both illuſtrated and confirm'd by Figures light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut in the Rind of a <hi>Gourd,</hi> which grow bigger and bigger as the <hi>Gourd</hi> increaſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:57199:44"/>And now I ſee not any conſiderable Difficulty remaining in this Subject, after I ſhall have added this one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; namely, That, becauſe the <hi>Formative Idea,</hi> reſiding in every Part of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> is a Particle of the <hi>Idea</hi> that reſides in the ſame Part of the <hi>Mothers Body</hi>; an <hi>Imaginative Idea,</hi> produc'd in her Brain, by a ſudden Impreſſion made upon any Part of her Body, may, when it is communicated to the <hi>Foetus,</hi> be more apt to unite it ſelf with the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative Idea,</hi> belonging to that ſame Part of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> than with any other; and upon this account, that Part may more eaſily, than any other, receive the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. For the <hi>Idea of the Object</hi> comes to the Mothers Brain, accompany'd with the <hi>Idea of the Part,</hi> that the Impreſſion is made upon, and the <hi>Imagination con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nects</hi> them together as it were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Compound Idea,</hi> and tranſmits them to the <hi>Foetus</hi>; where the <hi>latter</hi> eaſily unites it ſelf with the <hi>Formative Idea</hi> homogeneous to it, and the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> impreſſes itſelf upon the Part, that this <hi>Idea</hi> reſides in.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that after all that has been ſaid, we are ſtill in the dark about
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57199:44"/>
the main Point, for want of a clear and diſtinct Notion of the <hi>Ideas</hi> ſo often mention'd. I anſwer, that many things have been already, and ſome more yet remain to be, deliver'd, tending to clear the Nature of thoſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> all which laid together, and attentively conſider'd, may go a great way in aſſiſting judicious Readers, to form as clear Notions about them, as can well be expected in ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe a Subject, as the <hi>Generation of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</hi> And 'tis no leſs cefficult, if not much more, to give an Intelligible and ſatisfactory explication, of the Nature <hi>of Imaginative Ideas,</hi> repreſenting ſeſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the Brain (which no man queſtions the reality of,) than <hi>of</hi> thoſe <hi>Formative Ideas,</hi> that the Notions, here propos'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Generation, are built upon. And he that denyes the <hi>later,</hi> becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſtinct enough in his Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, may upon the ſame ground de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>former,</hi> yea and even disbelieve his own Eyes, when he ſees the <hi>Ideas</hi> of many various Objects tranſmitted through a ſmall hole (fill'd with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex Glaſs) into a dark Room, and there delineated to the life, without the leaſt confuſion, upon a piece of White Paper, plac'd oppoſite to the hole, at a convenient

diſtance. And ſuch a Perſon I cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwer, than by recommending to his ſerious Peruſal, <hi>A Diſcourſe of things above Reaſon,</hi> lately Publiſhed; where the acute and judicious Author very convincingly proves, that, 'tis highly reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve many things, that our Reaſon cannot comprehend; many that we cannot form any clear and diſtinct Notions of; and many that we cannot reconcile to other unqueſtionable Truths. For the <hi>Ideas,</hi> we have been ſpeaking of, may very juſtly claim a place in the ſecond of the three, newly mention'd, Ranks of <hi>Priviledg'd Things,</hi> which that Author ſtyles <hi>Inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</hi> 'Tis true, that profound and ſubtil Philoſopher, <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> has attempted, in his Book <hi>de Homme,</hi> to give a Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Account of the <hi>Ideas,</hi> that are imprinted in the Brain by inſenſible Objects. But he founds his Notions upon an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> concerning the Structure of the <hi>Brain,</hi> and the Motion of the Spirits in it, which tho' it be moſt ingeniouſly devis'd, yet 'tis ſo far from being countenanc'd by <hi>Anatomical Obſervations,</hi> that it ſeems utterly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the <hi>best</hi> and moſt <hi>accurate,</hi> that have been made upon that <hi>Part.</hi> But 'tis more than time to conclude this Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and proceed to the reſt of our Authors
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57199:45"/>
Obſervations about the Seminal Ideas of Animals, and particularly of Man.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Propagation of Hereditary Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> (ſuch as the Epilepſie, Gout, Stone, Conſumption) from Parents to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, depends upon this: That the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Idea</hi> which forms the Lungs (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> is a Particle of that <hi>Idea</hi> which reſided in the Parents Lungs: Which is to be underſtood alſo of the Reins, Joynts, Brain, and all the other Parts of the Body. Hence many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are born with <hi>Moles,</hi> or Spots, in the very ſame Parts of their Body where their Parents had them, and of the ſame ſhape; inſomuch, that whole Families have taken their Names from the Things that the <hi>Moles,</hi> common to theſe Families, were obſerv'd to reſemble, as the <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones, Piſones, Lemuli,</hi> &amp;c. For there are certain ſubtil <hi>Corpuſeles,</hi> that go out of every (even the ſmalleſt) <hi>Part</hi> of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Body, and mingle themſelves with the Spirituous Part of the Blood that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates through <hi>it.</hi> Which <hi>Effluvia,</hi> being modifi'd, and as it were figur'd, after a peculiar manner by the Part they come from, impreſs this Modification upon the fore-mention'd Spirit; which Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards united in the Seed with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57199:46"/>
the <hi>Ideas</hi> of all the other Parts, (that is, the <hi>Spirits</hi> come from every Part with a peculiar Modification impreſs'd upon them by it) and excited to Motion, and extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the groſſer Parts of the Seed by the heat of the Womb, begins to form, of its own Subſtance, a Body like unto that Part, from which it receiv'd the Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications impreſs'd upon it. And thus the <hi>prima stamina</hi> of the <hi>Foetus</hi> are form'd; which are nouriſh'd at firſt by the groſſer Part of the Seed, and afterwards, partly by the Mothers Blood, and partly alſo, perhaps, by the Liquor contain'd in the <hi>Amnos</hi> or inner Membrane of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> From this Proceſs of Generation, 'tis eaſie to underſtand, how that Diſpoſition of ſome particular Part of the Parents Body, which renders Him or Her obnoxious to any particular Diſtemper, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the ſame Part of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and render it obnoxious to the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. Only the nature of the <hi>Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which is made upon the <hi>Spirit</hi> that forms the Parts of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and which qualifies it to form them like the Parts of the Parents Body which it came from; I ſay, the particular nature of this Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation remains in the dark ſtill. Nor do I know how to illuſtrate it better, than by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57199:46"/>
comparing it to that which is little leſs obſcure than it ſelf; namely, the Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>which</hi> the <hi>Rayes of Light</hi> receive by being <hi>Reflected</hi> from various Objects, and <hi>by which</hi> they are qualifi'd, to produce, in a darkned Room, lively and diſtinct Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of each of thoſe Objects, both as to their Figure and the Colour of their ſurface; and 'tis from the ſurface only, that the Rayes receiv'd this Modification, whereas the fore-mention'd <hi>Effluvia</hi> come from all the innermoſt Receſſes of every Part, and therefore from the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Part of the <hi>Foetus</hi> like unto it, not only in Figure and Colour, but in the whole Nature and inward Textur of it.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Ideas</hi> of all the Parts do really exiſt in the Blood, appears from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Arguments. 1. They have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſibly appear'd in the Blood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into a Cucurbit immediately as it ſlows out of the Vein, (whilſt it is warm and turgid with Spirits) for ſome Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Preparation: See <hi>Borell. Obſerv.</hi> 2. Some, that have drunk the Blood of any Animal, or of another Man, have been obſerv'd to partake of the Nature and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that Man or Animal. <hi>Commodus</hi> his diſpoſition was owing to his Mother,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57199:47"/>
who, preſently after his Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, drank the Blood of a <hi>cruel Gladiator</hi> that ſhe was deſperately in love with. A certain Maid, having drank ſome <hi>Cats-Blood,</hi> as a Remedy for the Epilepſie, did imitate <hi>Cats</hi> in her voice, motion and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when the Fit was coming upon her; watching ſilently at little Mouſe-holes. See <hi>Becker. Microcoſm.</hi> Therefore (to note that by the way) the Transfuſion of Blood ſeems not a ſafe way of curing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes. 3. The <hi>Spittle</hi> of a <hi>Mad Dog</hi> makes other Dogs, Men, Horſes, or any other Animal, wounded by his Teeth, turn mad alſo, and imitate his Actions and Geſticulations, ſuch as <hi>Barking, Grinning, Fearfulneſs of Water,</hi> &amp;c. Now <hi>Spittle</hi> is an immediate production of the Blood that circulates through the <hi>Salivary Glandules,</hi> &amp; therefore muſt have receiv'd from thence the <hi>Ideas,</hi> that it infects the Spirits of the bitten Animal with. Alſo other <hi>Venemous enraged Animals,</hi> as the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> &amp;c. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſuch <hi>Ideas</hi> by the little Wounds that their Teeth make in the Part they bite, as transform the Spirits of the Party bitten to a ridiculous imitation of their Geſticulations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though</hi> every particular Part of the <hi>Foetus</hi> be form'd, as has been ſaid, by the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57199:47"/>
Evolution of its own <hi>Idea,</hi> convey'd, by the Circulation of the Blood, from the Correſpondent Part of the Parents Body, unto the <hi>Teſtes,</hi> where the Seed is made; <hi>yet</hi> maimed Parents may have perfect Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; namely, if both Father and Mother be not mutilated (at leaſt not of the ſame Parts;) or if they have had perfect Seed in ſtore, before they were diſmembred; or if the defect of the <hi>Architect tonic Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that ſhould have come to the Seed from the Part that is deficient, be <hi>ſuppli'd</hi> by the ſtrength of the <hi>Parents Imagination</hi>; who by ſeeing daily other Infants, Boys, Girls, Men, Women, all perfect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the defect of any Part, may conceive ſo firm an <hi>Idea</hi> of a perfect <hi>Foetus,</hi> as will (by the <hi>Sympathy,</hi> between the <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the <hi>Seed,</hi> formerly explain'd) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the very ſame Modification in the Seed, that an <hi>Idea,</hi> convey'd by the Blood from the deficient Part, (if it had not been wanting) would have done. For the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Imagination may not only add to the <hi>Foetus</hi> a <hi>Spot</hi> repreſenting the Thing Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd in Figure and Colour, but even the very <hi>Thing it ſelf</hi> in its whole Nature. How many Inſtances are there of Pregnant Women, that have conceiv'd <hi>ſo</hi> ſtrong an <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Horns</hi> of ſome Beaſt that has
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57199:48"/>
terrifi'd them, <hi>that</hi> the Impreſſion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made upon the <hi>Foetus,</hi> has produc'd (not a <hi>Spot</hi> only repreſenting it, but) a real ſubſtantial <hi>Horn,</hi> though, perhaps, this Cauſe of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> be not always obſerved. And hence it is, that if the <hi>Parents be maimed from their Birth,</hi> their Children are often mutilated of the ſame Part, becauſe they cannot eaſily conceive a firm <hi>Idea</hi> of the entireneſs of that Part, which they never felt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in themſelves: But if they were <hi>diſmembred long after,</hi> they can eaſily form a ſtrong <hi>Idea</hi> of the Part that they have felt entire, and known the uſe of, in themſelves, and ſo ſupply the defect of that <hi>Idea</hi> in the <hi>Seed.</hi> 'Tis alſo probable, that the <hi>Mothers Imagination</hi> is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſe, why the <hi>Childs Face</hi> ſometimes reſembles the Fathers, ſometimes the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſometimes ſome other Perſon, according to the <hi>Idea</hi> that is prevalent in the Mothers Brain, while ſhe is with Child.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Mother</hi> (as well as the Father) is furniſh'd with <hi>true Seed,</hi> endow'd with the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Parts of her own Body (as well as the Fathers is with the <hi>Ideas</hi> of his) and conſequently, that ſhe does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute part of the <hi>Plaſtick vertue</hi> that forms the <hi>Foetus,</hi> as well as afford the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57199:48"/>
                  <hi>Matter</hi> of which it is form'd and nouriſh'd in the Womb, appears from ſeveral Parts of the foregoing Diſcourſe, as well as from the three following Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. The <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Maſculine Seed can only be taken from the Parts of the Mans Body, and therefore can never form the Organs peculiar to a Woman. 2. The vitious Conformation of any Part of the Mothers Body, as well as of the Fathers, is often propagated to the <hi>Foetus.</hi> 3. When a <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> of differing <hi>Species</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate, the <hi>Foetus</hi> is of a mixt kind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the <hi>one</hi> in ſome of its Parts, and the <hi>other</hi> in others. We have (beſides the inſtance of Mules) too many inſtances of this in the Monſtrous <hi>Foetus's</hi> produc'd by the deteſtable Venery of ſome Men, that copulate with Female Brutes. The flowing of the <hi>Menſtruous Blood</hi> to a young Womans Womb, is a <hi>ſign of Maturity,</hi> becauſe it ſignifies, that, beſides the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Idea</hi> of her own Sex (which ſhe was really furniſh'd with before) there is now alſo Aliment provided for the Evolution of that <hi>Idea,</hi> whenſoever it comes to be Foecundated by the Maſculine Seed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Death happens, when the Vital Spirit (or Calidum innatum</hi>) that is the chief Mover in the Evolution of the <hi>Ideas,</hi> and in all

The Seminal <hi>Idea</hi> of every <hi>Plant</hi> (as was formerly ſaid of <hi>Animals</hi>) conſiſts of as many particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>Ideas,</hi> as there are different Parts in the Vegetable, all together repreſenting an exact <hi>Model</hi> of the entire Plant.

When theſe ſigns are compleat, if you heat the Glaſs, you ſhall ſee a perfect lively <hi>Idea</hi> of the Plant riſe up within it, which will diſappear again when the Glaſs is remov'd from the Heat. This odd <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi> depends upon a Particle of the <hi>

But the Author does not give credit to the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſome pretend to, of elevating this <hi>Idea</hi> from the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of a Plant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Calcination drives away that Spirit, which is the immediate Receptacle of the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Plant.

And tho' Fiſhes have no Lungs nor Air Pipes, becauſe they live in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet inſtead thereof they have <hi>Gils,</hi> which are Dilated and Contracted by a perpetual Reciprocation, to give ingreſs and egreſs to the <hi>Water,</hi> as the <hi>Lungs</hi> of other Animals are to Inſpire and Exſpire the <hi>Air.</hi> Nor can <hi>Fiſhes</hi> live without <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> any more than <hi>Land-Animals</hi> can do without <hi>Air.</hi> Whence 'tis highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the <hi>former</hi> receive conſtant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes of ſome <hi>vital ſubſtance</hi> from the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as well as the <hi>later</hi> do from the <hi>Air:</hi> eſpecially if we farther conſider, that the <hi>Vital Liquor</hi> Circulates through the <hi>Gils</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> by the Ramifications of their <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Bronchialis,</hi> as well as it do's through the <hi>Lungs</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> by thoſe of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57199:57"/>
their outward ſurfaces without penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any farther. But inſtead of enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging any more upon this point, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the curious Reader to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s <hi>Book of the ſoul of Brutes, Chap.</hi> 3. where he will find it very fully and accurately handled.] 4. The Exiſtence of an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Spirit</hi> is evident from what has been ſaid concerning the Growth of <hi>Vegetables.</hi> For 'tis a Particle of this <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>ſeed,</hi> excited, ſtrengthn'd and <hi>maintain'd</hi> by the <hi>Suns Vital Influence,</hi> that <hi>Explicates</hi> the <hi>Seminal Idea,</hi> and <hi>Coagulates</hi> the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> into ſolid ſubſtances, as Wood, Bark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which could never be produc'd out of ſimple Water without this <hi>Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating Spirit.</hi> 5. The ſame Argument may with equal, if not greater, force be applied to <hi>Minerals,</hi> and eſpecially to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> which, tho' they be the ſolideſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances yet known, are nevertheleſs made of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which of all Liquors is the moſt fluid.</p>
               <p>In the next place, To evince that <hi>the Sun is the chief Fountain of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Spirit,</hi> I need only put the Reader in mind of what was formerly obſerv'd concerning <hi>vegetable ſeeds</hi>; namely, that they would be perpetually barren, if their <hi>Native Spirit</hi> were not <hi>actuated</hi> by that vital ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57199:57"/>
which is every where diffus'd with the <hi>Rayes of the Sun.</hi> But to confirm this a little farther, 'tis evident beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that <hi>the Growth of Vegetables depends upon the Influences of the Sun,</hi> ſince the different Seaſons of the Solar Year have ſo conſtant and ſo powerful Effects upon them. For in <hi>Winter</hi> the Influence of the Sun is very weak, becauſe of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity of his Rayes, and the ſhortneſs of the dayes: and therefore <hi>Seeds</hi> lye dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant in the Earth without any motion: <hi>Herbs</hi> fade and wither, or dye totally: <hi>Trees</hi> are depriv'd of their Leaves and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Verdure, ſhoot forth no Twigs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no Bloſſoms, bear no Fruit, and in a word ceaſe from all Vital Actions. Yea many <hi>Animals</hi> themſelves looſe much of their Vigour, and ſome of them (ſuch as <hi>Flyes, Frogs, Swallows,</hi> &amp;c.) lye dead, as it were, all the Winter long, in Chinks of Walls, or in Cavities of the Earth, or under Water, without any motion, Senſe, or the leaſt appearance of Life: But when the <hi>Sun</hi> comes to be more <hi>vertical,</hi> and the Dayes grow longer, every thing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Life is quickn'd or reviv'd; and the whole Face of the Earth, that look'd dead and lifeleſs before, appears freſh, verdant, lively, and quite new, inſomuch
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57199:58"/>
that 'tis aſtoniſhing to behold ſo vaſt an alteration: the <hi>Vital Spirit</hi> remaining in the Roots of ſuch <hi>Herbs,</hi> as did not quite dye in the preceeding Winter, being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd, Excited to Motion and Corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, falls to work afreſh, and produces new Stalks, Leaves, Flowers, Seed, Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Vital Spirit</hi> that had in a great meaſure retir'd from the Branches of <hi>Trees</hi> into their Roots and Body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates it ſelf anew, reſtores their freſh and lively Verdure, and adorns them with new Leaves, Twigs, Buds, Bloſſoms, Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Finally the <hi>Vital Spirit</hi> of the forementioned <hi>Animals,</hi> that had Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it ſelf in the middle of their Body, actuates the Members anew which it had before deſerted, and reſtores to them Senſe, Motion, and the Exerciſe of all their Vital Functions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Spirit</hi> appears to be of an <hi>Igneous Nature,</hi> 1. Becauſe it flows from the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is an actual <hi>Fire.</hi> Yea the <hi>Solar Rayes</hi> themſelves, which diffuſe this Vital Subſtance through the Viſible World, being <hi>Collected</hi> by a Burning Glaſs into a Center, produce all the Effects of our <hi>Actual</hi> Culinary <hi>Fire.</hi> [2. The Vital Spirit of Animals is fed by the Univerſal Spirit, as has been evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

prov'd, and by conſequence is of the ſame Nature with it. Now this <hi>Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in Hot Sanguineous Animals, has all the Eſſential Properties of an Actual Flame:</hi> For it conſtantly <hi>diffuſes</hi> a ſenſible <hi>Heat</hi> through all the Members of the Body: it is <hi>maintain'd</hi> by conſtant freſh ſupplies of <hi>ſulphureous Fuel</hi> from the <hi>Aliments,</hi> that are taken into the Stomach and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Blood, where this ſubtil Flame inviſibly burns; and of an <hi>Aerial Pabulum</hi> from the <hi>Air,</hi> that is taken into the Lungs by Inſpiration, and there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the ſame Liquor: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly <hi>emits Fuliginous Effluvia,</hi> both through the <hi>Wind-Pipe</hi> alſo through all the <hi>Pores of the Skin,</hi> which are like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Chimneys</hi> appointed to ventilate this vital Fire: It is <hi>kindled</hi> firſt in the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Liquor, either <hi>by another</hi> vital <hi>Fire,</hi> as in viviparous Animals; <hi>or by the Inteſtine Motion of the Sulphureous Parts,</hi> excited and cheriſhed by a continu'd External Warmth, as in Oviparous Animals: but ſo long as the <hi>Foetus</hi> is <hi>included</hi> in the Womb or Egg, it <hi>burns</hi> very <hi>faintly,</hi> and never breaks out into an <hi>actual Flame</hi> till the <hi>Air</hi> have free ncceſs to it by Reſpiration: finally it <hi>dyes</hi> as ſoon as it is <hi>depriv'd of Sulphureous Fuel,</hi> of <hi>Aerial Pabulum,</hi> or of <hi>Ventilation.</hi> Now

All Chimiſts agree that <hi>the Concretion of Bodies depends upon the Saline Principle.</hi> Now <hi>Acaline Salts</hi> are apt rather to <hi>Diſſolve</hi> Bodies, than either to Coagulate or be Coagulated: Whereas we have a multitude of Inſtances of Coagulation and Fixation perform'd by <hi>Acid Salts</hi>; which tho' they Corrode (and ſo Diſſolve) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bodies, yet their Property is to <hi>Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate</hi> with the Bodies they have Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

Corroſive</hi>; by Spirit of Nitre into <hi>Red Precipitate,</hi> as the Chymiſts abuſively call it; by Oyl of Vitriol, Oyl of Sulphur, or Oyl of Alum into <hi>Turbith Mineral,</hi> finally by the <hi>Acid</hi> Particles of Fire into <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate per ſe.</hi> Theſe Inſtances are the more pertinent to our purpoſe, becauſe Mercury is a more Fluid Body than Simple Water it ſelf. And the laſt of them, tho' at firſt it appear ſomewhat Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical, yet upon better examination it ſeems to be very reaſonable; <hi>ſince Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate per ſe,</hi> as well as the reſt of the newly mentioned <hi>Preparations of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver,</hi> may be <hi>reviv'd</hi> into running Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by being diſtill'd from Salt of Tartar, Quick-lime, or ſuch other <hi>Alcaliſate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> as are very apt to be wrought upon by <hi>Acid</hi> Salts, and thereby to diſengage the Quickſilver that was Coagulated with them: and <hi>ſince</hi> the Particles of Fire (which have been prov'd to be <hi>Acid</hi>) may penetrate Glaſs, and many times increaſe the weight of the incloſed Bodies, as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> has undeniably evinced by a great many Experiments: and finally <hi>ſince</hi> Fire is the only Agent in this Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.] The Sulphur of Lead deprives <hi>Quickſilver</hi> of its Fluidity.

as to endure an open Fire for ſome time; but they recover their former vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility, as ſoon as they are diſengaged from the <hi>Acid</hi> Salts that fixed them, by the addition of any Alcaliſate Body. All ſorts of <hi>Acid</hi> Salts do coagulate <hi>Milk</hi>: and the Coagulation of the Creamy parts of Milk into <hi>Butter,</hi> depends upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Acid</hi> of the Milk; for if you throw any Alcaliſate Salt into it, there can be no Butter obtain'd from it. The <hi>Acid</hi> Salts of Nitre do ſo powerfully fix the vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> as to render it a good Diaphoretic. [The <hi>Acid</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine inſtantly Coagulates <hi>Spirit of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi>; for, if both theſe Liquors be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rectified, as ſoon as ever you have ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, the whole mixture loſes its Fluidity, inſomuch that tho' the Glaſs be inverted, not one drop will fall out: yea our Author affirms that] if Spirit of Wine highly rectified be kept for ſome months upon Salt of Urine in a gently digeſtive heat, they will unite together into a <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> of a reddiſh Colour: and (which is yet more ſtrange) four parts of this Stone will convert one part of new Spirit of Urine into its own Subſtance, and four parts of this one more, and ſo on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any end: and that the Stone in the
