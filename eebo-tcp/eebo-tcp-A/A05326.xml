            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>A. The holy Scriptures (as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith) vnlesse they bee read with that Spirit, by which it is beleeued to be written by the inspiration of Gods' Siprit, for the direction of mans life, and that with humilitie, and desire to know and be gouerned by it, cannot be vnderstood, but remaine as a dead letter in the efficacie thereof.</p>
                     <p>Concerning whom, yet further S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> saith, though they haue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that height and depth, wherein
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17721:11"/>
their mistery may exercise the wisdom of the learned, yet haue they also that easinesse and plainenes, that the simple may be comforted &amp; taught, being in themselues that wonderfull riuer, both shallow &amp; deep, wherein as the Lambe may wade, the Elaphant may swim.</p>
                     <p>Of whose depth S. <hi>Austin</hi> thus spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth further; The holy Scriptures are thus written, <hi>saith hee,</hi> that by their height the proude may bee abased; as with their easinesse, the simple may be comforted: Adding withall, that it is our dulnes of capacity, that they seeme so hard vnto vs, and the vaile of our hearts which cannot bee remoued, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse by him which hath the <hi>key of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, which opens where no mans shuts, and shuts, where no mans opens, which only can open that sealed Booke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore as another father saith, God hath not wrapt vp these high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Scripture in such obscuritie, as euying mans knowledge; but that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17721:12"/>
the study and industry of man might be the more profitably exercised, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall that no man ought to be too much deiected, that he cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand euery mysterie therein: for that there are some things, that to bee ignorant of, though they may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what subiect thy presumption, will not indanger thy saluation; for that all things are not necessary to bee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all. And therefore according to Saint <hi>Austins</hi> rule, if thou louest the law of God, manifest it in reuerencing that which thou vnderstandest, not as in practising that which thou dost vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and thou shalt haue first wherewithall to drinke, after stronger meate to eate, and possesse thy selfe patience, knowing that whilst we are in this mortall flesh, wee can perceiue but as in a mirrour, yet that hereafter we shall bee translated to a higher A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy, where God himselfe shall bee our Schoolemaster, and then we shall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17721:12"/>
see him as he is, where all shadowes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and the substance onely is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, where being ascended we shall know the truth of all, either argued or debated of in this sublunary religion.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>What were those three couiuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Saint</hi> Barnard <hi>so wonderfully wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, the like whereof neither can nor shall euer be done againe vpon the face of the earth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A. Three works, three coniunctions hath that omnipotent Maiesty made in the assumption of our flesh, wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly singular, and singularly wonderfull, euen such as the verie Angels were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at:
<list>
                           <item>1. Coniunction of God and man.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>A. The first coniunction is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully great, wherein is conioyned earth

and God, Maiestie and infirmitie, so much vilenesse, and so much puritie; for nothing is more pretious then God nothing more vilde then durt. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse wonderfull; for by the eare of man was it neuer heard, nor by the heart of man euer conceiued, that a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin should bring forth and become a Mother, and that there should bee a Mother that should yet remaine a vir-Virgin. The third is inferior to both first and second, but not lesse strong that mans heart should haue power to beleeue this.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>How many seuerall wayes since the beginning of the world hath God brought foorth man?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A. Foure wayes according to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmus,</hi> which are these: 1.

                     <p>Q. <hi>By the coniectures of the learned, for how many thousand of yeares from the Creation was the world ordained to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A. Sixe thousand yeares, because that as in 6. dayes the world and all that therein is was created, and so God rested the seuenth, so thereupon it is probably collected that in 6000. yeares, which are but as 6. dayes in Gods account, it shall againe be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: after which shall follow an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Sabaoth of rest; of this opinion were many of the Fathers, and also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more modern writers, as that there should be two thousand yeares before the Law, and two thousand yeares vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and two thousand yeares vnder the Gospell.</p>

if hee had but legges to beare him to them: To whom the blinde answers, and I would not sticke to pull the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples if I had but thy eyes to see them, and so at last between this debate they agree that hee that had his eyes should ride vpon the others shoulders that had his legges, this being done, they were able to plucke the fruite and did eate, and hauing eaten, the master of the Orchyard enters and finds his damage, enquires by whom it was done, and they both confesse their act and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance, how the one vsed his feet, and the other his eyes, and so they did it betweene them.
