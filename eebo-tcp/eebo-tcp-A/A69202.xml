            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will, no doubt, seeme strange to see my name in print, standing so neare these men who are Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pages, their profession and mine being of such different natures; But I shall entreat the ingenuous rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take notice of the necessitie of this my doing.</p>
            <p>I am by the three Answerers to these Demands wronged, and that by an injurie of an high nature, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged in writing to have done that, which God doth know never entred
<pb facs="tcp:496:3"/>
into my thoughts; and for any thing the answerers did or doe know, never came into my minde. And though by the law of challenges, they having challenged me, I may choose the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons (which certainely should have beene in another kinde, had the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengers beene of another profession) yet being men of so holy a function, I have thought good to make choyce of their own weapons; and by my pen to doe out that blot, which they by their pen have laid upon me. And I have thought it fit to doe it in a scedule an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this booke (which for that cause only I have caused to be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed) that where mens mindes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be poysoned by swallowing an untruth in their answers, so deeply wounding my honour and loyaltie;
<pb facs="tcp:496:3"/>
this antidote might be ready at hand to cure them, before they should be fully tainted with it: As likewise sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that if they should be printed severally, many might meet with their answers alone, which might leave in them a bad impression of me; if they should not be attended with this just and true expression of mine.</p>
            <p>The injuries wherewith I am viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the three answerers, are of two sorts: One of them strikes me alone, as his sacred MAJESTIES high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner; The other wounds me as his MAJESTIES Counsellour; and with me all of that honourable boord. The former is this,</p>
            <p>They deliver affirmatively, That the declaration which they tendered mee of their late Covenant, was such as I
<pb facs="tcp:496:4"/>
accepted, and was well pleased with. And this they set down twice for fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; In their answer to the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand towards the end, and in their answer to the third demand a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the middle of it; and that with such confidence, as truly I cannot with any justice blame the reader for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, when it fell from the pens of these men, whose profession is the teaching of truth.</p>
            <p>But I shall desire the readers to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves (notwithstanding the prejudice of these mens persons) to be undeceived by a plaine averment of truth.</p>
            <p>I am confident none of these three answerers ever heard me say so, nor will they say they did. If they but heard it from others (which I do veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:496:4"/>
beleeve they did not, and shall do so still, till they avouch their authors) sure no man can choose but misse in them that civill prudence, which will not allow any discreet man to affirme that of any other; much lesse of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of my qualitie, and at this time of my place; the foundation whereof shall be so frail and slipperie, as report, which is alwaies uncertaine, and most times false.</p>
            <p>For clearing the truth, I doe averre upon mine Honour that I never said so, I never thought so. And though that that Declaration was much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the industrie of some well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected (from what was first intended) yet it gave me not satisfaction: and I dare boldly affirme, I never said it would give my Master the KINGS
<pb facs="tcp:496:5"/>
MAJESTY any. My justifiers in this, shall be these Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others to whom I ever spoke, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publickly, or in private. I was indeed content to catch at any thing I could, when I could not obtaine what I would; as being willing to doe my countrey-men that respect, as to the utmost of my power to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to my gracious Master, with all favourable construction, even that which I then thought, and did know fell short of just and home satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <note n="†" place="margin">Nor is there any ground for their opinion of my accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they call receiving, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting; and that was not in my power to refuse, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceived in formall words of a supplication, and so tendered to me, who by my royall Master his instructions was commanded to receive the petitions of all his good and loyall subjects.</note> And here, I doe confesse, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not charge it for a faultie mistake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the readers of these asseverations of the three answerers, if they should, before this my declaration, conceive that his MAJESTIE were in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie
<pb facs="tcp:496:5"/>
like to rest satisfied with that declaration of the Covenant; having it delivered to them from men whom they have in all this businesse beleeved as much as themselves, that his MAJESTIES Commissioner, who in all likelihood did know his MAJESTIES minde best, did rest satisfied with it.</p>
            <p>But his MAJESTY hath just reason to charge me, if these asseverations were true; as I have good reason to vindicate my selfe, they being not true. The truth is, if these asseverations be true, I doe professe to the whole world, that his MAJESTY hath a most just cause to discharge himselfe of mee, and my service, and to discharge mee of all trust in this, or any other nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation For I professe, that I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his MAJESTIES constant mislike of
<pb facs="tcp:496:6"/>
the said Covenant, it must bewray in me, either breach of trust, or want of judgement; if I should goe about to make either my self, or the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that my Master could receive satisfaction by such an explanation.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot dissemble, but must ask leave to vent my self thus far. Had these wrongs beene put upon me by the pens of other men, and not of these whose professions I am forward and willing to beleeve (because I would have it so) will not suffer them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace wilfull and malicious designes: I should justly have doubted, that there had been some men in this kingdome, who being afraid of a setling and peaceable conclusion of this businesse, had gone about to raise in my royall and gracious Master a jelousie of my
<pb facs="tcp:496:6"/>
slacknesse in my King and Countries service, that so I might be called back, <hi>re infecta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any such enemies there be to the peace of this miserable distracted Church and State, I beseech God in time to discover them, and that all may end, in covering them with shame and confusion. The summe of all I will say of this personall wrong offered to my self, is this; If these reverend and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentlemen, the Answerers, in these untrue aspersions intended any harme to me, I shall only now requite them with a cast of their own calling; I pray God forgive them. If they intended me no harm, then I do expect that they will give my self and the world satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in clearing me that I gave them no ground for these their asseverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb facs="tcp:496:7"/>
And so being confident of his MAJESTIES goodnesse to all his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; amongst the rest, to the meanest of them, my self, especially in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that he will never be shaken in the opinion of my loyall and constant service, upon such slight, light, and groundlesse reports: I will say no more of that first point.</p>
            <p>For that which concerneth my selfe as a Counsellour, and the rest of that honourable Boord, averred by the three answerers, in their answers to the third and fourteenth demand; I do here protest before Almighty God, that none of the allegations alledged by the three answerers, nor any petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given me by the supplicants, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to give way, that the order of the Councell table should not passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:496:7"/>
an act: for I did then, and doe now avow, that I then was, and now am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied with his MAJESTIES most gracious declaration; and that in my opinion all ought to have thought themselves sufficiently freed from fears of innovations. But the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was this, I was so tenderly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned towards the peace of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that I gave way to that, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of honourable qualitie assured me, if it were not done, a present rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might follow, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ruine of this Kingdome; which I was resolved to keep off so long as possibly I could, retaining my fidelitie to my Master. VVhich care of mine I finde but slenderly required, when it is made an argument to perswade his MAJESTIES good subjects to do that
<pb facs="tcp:496:8"/>
which is so displeasing to him, and so unsafe for them. And yet even in this passage, it would have beene expected from men of that profession, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should have passed but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth. In which point too they have failed, either as I hope by a mistaking, or a mis-informing. For the Missive once thought fit to be sent to his MAJESTY was never rent, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yet as it was: and wee did not send it, because wee did not thinke, thanks to his MAJESTY would be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable in the name of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when we knew his MAJESTIE, by the last proceedings of many, and protestations made against his royall declaration (pretended in the name of the whole country) could not receive satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:496:8"/>To conclude, notwithstanding this personall wrong offered to me his MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTIES high Commissioner, I will carefully; cheerfully, and constantly go on with this great businesse, wherewith he hath intrusted me. VVhich as I pray God that it may prosper under my hands; so I praise God that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me so cheerfull and willing a heart to go on in it; that if my life could procure the peace of this torn Church and Kingdome, to the contentment of my royall Master, and comfort of his distracted subjects; he who knoweth all things, knoweth likewise this truth; It is the sacrifice of the world, in which I would most glorie, and which I would most sincerely offer up to God, my King and Countrey.</p>

               <p>WE have, <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> sufficiently considered and examined your answers to our Demands, by which we expected full satisfaction to all our scruples and doubts concerning the <hi>late Covenant</hi>: But truly, in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and brotherly love, we tell you, that your answers (whatsoever you think of them your selves) have not given us that satisfaction which we expected. We know that some who rashly condemne every thing which is said or written contrarie to the cause which they maintain, will boldly say of us, that we have closed our eyes against a clear and ingyring light: But first, we say with JOB, <hi>Our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is in heaven, and our record is on high.</hi> That Lord who only seeth the secrets of hearts, knoweth, that we love his truth, and are ready, so soon as it shall be shown unto us, to embrace and professe it before the world. Next, we appeal to the consciences of all impartiall readers, who shall have occasion to weigh and consider maturely the weight of our arguments, and of these answeres which it hath pleased you to give us: wishing them, yea, most humbly and earnestly intreating them, to judge both of your writings and ours without prejudice, or any partiall respect. Yea, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that ye also, of whose love to the truth of GOD we are perswaded, will after better advisement, and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture consideration of the matters debated, acknowledge that we are not against the truth, but for it. The Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your eyes, that you may clearly see that truth for which we stand.</p>
               <p>WE objected to you, <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> that you had not a calling to urge us to the subscription of the <hi>late Covenant,</hi> from any acknowledged authoritie, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Judicatorie established in this Church or Kingdome: to which objection ye answere not here particularly, as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:496:12"/>
And whereas you say, That you are come to exhort us, and our people, in all humility, to joyn with you; How is it, that without our consent, and against our will, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lawfull authority, which you seem here not to acclaime to your selves, you have publickly preached to our people, within our Congregation? which is a thing repugnant to those places of Scripture, in the which the Spirit of God recommendeth to Elders, or Pastors, the care of those flocks, <hi>over which the holy Ghost hath made them over-seers,</hi> Acts 20.28. 1 Pet. 5.2. as also telleth us, That the Pastors whom the flock must <hi>know,</hi> and to whom they must <hi>submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> do <hi>watch over the souls of that flock, and must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for them,</hi> 1. Thessal. 5.12. Hebr. 13.17. It is also contrarie to the laws of the Christian Church in all ages. For by the ancient Canons, Pastors are commanded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themselves within the limits of their own charge; and not to presume to exercise Pastorall office in another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors Diocesse, or Parioch, without leave: As also, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Pastors to receive to divine service any man of another Parioch, that commeth in contempt of his own Pastor. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.

We did not without reason say, That you, and others of your confederation, enforce your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the <hi>Negative confession</hi> upon others; seeing we hear, that some Pastors and Prelates are forced to flee to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne countreys, for fear of their lives, because they have refused the said <hi>interpretation</hi>; and those who have stayed in the countrey, dare scarcely appear in the high wayes, or streets; and are threatned, That their stipends shall not be payed unto them, untill they subscribe your <hi>Covenant.</hi> ¶ 3. Whereas you do in brotherly love exhort, and entreat us to contribute our best endeavours, for extinguishing the common combustion; we praising God for your pious zeal, and for the lovingnesse and modesty of your speeches,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:496:12"/>
(wherein by Gods help we shall labour to keep correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with you; that both we and you may shew our selves to have learned of Christ, <hi>Meeknesse, and lowlinesse of heart)</hi> we most willingly promise to do so, by all means which our consciences will permit us to use; as also to joyn our most humble and hearty prayers with yours, That it may please God in this dangerous exigent, To <hi>do good in his good pleasure to our Sion, and to build up the wals of our Ierusalem.</hi> ¶ 4. We may justly say, That this <hi>new Covenant</hi> is substantially different from the <hi>old,</hi> which was made <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1581. in respect it not only containeth that <hi>old covenant,</hi> or <hi>confession,</hi> which was allowed by two <hi>generall assemblies,</hi> but also your <hi>interpretation</hi> of it, which, as yet, hath no such authority, or approbation. ¶ 5. No band of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all defence, <hi>against all persons whatsoever,</hi> is expressed in the <hi>Covenant</hi> made 1581. And although it were, yet the case is very unlike: For subjects may make such a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>mutuall defence</hi> by armes, with the consent of the King, who only under God, hath the power of armes, or of the sword, in this kingdome. But they who made this <hi>late Covenant,</hi> had not his consent, as that former or <hi>old Covenant</hi> had: which is a thing so evident, that no man can call it in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. ¶ 6. As for that which you affirm here, That my Lord Commissioner his Grace was well satisfied with your <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>; it becommeth not us to pry narrowly into his <hi>Graces</hi> doings: but truly we have more than reason to pry most narrowly into the words of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto us, to be sworn, and subscribed, left we abuse, and prophane the sacred name of God, and tye our selves to the doing of any thing which is displeasing unto him. Last of all; whereas ye desire us to joyn our selves to you, and to the rest of your confederacie, who are (as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm) <hi>almost the whole Church and Kingdome:</hi> Truly we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but reverence such a multitude of our reverend bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dear countrey-men, and are ready to be <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them, in so far as they are followers of Christ:</hi> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we <hi>do any thing against the truth,</hi> neither can we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:496:13"/>
attribute so much authoritie to their multitude, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we would, in respect there hath been so much dealing for <hi>subscriptions,</hi> in all quarters of this Kingdome, and so many have been threatned, to give their consent, as we are most credibly informed.</p>

And therefore, we cannot see how any bands of that kinde can be excepted, as if they were not seditious. 2. We doubt not, but the <hi>late Covenant,</hi> being considered according to the main intention of those pious and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gentlemen, Barons, and others our dear countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who made it, especially our reverend brethren of the holy ministery, is a <hi>Covenant</hi> made with God, and proceeding from a zealous respect to Gods glory, and to the preservation of the puritie of the Gospel in this Church and Kingdome: But we cannot finde a warrant in our consciences to grant, That such <hi>Covenants,</hi> in so farre as they import <hi>mutuall defence, against all persons whats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> none being excepted, no, not the King, (as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto us, by the words of your <hi>Covenant,</hi> but far more by

For first, we have alreadie shown, That they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the foresaid act of <hi>Parliament, Anno</hi> 1585. 2. No warfare; and consequently, no <hi>covenant,</hi> importing war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, is lawfull, without just Authoritie; which, we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, is onely in the supreme Magistrate, and in those who have power and imployment from him, to take armes: yea, so farre as we know, all moderate men, who duely respect Authority, will say, That it is so in all <hi>Kingdomes, and Monarchies, properly so called</hi>: (of which nature is this his Majesties most ancient Kingdome) And, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unlawfull to subjects in such Kingdomes, to take armes against their Prince. For which cause, that famous and most learned Doctour <hi>Rivetus,</hi> in a late <hi>Treatise</hi> called <hi>Iesuita vapulans,</hi> speaking of the judgment of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> and others, who taught, That subjects might take armes against their Prince, in extraordinary cases, and extreme dangers of the Religion, and Common-wealth; professeth first, That he, and all other <hi>Protestants,</hi> condemne such doctrine. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this errour did proceed from a mistaking of the government of the <hi>Scotish Kingdome,</hi> as if it were not truely and properly <hi>Monarchicall. Thirdly,</hi> That the rashnesse of those writers, is to be ascribed partly to the hard and perilous times of persecution, wherein they lived, and partly, <hi>Scotorum praefervido ingenis, &amp; ad audendum prompto.</hi> Thus he writeth in the 13. Chap. of the said book, Pag. 274. and 275. answering to the Recrimination of a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> who had affirmed, That <hi>Buchanan, Knox,</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> had written as boldly for the rebellion of Subjects against Princes, as any of their order at any time had done. A thing much to be noted by us at this time, lest we any more give that advantage to <hi>Iesuites,</hi> to make <hi>Apologie</hi> for their rebellious doctrines and practises. 3. Not only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Covenants,</hi> but also all other actions, are to be

esteemed and judged of, first, by the equitie of the subject, and matter; then, by the end: for if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pactioned (that is, which the parties mutually do promise) be justly forbidden, by a lawfull Authoritie, and consequently be unlawfull in it self; then the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the end, or project, cannot make the paction, or <hi>Covenant,</hi> to be good, or lawfull.</p>

               <p>AS for the first of these two mistakings: If you have not given out that <hi>interpretation</hi> of the <hi>negative confession</hi> judicially, but only have <hi>made known</hi> your own meaning, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the minde of the Reformers, as you alledge; then, first, your <hi>interpretation</hi> hath no obligatory power over others; and consequently you ought not to obtrude your <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> upon us, more then we doe our <hi>interpretation</hi> thereof upon you. Neither ought any man to be molested, or threatned, for not receiving your <hi>interpretation</hi>; chiefly seeing all who are of your <hi>confederation</hi> have so solemnly vowed, and promised, to be <hi>good examples to others of all godlinesse, sobernesse, and righteousnesse, and of every duety which you owe to God and man.</hi> Secondly, As for the minde or judgement of our <hi>Reformers,</hi> we know no evidence of it, having publick authority to oblige the subjects of this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:496:16"/>
Kingdome, except that which is expressed in our <hi>nationall confession of faith,</hi> ratified in Parliament twenty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>negative confession</hi> was penned: wherein we finde no warrant or ground of such <hi>interpretation</hi> as you bring. Thirdly, The <hi>interpretation</hi> of the <hi>negative confession,</hi> set down in your <hi>covenant,</hi> as it is not publick, <hi>ratione personae,</hi> so also not <hi>ratione medii</hi>: for it hath no warrant, for ought we could ever perceive, either from the word of God, or from the testimony of the ancient Church, or from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of other reformed Churches, or from our <hi>nationall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> registrated in <hi>Parliament.</hi> As for the second mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or mis-interpretation of the words of the <hi>late covenant,</hi> first, we marvell, that a <hi>generall Covenant</hi> appointed to be subscribed by all, learned and unlearned, should have been set down by you in such ambiguous termes. For, truly, all men here, even the most judicious, do so take your words, as if the articles of <hi>Pearth</hi> were in them abjured. 2. We have again more attentively examined the words of the <hi>late Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and do evidently perceive by them, That in the said <hi>Covenant,</hi> the articles of <hi>Pearth,</hi> and <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and abjured, as erroneous, and damnable corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For where you professe, <hi>and before God, and his angels, and the world, solemnly declare, That you shall labour, by all means lawfull, to recover the libertie, and puritie of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as it was established and professed before the foresaid nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> We ask you, what is that period of time, to which your words have reference, when you promise to <hi>labour, to recover the puritie and libertie of the Gospel, as it was professed and established before the foresaid novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> If you mean that period of time, when the <hi>Service book,</hi> and <hi>Book of Canons</hi> were urged upon you; to wit, the last year by-past in Summer; then you acknowledge, That all that time you enjoyed the <hi>puritie and libertie of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi> and consequently, That you yet enjoy it; for no new thing hath since that time been publickly received, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in this <hi>Church.</hi> If you mean (as undoubtedly we think
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:496:17"/>
you do) the time praeceding the bringing in of <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> and the acts of <hi>Pearth</hi>; then you comprehend both <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> and the acts of <hi>Pearth</hi> under these <hi>novations: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving whereof, you promise to labour, according to your power:</hi> and consequently do dis-allow and condemne them, even before they be tried in a <hi>free assembly,</hi> and before they be heard who maintain and approve them as lawfull. 3. We may evidently demonstrate this, <hi>argumento ad hominem,</hi> as we say in the schools: For, those <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> which are abjured in the <hi>negative confession,</hi> are also abjured in your <hi>late Covenant</hi>; which, as you say, is all one with the <hi>negative confession,</hi> or with the <hi>Covenant</hi> made 1581. But the <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi> which were concluded in <hi>Pearth assembly,</hi> are abjured, as you say, in the <hi>Covenant</hi> made 1581. and therefore they are also abjured in this your <hi>late Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> The first <hi>proposition</hi> is evident: For in your <hi>late Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> speaking of the oath contained in that <hi>old Covenant,</hi> which was made <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. you professe, <hi>That the present and succeeding generations in this land, are bound to keep the foresaid nationall oath,</hi> as you call it, <hi>and subscription, unvio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable.</hi> The second <hi>proposition</hi> also cannot be denied by you: For, these twenty years by-past, you have accused those who conformed themselves to the <hi>ordinances</hi> of <hi>Pearth,</hi> of <hi>perjurie</hi>; and that because they had violated the oath made <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. in the which those articles (as you alledge) were abjured. But perhaps you will say to us, That we think those things not to be abjured in that oath made <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. and therefore we may swear, and subscribe your <hi>late Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>; and, notwithstanding of our <hi>oath</hi> and <hi>subscription,</hi> be tied only to the <hi>forbearance</hi> of the practice of <hi>Pearth</hi> arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for a time. We answer, first; The words of an <hi>oath</hi> should be clear, and plain: or, if they be any wayes ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, the true sense of them should be so declared, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, that all may know it. 2 An <hi>oath</hi> is to be given, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the minde and judgement of him that requireth it. And therefore, seeing you who require this <hi>oath</hi> of us, think the <hi>rites</hi> or <hi>ceremonies</hi> concluded at <hi>Pearth</hi> to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:496:17"/>
abjured in that <hi>oath</hi> made <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. how can we swear and subscribe your <hi>Covenant,</hi> which reneweth the foresaid <hi>oath,</hi> and bindeth us to it? 3 If we should swear, and subscribe the <hi>negative confession,</hi> as it is included in your <hi>covenant</hi>; then ye, who think the <hi>articles</hi> of <hi>Pearth</hi> to be abjured, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>negative confession,</hi> will think us tied, by our own <hi>personall oath,</hi> to condemn the <hi>articles</hi> of <hi>Pearth.</hi> 4 Seeing this <hi>covenant</hi> was penned by you, who have hitherto not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med your selves to <hi>Pearth assembly,</hi> and have opposed <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> and seeing you all condemn <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> as if it were that <hi>popish,</hi> or <hi>wicked Hierarchie,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>negative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>; as also esteem the things concluded in <hi>Pearth assembly,</hi> to be <hi>idolatrous,</hi> or <hi>superstitious</hi>; how can we think, that you in your solemn vow made to God, for reformation of this <hi>Church,</hi> and resisting, in times to come, the <hi>novations</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> of it, have passed by these things, which are the only <hi>novations</hi> already introduced by authority, and from which, as you affirm, the Church hath so great need to be purged: chiefly, seeing ye think them as <hi>popish, superstitious,</hi> and <hi>ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous,</hi> as ye do these other <hi>novations,</hi> which are not as yet introduced. 5 If in all your <hi>supplications, plaints,</hi> and <hi>protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> ye have only sought the <hi>removing</hi> and <hi>discharging</hi> of the <hi>Service book. Book of canons,</hi> and the <hi>new high commission,</hi> not complaining of any other <hi>novations</hi>; and seeing his Majestie hath discharged the first two, and hath promised to rectifie the third, or last of them; Then, what reason have ye to think, that his Majestie hath not satisfied your <hi>supplications?</hi> For, all the <hi>novations,</hi> upon which you complained, are removed by his Majestie, and ye have his princely promise, That no further shall be urged upon us, but by such a fair and legall way, as may satisfie all his subjects. 6 As for that which your <hi>Covenant,</hi> by your own confession, requireth of us, to wit, <hi>The forbearance, and abstinence, for a time, from the practising the articles of Pearth</hi>; We professe sincerely, and in the sight of God, That our c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nscience will not suffer us to subscribe that part of your <hi>Covenant</hi>; and that because laws being standing for them, and our lawfull superiours requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:496:18"/>
obedience from us, by practising them, to swear <hi>forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the practise of them,</hi> is to swear <hi>disobedience,</hi> and, <hi>to wrong their authority.</hi> 7 How can we, with a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, abstaine presently from <hi>private baptisme,</hi> and <hi>private communion,</hi> being required thereunto by sick persons, and those parents whose children cannot be carried to the Church commodiously with their lives; seeing we think it a thing very unlawfull, in such cases, to refuse to administrate those <hi>Sacraments</hi> in private houses? Not that we think, that God hath tyed himself, or his grace, to the <hi>Sacraments</hi>; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath tyed us unto them, by his precept: and, not to use the means appointed by God, when our people, or their children stand in need of them, is a contempt of the means, and a tempting of God.</p>

               <p>WHether or no we can sincerely, and with a good conscience, subscribe the negative confession, as it is expounded and interpreted by the contrivers or authors of the late Covenant, seeing it maketh a perpetuall law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the externall rites of the Church, which God hath not made, as if these rites were unchangeable?

               <p>THe <hi>late Covenant</hi> maketh not a perpetuall law concerning the externall rites of the kirke, as if they were unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: but, as we have said before, onely bindeth us, for a time, to forbear the practise of <hi>innovations</hi> already introduced, and doth not determine whether they ought to be changed, or not. 2.

               <p>FIrst, VVe have already told you, That we cannot subscribe your <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>forbearance</hi> of the practise of the <hi>articles</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready introduced, without violation of authority, and of wronging our own consciences, who think <hi>private baptisme</hi> and <hi>communion,</hi> not to be indifferent, but also necessary, in some cases; not indeed, <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> as if Gods grace were tyed to the externall means, but, as we say in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:496:19"/>
schools, <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> because we are commanded to use these means. 2. This <hi>late Covenant</hi> leadeth and bindeth us to the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> made 1581. and that <hi>old Covenant</hi> bindeth us perpetually to that <hi>discipline</hi> which was then; that is, (as ye alledge) to the whole policie of the Church, comprehending all the externall <hi>rites</hi> of it: and so, <hi>à primo ad ultimum,</hi> this <hi>late Covenant</hi> bindeth us to the whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of the Church, which was then; and consequently maketh a perpetuall law, concerning externall <hi>rites</hi> of the Church, as if they were unchangeable. All parts of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument are sure: For by your <hi>late Covenant,</hi> you professe your selves bound, to keep the foresaid <hi>nationall oath</hi> (as you call it) inviolable: And that <hi>oath,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> bindeth us, to continue <hi>in the obedience not onely of the doctrine,</hi> but also <hi>of the discipline of this Kirke.</hi> Where by <hi>the discipline of the Kirke,</hi> ye understand (as ye have in all your writings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, especially of late, in your booke entituled, <hi>A dispute against the English Popish ceremonies.

Yea, you confesse, That no other thing can be understood by <hi>the discipline of the Kirke,</hi> but that which we have said already; and consequently we shall be tyed by that <hi>oath</hi> which you require of us, to admit and practise no other <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> but such as were then received in our Church. We can no wayes passe by this, seeing ever since the <hi>assembly</hi> of <hi>Pearth,</hi> in your <hi>publick ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and <hi>printed books,</hi> ye have most vehemently accused us of <hi>perjurie,</hi> as violating the <hi>oath,</hi> or <hi>covenant,</hi> made <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1581. and that in respect we have admitted into the Church, some <hi>rites,</hi> or <hi>ceremonies,</hi> which were not in it the foresaid year of God.

Seeing the <hi>negative confession,</hi> according to your minde, and conception of it, maketh the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:496:19"/>
policie of the Church, as it was <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. to be unchangeable: and on the contrary, the <hi>confession</hi> insert into the acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> declareth, That the <hi>rites</hi> belonging to the externall policie of the Church, are changeable; how can you escape a <hi>contradiction,</hi> if ye receive both these <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions?</hi> 4. Whereas by that <hi>distinction</hi> mentioned in your <hi>answer,</hi> of things necessary to be observed, and of things va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable in particular congregations, ye insinuate that by the <hi>keeping of the discipline of the Kirke as it was then,</hi> to which we are bound in the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> ye understand the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of those things which are necessary to be observed in every kirke, and not of things variable in particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations: We ask, Into which of the members of this <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> ye refer <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> and the <hi>articles</hi> of <hi>Pearth?</hi> That is, Whether they must necessarily be omitted in all Churches, and at all times, or not? If ye say, that they must be necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted, and that the <hi>negative confession,</hi> confirmed with an <hi>oath,</hi> doth tye us to the omission of them; then both ye would make us to swear, and subscribe against our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (for we are perswaded, That these things are lawfull) as also ye would make us to abjure <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> and the <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of <hi>Pearth, in perpetuum</hi>; which is flatly contrary to your <hi>declaration</hi> in your <hi>answers,</hi> 1.5. &amp;c. If you say on the other part, That we are not tyed by the <hi>negative confession,</hi> to the omission of these things; then, why have ye, in all your writings against us, exprobrate to us, <hi>perjurie,</hi> in violating of the <hi>oath</hi> contained in the <hi>negative confession?</hi> 5. We would gladly have known your minde, concerning the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of such <hi>rites</hi> as are not of divine institution, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Gods word.

               <p>THere is too much, as we think, in your <hi>Covenant</hi> against the lawfulnesse of <hi>Pearth Articles.</hi> 2 Your <hi>band</hi> of <hi>mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all defence, against all persons whatsoever,</hi> may draw subjects, perhaps, to take arms against their King, (which God avert) and consequently from that <hi>loyalty</hi> of <hi>obedience,</hi> which they owe to their Soveraigne, and ours; except ye declare, and explain your selves better, than ye have hitherto done. 3 What the most honourable Lords of his Majesties privie Councell have done concerning the Kings Majesties last Proclamation, is not sufficiently known to us, and far lesse upon what <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> they have (as you say) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded their <hi>approbation</hi> of the late <hi>Proclamation.</hi> 4 His Majesties religious and righteous disposition, hath been to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:496:28"/>
us, and is a main ground wherefore we rest and rely upon his gracious <hi>Proclamation,</hi> perswading our selves, that he intendeth not, nor ever intended, any <hi>innovation</hi> in <hi>religion.</hi> 5 We shall labour, by all means, to eschew every thing, which in the least degree may wrong you, our reverend and worthy brethren. As for the wrongs already done by us to you, (as ye pretend) whensoever it shall please you to spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie them, we hope to give you full satisfaction, and to clear our selves of that <hi>imputation.</hi> 6 The work of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any nation, how strange and wonderfull soever it seem to be, is never contrary to his word: And therefore we fear not to be found fighting against Gods work, so long as we fight not against his truth, revealed in <hi>his word. That all-seeing Lord</hi> knoweth, that we maintain his truth according to the light of our consciences, and are ready to joyn heart and hand with you, for the purity and peace of this <hi>Church,</hi> in every lawfull way and course, as sincere lovers of truth and peace.</p>
               <p>And now, brethren, before we conclude, again we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, and all others our dear country men, especially our <hi>reverend brethren</hi> of the holy <hi>Ministery,</hi> to judge chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably of us, and of our proceedings at this time; and in particular, of these our <hi>Demands,</hi> and <hi>Replyes</hi>; which, God is our witnesse, neither hatred of any mans person, nor love of contention, nor any worldly respect; but only the <hi>conscience of our calling</hi> hath drawn from us. And as for our <hi>arguments</hi> for <hi>not subscribing,</hi> which are taken from our due <hi>subjection</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to our <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> and his laws, <hi>We protest and declare,</hi> That they ought not to be so interpreted, as if we intended to accuse you, or others, our dear countrey men, of <hi>disloyalty</hi> towards our most gracious <hi>King</hi>; or as if our purpose were to lay any such <hi>imputation</hi> upon you: For they are only used by us, to show what the words of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> seem to us to import, and how we conceive of them; as also, what maketh us so to conceive of them. We doubt not, <hi>reverend brethren,</hi> but ye know, that as we owe to you, and to your proceedings, the favourable judgement of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:496:28"/>
                  <hi>charitie</hi>; so we ought to judge of those things, which we are to swear, and subscribe, with the strict and inquisitive judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>veritie</hi>; and consequently, we ought to ponder duly, and to propound particularly and fully to others, (especially to those who require our <hi>oath</hi> and <hi>subscription,</hi> and undertake to satisfie our consciences thereanent) all the doubts and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which make us unwilling or afraid to give our <hi>subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> thereunto.</p>
