            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>DIdo</hi> was espous'd a virgin
to <hi>Sichaeus;</hi> and both liv'd
happy in their mutuall love, untill
her brother <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> who was then King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> the place of
their abode, by some close treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
slew <hi>Sichaeus</hi> in hopes to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
his great wealth, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of his Wife; All which, her
<pb facs="tcp:35194:4"/>
husbands ghost appearing in her
sleep, discovered; telling her
also where hee had hid a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
treasure, of which <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malion</hi>
knew not. This she took,
and, in the company of such friends
she could best trust, and most hated
the Tyrant; fled from thence to
seeke her fortune in some safer
<pb facs="tcp:35194:4"/>
place. At length arriving on the
shore of <hi>Lybia,</hi> partly for mony,
partly by the favour of some neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Princes,
affected with her
beauty, and the hope to obtaine her
in marriage, shee got possesion of
that ground where the famous Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Carthage</hi> was afterwards
built; whose foundation she had not
<pb facs="tcp:35194:5"/>
only laid, but made some good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
in the structure; when the
wandring Trojan <hi>Aeneas</hi> was by
Tempest Shipwrackt on some
part of her dominion. His great
Fame, good mine, and well rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his story, prevailed so
with her that shee not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
his Ships, and feasted him
<pb facs="tcp:35194:5"/>
and his Company with great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence;
but let him so far into her
affection, That she esteemed him,
(at least did not doubt but to make
him) her husband. When his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
pursuit of other designes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
his sudden Departure, and
her Tragedy.</p>
            <p>This fourth book describing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:35194:6"/>
hir passion, deep sense of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
and hir death, has been
alwayes esteemed the best piece of
the best of Poets; has been translated
into all Languages, and in our days
at least ten times by severall Pens,
into English. It is freely left to
the Reader; which he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35194:6"/>
This was done (all but a very
little) by that incomparable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as well for virtue as wit, Mr.
<hi>Sidney Godolphin</hi> only for his
own divertion, and with lesse
care, then so exact a judgment as
his would have used, if he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it should have ever been
made publick.</p>

Above all Chance. Did not my changelesse vow</l>

Of the enamour'd Queen, whose tender breast</l>

            <l>Cruell and false! didst thou not seek a land</l>

Nor did he in delusive Dreams appear;</l>
            <l>A wake, I did the angry message hear.</l>
            <l>Then fairest Queen do not this fate withstand,</l>

            <l>While thus he talks, the much distempered Dame</l>

            <l>What shall I do? for now alasse, I see</l>
            <l>That neither Juno daignes to favour me,</l>

            <l>But now (for sooth) Apollo's Augury</l>
            <l>The Oracles are urged to incite,</l>

            <l>Is Heaven concern'd? doth care of humane fate</l>

            <l>Thou hearst me not, regardlesse of my cry,</l>

Through the deaf Seas and through the angry Wind,</l>

But fainting soon and to her chamber led</l>
            <l>She threw her self upon her Ivory bed.</l>
            <l>Pious Aeneas, though his noble breast</l>

            <l>But does his fleet without delay prepare.</l>
            <l>The Trojans ply the work, the busie Maine</l>
            <l>Is fill'd with noise, the Ships now float again:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:35194:28"/>
On every side are seen descending down</l>
            <l>Long troops which bring provision from the Town.</l>
            <l>So when the winter-fearing Ants invade</l>
            <l>Some heaps of Corn the Husbandman had made;</l>
            <l>The Sable Army marches, and with prey</l>
            <l>Laden return, pressing the Leafy way,</l>
            <l>Some help the weaker, and their shoulders lend,</l>
            <l>Others the order of the march attend,</l>
            <l>Bring up the troops, and punish all delay.</l>
            <l>What were thy thoughts, sad <hi>Dido,</hi> on that day?</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:35194:29"/>
How deep thy sighs? when from thy Tower above</l>
            <l>Thou seest the Phrygians in such order move</l>
            <l>And hear'st the Tumult of the Clamorous Sea.</l>
            <l>All-conquering Love! who can resist thy sway?</l>
            <l>Once more the Queen to humble tears descends,</l>
            <l>And Language to her grief once more she lends,</l>

            <l>Nor Counsell unexplor'd, before she dy'd.</l>
            <l>Anna, she said, thou seest the peopled Sea,</l>

Ready to loose; I feel their great Chief's scorn</l>
            <l>Which if foreseen I might perhaps have born.</l>
            <l>But now I make this one, this last request,</l>
            <l>You in this faithlesse man have interest</l>
            <l>You know his gentlest times, and best can find</l>
            <l>What wayes are left to mollify his mind.</l>
            <l>Go then and use all Pitty-moving Art</l>
            <l>And if you can soften his harder heart.</l>
            <l>Not I at Aulis, did with Greece conspire</l>
            <l>Nor did I bring one brand to Troy's last fire</l>

I never rent Anchises Honour'd Tomb,</l>
            <l>Why should he then my sad entreaty shun?</l>
            <l>I do not urge (as once) our marriage tyes</l>
            <l>Those sacred bonds which now he does despise,</l>
            <l>Nor that he would fair Italy resigne</l>
            <l>I only aske respite, and breathing time,</l>
            <l>Till my dejected mind learne to comply</l>
            <l>(Taught by degrees) with so great misery.</l>
            <l>¶All this her weeping Sister does repeat</l>

            <l>

Lost here her prayrs and fruit lesse were her tears,</l>
            <l>Fate and great Jove had stop't his gentle Eares.</l>
            <l>As when loud winds a well-grown Oak would rend</l>
            <l>Up by the roots, this way and that they bend</l>
            <l>His reeling Trunk, and with a boisterous sound</l>
            <l>Scatter his leaves and strew them on the ground:</l>
            <l>He fixed stands, as deep his root dothly</l>
            <l>Down to the Center as his top is high.</l>
            <l>No lesse on every side the Hero prest</l>

And down his Cheeks though fruitlesse tears do roul,</l>
            <l>Unmov'd remaines the purpose of his soul.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Dido</hi> urged with approaching fate</l>
            <l>Begins the light of cruell Heaven to hate;</l>
            <l>Her resolution to dispatch and dye</l>
            <l>Confirm'd by many a horrid prodigy.</l>
            <l>The water consecrate for sacrifice</l>

            <l>The wine to putrid bloud converted flows</l>

Besides there stood as sacred to her Lord</l>
            <l>A marble Temple which she much ador'd,</l>

            <l>Hence every night proceeds a dreadfull sound.</l>
            <l>Her husbands voyce invites her to his Tomb</l>
            <l>And dismall Owls presage the ills to come,</l>
            <l>Besides, the prophefies of Wizards old</l>

            <l>Her potent charmes do troubled souls relieve</l>

            <l>Thus speaks the Queen, but hides the fatall end</l>
            <l>For which she doth those sacred rites pretend.</l>
            <l>Nor worse effects of grief her Sister thought</l>
