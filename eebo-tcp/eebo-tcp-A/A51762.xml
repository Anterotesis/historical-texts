            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER</head>
            <p>WHo can now deny, but that there is a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> stampt upon Presbytery, when we have seen such signal <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciae</hi> of it in the Fate and Death of the most Eminent and stontest Assertors of it? We will therefore give it leave to take praecedency of any Schisme of which Blood was never yet drawn. But whether <hi>Sanguis Draconis</hi> or <hi>Sanguis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae Scoticae</hi> be the better Drug, and which will grow fastest, we leave to Dr. <hi>Trig</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have made a Confection or Miscellany out of it at a Venture, and compounded the bitter Ingredients of its Death, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe them you in a Dose of Mirth.</p>
            <p>The first place, as that which operated most, we give deservedly to the Covenant, of a Griping purging quality; most of the Town complain of
<pb facs="tcp:95853:3"/>
its Physick; with groanings and strainings; and they say it never work'd kindly since the Time that Alderman <hi>Atkins</hi> bewrayed the <hi>Militia,</hi> for now it works upwardly in vomits altogether: It is lately torn up by the roots, and hath fetcht such deep sighes, as a Mandrake at its Revulsion; a relation whereof you have in the next pages.</p>
            <p>The next Place the Marquesse of <hi>Arguile</hi> challengeth; this was a Great Doctor and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministerer of the Covenant; we present him to you like a Mountebank on his Scaffold, where he uttered a whole promptuary of Kirk venome &amp; readily swallowed it, wherefore we have next sent this Zany with an Antidote after him.</p>
            <p>If you say 'tis too late, we can assure you from the mouth of a Presbyterian Patriarch, that Death hath no power over a Covenanter, no more then one Gasp can kill a Cat.</p>
            <p>Room for St. <hi>Guthrey,</hi> a name conformable and consonant to the Legend, the precise mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns will make miraeles of him, and save us the labour to tell you how he was hanged.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Giffan</hi> he was but his <hi>Sancho Panca;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95853:3"/>
his story is bound up in this <hi>Quixots;</hi> and so they go together.</p>
            <p>The other Appendix of <hi>Gillespy,</hi> (being like to beare a great influence on these worst and last Times of Presbytery, wherein Scandals and Offences are like to be given by revolts and desertions,) we have subjoyned by way of Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel betwixt the case of him and Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> it being like to be of exceeding use to the unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remnant of giddy Zealots.</p>
            <p>These are the onely Remains of Presbytery, and it cannot but Comfort your Hearts to hear such a word. <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch</hi> of it are hewen down, and in the dead Trunks of these <hi>Furioso's,</hi> it lies still and quiet, and though you laugh never so loud at it, it will never wake and baul again. If there be any whiffling curs that grin and snarle (such of whom it may be said,<hi>—Non quies, non tumultus, quale magni metus, vel magnae irae silentium est,)</hi> they know what Hawks-meat is, at least the worming iron of Pulpit silence will surely cure them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95853:4"/>
To the Honest and Loyall be this a Gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, for the Ultion and Revenge the Lawes and these Happy Times have taken on that <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed Thing,</hi> and so let it go.</p>

               <p>Dear Child, you must know, that you were begot in the night of Confusion, when another <hi>Chaos</hi> was inverting the Order and Course of Things; the Head was not intended to be the chief member, but subordinate to the shoulders of Presbytery, which came into the world with its <hi>heels</hi> forward: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, though the Head resisted, we maintained our Authority, and laid that aside as uselesse and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.

               </p>
               <p>But I know you expect I should say something of my Religion, truly I shall I fear very much disappoint you therein, I have not had time enough to be setled in it, nor have I any foundation whereon to bottom it. The <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> have the Popes Infallibility; The Protestants the 39. Articles, the highest I can derive my self from, is from a provincial Synod, and they have made me a Religion of my self, made up like the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> of <hi>Paganisme, Scotti Schisme,</hi> and some Christianity, and at the best but like <hi>Olivers</hi> Instrument, or <hi>Harry Martins</hi> Descant on the <hi>Rumps</hi> Act of <hi>Oblivion,</hi> which pretended to SAVE all at the beginning, but some in the middle, and none at all in the Conclusion, as wofully appears this day.</p>
               <p>I know there is a claim laid by my faction to the <hi>Geneva</hi> Discipline and Doctrine, I professe I do not own it. Our Presbytery and that is very different, they had no Kings to make experiments on, or to try Jurisdiction and Power with; ours is a Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Presbytery, theirs a more sober Political Church Government; we are but a ranting Schism from them: and therefore dying I speak it, I do not arrogate to my selfe their (though not justified, or so much as approved) Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95853:10"/>
For the Cause of my Death, I can here assign many.</p>
               <p>The first is Natural<hi>—Nullum violentum est per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum,</hi> Nothing can be permanent that is violent, my fury soon wasted and consumed those spirits which might have protracted and prolonged my Fate; no abatement, no respiration allowed in my hast to the ruin of Three Kingdomes, till I had outrun my self and the Constable: though the ingenious justice of that Gentleman, who would have me whipt from Tything man to Tything man, till I came to the place of my Birth, would have delivered me into his hands.</p>
               <p>The second is Divine. I was first shown to the World as a Copy of Gods will to be done and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the new Ordering of the World; I was styled the second Covenant of Grace. A Ray of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; what not? whereas another <hi>Herostratus</hi> was my parent. I frighted the first light that looked on me, till I had driven it into a Gloomy dismal Night, that overcast three Kingdomes; and is it not just with Heaven, I should expiate those false Fires, and that imprecation be heard on me, Let fire come down from Heaven and consume me?</p>
               <p>The third is Political. Laws and Government have made an universal League between Mankind, other compacts are but inclosures of the peaceably enjoyed Common: what a Deluge of Blood did the French Catholick League draw from that Kingdom, that it might have been said to have been a <hi>League with Death,</hi> wherever was any potent Rebellion main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95853:11"/>
without some such Confederation? And the Evils I have done, and the misery I have been the cause of, are little lesse then the most prevailing of them can boast of. 'Tis both security and satisfaction therefore to the Laws, and established Magistracy, solemnly to extinguish these Flames of Sedition by their Justice in lighting me.</p>
               <p>Other Extrinsical causes there were, but being but subservient to these I shall passe them, lest I touch upon some jarring Strings, in the late Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For this Death I forgive all the World, though I expect not to be forgiven. I shall leave such a deep impression in the Ruines of many Families, that it will exceed their Charity, or Times oblivion to blot it out. I am not able to make Restitution, The Crown and the Mitre will be I hope content with the Reversions: Private men must lick the Dishes.</p>
               <p>I carry nothing out of the World with me, and yet must leave something behind me. A stinking name to posterity.</p>
               <p>That justice that condemned me to this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might have been pleased to order a bonefire of all the Presbyterian Books, printed from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Troubles, and its first origine, for the Booksellers could have afforded them for wast paper; but since they saw it not good, I am content with this small <hi>rogus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I leave all my proselytes and adherers in a sad plight. I owe much to them for their ardent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to me; but they have a recompence in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95853:11"/>
in their very conscience, and therefore I am not very solicitous for them. If they will still pine and murmur at my usage, and do as Children for a play thing or bawble, let the Fools even do so.</p>
               <p>I shall not trouble you much longer, Mr. Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, (I have been better attended formerly) I see none but Boys and Prentices (as malicious Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of me, as once of Dr. <hi>Lamb)</hi> whom I cheated of their Holydayes, and therefore I must addresse my self to them.

               <p>One word more to the Publick Faith men, I warn them not to trust to any solemn Juramental Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'tis all one as to credit a Damme Cavalier; It was clearly putting of their money to <hi>Interest,</hi> or the lottery of the <hi>Holy Cheat,</hi> when they advanced such wonderful sums for my <hi>Account.</hi> Nothing was ever lesse meant in this my whole conscientious businesse then repayment, and with this I should wish them to be satisfied.</p>
               <p>I have just done, for I have no prayers to say, the Spirit fails me, this is an <hi>Extempore</hi> punishment; I doubt not of nor need I to ask your Curses, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you are all ready to mount me upwards—Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner stay while I give the sign.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Name of <hi>Smectymnnus</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Pocus,</hi> so be it; I <hi>Archibald</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse of <hi>Argyle,</hi> the Devils Viceroy in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> and the most Sacred <hi>Covenants Protomartyr</hi> in the Low, now a Prisoner in the <hi>Toll Booth</hi> at <hi>Edingbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough;</hi> calling to my mind, that my prefixed bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned terme of years is even expired, and knowing that <hi>all the Town cann't</hi> save <hi>me:</hi> Having recollected all my unparalleld Rebellions, Treasons, Murders, Rapine, Plunderings, Witchcraft, Perjury, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Sacriledge; for which I do expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good Wages at the Hands of my Master, do make and Ordain this my last Will and Testament in manner and form following.</p>
            <p>First, because it is of Form to begin so, I believe with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that Souls do transmigrate, I my self
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95853:13"/>
being that very <hi>Matchiavil</hi> that lived in <hi>Florence</hi> some Two hundred years since; and therefore I will, that mine do forthwith after my Dissolution pass into one of his Wild-soule, thence into a <hi>Soland</hi> Goose, thence into a <hi>Scotch</hi> Pedlar, thence into a Man whom <hi>Lilly</hi> by the Stars prognosticated (some ages to come) to be made a Notorious Cuckold, so that by that means, it may be be sure at last to come to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for my Body (since the Parliament so detest that horrid Babarisme committed on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse of <hi>Montrose,</hi> that they think it not fit to reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate it upon me the prime Author thereof) it being at my own disposal, I request my Executors hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter named, to see it solemnly interred with the <hi>spels</hi> of the Directory, and laid so shallow, that at the next Trump of Sedition, it may by the same raise-Devil Directory be conjured up again, and meet my exalted Head, that Bound mark of Presbytery, its <hi>ne plus Ultra, Hitherto shall you go and no further:</hi> But I forbid then any such superstitious procession, as to my scandal and great offence of the Brethren, was used to the gathered reliques of that late loyal Martyr.</p>
            <p>As for my worldly Goods and Estate with which the Covenant that Goddess <hi>Diana</hi> hath blest me, I say to't <hi>Presto Jupiter,</hi> lightly come, lightly go, the wicked Cavaleirs will divide the spoile; what was got by oppression, will be booned way by the Kings liberality, had mine been a <hi>mean</hi> fortune, it had not probably met with such Extremes. Nevertheless my dear Brethren in affliction, I have also a Portion for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95853:13"/>
you; as I had Time and Opportunity of getting, so I had the wisdome of hiding and concealing, and what I thus preserved, I give and bequeath in manner following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inprimis,</hi> for that great Reverence and Religion I owe to the solemn League and Covenant, I give a Thousand pounds to the Pastors and Ministers of the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> towards the Erecting a Shrine or building a Sanctuary for the Covenant, now perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and driven out of these three Kingdomes; whose sacred ashes (if they can be found) I will also to be there deposited in a golden Urne to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the charge of my Executors.

And I do hereby lovingly request the said Church (since our Kirk hath lost its Keyes) immediately to excommunicate the <hi>London</hi> Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and all other persons whatsoever who have had any hand in burning, or otherwise profaning that most Holy Thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> I give 2000 <hi>l.</hi> more for founding a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Fraternity there, to be Christned by the name of the Society of the Covenant, and for founding a Covenant Reader in that University; hoping that well disposed Presby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <hi>Item,</hi> whereas the sad case of Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> hath mightily affected the tender bowels of the Sisters,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95853:14"/>
who complain there is not a stone by a stone of all his late Purchases, particularly the great loss he hath had by the fire of the Covenant in his Deanery of Wells, to his utter undoing, and for which he is never likely to have a Breif; I bequeath to him the sum of Five hundred pounds, it being a good compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to keep him in <hi>Bedlam</hi> all the remainder of his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> I give to that little <hi>David</hi> of the Covenant that Champion of Presbytery Mr. <hi>Zachary Crofton</hi> an augmentation of an 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> as long St. <hi>Peters Bonds abide;</hi> and that through any discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement or restraint he may not faint and fall away, I add a Noble a day for Caudles and Cordials, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to stand manfully for the cause, he being the cheif Standerd bearer, in which this Impress is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Tu Patronus, si Tu deseris nos Perimus.</hi>

               <hi>Item,</hi> as next in order I give to Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> not out of respect to his love of the Covenant, for Satan that buffeted him knows how weak he is in that point, but for his seditious preachments, for his turbulency of Spirit, and restlesseness against the Kings Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Five hundred pound; I know thats too much, for I detest a Recanter with all my Heart, and 'tis not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our strict Discipline to revoke a Tittle: but seeing how neer the brink Presbytery is brought, all things must be done to support it, and therefore we must make use of <hi>Renega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To the several Sects of <hi>Anabaptists, Fifth Monarchy men, Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. I give respectively Ten

Groats to redeem their Meeting-Houses; in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they do not jeer that Covenant in which they voluntarily perjured themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> All my Offices and Preferments whatsoever, I give freely to those who are disabled to bear any in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> For perpetual memory of Presbytery, I give a Hundred pound for the casting the figure of the dog in Brass that lay with the Elders Maid; to be placed where the last <hi>Provincial Classis</hi> was held in <hi>London,</hi> as a desk for the Directory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To any that can, or shall prove Presbytery to be <hi>jure Divine,</hi> Ile give him Three Kingdomes; for then they will not be worth the Having, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils proffer, and my Legacy, will be all one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> I give to the Wife of <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> for his keeping the Covenant in the right sense by murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King, a Groat a day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> I give to the late Secretary <hi>Thurloe,</hi> my debt due to me from his Master and the <hi>Rump</hi> for moneys expended by me for their use in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was to be repayed me out of the Commission for <hi>Discoveries,</hi> when I was last in <hi>London,</hi> by <hi>Olivers</hi> Direction.

            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> I give my Debentures to Captain <hi>George Withers</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> to purchase more Bishops Lands in lieu of those he sacrilegiously kept before: &amp; that he may never cease scribling of Rhymes, Ile not leave him a farthing.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95853:15"/>
               <hi>Item,</hi> I give to the Independant Gathered Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches under the cure and teachings of <hi>Cockain, Brooks,</hi> &amp;c. all the ill qualities of our gasping Kirk, that by the impudence and deceit of their Pastors, their ruine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so may be expedited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> I give to the Clerk of Mr. <hi>Calamies</hi> Church a Ring to wear for my sake, for his great Superlative zeal yet manifested to the Covenant—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To all the Sons and Daughters of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, who now mourn and lament, I give a Medal (with my squint Eyes in it leering after other times, and a better day) to dry up their tears.</p>
            <p>All these Legacies and Bequests, I will and order my Executors to perform and pay the morrow of the next Puritan Rèformation in <hi>England,</hi> or at St. <hi>Tibs Eve</hi> at farthest, without any Covin or delay.</p>
            <p>As for mine own Country, Relations, and Friends; I do also dispose of my Estate to them, as followeth.</p>
            <p>I will therefore first that the whole <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation be put into mourning in remembrance of those ruines, dishonour, conquest, and slavery, which my Covenanting covetous designes have brought upon it; though I would not have my Brethren of the Presbytery lay that so much to heart, as that they are like to do so no more.</p>
            <p>As to my Sept so famous heretofore in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as I never did them good in my life so they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect otherwise at my Death, they have a <hi>Scotch</hi> Priviledge now to beg or steal where they please, without any frustraneous dependance or expectance on my greatness; if my name will do them any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95853:16"/>
they may make use of it and sterne, <hi>since they are I fear rejected of God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To my dear Lady I give and bequeath her full and entire Joynture, which was setleed firm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough by Law before thanking her for all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and benevolence I had from her, when my kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was out of the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To my hopeful Son the Lord <hi>Lorne</hi> I give the inheritance of my qualities, leaving him an equal portion and share of Estate and Honour; the first I forfeited from him, and the last he never had from me, nor is like to be capable of, since he must conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and preserve my hated nature: I give him my unnecessary blessing, as it is prescribed in that most exact sorm in the Directory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To the rest of my Sons and Daughters, since I cannot be too indulgent a Father, I advise them for their great Consolation to read the <hi>Spanish</hi> Curate, and take what portions they please.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To all my Servants and Retainers, who I doubt not have learnt from me their Master to carve for themselves without bidding; all they can cheat and purloyne from mine Estate as well as from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, besides my pronsim of Oat-meale for their lives, and Hemp for their Deaths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To my Vassals of my Seignory, I give their long desired Freedome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To the Poor of my Parish, for every Curse they give me, the sum of 000.</p>
            <p>And I do make and ordain my loving and intimate friends, <hi>Archibald Johnson,</hi> Lard <hi>Wareston,</hi> and <hi>William</hi>

            <p>All this I ratifie and confirm by the mysteries of the stool of Repentance, on which I devoutly set my breech, and having done sealed it with a—</p>
            <p>And I do hereby revoke all former Wills by me made, as not being framed according to that Holy Pattern of the Covenant, from which under Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no man may recede a Tittle; and which I will further to be cut in brasse and laid upon my Tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</p>

            <p>SO many remarkable accidents, such alterations of Government, Affairs of such moment and intrigues of State, do fall in with this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses memoires, that it will rather seem a History then a Character to speak him out. His Birth rendred him very Noble, and his Education proffered him the advantage of making it Nobler, though for that he was beholding to the first Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest of the Times, being by his late Majesty to oblige him from the Rebellion then on foot, created a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess. He was of Stature something exceeding the mean, like his own Country-men the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> with a biggness proportionable to it, his Face some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long, his Cheeks wide, the haire of his Beard red, his Eyes very much a squint, so that he was

A most Dexterous Artist in that prime quality of a <hi>Scot,</hi> Dissimulation, which was the ground work of all the Exploits he did after. If ever he seemed what he was (though that be not to be over-believed) 'twas in the matter of the Covenant, which he entred into so eager and resolutely, and left it and the world toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so confidently and avowedly; and yet the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle agreed with neither, when in the Crisis of the sincerity, Honesty, and Loyalty of that Libel which it so highly boasted of, as to the maintenance of the Kings Person Dignity and Authority; by this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses Counsel, his late Majesty was delivered into the Hands of the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Newcastle.</hi> But it is most Evident, that the right spelling of Covenant is Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, and according to that he very well kept it, having shared a good part of that 200000 <hi>l.</hi> given the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army for their departure. He was as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satile as a Dy, and like that sometimes, was plaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with very lucky hands (as those times were) and was every way as square, stood firm on his own

               </gap>nely careless and at a great distance (though he hurried up to <hi>London</hi> to wait on His Majesty) and then bound him fast, that he could have no liberty to assume any other shape then what he was then found in (being denied accesse or audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at Court) he might have been a riddle still, whereas now Death hath resolved Him.

He was a great Fomenter of war, yet cared not at all to endanger himself, like the Monkey that took the Cats foot to pull the Chesnut out of the fire, nor was he much to be blamed, having been by the Marquess of <hi>Montrosse</hi> so often put to shift (and that narrowly too) for his life: what he wanted of the generosity of a War<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

His Speeches at his Tryal (which were said to have been spoken <hi>ex tempore,</hi> because they would not allow him his delays, but compelled him to present an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer) are very grave and sententious, yet polite and very cunning. He was a deep Lawyer and was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Lord Cheif Justice, I think not much taxed for bribery (for I take all their Lands, Estates, and whatever <hi>Scotland</hi> is worth not to be worth a Suite, much lesse the overplus of a Greazing) yet all this while a bad nature predominated, like stinking Oyle upon generous Wine; his potentiality to vertue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exerted it self, while his vices were most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and boyant. It is a truth undenyable that he died unpitied of all men, and the reason was this, the universality and complication of his vices could miss no mans eyes, and for one fault or other so many single observations hit him, as drew a general <hi>Odium</hi> upon him; Excepting onely the Presbyterian Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, who alwayes had a particular respect for him, not from any other inducement but the necessity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, the Kirk rides while the Lords hold the reines, and keep that people under the Tyranny of that worse then <hi>Turkish</hi> Government. He was the first Promoter of the Discipline, and that with an Earnestness extraordinary, wherein no doubt he served himself principally, and the large demeasnes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95853:19"/>
he died possest of, will evidence, what religion he was of, and how beneficial a thing <hi>Reformation</hi> is to the first Projectors. He was at <hi>feud</hi> with all his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in <hi>Scotland</hi> as well as his Peers; of four Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses he procured the execution of three; <hi>viz.

He was a profound Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of a fine Mercurial spirit, of whom it may be said dis-junctively, what his late Majesty said of the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> He was su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h a Minister of State, that he might well be ashamed of himself; and his Prince as rightly fear him. There was nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him but Loyalty and Honesty, two such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable things with Presbytery, that they could hardly be afforded roome in their Morals for one whole age together; but it had been direct Blaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to blend and incorporate them into their religion, however, for specious pretence sake they crept into the Covenant He was a most indefatigable carrier on of his Designes, and that with very great expedition, though his motions were eccentrick, but all turbulent, and violent efforts are usually very sudden: He thrice repaired, and recruited his broken Forces by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Montrosse,</hi> before there could be any thought of an Enemy from him. He was never discouraged
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95853:19"/>
with any disappointment, but he would set the Kirk to thunder out <hi>Anathema's,</hi> and himself made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions and levies together, fight with the Pen and the Sword at one and the same time: but his Escripts were not <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> Commentaries, but <hi>C. Marius</hi> his publications and Sentencings, betwixt whom there is in many things a neer Parallel.</p>
            <p>To take a neerer view of him and put him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was absolutely Master of all the Arts of State; it were no injury to him to say it was his religion, since the great successes of rebellion led him to a firm beleif that there was nothing but what was manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by, and feasible to Policy. But he so mixt them both in his affairs that it was not easily discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to which he owed most; by the first he secured his Interest, and had not the excesses of the <hi>English</hi> usurpation out-run him, probably advanced his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes to that which <hi>Hamilton</hi> was suspected of; by the other he procured an awe and reverence to himself, being vogued up by the Clergy, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the Vulgar as a Pattern of Piety and zealous promoter of Godliness, till such time as the vizor of the specious Reformation was laid aside, and bold fac'd Interest outstared the impudency of the Kirk, and made them veile to, and worship the Devil they had raised.</p>
            <p>In a word he was the right <hi>Antithesis</hi> to that Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Marques of <hi>Montrosse,</hi> so that whoever read or hath heard of his Excellencies, may by opposition know the vileness of this.

               <hi>Extremes</hi> should ballance one another: otherwise it had been a most hard fate for <hi>Scotland</hi> (who can impute her dishonour and total Conquest to name originally but <hi>Arguile)</hi> to have produced no Renowned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son his Contemporary, such as was <hi>Montrosse,</hi> whose Glories and Fame may fill up his Chasmes in their History.</p>

               <p>BRother the Time is Come that we must glorify Presbytery in, and therefore I would have you to cloath your self with resolution like as in a plad, that our Ends may be like Heroick to the righteous Royalists, whom we sent before us in this way.</p>

               <p>I doubt we are not so well appointed, but sure we that durst do any thing, may dare to die, and therefore, good Father Confessor, give me your blessing that I may be armed with all the Kirk Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and store necessary for this Expedition.</p>

               <p>I am to seek my self, the perplexities of my cause, and the treachery of a revolting party have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the staggers; but I will muster up and summon all the confidence of my life past to bear up with at my <hi>Exit.</hi>

               <speaker>Giff.</speaker>
               <p>My crimes are complicated and of a larger Extent then yours, and yet I doubt not but by the dram of the bottle and your good Example, to face it out rarely.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gut.</speaker>
               <p>Well said, for who would pule, and sneak now; that ought to have been done before, when some favour might have been expected from it. The Kirk will Canonize us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Giff.</speaker>
               <p>Besides what Presbyterian is he that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire life longer then he may have his will? we should die of the sullens, if we were not offered this brave advantage; but you must tell me what I must say, when I come to it, in honour of the Cause, and by what Epithete I shall stile it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gut.</speaker>
               <p>Our Case is novel, and there was never any thing said before by any in our Condition upon this subject, save what was lately held forth by <hi>Arguile,</hi> most cunningly: now it is not requisite for you and me to be so modest or mealy mouthed, but we will bounce up the Covenant.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Giff.</speaker>
               <p>Sir I am pretty well armed already, but if you teach me not now, when you have had so much time to digest it into a method, I shall shame you, and that will be little for your credit.</p>

               <p>Presbytery in a method! I tell you you must rave at randome, never speak any thing appositely but what is direct treason, that you may be plainly understood, tis for our Brethren of <hi>England</hi> who yet are troubled with <hi>little</hi> learning and <hi>great</hi> benefices, to speak indifferently.</p>

               <p>That will not advantage me or you, there's a consecrated place in the Market within the lines of Communication where we must expire, and Ile trouble the Devil no longer, I wont go a foot fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, here we began and here we will end.</p>

               <p>Well then, first you must look as grim, and sowre as Varges, speak not a pleasing word to any of the Officers about you; when you have thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed your self, then you must with some vehement indignation declare and declaime against the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness and loose living of the Times, where you must by no meanes take any notice of the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration, and his return to his Kingdoms and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, unless a thing offer it self, wherein you

               <speaker>Gif.</speaker>
               <p>I think there's no necessity of laughter on any side, but I am sure there will be grinning on both; but I shall never know how to bring a story in so artificially.</p>

               <p>If you know but any Common places of raillery, Envy, Calumnations, lies, forgeries or other, stick not to lay them on soundly, you know the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian rule<hi>—Calumniare fortiter, aliquid haerebit</hi> with such loud reproachful Accusations the Puritans first began their designes against Church and State.</p>

               <p>Then you must set forth the Excellency of our Way, by shewing what a blessed change was wrought upon the people of the Nation since the Covenant was taken, and what signal tokens there were of approbation of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Giffan.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gut.</speaker>
               <p>O yes, thats the cream of the jest, you must own this as the greatest indulgence of Providence in the world, it being an Evident proof of the grouth of Presbytery; now it comes to be watered by the blood of its Martyrs; 'twas before a dry Plant, and cannot reckon one drop spilt before on it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gif.</speaker>

            <sp>

               <p>You must understand our Modern Synods make no distinction betwixt the Cause and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Martyrdome for Presbytery, if the Covenant be objected against you in observing any the least scruple thereof, either by sacriledge, Rebellion, or other ways—I can assure you, you die their Martyr.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gif.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I must clap in a word, I do not see our case to be much different from his, and I begin to coole, my Heart blood flutters and quakes, pray tell me what distinction the Modern Synods have made in this case.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>I see you are carnal and consult with Flesh and Blood, I spoke those last words of him, as an Independent, one whom the Kirk had cast off and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, alass! we have delivered them to Satan ever since our Project failed in <hi>England,</hi> they are no more to us then <hi>Portugal</hi> to the Papacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> or a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to a Papist.</p>

               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>I confess they did follow our pattern a long time, but it was with a designe to spoil our copy, and they supplanted us by the same artifice we used, a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95853:23"/>
greater seeming austerity of life and conversation; now I must deal ingenuously, what ever they did else was conformable enough to what we hold forth, but rivals and competitors were not endurable.</p>

               <p>In short, I think you were all one, for I can guess shrewdly by my self; after I had once taken the Covenant, (like a man who looks for no dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the midst of the mire) I cared not what I undertook, through thick or thin. To swear for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was the next Employment to a Knight of the Post. I supposed we did not stretch forth our hands in vain; so like other folks, I laid my clutches on what ever I met; and to you my Confessor may I tell, I <hi>stretcht</hi> out my hand (by my consent and approbation, for you must know I aim'd at preferment) against my lawful Soveraign.</p>

I preacht that Doctrine in effect some years before it was perpetrated, I thank God my <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Conscience</hi> had never the least Compunction in the world for it. I have got into such a traine of it, that if it had not been for that Anti-christian Fashion of Arch-bishop <hi>Laud</hi> to make a Sermon at my death. I would have preacht a Sermon on that Subject.

            <p>WHereas I <hi>Patrick Gillespy,</hi> Presbyter, being convened before the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and the Lord Commissioner his Grace, and there charged in due process with several Treasonable and seditious speeches and papers against his Majesties Person, Family, Authority, and Government, of which I ought justly to stand convict, the said crimes being manifestly found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivant against me; yet through the undeserved cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of my Judges having obtained leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and consult with my self, they desiring if by any means possible to reclaim or dispossess a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian spirit; do in satisfaction to their Lordships, and out of a pressing fear of Death ensuing, most humbly recant and retract (saving to my self alwayes a power if occasion serve to deny them again) these following Errours, and dangerous Tenets.</p>
            <p>First, Whereas I have Dogmatically and avowed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95853:25"/>
taught that Princes if they will not be ruled tby he Kirk, and in all things conform themselves to their dictates, as being his Supream, and a power ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over him, might by the said Holy Kirk be bound and manacled, or more plainly, imprisoned and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and finally put to death. I do now truely and unfeignedly relinquish that fond Opin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, begot in me by the Excess of our Lordly Domination over his present Majesty, (as also the necessitated condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his glorious Father) when with us in <hi>Scotland</hi> 1650, my eyes through the multiplied terrours of Death, seeing as through a glass the manifold danger of that Principle: the rather for that the gude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Scotland</hi> will daunce no longer after our pipe; when we thought the <hi>Circe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> incantations and charms of our Kirk had transfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> and alienated them into Everlasting rebellion. I do therefore heartily and resolvedly abjure that Doctrine, which I know will never be believed again in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the danger of being next inslaved, whereas they scape for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s time, by being but conquered. And this I do infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by reason of State, not complying altogether with it in my Conscience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas I have often declared in the Pulpit, that God had rejected his present Majesty, together with his Family; for not owning the Hand of Providence against him, but pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sting in the steps of his Ancestors, who were Enemies to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I do freely confesse from my heart, that I never thought of his restauration by any visible means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; and it was so farre from the intendments of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95853:25"/>
this Kirk, either to advance or defend him, that we would have made an Easier bargain of him then of his Father, had a Chapman offered in time: and (as learned <hi>Coke,</hi> I mean the High Court of Justice Solicitor said in the very same case, for his life also) since it was <hi>crimen Avaritiae non malitiae,</hi> covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness not cruelty, I pray your Lordships do not put a greedy Presbyter to repent of that. And yet I will make bold a little further with your patience, while I repeat in an humble and submisse reverence, what a great Rabby of our way in <hi>England,</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi>
               </note> and advantagiously said for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a most curious Petition to the Rump of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> in the same words <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis mutandis,</hi> about Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> business.</p>
            <p>I shall omit the Title as no way serving my design, having declared already the Powers to whom it was addrest.</p>

                  <p>THat your Petitioner being deeply sensible of your high displeasure into which by some late actings he is unawares fallen, hath made a greater research after the mind of God in these late dispensations of his Providence in the great Curns and Changes of State in this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and is therein wholly convinced, that all Powers are of God, and that He both dispose of them according to his own good will and pleasure, that he is also satisfied and convinced, that no person may presume under Damnation to resist or withstand the said powers.</p>

And whereas your Petitioner, by several fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures of obedience to this Authority p'aced over him by God, is become obnorious to your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and that accordingly he is to be tryed for the same, and unlesse your mercy mediate, and prevent the Sentence, is like to suffer the severity of your just indignation.</p>
                  <p>Your Petitioner in all humility prostrates himself before you, beseeching you favourably to remit his offences, he engaging to live in all due obedience to your Government, and to pray for the prosperity and continuance thereof</p>

            <p>This so well succeeded, that upon the return of those rotten members by <hi>Lamberts</hi> resurrection to their place, and possession of the power again, he was the onely man thought fit to preach the congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sermon, which he did very gravely and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thankfully remembring their bringing him from life to Death, to see a like miracle for them in that their happy day: And why may not I, my Lord, be such an Honest godly Convert, if you please to try me but this once.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas it is objected and proved against me, that neither during the Time his Majesty was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor since, I did ever so much as mention his Majesty, (unlesse with bitter taunts and reflections) in my Prayers, nay, have wholly discontinued pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him after his defeat at <hi>Worcester,</hi> besides my discontented preachments, since his return to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95853:26"/>
I do freely acknowledge, that what I did was by the major vote of my fellow Remonstrants, and in obedience to the usurping <hi>English,</hi> whom in all Kirk policy and reason, and the general practise of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>England</hi> (ever since 1642 when the warre began, where they prayed for the King as Gamesters for ill Dice, with <hi>Curse ye Meroz,)</hi> we were forced to comply-with, even in our private devotions; so fear'd we were that any body, nay God Alinighty himself should hear us to speak for the King. I must indeed herein acknowledge my weakness, for I cannot but confesse, that if we did not then excommunicate him 'twas because we thought the <hi>English</hi> Sectaries would not thank us, who were able enough to shut him out of this Kingdome without our Keyes. As for my malapertnesse since his restitution, I humbly pray your Lordship to consider, how many inveterate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases are grown upon Presbytery in its declining age; Crazinesse and Testinesse are inseparable companions of it now, as madnesse, rashnesse and hot zeal gave life and being to't. But if your Lordships suspect me incurable, deal with me as favourably as the <hi>English</hi> have done to <hi>Philip Nye,</hi> and I will learn and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to frame my mouth (with him) to the thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings of secret murmurs, whispers, obloquies and reproaches against the State and Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> whereas I stand charged with procuring and inciting the Parliament of this Kingdome, then sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Edinborough,</hi> to take away the lives of the Marquesse <hi>Montrosse,</hi> and those other Gentlemen then prisoners with him; and that I did dispitefully,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95853:27"/>
and maliciously traduce the memories of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons after their death. As I cannot deny it, so I will not nor cannot make any defence to it: if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </hi> was <hi>Satia te sanguiue,</hi> and whose inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletible cruelties have murdered more in one age, then all the Tyrannies in the Christian world have done in Twenty; you will find my particular case, like to one in a Contagion, I did that in the height of the infection; for then the Tokens were on us, and we came to present destruction. A general ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy and fury seized us, and we kill'd and slew those persons in our rage, whose courage, conduct and Loyalty might haved the Kingdome. My Lords, you have <hi>Confitentem reum</hi> to this Particular. And so I say no more to it.</p>
            <p>To all the rest of the charge exhibited against me, as refractorinesse, rebellion, the businesse of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I appear before your Lordships with a clear and cleansed stomach to confesse them, I have vomited up the Covenant, and have purged out the Remonstrance; I am swept clean, and if your mercy enter not speedily, the seven deadly Devils of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery will soon return, and I shall be worse then I was at first. Therefore I say make sure of me, lest like my Brother <hi>Crofton,</hi> I say one thing to night by way of submission, and the next morning boggle at it again, like an old Womans arse at no Certainty. Just, just now I am in the humour, if you let this cold fit go off me, and remove the Death-Head, I shall unsay all again, and then the <hi>London</hi> Elders will boast
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95853:27"/>
wonderfully, and some other fools will plague you with my Example here, as well as some there, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be sure you record it, that there may be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception against the verity of it, when ever I may have the opportunity of reneging.</p>
