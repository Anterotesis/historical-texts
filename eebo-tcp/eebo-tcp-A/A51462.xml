            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ad you told me of the late ſtorm of Thunder and Lightning that kill'd a Shepherd or the wonderful inundation of waters, that endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd a little Child, you had not fri hted me half ſo much, as this new and unexpected A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum againſt the <hi>Papists:</hi> You tell me <hi>His Majeſty</hi> (upon the Petition of thoſe who were not like to be denyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has baniſhed all their Prieſts: You tell me a Bill has been read in the Houſe of Commons and is committed, to renew againſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104467:3"/>
the Layity all the former penal Lawes, and adde more, even to the taking away their Children, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Why, what evil have they done? they fought daily with us in the field, and none laid hands on them but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms enemies; they kill'd indeed, in a juſt and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable War, ſome that call'd themſelves <hi>Saints,</hi> but none but ſuch as we call <hi>Rebels.</hi> Whence then ſhould all this anger come? 'tis not from jealouſie, nor intereſt, nor policy, nor all theſe together; but from ſome ſtrange unhappy conjuncture, which I know not how to name; and therefore without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on an event ſo wholly unlike the cauſes that were laid for it, I ſhall ſeldom look backwards to what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have done and ſuffer in theſe late calamiies; a thing ſo evident, it need not be mentioned, nor can be denyed; but chiefly conſider what they now are in reference to hereafter. I ſee the noiſe of their complaints is not heard in the ſtreets, but generally they take their miſchances with ſilence; which as I eſteem for a generous and manly vertue where e're I find it, ſo I cannot but freely expreſſe to you my thoughts in ſo ſingular and preſſing an occaſion.</p>
            <p>We fear, ſay you, <hi>the growth of Popery,</hi> and to that fear you aſcribe the proceeding againſt the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> but muſt we therefore abſolutely ruine them? Is there no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt checking a Tree that is ſpread not too far, and utterly extirpating it root and branch? Is it not enough to ſee them in a ſhade of the private life, and deny them the fruitful ſhowers of rich Offices, but we muſt ſuck the ſap out of their hearts, and leave them to wither away by degrees, and dye?</p>
            <p>Beſides, when the grounds of ſuch a ſuſpition are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly examined, they will certainly be found too week to ſuſtain ſo heavy a ſeverity: For to omit the pious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, That we are ſecure enough by the nature of our Cauſe, and the protection of our God; we have ſenſible and humane Reaſons, (which many ſooner believe) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from plain and evident experience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104467:3"/>
Are not the <hi>Papiſts</hi> tolerated in divers parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> where the <hi>Reformation</hi> is Maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet they grow not? Is not the <hi>Reformation</hi> it ſelf, which has ſo many advantages o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Popery,</hi> tolerated in <hi>France,</hi> and yet it grows not? In <hi>Holland,</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and generally in all Countries where they live mingled together, they ſtand as it were at a certain mark, and ſeldom overflow; but like the Sea, if they gain on one ſide, they loſe as much on another.</p>
            <p>I know what ſoyl your Countrey is made of, but as I think we love our Religion as well as our Neighbours, ſo I'm confident our Reformation is ſo much more rational then <hi>Theirs,</hi> that we have far leſſe cauſe to apprehend any change or defection than they: They fear it not in their Laws, they find it not in their practices; why ſhould we alone enter into unneceſſary ſuſpitions, to the diſcredit both of our Religion, while we declare by our proceedings that it needs the prop of force to ſupport it; and of our Policy, while by chaſing ſome from home, and diſcouraging others abroad, we diminiſh the wealth and proſperity of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Let us open our eyes, and look on the wiſeſt of our Neighbours, and ſee how moderately they proceed in matters of Conſcience, and how notably they thrive and improve by their moderation.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly at firſt, when Liberty is newly given, ſome num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who now conceal, may diſcover themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but after the firſt Run, the reſt will ſtand firm and be more unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this, when all's conſidered, may prove the ſafer courſe, to ſeparate ſuch as diſſemble from among the cordial Profeſſors: However, 'tis time enough to prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, when we ſee the increaſe grow really dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
            <p>In the preſent ſtate of our affairs, the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ſeem ſo far from dangerous, that they rather are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly uſeful. The Nation we ſee is divided into four Parties, <hi>Proteſtant, Roman Catholick, Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Fanatick.</hi> And were there now a War to begin, we might eaſily gueſs which of theſe four would likelyeſt agree, by remembring which of them agreed in the War that's ended. If we think the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104467:4"/>
               <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> would again aſſiſt the right way, why do we ſo terrible diſcourage them? If we beleive them loyal (as we have found them by the beſt Argument, <hi>Experience)</hi> why ſhould we ſo diminiſh them, that we make them incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Were it not more ſuitable to our true intereſt, ſo far to ſuffer them as they are neceſſary to counterballance one ſort of our diſcontented Neighbours, and then we ſhould eaſilier ſecure our ſelves againſt the other? Can we forget a Trick ſo lately paſſed upon us? Firſt, they cried out againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as if they were Traytors, till they had diſabled them: Then, againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as if they were <hi>Papiſts,</hi> till they had maſtered them: Then, againſt every one that would not rebel, till they had ruin'd all.</p>
            <p>'Twas a ſhrewd word, and very true, in our Country, of him that ſaid, I have obſerv'd few of the <hi>fighting Cavaliers</hi> ſpeak againſt the <hi>Papists.</hi> I'm ſure we (of my Noble Lord of <hi>Newcastles</hi> Army) know well enough their conſtant Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; we fought and fell together, we freely ventured our lives for one another, and in all occaſions, that might any way conduce to our Princes ſervice, we perfectly agreed, and little thought, if it had pleaſed God to have given us ſucceſs, to exclude them wholly from ſharing in the benefit.</p>
            <p>Were we all one in Religion, 'twere certainly beſt for peace, but if ſuch Union be once become impoſſible, then let the Maſter-Religion be eſtabliſht; and for the Reſt, the more ſorts of them there are, the more ſafely they are govern'd: Should now the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Fanatick</hi> be ſuppreſt; the Civil Intereſt would be more endanger'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we overcom the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> too, which will be a harder task, when by the disbanding of others, they are grown more numerous. Two Factions in a Common-wealth are deſperately dangerous, but twenty not at all; unleſſe they conſpire into Two, which is not ſo eaſily done, as they who originally are no more. However, that evidently is the dangerous number, ſince none elſe is dangerous till they come to that.</p>
            <p>If the preſent <hi>Papiſts</hi> be too few to be fear'd, what need we puniſh thoſe who now are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> leſt they ſhould grow
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104467:4"/>
hereafter ſo many as to be fear'd? Is it not enough to lay penalties on ſuch as ſhall turn to them for the future? If to preſerve the peace be our intention, and that cannot be moleſted by thoſe of the Roman communion, as now it ſtands, let us but ſhut the door that no more enter in, and we are ſafe, without pulling down the Houſe on the heads of thoſe that are there already.</p>
            <p>I cannot deny but I'm thus far Popiſhly affected, that I willingly converſe with a Papiſt, if he be a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> and heartily love a Cavalier, though he be a Papiſt: this is my character, and I'm not a jot aſham'd to own it. Shew me a <hi>Papist</hi> that took the <hi>Covenant;</hi> or fought againſt the King, and I'le hate him worſe then a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> ſo much care I for their Religion: but when I find many of them civil and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and well-bread perſons, why ſhould I decline their Company? When I find all of them true, and earneſt, and conſtant Cavaliers, why ſhould I hate their Perſons? All this I ſee may eaſily be done, without either approving their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or diminiſhing my own: Eſpecially ſince the moſt eminent Divines of <hi>England</hi> allow the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, from whence they acknowledge to derive their <hi>Orders;</hi> wherein they agree that both ſalvation may be had, and all fundamentals are profeſt; which I believe they will not ſay of any other Diſſenters in this Nation; I'me ſure, if they ſay it, they cannot maintain it, till they have anſwered this Argument.</p>
            <p>No true Church without true Paſtors: No true Paſtors without true Ordination: No true Ordination without true Biſhops: Therefore, where there are no Biſhops, there's nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordination, nor Paſtors, nor Church.</p>
            <p>Thus clearly to my eye, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> differ from <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and the reſt, not in circumſtantials onely, but in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials; they differ as Church and no Church; which is a far grater diſtance then between <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Papiſt.</hi> This ſingle conſideration has often made me wonder why we ſhould ſo violently perſecute the <hi>Papiſt</hi> with the uncouth names of <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> and, which is worſe, with the churliſh actions of <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104467:5"/>
and quartering them only for taking Orders from the ſame Church from whence we derive our own: And all this while we kindly call our other Neighbours Brethren and pray for our Siſter-Churches beyond the Seas; who yet are ſo far from having <hi>One</hi> Mother with us, that our ſelves ſay they have <hi>None</hi> at all?</p>
            <p>Are then the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> no Church? are all the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> in <hi>France, Germany, Holland,</hi> and even <hi>Geneva</hi> it ſelf, no Church? I refer you to the Argument; the Concluſion perhaps may be unwelcom; but the Premiſes, I doubt are unavoidable. If no Governors, there can be no Governed, and if neither of Thoſe, there can be no Community; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſpeak of ſpiritual or civil Communities. Only ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when we would reckon up our numbers to croſs-bite the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> (who for the ſame purpoſe will count the <hi>Greeks</hi> their Brethren) we let all ſorts of <hi>Reformers</hi> paſſe the Muſter for <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> a kind of <hi>pia fraus</hi> to ſuſtain reputation, and bear up the hearts of the People, and have ſomwhat to ſay to an Adverſary.</p>
            <p>Whether upon this Reaſon, or ſome other, I know not, but I obſerve our graveſt Preachers, and our learnedſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters generally affirm, that We puniſh the <hi>Papiſts</hi> not for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> but for <hi>Treaſon.</hi> Sure we muſt not mean their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is <hi>Treaſon,</hi> for then we plainly contradict our-ſelves, while we ſay we puniſh them for <hi>Treaſon,</hi> not <hi>Religion;</hi> if at the ſame time we make them but two Names for one Thing.</p>
            <p>What is then their Treaſon? Either their Actions; and let all that are guilty dye without mercy, without ſo much as the leaſt ſyllable of benefit by the Act of Oblivion; let them all be hang'd, and drawn, and quarter'd, and none be found to pity them; onely let our Juſtice not be blind, and puniſh the Innocent with the Criminal; but the Soul that ſins, let that dye. Or elſe their Opinions are Treaſonable: And then let the Opinions be firſt ſingled out, and either publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't, or the Maintainers proceeded againſt with what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty you pleaſe. But, if their Religion (that is, their Faith, not their Opinions,) be clear from the charge of Treaſon,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104467:5"/>
let us honeſtly ſtand to our Principles, and no longer, upon that account, puniſh them as Traitors.</p>
            <p>Well, though they now have approved themſelves good Subjects, yet time has been when they were not ſo. But ſhall we not ceaſe to puniſh, when they ceaſe to deſerve it? Shall we not take off their Fetters when they do well, as willingly as we laid them on when they did ill? Nay, ſhall we charge them with new and heavier chains now they have given us ſuch evidence of their conſtant Loyalty? even <hi>Bedlams</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſet at liberty, when we ſee they are returned to their wits. We know all have ſuffered long for the crimes of a few; Why may they not hope as well to be indulged now for the Loyalty of many. Time too has been, when others were no good Subjects, and that within the memory even of young men; but the gracious clemency of <hi>His Majeſty</hi> has buried all in <hi>Oblivion;</hi> and may all treaſonous Rebellions, of what Sect or Faction ſoever, be eternally buried, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver riſe again to moleſt us, either in our duty to our <hi>King,</hi> or charity to one another.</p>

Diſcovery, and you'l find the number of their chief Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to be about a dozen, and all the forces they could levy, ſay our Hiſtories, were not full fourſcore. Now if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the multitude of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> who faithfully ſerv'd our <hi>Gracious King,</hi> and his <hi>Royal Father,</hi> we ſhall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee how far more apt they are to adhere to their Prince, then rebel againſt him. Read then the death even of thoſe few deſperate men, and you'l find they heartily repented, at leaſt, moſt of them: Read all their Hiſtory, the fouleſt that ever that Party was concern'd in, and I am confident, though you'l continue your juſt indignation againſt thoſe who were Traytors, yet your anger will be allay'd towards the reſt that were Innocent; at leaſt, all Revenge will be ſatisfied, when you have conſidered how long, and how uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally that one crime of a few deſperate men has been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht. Miſtake me not, I would not have ſo great a Crime for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but I think it belongs to Chriſtian charity, that the greateſt ſhould at laſt be forgiven. Can there be imagined a more deteſtable Treaſon then that againſt our late gracious Sovereign, in which, though Juſtice take care to conſerve the memory, yet mercy already has pardoned the Offenders.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but remember ſome paſſages among us, that keep alive our animoſities, and certainly have more of humour in them, then ingenuity. We call the <hi>Papists Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> and yet fear their <hi>Subtilty:</hi> We cry out of the <hi>Foggy Myſts,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian darkneſs</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and at the ſame time, rail againſt their <hi>Prieſts and Jeſuits,</hi> as <hi>Crafty Foxes,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Vineyard of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> If they write openly, we ſay, they grow inſolent: If privately, they ſeek to ſurpriſe us: If they <hi>ſay</hi> nothing at all, we ſuſpect they are plotting to <hi>do</hi> the more. Even ſince the late Proclamation for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Prieſts, a Friend of mine told me he heard this cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Dilemma</hi> made uſe of. If many go away, then there were many here, and it was time to look to them: If few, then the more are left behind, and ſtill we muſt have a care of them: If they complain they are afflicted, we ſay, they are Male-contents; if they take all with patience, we ſay they are well enough now, if they can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.

Nay, ſo croſly we interpret one another, that, to my amazement, I have heard ſome zealous Diſcourſers affirm, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were guilty of all our Diviſions in Religion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſtriving ſtill to ſhew that our Principles lead to Divſion. Which if it be true, is no Crime in them at all; If falſe, let us labour to diſprove it; they who diſcover the conſequences of inconvenient Maximes, are not too blame: but they who ſet up thoſe <hi>Maximes.</hi> Therefore me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks our better play in this point is, firſt to prove the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> in an errour, and then the union and unchangeableneſſe they ſo much boaſt of, will be the greateſt Objection againſt them; ſince ſuch union makes an errour apt to deceive; and ſuch fixedneſs makes it impoſſible to be mended: Whereas our variety has this advantage, that ſome may be in the right, while others are in the wrong; and if to day we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, to morrow we may correct it.</p>
            <p>Other accuſations we too haſtily impoſe on them, which none but Fools and Bedlams would be guilty of: As, that whoever is in power and prevails and rules, they ſtill oppoſe him; And therefore, at firſt they were againſt the all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding-long-half-lower-Houſe; then againſt <hi>Oliver:</hi> then againſt the <hi>Rump:</hi> Now, againſt the <hi>King:</hi> Thus ſome among us ſtill ſeek to make it be believed, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are alwayes againſt the governing Powers, onely that the governing Powers may be alwayes againſt them. Sure, if all be true we ſay of them, our Engliſh <hi>Papiſts</hi> are a ſtrange race of people, every kinde of <hi>Reformer</hi> ſuſpects them to make Plots and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies with his particular Adverſary againſt him. In the beginning of the late times, they were charged to conſpire with the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> In the midſt of theſe miſeries, they were accuſed to conſpire with the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> againſt the <hi>Fanaticks:</hi> Now, in the end, ſome are found to murmur up and down, that they conſpire with the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks</hi> too, againſt the Church of <hi>England.</hi> All, I can ſay to this caſe is, either we miſtake them, or they are mad men, and have no more wit then a weather-cock, that where e're the wind is, ſtill turns his face directly againſt it.</p>

Though in all theſe Inſtances, I think, they are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſunderſtood: yet is there one wherein I am not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my ſelf; and that is, their acknowledging a Foreign Authority in prejudice of our <hi>Kings Supremacy.</hi> And at firſt ſight I eaſily diſcern, the Controverſie has, for a long time, been ſomwhat miſtaken, at leaſt miſexpreſt. The Queſtion, I conceive, is not whether the Supremacy in matters pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spiritual be in the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>Pope:</hi> but, whether in the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or the Pope: I ſhall onely looſen the knot a little, and then 'twill unty it ſelf. We know our graver and more learned Divines, diſtinguiſh between the inward power of the Keyes, and the outward juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by temporal penalties: This they aſsign to the King, in all Cauſes, and over all Perſons: That they reſerve to the Clergy, as neither deriv'd from the Civil Magiſtrate, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on Him. And thus much the <hi>Papists,</hi> unleſſe I'm miſinform'd, are ready to profeſs, onely they faſten the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>link of the pure-Spiritual chain to the Chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not to that of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Which of theſe waies is the more convenient, I cannot judge, but plainly ſee, if one be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Monarchy, the other is: And if a Subject may be, in any conſideration, <hi>Supream,</hi> without derogating from his Prince, a Stranger may be ſo too. Think on it well, and inſtruct me, if I erre.</p>
            <p>But you will Reply, if the Moderate on both ſides ſo nearly agree in ſenſe concerning the Kings Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, why do the <hi>Papiſts</hi> refuſe the Oath of Supremacy, and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> admit it? ſhall I tell you freely my thought? I believe, if the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> underſtood that Oath as it ſounds, they would never take it, for it gives the King more then they mean; and if the Papiſt could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it to ſound no more then the Proteſtants mean, they would never refuſe it. How then ſhall this difference be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled? Either let both ſides be underſtood to mean as they ſpeak, and then neither of them will take it; or to ſpeak as they mean, and then neither of them will refuſe it. The remedy, if heartily deſired, is eaſie: There needs no more but fairly to frame the Words according to the ſenſe:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104467:7"/>
I mean all this while, as far as concerns the <hi>Royal Supremacy</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical affairs, not intermedling with the pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual part, which I leave to the diſcuſſion of pure Spiritual Perſons.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the Oath it ſelf aims at no more then to aſſert theſe two Points; that the Supream power in Spirituals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the King; and that none of That Power belongs to any Forreigner, as is clear by the Words of the Oath, nor to any other, as may clearly be infer'd from the Form of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion made 35. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. where the Submitter is requir'd to <hi>teſtifie in his Conſcience, that, No other Perſon hath, or ought to have any Power or Authority over his Majeſty:</hi> Which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in matters belonging to the Church, for thoſe were the Caſes provided for by that Act.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot a principal conſideration. The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> 'tis ſaid ſolicited his <hi>Sacred Majeſty</hi> to publiſh the late <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> for tender Conſciences; and did none ſolicit but they? Or muſt it be counted ſo unpardonable a Crime for Subjects to beg of their King the Performance of his Royal Word? At leaſt thus much we muſt confeſſe in excuſe of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they needed moſt their Princes Indulgence, becauſe the Lawes were ſevereſt againſt them: They deſerv'd it beſt, becauſe, of all that needed it, they were moſt faithful to him. They moved in the fitteſt time, after the Common <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> was Enacted, and before the Services they had done were forgotten? Yet for all this the general mercy was far more ſparingly expreſt to them, then to any of the reſt. Sullen <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> that rather will ſtarve himſelf, then endure a <hi>Papist</hi> to have a morſel of bread!</p>
            <p>'Tis true, ſome withdrew themſelves from the publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice upon that <hi>Declaration:</hi> But, was there one <hi>Papiſt</hi> among them? Why muſt the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and none but he be whipt; when the <hi>Puritan,</hi> and none but he playes Truant? for the <hi>Papiſt</hi> went to another School before, and therefore though he ſtill be abſent from ours, yet cannot he properly be ſaid to play Truant. Nor can the endeavour of procuring this <hi>Declaration</hi> be ſuſpected (as our faſhion is) for a <hi>Popiſh-plot,</hi> and that all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> conſpired in it together; when I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104467:8"/>
have Reaſons to be extreamly confident few knew of it till 'twas cry'd in the ſtreets. I know 'tis eaſie to be jealous but every one knows 'tis uncharitable too; unleſſe we have a cauſe; we, that is, ſome peeviſh ſpirits among us, ſay, that all along the late times, their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi> were in the enemies army, and (under the diſguiſes of <hi>Taylors</hi> and <hi>Weavers,)</hi> preach'd them into rebellion: But if never any one of theſe were diſcover'd, on what ground do we ſay they were there? and if they were diſcover'd, by what favour were they protected againſt the Law? ſure nothing can be aid why they were not found <hi>guilty,</hi> but that they could not be <hi>found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis time to conclude; for my part, let others do as they pleaſe, I'le ſtrive to love my own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion, without hating another mans; much leſſe will I hate another man for his Religion. I conceive him in an errour, and he thinks ſo of me; I have ſome marks of being in the right, and he believes he has as many as I: I reade the Bible, and ſo does he: And after all, our differences continue: What ſhall we do, but live peaceably together, till it pleaſe God to clear the truth among us; Onely this advantage I cannot deny to the Papiſts, that in temporal reſpects they are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more tolerable, then either <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Fanatick;</hi> In ſpiritual, though we charge them all with Errours, yet thoſe of the Papiſts conſiſts with the Being of our Church, the other deſtroy it.
