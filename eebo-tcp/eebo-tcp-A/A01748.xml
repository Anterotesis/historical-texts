            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N ſuch bookes as ſome of our brethren haue bin lately constrayned to ſet out for your ſatisfaction: there is often mention made of the contention at <hi>Wisbich</hi> begun <hi>1595.</hi> Of this contention, there haue gone many reports: and as yet the truth thereof hath not bin ſo fully publiſhed, as it is conuenient: the indirect courſe of our new aduerſaries conſidered. Such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with our Engliſh Ieſuitiſme, do aſcribe all the blame in that behalfe vnto vs, that are ſecular Priests: in that we could not be brought to alter our old orders for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of Fa. <hi>Weſton</hi> a Ieſuite to become our Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or Agent; as his faction tearmed him. To make this matter therefore as cleare as the ſunne, and that no indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete Catholike may be ignorant of the truth herein, if he will not wilfully ſhut his eyes, or ſtop his eares, as our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt would haue them: we haue thought it our duties to deliuer vnto you from point to point (as in the ſight of God) the beginning and proceeding of thoſe garboyles then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs. And at this time, we are the rather moued ſo to do: becauſe it hath pleaſed Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> our ſayd Arch-prieſt, very lately to ſend to his twelue Aſſistants to be diuulged a certaine Cenſure, or (we know not what to tearme it) a ſheet of paper, fraught neither with wit, honeſt dealing, diſcretion, or learning: but in effect with as many ſhifts and lyes almoſt as lines, in derogation not only of ſome of the ſaid bookes ſet out by our brethren, tearming the ſame (as if either he himſelfe, or ſome of his commaunders the Ieſuites had made them) to be ſeditious bookes: but likewiſe taketh vpon him, to touch the ſaid contention, not in many words, but with much follie and great vntruth. We will be bold by way of Preface, a little to touch them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are his words. The firſt point (ſayth he, meaning the diuiſion at <hi>Wisbich)</hi> was a thing long ſince ended with great edification, and by the meanes principally of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:621:3"/>
which are moſt condemned. It toucheth the greater and better part of that company. It nothing concerneth our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: it being more auncient, and hauing orders taken at the attonement by their owne conſent. It is well knowne at <hi>Rome</hi> by whoſe meanes they were diſanulled. Neither is it more vnfitting for thoſe which liued in one houſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute rules for ſuch as voluntarily demaunded and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them then to procure a ſodality abroade. Thus farre our Arch-prieſt: and it is all he writeth to his aſſistants of this matter: which we the rather note to ſhew the extremity of his pride, in ſuppoſing by ſuch an anſwere to the ſayd bookes concerning that diuiſion to wipe away thoſe imputations &amp; matters, wherwith both Fa. <hi>Garnet,</hi> &amp; Fa. <hi>Weſton,</hi> &amp; he himſelfe in ſome ſort are charged. That which here he ſayth either touching our contention at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> or any thing whereof he hath written to his ſayd aſſistants againſt the ſayd bookes, is fully anſwered in print by one of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, a true Catholick Prieſt: We hartily pray you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the booke, and then iudge of our Arch-prieſt as you finde him. In the meane while and becauſe this our treatiſe may come to your hands before the other, although the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory following doth ſufficiently confute his words by vs now cited: yet will we giue you ſome little tryall of our new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors wiſedome and ſinceritie, by that which here he writeth.</p>
            <p>The firſt point (ſayth he) was a thing long ſince ended. And what then maiſter <hi>Blackwell?</hi> will you reaſon thus? It was long ſince ended: ergo, maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> and maiſter <hi>Weſton,</hi> the firebrands of that garboile with their factious adherents are not to be blamed as our brethren haue writ of them in their ſayd booke? But we beſeech you ſir vpon your ſmall credit tell vs, is that contention long ſince ended? Nay rather (ſpeake man) is it ended as yet? It was in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: whether it were meete, and according to the auncient eccleſiasticall Diſcipline, that a Ieſuite ſhould haue the commaundement ouer ſecular Prieſts. And is this point
<pb facs="tcp:621:3"/>
yet decided? There was we confeſſe (as we thought) an end made amongſt vs <hi>1596.</hi> by maiſter <hi>Muſh,</hi> and maiſter <hi>Dudley,</hi> and that with edification: but it fell out farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. The edification you make mention of was nothing ſutable to that edification, whereof the Apostle ſpeaketh: but was much more agreeable to the building of <hi>Babell</hi> that tower of confuſion. For whileſt we of the vnitie were quiet, and ſuppoſed all had bin well: maister <hi>Garnet,</hi> and his ſubiect maiſter <hi>Weſton,</hi> were ſo moued, that they had bin diſappointed of their ſayd gouernment amongst vs, as like prowde <hi>Nymrods</hi> and boisterous hunters they caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout how to bring vs vnder them by an other ſtratageme, ȧs by the historie it will appeare.</p>
            <p>When he alſo further ſayth, that the end he mentioneth was made by the meanes principally of thoſe which are moſt condemned: he meaneth maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> and maiſter <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> to be thoſe principall perſons; or elſe his ſpeech is ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: and then alſo he writeth moſt falſely. For true it is, that the end which we ſuppoſed had bin made, was compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by maister <hi>Muſh</hi> and maister <hi>Dudley</hi> full ſore againſt the harts and good likings of the ſayd two Ieſuites. Mary if he meane ſuch an end of the ſayd contention as they two propounded to themſelues, which was but an interim to a further miſchiefe, ſuch an end, as then they respected and ſought after, and do now perſwade themſelues to haue found it (whileſt maister <hi>Garnet</hi> ruleth the roaſt) then indeede Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> and Fa. <hi>Weſton</hi> may truly be ſayd to haue bin the especiall contriuers of it: otherwiſe it proceedeth from incredible boldnes to pretend them to be authors of any good peace, who breathe forth nothing but diſſenſion and cruelty.</p>
            <p>And where he ſayth (as we ſuppoſe) that maister <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> and maister <hi>Weſton,</hi> are two men now moſt condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: it is true that they are indeed condemned for their Machiuilian practiſes againſt their brethren: being (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of their Fatherhoods) ſo puft vp with pride and arrogancic, as it is ſcarſe probable to relate. But yet ſome
<pb facs="tcp:621:4"/>
exception may iuſtly be taken to his words, in that he ſayth, they are moſt condemned. For in good ſooth, we thinke his maisterſhip as farre too blame as either of them, or more: in that being a ſecular Prieſt, he doth ſo tyrannize ouer his owne brethren by calling, and hath not the wit to ſee, how he is abuſed and made a puppie to daunce after their pipe, and to execute what they do commaund him.</p>
            <p>But it followeth for ſooth: that the ſaid diuiſion toucheth the greater and better part of that company. Alack alack, doth it ſo? It toucheth indeede the greater part: and that very neerely: for it ſhewed them for the time to be very factious: ſuch as ſecretly banded, and combined themſelues with a Ieſuite againſt their fellow priſoners and brethren. And therefore in that hee ſayth thoſe conspiring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were the better part, he ſpeaketh like himſelfe very vntruly, as we in our indgements do esteeme of honeſt men. Mary in his ſenſe, and according to the common ſaying, the veryer knaues, the better luck: they may well be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the better part: becauſe none are iudged vertuous or of any estimation that oppoſe themſelues againſt the Ieſuites, or refuſe to worſhip their Ieſuiticall Idoll our Arch-prieſt. And yet we will be content to let them go for once as he would haue them: ſo he ioyne thoſe words with the other that follow: and to this effect. The ſayd contention tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the better part, and therefore it concerneth neither himſelfe, nor any of his louing aſſistants, nor their impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable authoritie. But in good ſooth maister <hi>Blackwell,</hi> ſpeake truly man: doth not that contention in ſome ſort touch your high authoritie? Was it not the ground of it? If we had yeelded to Fa. <hi>Weſtons</hi> agencie, had you bin euer aduaunced as you are? Did not our garboyles beget your greatnes? If maister <hi>Weſton</hi> had preuailed with vs, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Garnet</hi> would haue wiped your noſe for dealing like a yong prince abroade-as you do. And therefore indeed in a right good ſenſe, wee are your good maisters, and ſo you ought to esteeme vs. But if we ſhould deale more ſeriouſly
<pb facs="tcp:621:4"/>
with you, and vrge you to ſet downe, wherein the ſaid great part was, or is the better: what durſt you ſay, if you haue any ſparke of the feare of God before your eyes? Are they better learned? for ſhame you will not ſay it. Are their liues more ſincere? I hope you will charge vs with no diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie: or if you dare, we defye you: being in our liues we truſt blameles before men, and euery way as honeſt as your ſelfe at the leaſt.</p>
            <p>As touching the orders you ſpeake of; they were yeelded vnto (it is true) by our conſent, and that moſt willinglie: but as for maister <hi>Weſton,</hi> it ſo ſtroke him to the hart to yeeld vnto them, as he fell downe preſently before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany into a ſwoune: ſuch was his pride, and ſo vnwilling he was to be ouer-ruled for the time. And whereas our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt ſaith: that it is well knowne at <hi>Rome</hi> by whoſe means the ſaid orders were diſanulled: we are glad to heare it, and haue taken ſome little paines in this treatiſe, to make it alſo as well knowne here in <hi>England.</hi> If his meaning be that we of the Vnity did firſt diſanull them, he ſayth vntruly, and they in <hi>Rome</hi> are falſely informed. No, no, thoſe orders croſſed too much the Ieſuites deſeignements to haue any long continuance, where they had any factious creatures to infringe them.</p>
            <p>But that which followeth, is worthie ſome especiall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Neither was it more vnfitting (ſayth maister <hi>Blackwell)</hi> for thoſe which liued in one houſe to institute rules, for ſuch, as voluntarily demaunded and accepted them, then to procure a ſodality abroade. In good faith we are ſory, that we are compelled to diſcloſe this fellowes falſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Catholick Church for ſecular Priests to ſue to the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall of the Ieſuites to haue a Ieſuite for their head: or for others to ſue to his holynes to aſſigne them a Biſhop. But let this paſſe: and proceede we to the reſt: and when you heare the truth in a word, then conſider the mans ſinceritie. It will appeare vnto you by the history following, that Fa. <hi>Weſton</hi> had bin laboring for a ſuperioritie ouer his brethren for the ſpace of ſeauen yeeres. To that purpoſe he had inſinuated himſelfe by hypocriſie, and vnequall distribution of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the fauors of the yonger ſort, ſuch as were either themſelues Ieſuites, or elſe inclining thereunto. The Rules he ſpeaketh of, were of Fa. <hi>Weſtons</hi> owne making. And all this was done ſecretly, the grauer ſort of the company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neuer acquainted with it. When they had contriued their buſines, as you haue heard: they pretend themſelues to be more holy, then the reſt of vs whom they miſliked: and that therefore, in respect of the ſinnes that raigned amongſt vs; they would no more either eate or drinke with vs, but would haue their diet by themſelues. And in concluſion, they ſeuered themſelues from vs, and dealt as you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in this treatiſe at large; more like <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> then Catholick Priests. And all this inquitie doth this Ieſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Arch-prieſt couer in the ſayd words, ſo Clarkly masked with good tearmes, without any regard either of conſcience, or common honesty, but to abuſe the world, for the better vpholding of his owne credit: which being gotten by falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, is ſtill yet ſo mainteined. But we keepe you too long from the ſtory it ſelfe: and therefore referring you for this matter to the ſayd printed diſcourſe, in anſwere both of it, and many other points, we commit you by our prayers to Almighty God, who open your eyes and harts, that you may truly diſcerne betweene wolues and true pastors of your ſoules, and accordingly to imbrace them, as heretofore you haue done, and we hope will do hereafter.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeare 1579. <hi>M. Saunders</hi> was diſpatched from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Ireland:</hi> and not long after the Pope ſent other forces thither. About the ſame time alſo, the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> intending to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle <hi>Portugall,</hi> vpon the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the late Cardinall, prepared an Army and a Nauy (as it was pretended) for <hi>England.</hi> And to countenance the ſame, he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Cardinall <hi>Alexandrino</hi> his meanes, the renoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bull publiſhed by <hi>Pius quintus</hi> againſt her Maieſtie: and printing of them to the number of 1500. at the leaſt, he was content they ſhould be ſpread abroad. Not long after Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and two other Ieſuites his ſubiects, Father <hi>Campion</hi> and Father <hi>Cotham,</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> with ſuch a noyſe, as mooued great expectation in ſome, and diligent caution to be had of their proceedings by others. Theſe things hapning thus together: her Maieſtie and the State (as fearing the worſt) diſpoſed of the affayres in the Realme accordingly: and thought it conuenient to carry a hand more hardly vpon the Catholicks. So as in the yeare 1580. Doctor <hi>Watſon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> Doctor <hi>Fecknam</hi> Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Young,</hi> maiſter <hi>Metham,</hi> Doctor <hi>Oxenbridge,</hi> and maiſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> were ſent to remayne as priſoners in the Caſtle of <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> where they liued in great vnitie and brotherly kindnes: euery man intermedling only with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:621:6"/>
his owne affayres and priuate meditations. They were all in commons with the keeper: and for their recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, had a Garden there to walke in, and to ſolace themſelues as they thought good. Such money as was ſent to any particular man he had himſelfe the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it as he thought it conuement, that which came for the common vſe, was by all their conſents deliuered ſtill to mayſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> who diuided the ſame to euery man alike. There was then no affectation of ſuperiority, but euery man yeelded of his owne accord that duty and precedencie which to euery one was due, the keeper hauing the commaundement ouer them all. Afterwards within about three yeares, eight or nine Gentlemen were likewiſe ſent to remayne there as priſoners, vpon certayne ſpeeches that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had ſome intendment againſt <hi>England,</hi> whereby the number of the priſoners increaſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſturbance at all to the foreſayde vnity. Theſe Gentlemen liued at their owne charges, and as moſt dutifull children demeaned themſelues towards their fellow priſoners, and ſpirituall fathers. If at any time ſome little indiſcretion hapned in any, a word (eſpecially of his ghoſtly father) was more then ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to reforme it: or if vpon ſuch like an occaſion Biſhop <hi>Watſon</hi> were mooued to reprooue this or that, his anſwere was, What? are we not fellow priſoners? Are we not at the commaundement of an other? Shall Iadde affliction to one that is afflicted? Are we men who profeſſe our ſelues to be examples to others in ſuffering for our conſciences, and ſhall we not be thought then able without controllers to gouerne our ſelues? Be content: I will not take vpon me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue my fellow priſoners. And indeed this was the courſe that euery man held: ſo as by ſubmitting themſelues one to an other, euery man had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding power one ouer an other, ſuch was the moſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:621:6"/>
chriſtian and brotherly affection amongſt them. In this ſort they liued till all were either dead or gone, but maiſter <hi>Metham</hi> and maiſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> which was for the ſpace of about ſixe or ſeauen yeares.</p>
            <p>Afterwards (vpon new attempts by <hi>Babington</hi> and his aſſociates againſt her Maieſtie, and by reaſon of the rumours of the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> preparations) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue thirtie prieſts that were priſoners elſewhere, were in the yeare 1587 (as we remember) ſent likewiſe to <hi>Wiſbich.</hi> In which number was maiſter <hi>Edmonds, alias Weſton,</hi> a Ieſuite: a man, who after <hi>Heywoods</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of <hi>England,</hi> was ſent hither by <hi>Parſons</hi> from <hi>Paris</hi> to bee his ſubſtitute, or Prouinciall: Vpon whoſe apprehenſion maiſter <hi>Walley, alias Garnet,</hi> by order from Fa. <hi>Parſons,</hi> did ſuccede him in that office. This company had ſcarſely conſorted themſelues with maiſter <hi>Metham</hi> and maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> by the ſpace of a weeke, but Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> (hauing in him the reliques of his late prouincialitie) began to caſt about how he might aduance himſelfe aboue his brethren. To which effect, entring amongſt his beſt acquaintance into a great commendation of diſcipline, he offred to their conſiderations a very ſimple man one maiſter <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (a Seminary prieſt, and his ghoſtly father) for a fit perſon, to take vpon him the direction and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the whole companie: adding, that if they thought that there were any thing in him (the ſayd <hi>Weſton)</hi> worthy the reckening of, he would imploy the ſame at their commaundement to the aſſiſting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of him the ſayd <hi>Dryland</hi> for the full ſupplying of any defects in him. This motion finding little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, it being very abſurd to make choyſe of a head, that muſt borrow his diſcretion and directions of an other (as at this day our Arch-prieſt <hi>Blackwell</hi> doth of Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> the Ieſuite) he the ſayd <hi>Weſton</hi> gaue it ouer for about three weekes. And then he began againe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:621:7"/>
(though in a more generall ſort) to inſiſt very grauely vpon his ſayd pretended diſcipline: ayming with all his skill at his owne particular preferment: for thus the caſe ſtood. Maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> (being a man that had bin chiefely imployed in the affaires of that houſe) was iunior to maiſter <hi>Metham:</hi> and he the ſayd maiſter <hi>Metham</hi> (hauing more lately entred into the ſociety of the Ieſuits then maiſter <hi>Weſton)</hi> was thereby (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that otherwiſe he was farre his aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) yet his inferior according to the rules of that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Now one of theſe three (if there ſhould haue bin a gouernour choſen) being ſuppoſed to be the fitteſt amongſt all the reſt for ſuch a place: maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> geſſed, that in that choyſe they would haue omitted maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> in reſpect of maiſter <hi>Metham;</hi> and him the ſayd maiſter <hi>Metham</hi> in regard of himſelfe, and that ſo they ſhould haue bin driuen to haue choſen him the ſayd <hi>Weston.</hi> But it fell out otherwiſe: for in their conſultation it was thought that maiſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> by reaſon of his long experience in that houſe, and of his acquaintance in that towne, together with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall knowledge had of him with all Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> in reſpect of his long dealings with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon money, could in no ſort be omitted: So as they concluded, that if they muſt be driuen to haue any ſuch gouernment ouer them, it was moſt expedient to chooſe them all three. Whereupon maiſter <hi>Weſton</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that he could not get the whole regiment to himſelfe, gaue that attempt ouer: vnder pretence, that he being a Ieſuite, was forbidden by the rules of his order, and others his ſuperiors, to meddle in matters of gouernment.</p>
            <p>But it is here to be obſerued: that the Ieſuites long before this time, hauing gotten the regiment of the Engliſh Seminary at <hi>Rome:</hi> our countriemen of that order no ſooner came into <hi>England,</hi> but preſently (as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:621:7"/>
the ſequele declared) they began to lay their plots how they might bring the ſecular prieſts heads vnder their girdles. For notwithſtanding their ſaid rule (of not intermedling with gouernment) mentioned by Fa. <hi>Weston,</hi> they haue ſo many wayes to qualify it, as indeed it is but a mask to couer their ſleights with, till opportunitie doth ſerue them. Whereof Fa. <hi>Weſton</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſufficient intelligence and skill, did not from time to time (almoſt by the ſpace of ſeauen yeares) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to put the ſame in practiſe. He laboured, as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly as he could, to creepe into the fauour of the yonger ſort. When ſtrangers came, it ſhould eſcape him narrowly, but he would be the firſt that ſhould bid them welcome: and no friendſhip could be held with him, except he might make the collation at ſuch times vſuall. In which collations he would ſeldome omit to inſiſt vpon the commendation of order and diſcipline: which being things in themſelues of great worth, he was ſtill therein to them that vnderſtood him not very plauſible. Being a man as impatient as ſome of his fellowes, and of as haughty a ſpirit as any man can be: it was wonderfull to conſider, what humblenes and ſimplicitie he would pretend. His ſighs and zeale ſeemed to be extra ordinary: as though the perfection of true mortification had bin the only thing he aymed at. Marry, with all this hypocriſie he deceiued none, but ſuch as did not looke more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into his proceedings: a righter Phariſee cannot eaſily be found. In the middeſt of his humilitie nothing troubled him more, then that maiſter Doct. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> (being a Doctor of Diuinitie) ſhould haue place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at the table: inſomuch as the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him, we were driuen to place him at the tables end with him. The Ieſuites abroad hauing gotten the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tribution for priſoners into their hands, much was ſent to be diſtributed, by this good father:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:621:8"/>
wherewith (through his vnequall diſtribution of it) he laboured nothing more, then how he might draw, and binde men vnto him, to make his ſide and faction ſtrong inough againſt the time, he had occaſion to vſe them. Theſe &amp; many other ſuch his vnder-hand pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes being well diſcerned by maiſter <hi>Metham</hi> and others, he the ſayd maiſter <hi>Metham</hi> was very much mooued, and did greatly lament the ſame. This maiſter <hi>Metham</hi> was a vertuous learned Prieſt, who when he was priſoner in the Tower vowed to become a Ieſuite; as admiring that calling, becauſe he was not acquainted with their courſes: but afterwards at his being in <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> he found by wofull experience that all was not gold that gliſtered. Sundry times he hath ſayd to ſome of our company, not without teares in his eyes, Keepe this fellow downe aſmuch as you can, meaning Fa. <hi>Weston:</hi> by labouring to be popular, he beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the ringleader of all mutinies in the houſe, which in time will breede faction againſt you. This houſe will come to vtter ſhame through his folly. I pray God that I dye before it commeth to paſſe, for I do foreſee ſuch a miſchiefe. Thus maiſter <hi>Metham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cardinall <hi>Alane,</hi> when the Ieſuites firſt came into <hi>England,</hi> told ſundry of his friends, that certainely they (the ſaid Ieſuites) would rayſe great garboyles in this countrey, by ſeeking to diſgrace ſecular prieſts, and to aduance themſelues aboue them. He had great experience of the ambition which raigned in many of that ſocietie, and therefore indeuoured (as he might conueniently) to repreſſe that humor in our Engliſh Ieſuites, which kept them within ſome reaſonable compaſſe whileſt he liued. But afterwards they heard no ſooner of his death, and ſhortly after of the death of Doctor <hi>Lewys</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caſſane</hi> (of whome they ſtood in ſome feare, ſuſpecting he ſhould haue bin made Cardinall in the others place) but their inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:621:8"/>
burſt foorth as a flame that had bin long ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. They depraued both thoſe worthy perſons now dead very ſlaunderouſly, charging the Cardinall to haue bin but a ſimple man, and of no great worth; and the Biſhop to haue bin a factious perſon in <hi>Rome:</hi> and all this (forſooth) becauſe ſometimes they both had croſſed ſundry of their lewd attempts. Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> at <hi>Wiſbich</hi> (as a man who had long trauailed with his imaginary diſcipline) hearing of theſe mens deaths, and being as he thought, backed ſufficiently by his confederates, began to bring forth the fruits thereof. He lifted vp his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, as if a new ſpirit had bin put into him, and tooke vpon him to controll, and finde fault with this and that: (as the comming into the Hall of a Hobby-horſe in Chriſtmas) affirming that he would no longer tolerate theſe and thoſe ſo groſſe abuſes, but would haue them reformed. At this his pride and vanitie ſome of vs greatly maruayled, but the reaſon thereof (which we then knew not) was this. We were then priſoners in the houſe to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 34. whereof by his foreſayd practiſes he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured vnto him 19. who by his direction had choſen him to be their head, and giuen him the name of their Agent. Whereupon this grand ſenior thus promoted, withdrew himſelfe to his chamber by the ſpace of a fortnight, of purpoſe (as we afterwards perceiued) to rowze himſelfe, and to deuiſe ſome ſuch new orders and lawes, as he thought moſt conuenient for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of his ſubiects, which being reſolued vpon by him, he did dedicate them vpon Candlemas day to the bleſſed Virgin, as himſelfe afterwards confeſſed. You muſt vnderſtand, that he did not proceede thus farre, without Fa. <hi>Garnets</hi> priuity and conſent. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, his ſayd ſubiects being ignorant thereof, they poore fooles muſt needs write a letter to his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to craue his approbation of their ſayd election.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:621:9"/>
Beſides, Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> had to practiſed vnder hand with ſome of his ſayd 19. ſubiects, as this his new prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be obtruded vpon him, whether he would forſooth or not. And accordingly the ſayd letter was framed: ſignifying to maiſter <hi>Garnet,</hi> that he the ſayd maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> was as a man taken with the palſey of the mind, and would in no wiſe accept of their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except that he by his commaunding authoritie, would bid him riſe vp and walke before them in the way of the righteous.</p>
            <p>With this letter they ſent alſo the ſayd lawes or rules, being in number 22. where of ſome of them were ridiculous, and ſome of them very ſcandalous. Theſe things (as we coniecture, for the diſtinct times were kept cloſe from vs) being ſent to Fa. <hi>Garnet;</hi> the new Agent after he had withdrawne himſelfe from the reſt of the company by the ſpace of a fortnight, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected maiſter <hi>Southworth</hi> a Prieſt, and our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoner vnto maiſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> to ſignifie vnto him, that Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> deſired him to allot to him, and to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany being 19. the high table in the Hall: and that leauing the ordinary Kitchin to them, he the ſayd maiſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> with the reſt (but twelue in number) would be content to prouide themſelues of another. What meane you by this meſſage, quoth maiſter <hi>Bluet?</hi> Cannot the Hall and Kitchin ſerue vs all now, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they haue done? No, ſayth maiſter <hi>Southworth,</hi> we are determined (20. of vs) to draw our ſelues into a more ſtrict order of life: and haue therefore reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to keepe commons together amongſt our ſelues, thereby the better to auoyd ſuch ſinnes, as whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, drunkennes, and dieing, the ſame being too or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie with ſome in this houſe. What, quoth maiſter <hi>Bluet:</hi> hath Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> ſent you vnto me with this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage? and he anſwering, yea: He the ſayd maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> went to Fa. <hi>Weston,</hi> who iuſtified the ſayd meſſage:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:621:9"/>
ſauing that he qualified the mentioning of the ſayd crimes with humme and hah: ſaying at the laſt (as though butter would not haue melted in his mouth) indeed we reuerence you, and maiſter Doct. <hi>Bagſhaw:</hi> but amongſt the reſt, there are ſome enormities, which we would be glad to auoyd: and do therefore purpoſe to impoſe vpon our ſelues a more ſtrict order, leauing you and others, to follow ſuch courſes, as you ſhall thinke good. With this his anſwere, maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat moued: Haue you kept your chamber (ſayth he) all this while, for this? Shall we haue a new <hi>Donatus</hi> amongſt vs, to reuiue againe that peſtilent ſchiſme? Can you name any in the houſe, worſe then your ſelues? Well, well: I pray you leaue this courſe: it is naught. Be content to eate and drinke with vs ſtill: for, aſſure your ſelfe, we will neuer yeeld, that you ſhould haue any ſeuerall roomes graunted vnto you; thereby to ſeuer your ſelues from vs. And ſo after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſpeeches, for that time they parted.</p>
            <p>When maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> had imparted vnto vs the ſayd meſſage, and his ſayd diſcourſe with Fa. <hi>Weston,</hi> it did very much grieue vs all, as foreſeeing what publick ſcandale it would grow vnto: and therefore diuers of vs dealt with them particularly, that they would deſiſt from that their purpoſe, and be content that we might liue together ſtill, like priſoners, and louing brethren, as we haue done before. But all was in vaine: they inlarged their calumniation and ſlauders of vs, and began to ſpread the ſame abroad to our great diſcredits: and would in no wiſe be ſtayed from the courſe they had begun. Howbeit, we hindered as long as we could their publick ſeparation from vs, by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping our old places, ſome of vs, at euery table: ſo as they could not chooſe, except they would haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne their dinners and ſuppers, but that they muſt needs ſit amongſt vs. Whereupon Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> ſent the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:621:10"/>
ſayd <hi>Southworth</hi> to our keeper, with the like meſſage in effect to the former, concerning their intent (for the auoyding of ſinne) to keepe commons by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, apart from the reſt: and therefore to intreate him, that they might haue a roome aſſigned them, to make a Kitchin of, and ſome other places meete and conuenient for them; offering him ſome large conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for his good will therein. But he conſulting with ſome of the grauer ſort, diſliked their attempt: and reiecting their ſuite, commaunded them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in peace and quietnes, as the State had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as he found them, at his firſt comming to be their keeper: vnleſſe they could ſhew vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the reſt, ſome capitall crimes which might war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him to graunt their ſeparation: for (ſayd he) I am a Iuſtice of peace, qualifyed to take notice of ſuch crimes. To whom maiſter <hi>Southworth</hi> anſwered: that in this caſe, the Queene could not make him a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent iudge: and that the crymes were ſuch and ſo great, as in conſcience they could not keepe company with vs. Why (ſayd maiſter <hi>Medlye)</hi> what crymes are thoſe ſo horrible, that the Queenes authority cannot reach to take knowledge of? Maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> can tell you (ſayth maiſter <hi>Southworth)</hi> for I haue ſignifyed them vnto him. Very well quoth maiſter <hi>Bluet:</hi> I ſee the old prouerb verified now in you: An Engliſh man Italionate, is a Diuell incarnate. If you told me the cauſes why <hi>Weston</hi> and you do attempt to make this ſchiſme and diuiſion in the houſe, why may not your ſlaundering toong vtter the ſame to maiſter <hi>Medlye</hi> our keeper? Muſt I be your Bedle to proclayme your lyes? But maiſter <hi>Medly,</hi> this Italionated company on hath this craft in his budget: if I ſhould now relate vnto you what he hath told me of this matter, then would he being meerely Ieſuited, deny it, and ſo turne the blame vpon me, that I telling it you publickly, do
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:621:10"/>
ſlaunder the houſe, and not he, nor his fellowes, that told it but ſecretly. Vpon this, and ſuch like commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, maiſter <hi>Medlye</hi> fell to the commendation of the quiet behauior of thoſe priſoners, which were firſt ſent to <hi>Wiſbich:</hi> ſaying, that it was nothing, but the turbulent ſpirits, and humour of youth, that wanting due wiſdome, diſcretion, and grauitie, thruſt them into theſe noueltyes.</p>
            <p>Much iangling they kept both at this time and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for ſeuerall roomes: but fayling of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire therein, they grew to a great diſlike with the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and to be reuenged vpon him, procured in ſhort time two Prieſts to eſcape from him out of priſon, which they knew would grieue him much. Beſides, the ordinary Chappell belonging to the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> lying fitly by them, they aduentured of themſelues to dedicate the ſame to <hi>Bacchus</hi> for their Buttery: and entertayning an other Brewer (one <hi>Palmer)</hi> laid ſuch Beere in it as they thought meete. It is not almoſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible what brablings were about theſe matters: and with what malice and impietie they did alſo proſecute vs, by ſeeking to blemiſh our good names, as though they had quite forgot that we were Catholick Prieſts, and their fellow priſoners. The common enemy could not haue vſed vs much more deſpitefully.</p>
            <p>By this time Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> hauing peruſed the ſayd rules and letter, returned his approbation of them in a generall letter to that company, and alluding to a point mentioned in their letter to him, commaunded his ſubiect Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> as an hypocriticall paralytick, to take vp his bed and walke: that is, he gaue him leaue to accept of the Agency, impoſed forſooth by them vpon him: but vnder-hand ſent to Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> himſelfe a priuate letter; wherein he admoniſhed him in any ſort ſo to take vpon him that his new Prelacy, as both his the layd fathers name for auoyding of enuy might
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:621:11"/>
be concealed: and that it might ſeeme to proceede wholy, from the importunity of thoſe that had choſen him. All theſe particulars were at this time vnknowne vnto vs: they played faſt and looſe in corners (as you ſee) buying and ſelling of vs (as honeſt men as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues) at their pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Whileſt they were thus in this garboyle with vs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated therein by Fa. <hi>Garnet:</hi> it hapned that maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> (a graue Prieſt) came to <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> with ſome contribution for the whole company: who perceiuing and lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting what a breach he found of our auncient vnity, did endeuor for the ſpace almoſt of a weeke, to haue reduced vs thereunto againe, being earneſtly deſired by vs all ſo to do. At this his being there, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Southworth</hi> drew him with importunitie into his chamber, and did ſhew vnto him their foreſayd letter, and rules, which they had ſent to Fa. <hi>Garnet,</hi> entring into a long diſcourſe with him, concerning their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſeparate themſelues from vs. Whereunto mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Dolman</hi> aunſwering, that in ſo doing, they would aſſuredly be the occaſion of great ſcandale: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that their company were reſolute to go through with it.</p>
            <p>We had heard before of the ſayd letter and rules ſent to Fa. <hi>Garnet:</hi> but (as we then told M. <hi>Dolman)</hi> we could neuer come to the ſight of them: and therefore we deſired him to be a meanes, that we might haue the peruſing of them. Whereunto he did very willingly yeeld; as thinking our motion therein very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: and thereupon going to maiſter <hi>Southworth,</hi> he ſo preuayled with him, as that he the ſayd maiſter <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> brought them vnto vs: which when we had read, we were much perplexed, finding our credits to be greatly touched by them. Howbeit, maiſter Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> in a very mild and charitable ſort, did then deſire maiſter <hi>Dolman,</hi> that by his mediation he might
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:621:11"/>
haue conference with Fa. <hi>VVeston:</hi> promiſing, that he would be a meanes, that this controuerſie ſhould be ended to his honor &amp; credit, and to a further increaſe of amity and charity, then euer there had bin for a long time amongſt vs. Maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> being a glad man to heare ſo much from him, dealt with Fa. <hi>VVeston</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: whome he found ſo ſtiffe, as he could by no meanes perſwade him to admit of that godly offer: notwithſtanding it was made vnto him thrice; and ſo oft preſſed by him the ſayd <hi>Dolman.</hi> Whereby mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Dolman</hi> gathered, that Fa. <hi>VVeston</hi> had receiued ſome commaundement from maiſter <hi>Garnet,</hi> to take vpon him his ſayd Agency: and for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting of Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> and his friends (being ſomewhat moued, that maiſter <hi>VVeston</hi> had ſo oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed conference) told them ſo much: adding, that he thought maiſter <hi>VVeston</hi> his ſayd refuſall to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon grounded: it being vnlawfull for him to reiect, or call into queſtion that, which his Prouinciall had impoſed vpon him. But afterwards he the ſayd maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> imparting to maiſter <hi>VVeston</hi> what he had ſayd to Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> and his friends, maiſter <hi>VVe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> flatly denyed that he had receyued from maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> any ſuch approbation or commaundement, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by letter, or otherwiſe. With which his aunſwere, maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> acquainting vs, we did the more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile why he diſdayned the ſayd offer of conference. Howbeit, ſeeing their courſes, we ſayd that we would not impeach any order, which they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues thought meete to liue vnder: only we deſired to liue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons together with them, that the world might not take notice of any ſuch ſchiſme amongſt vs: but this was reiected. Whereupon maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Fa. <hi>VVeſton</hi> whether they meant to keepe any more ſtrict or large dyet by themſelues, then the reſt? who anſwered, that they did not. Why then (quoth he)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:621:12"/>
haue you taken another Brewer? Maiſter <hi>Weſton</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: it was, for that he brewed better Beere then the other. Vpon occaſion of theſe ſpeeches betwixt them, maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> told him, that by reaſon of the choyſe of the ſayd new Bruer, the Towneſmen began to talke at large of their great breach in the Caſtle: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayd, that ſome ſcandale was already growne, by appointing the ſaid Chappell for their Buttery. To which laſt point maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> replying, aunſwered: that he thought (as the caſe ſtood now in <hi>England)</hi> they might vſe things heere as they found them: which words of his gaue maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> occaſion to ſhew the contrary, both out of <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> and out of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> in his Commentaries <hi>De ſpolijs.</hi> It were too long to ſet downe what then paſſed amongſt vs, at this time of maiſter <hi>Dolmans</hi> being with vs: but he perceiued ſuch oppoſition to his godly motions, as that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue ſome ioyned with him: and that he might then depart, and returne with his Colleague, named by them one Doctor <hi>Bauin,</hi> a fortnight after Eaſter. Hereunto we all willingly yeelded: and ſo after ſixe dayes trauayle amongſt vs, he bade vs farewell. But conſider now a Ieſuiticall trick that hapned. As mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Dolman</hi> was going to horſeback, maiſter <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> met him in the Porters lodge, and told him with great vehemencie of ſpirit, that Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> had greatly abuſed both him the ſayd maiſter <hi>Dolman,</hi> and the whole company: in that he had receiued a fortnight before a letter from Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> in approbation of their choyſe to haue him for their Agent: and had kept the ſame in his hands ſo long, without making his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany acquainted with it: which he tearmed to be double dealing, as indeed it was in them both. But maiſter <hi>Southworth</hi> pretending his great diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that reſpect, perſwaded maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> to returne back to maiſter <hi>Weston,</hi> and then hearing the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:621:12"/>
ſayd letter read, and perceiuing that it was ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly written, ſo as the time did not ſerue him to enter into any diſcourſe of it (hauing a great iourney that night) he departed, without making any of vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſayd letter: much meruailing (as ſince he hath confeſſed) to finde ſo groſſe a falſhood in maiſter <hi>Weston.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time that we were in expectation of maiſter <hi>Dolmans</hi> returne with his Colleague, it was a world to heare the people, that before had honored and admired vs, ſo long as we kept vnity and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, how they changed their opinions of vs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Ieſuites, tearming them in all ordinary aſſemblies, prowde, ambitious, and vndicatiue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: perturbers of ſtates, countries, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. What would theſe men do (ſay they) if they had all in their hands: that being in a Gaole, dare take vpon them to rayſe vp ſuch tumults and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyles? Certaine good men relating theſe things to maiſter <hi>Weston,</hi> deſired him humbly vpon their knees, to conſider what ſcandale he gaue to the world, and how God and his truth were much blaſphemed by this diſſention: but he, with great contempt and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion aunſwered, that he waighed not any mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: let them alone (ſayth he) <hi>caeci ſunt &amp; duces cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum:</hi> if it be a ſcandall, it is <hi>ſcandalum per accidens,</hi> which I care not for: this matter is gone further then may be controlled by man: you ſhall ſee it with hands and ſeales confirmed, ere it be long. With this fathers obſtinacy many were diſcontented: and maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> did thereupon thinke it conuenient to write to mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Perpoint,</hi> and to deſire him (hauing bin a priſoner before at <hi>Wiſbich)</hi> to moue maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> by his letter to ſome better quietnes. But the ſayd maiſter <hi>Perpoint</hi> being now altogether Ieſuited (which maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> knew not of) ſhewed his letter to Fa. <hi>Garnet,</hi> who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:621:13"/>
it in euill part, writ himſelfe thereof to Fa. <hi>Weſton,</hi> aduiſing him, that ſeeing maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> had begun to write abroad of the affayres in that place, they ſhould not now ſpare either him or any of the reſt, to requite them with the like. So as thereupon maiſter <hi>VVeston</hi> ſtirred vp a young Prieſt very well learned, to write a bitter, rayling, and an vnghoſtly letter to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>London</hi> (a lay brother of that ſociety) againſt Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> and maiſter <hi>Bluet:</hi> to the intent that the ſayd lay brother (being well eſteemed amongſt all the chiefeſt Catholicks) ſhould blaze and ſpread the ſame abroad, to their exceeding diſcredits. But Doctor <hi>Farbeck</hi> being about that time in <hi>London,</hi> and knew very well the affayres then at <hi>VViſbich:</hi> vpon the ſight of this letter by a Noble man, dealt very roundly with the ſayd lay Ieſuite, for the indignity and vnchriſtian dealing offered to thoſe two perſons ſecretly behinde their backs, where they could not defend their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. He did at that time after a ſort, ſatisfye the Gentleman ſo farre forth, as the ſpirit of that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be qualified in ſuch a matter: and beſides ſo informed the Nobleman of ſuch things as he knew, as that he was pleaſed with ſome diſdaine to teare the letter in pieces. But the poore Prieſt that was vrged againſt his conſcience to write it, being admoniſhed thereof, fell out of his wits, and threatned to kill thoſe that ſet him on worke: whereby they were driuen to intreate their keeper to ſhut him vp in a cloſe cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where he remayned a tweluemoneth, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing willingly, that for abuſing his penne againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, he was thus tormented: he asked the ſayd parties forgiuenes. You haue heard peraduenture of a Machiuilian maxime: <hi>detrahe audacter, aliquid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerebit:</hi> and here you haue ſeene the practiſe of it.</p>
            <p>Maiſter <hi>Doleman</hi> (as you haue heard before) being departed from vs, hath reported vpon occaſion, how
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:621:13"/>
carefully he imployed himſelfe on our behalfe. I met (ſayth he) with a deere friend to you all: a man well knowne to be excellently well learned in both lawes, and for his vertuous wiſdome and other ſingular good parts in him well beloued, and greatly eſteemed of all that know him. I meane Doctor <hi>Windam:</hi> vnto whom, I opened plainly and ſincerely the whole matter, and craued it earneſtly at his hands, that he would take ſome paynes therein, and for the loue he bare the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall cauſe, the eſpeciall affection he had to your company, which I know is as great as he can giue and you deſire, and for the old acquaintance and loue, that was between vs beyond the ſeas, he would aduiſe and inſtruct me what to deliuer vnto you. How much he lamented this controuerſie amongſt you, I am not able to expreſſe. After three dayes aduiſement, he told me, for any that liued together as you do (preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he vnderſtood your ſtate very well) to diuide themſelues from the boord, from the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (things ſo ſtanding as they do now) though their purpoſe were right good, was both againſt charitie and pollicie. Whereupon hearing his great miſlike, I made ſome haſtie returne, and let Fa. <hi>Weston,</hi> with ſome of his company, vnderſtand his reſolution, with mine owne therein. Thus farre maiſter <hi>Dolman.</hi> This his returne was within tenne dayes after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and before the time limited to him and his Colleague to deale in our cauſes. Vpon which his ſayd ſpeeches and communication with Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Doctor <hi>Windams</hi> opinion: Would God (ſayd maiſter <hi>Weston)</hi> with moſt earneſt affection (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) that you maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> were as well able to perſwade the reſt, as you haue done me. For mine own part, I mind to giue ouer and meddle no further, but to commend the cauſe wholy to God: aſſuring you, if I could do the leaſt of this houſe good for his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:621:14"/>
ſoules health, by laying my head vnder his feete, I would moſt willingly do it. I pray you talke with ſome of our company, and ſee whether you can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them. And thus farre this diſſembling Ieſuite (by maiſter <hi>Dolmans</hi> report) very well putting Father <hi>Garnets</hi> aduiſe in practiſe, ſo to enter into his courſe of gouernment, as that it might be thought to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon him in effect againſt his will. But how found maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> this Agents ſubiects? Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> could haue told him, like a crafty company on, if he had liſt to haue ſaued the poore old mans labour. For he no ſooner moued them to reunite themſelues, but they ſtartled thereat, and ſayd, they were ſtill reſolute to proceede in the courſe which they had vndertaken: and would heare nothing to the contrary.</p>
            <p>At this time (as we remember) of maiſter <hi>Dolmans</hi> being at <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> entred into ſpeech with maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> in his the ſayd maiſter <hi>Dolmans</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, concerning both their deſire of ſeuerall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and alſo their rules and lawes before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and ſayd vnto him: that it ſeemed very ſtrange that he ſhould perſiſt as he did, in defence of theſe his proceedings. To whom maiſter <hi>VVestons</hi> ghoſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aunſwered: that as he, and Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> had caryed away the glory and fame of all that was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore lawdably done in that Caſtle: ſo from hence-forth Fa. <hi>VVeſton</hi> would indure it no longer, but would haue the ſame aſcribed to himſelfe, and to the Ieſuites. Fa. <hi>VVeston</hi> halfe aſhamed of this ſo plaine a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, tooke vpon him to mend it: ſaying, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ſeparation was, rather to auoyd ſuch ſinnes as were in the houſe, as whoredome, dronkennes, and dicing, then for any ſuch cauſe, as the party before had mentioned. And being further vrged to ſpeake plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether he knew himſelfe of any ſuch ſinnes to be in the houſe, he aunſwered, that he ſpake not in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:621:14"/>
but in generall of them. Whereunto maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> replying, affirmed, that in ſaying as he did, and charging no man in particular, he inuolued the whole houſe as guiltie of thoſe ſinnes, and was a detractor thereby in the higheſt degree. He alſo the ſayd maiſter <hi>Bluet</hi> proceeded further in effect, as followeth. If there be ſuch enormious ſinnes amongſt vs, haue we not ghoſtly fathers to reforme them? or can you name any that herein hath bin refractarious? Is not the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of healthfull penance a ſufficient remedie for men in our caſes, to keepe vs from ſuch enormities? If the meanes appointed by Chriſt, haue not ſufficient force to remedie theſe euils: what extraordinary grace or power can we expect from your ſuppoſed authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye and lawes to effect the ſame? Againe, if ſuch ſinnes were in the houſe: either ſome particular men were guilty of them, or all: if ſome, why are they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that the reſt may know, as well thoſe that committed them, as thoſe that fauour or defend them in ſuch their turpitudes? And whereas we are priſoners heere againſt our wils, and therefore cannot chooſe but of neceſſity muſt dayly conuerſe and be together, by order and commaundement of the State, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the priſon: how dare you (except you will incroach vpon her Maieſties authority) thus violently attempt to ſeparate her ſubiects, promulgate lawes, execute puniſhments, and make your ſelfe in effect to haue as full power as the Pope hath himſelfe? In that you ſeeme without his authority to make a new order of Religion, or I know not what, with bands, lawes, rules, and puniſhments, except your power be more then we can dreame of: you incurre thereby the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of excommunication: and by the lawes of this Realme, it is well knowne, that <hi>omnis coitio</hi> in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome not preſcribed by her Highneſſe, is ſubiect to a very heauy cenſure. When <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> priuatly

and therefore vnlawfully ſought by inediation of their mother, the right hand and the left: the reſt of the Apoſtles did worthily diſlike that attempt: but when <hi>Peter</hi> and theſe two were called vp to Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> to behold Chriſt in his Maieſtie; all the reſt tooke it in good part, and neuer grudged, becauſe they were called thither by lawfull authority. Beſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you and your pretended ſubiects will keepe no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with vs, becauſe of our ſinnes (as you pretend) be your ſurmiſes true or falſe: yet (as you proceede) you ioyne therein with the <hi>Donatists;</hi> who becauſe they would not defile themſelues (pure creatures) with other mens ſinnes, departed from the Church, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in their foule ſchiſme and hereſie. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of this diſcourſe there were ſundry interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but the ſumme was, that maiſter <hi>VVeston</hi> did little regard it: notwithſtanding his pretence of yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mentioned before, if his companie would be thereunto perſwaded.</p>
            <p>When maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> was to depart, he moued maiſter <hi>VVeston</hi> and others, that foraſmuch as he had acquainted them already both with Doct. <hi>VVindams</hi> opinion and his owne, concerning the intent of his company for diuiding themſelues in Commons from their brethren: he might with their good fauours be releaſed of his promiſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming againe after Eaſter. But they would in no ſort yeeld thereunto: but deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him in any wiſe, as he loued them, to keepe the time appointed. Which made ſome of vs to meruaile, knowing now by maiſter <hi>Dolman,</hi> that Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> had approued maiſter <hi>Westons</hi> Agency: although neither then nor ſince we could euer obteine a copy of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to that effect. Howbeit afterwards we perceiued his drift herein: which was to make tryall, if by any poſſible meanes he could winne of the ſayd Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; to determine that ſome other order, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:621:16"/>
had bin vſed in that place, was neceſſary to be appointed. For then preſently by way of a conſequent depending vpon Fa. <hi>Garnets</hi> authority, he would haue obtruded vpon vs his owne Agency: or at the leaſt haue gotten ſome aduantage againſt vs, to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued vs to thoſe, who would not conſider, that the admitting of maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> for our head, we had thereby ſubmitted our ſelues to <hi>Garnet,</hi> and ſhould ſo haue become meere ſubiects to the Ieſuites.</p>
            <p>At the time appointed our two Arbitrators, Doctor <hi>Bauyn</hi> and maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> comming to <hi>Wiſbich:</hi> we found him the ſayd <hi>Bauyn</hi> much more ſtiffely lyned with Ieſuitiſme, then euer we could haue ſuſpected. He being in maiſter <hi>Bluets</hi> chamber, and demaunding the cauſe why they were ſent for: aunſwere was made, that their preſence was deſired for the examining and deciding a fact of great ſcandale and deformitie: yea a flat ſchiſme (as we thought) begun, and proſecuted in priſon by Fa. <hi>Weſton:</hi> and to reduce vs againe to our auncient vnity. To this Doctor <hi>Bauyn</hi> ſayd, that he would do his beſt indeuour, to ſet quietnes amongſt vs: and further told vs; that he had with diſdaine read Father <hi>Westons</hi> lawes and platforme, and was fully reſolued to caſheere them, whatſomeuer came ofit: but yet (quoth he) you muſt haue ſome order and forme of gouernment amongſt you. It was aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him; that we had deſired their company, but to iudge, whether the breach they had made, was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or no: iudge that firſt (quoth we) and then we will friendly conferre, what is meete to be done hereafter. We are in priſon, and ſometimes cloſe priſoners, not in caſe to ſpeake one with an other: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps muſt be, as heretofore we were at the Keepers dyet: what ſhall we then trouble our ſelues, with rules, orders, or common wealthes? Are not the Canons of Councels, the lawes of the Church, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:621:17"/>
the ſacrament of penance ſufficient for Prieſts, that are in priſon for the Catholick faith? Did the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> when he liued here, trouble himſelfe with any ſuch matters: or hath this yonker amongſt vs, a Ieſuite, more wit, grace, experience, and authority, then he had, being the Popes Legate ouer all <hi>England?</hi> To admit theſe his new lawes and penall ſtatutes, were to confeſſe in effect, that we had liued inordinatly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this Ieſuiticall youth came to reforme vs. No, no, they ſhall haue no ſuch aduantage againſt vs: it is the But, they ayme at, to make the ſimpler ſort of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks beleeue, that we ſecular Prieſts are no body, nor able to do any thing of our ſelues, except the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites may haue the commaundement ouer vs, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and commaund vs, as they thinke good.</p>
            <p>After ſuch communication had in maiſter <hi>Bluets</hi> chamber, maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> and he went to maiſter <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> and his adherents, to know wherein they would commaund their ſeruice. But maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> after the new faſhion, deſired them firſt to fall downe and pray with him: which done, he aroſe; and framing his countenance as though he would haue wept, ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them thus in effect. Your comming hither maketh vs glad, and heauy: glad, if that you will aſſiſt vs in that we haue begun; and ſo we will giue you prayſe and benediction: but if you will croſſe our deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and condemne our indeuors, you ſhall giue vs very great cauſe of ſorrow. Aduiſe therefore your ſelues very well what you do: for the matters are of great importance, which we put into your hands. Then Doctor <hi>Bauyn</hi> (to pay maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> with his owne coyne) pretended to be ſo mooued with his words, as if he likewiſe could ſcarſely haue refrayned from teares: which maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> and we obſeruing, we doubted to finde him but an halting Arbitrator. Beſides it ſeemed, that they were halfe vnwilling, to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:621:17"/>
commit their former deſignements to theſe mens ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement: had it not bin for feare, that elſe the world would haue condemned them: and therefore they laboured them in ſecret, with all their might and maine to approoue their enterpriſes. <hi>Whileſt we were in conſultation</hi> (ſayeth maiſter <hi>Dolman) good Lord, how were we dealt with vnder-hand, to allow wholy of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to reprooue the others.</hi> Many iarres hapned in theſe conferences. One of them that ſtood for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, told the Arbitrators that a brother of the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, threatned him, and all the reſt that ſtood againſt maiſter <hi>Weston, that if they would not ſubmit themſelues vnder the Ieſuites obedience, and liue vnder their ſtatutes and lawes, they ſhould ſtarue, and not haue a morſell of bread to put in their mouthes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Doctor <hi>Bauyn</hi> and maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> grew to the conſideration of Fa. <hi>Westons</hi> rules, and other his deſignements, he the ſayd Doctor <hi>Bauyn</hi> did vtterly reiect them. Marry withall he made mention of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine draught and forme of diſcipline, which was more beneficiall to the Ieſuites, then their owne: and ſuch a one (as he himſelfe hath confeſſed) the Ieſuites abroad had agreed vnto. In this platforme, eight (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides maiſter <hi>Weston)</hi> were to haue bin choſen out of the brethren of the ſeparation, and two of the vnited to make vp tenne: which tenne ſhould haue gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the reſt; maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> being appointed euer for their mouth. So that as before in his owne common wealth called the Agenage, he was maiſter Agent: ſo in this other of Doct. <hi>Bauyns</hi> (tearmed the tenne men, and the mouth) this our deuout Ieſuite was to haue bin called in proper ſpeech, maiſter mouth. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication about this new platforme of Doctor <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyns,</hi> there grew ſome heate betwixt him, Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> and maiſter <hi>Bluet:</hi> both of them with great earneſtnes, and very forcible arguments impugning
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:621:18"/>
the ſame, which Doctor <hi>Bauyn</hi> tooke in euill part, but was afterwards wel inough appeaſed. Then after a day or two our ſaid Arbitrators (hauing taken great paines this way and that way) agreed together vpon a forme of pacification, to be offered vnto vs all: the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall effect whereof was: that we ſhould reconcile our ſelues generally one to an other, remitting freely and wholy each to other, all pretended or ſuppoſed iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries paſt, vttering the ſame in order by ſome ſhort word or ſpeech, without any rehearſall, debating, or reaſoning of any matters paſt, and without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or exception for the time to come. This pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being firſt ſhewed to Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> they did moſt ioyfully receiue it: and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Arbitrators very inſtantly, that for Gods ſake, they would go forward with it. Afterwards they went to Fa. <hi>Weston,</hi> and maiſter <hi>Southworth,</hi> and deliuering them the copy of it, they ſeemed very willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſame: ſo as an hower the next day after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was appointed for the mutuall reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation of all the company, according to the effect of the pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before mentioned. Againſt which time maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> being in the Gallery ready to go into the Hall to dinner, Fa. <hi>VVeston</hi> drew him aſide to a window, and vſed theſe words vnto him: I truſt (maiſter <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)</hi> this reconciliation ſhall not preiudice our deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, of diuiſion of Commons: to whom maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> aunſwered, that all their breach was about that matter: and that therefore, he and his fellow could in no ſort like thereof, nor permit the ſame. Then ſayth maiſter <hi>VVeston</hi> very ſharply, you do vs great wrong. I meane you no wrong, quoth maiſter <hi>Dolman,</hi> but all the good I can wiſh or deuiſe: yes mary do you (ſayth he) and ſo you would confeſſe, if you ſaw but our extract: which conteyneth three ſheetes of paper of the enormious crymes, that we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:621:18"/>
haue to charge them withall. But I pray you (ſayth he) let vs intreate maiſter Doctor <hi>Bauyn,</hi> and you to ſtay this reconciliation, vntill to morrow: for we haue certaine Articles to ſhew you firſt, that cannot ſo ſoone be made ready. Vnto this motion the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors condeſcended, hoping it would haue turned vnto the beſt: but it fell out quite contrary. For they found that nothing would content them, except they would agree vnto the ſeparation of Commons.</p>
            <p>The Articles exhibited concerning vs, together with our Articles which we were conſtrayned thereby to offer to our ſaid Arbitrators, we haue thought good here to ſet downe. Firſt theirs (which are rather indeed Interrogatories to examine the Arbitrators, then mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that do much touch vs) and then our owne: which we offer to all men, to be cenſured, as they ſhall think good.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Whether (ſay they to the Arbitrators) will you ſtay the time to examine thoſe Articles, which any may be accuſed of?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Whether you thinke it ſecure for vs, that liue and meete together many times in the day (not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the meanes to auoyd each other) to haue thoſe things propoſed, and examined, and whether you can compaſſe our quiet?</p>
            <p n="3">3 That whoſoeuer doth come to declare any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhall ſubmit themſelues to you, as to their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, to declare without all equiuocation, or lying, any thing, whereof you thinke neceſſary to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the verity.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That you do take the promiſe of euery one that is called before you, to behaue themſelues with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie and good tearmes.</p>
            <p n="5">5 This ſuppoſed: we are all for our parts conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they obiect, what they can againſt vs.</p>
            <p n="6">6 We require alſo, that they ſhall giue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:621:19"/>
that they are all contented, to heare what may be layd out againſt them.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Euery thing being heard: that you pronounce ſentence againſt thoſe, that you ſhall finde culpable.</p>
            <p>When our ſayd Arbitrators had peruſed theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories, no maruaile though they troubled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being ſo contrary to their expectation: and deuiſed of purpoſe to breake off all hope of reconciliation by their meanes: and ſuch likewiſe, as by Ieſuiticall ſhifts might haue bin prolonged, if they had liſt, for we know not how many yeares. With theſe Articles we were no ſooner acquainted: but preſently we ſet down theſe fower in ſome ſort to aunfwere them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 We require that ſufficient ſatisfaction may be made for the ſlaunder and diffamation of vs by their breach and letter: if ſufficient cauſes cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for their ſo doing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We require that euery accuſation be ſet downe in writing vnder the accuſers hands, <hi>ſub poena talionis,</hi> if it be not proued.</p>
            <p n="3">3 We will aunſwere in all things according to the order in the Canon law: ſuppoſing theſe men to be our lawfull Iudges.</p>
            <p n="4">4 We will ſuſteine any cenſure, with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that being cenſured by theſe men, we may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured thereby from all other cenſures concerning that matter.</p>
            <p>When theſe our Articles were deliuered to Fa. <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> and he with ſome others had peruſed them: <hi>they began firſt</hi> (ſayth maiſter <hi>Dolman) to take exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fourth Article: and in the end againſt them all, plainely ſhewing indeed, that they liked nothing, but their owne deſignements, being reſolued to proceed in them: let it fall how it ſhould either back or edge, as the common prouerb is.</hi> Whereas we (by the teſtimony of the ſayd maiſter <hi>Dolman)</hi> profeſſed our ſelues very deſirous of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:621:19"/>
and offred our readynes to aunſwere any matters, that might be obiected againſt vs: prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting that we would only indeuor to maintaine our owne credits, without any recrimination at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the truth is, that our ſayd Arbitrators ſaw ſo many inconueniences that would haue followed, if they had entred into this courſe, as they by no meanes would be drawne vnto it: but ſtill inſiſted to haue lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp all diſcontentments in their ſayd generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. Whereunto we for our parts, were all of vs well inclined: inſomuch as maiſter</hi> Dolman <hi>himſelfe proteſteth, that</hi> he he will euer charge maister <hi>Weſton</hi> and his company, to haue bin the cauſes that the ſaid goodworke ſo greatly vrged by him and Doctor <hi>Bauyn,</hi> was not effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them. <hi>For (ſayth he the ſayd maiſter</hi> Dolman) all our motions were irkeſome vnto them: and two or three, one after another came vnto me: and told me, that except I would remoue my opinion touching the breach of commons, they wiſhed me to be gone. <hi>Whereupon he writ a letter to our whole company, and concluded thus.</hi> As before God I ſpeake it in conſcience, I am throughly perſwaded: you, that ſhall vnder pretence of ſubmitting your ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a head, and to liue vnder an order, diuide your ſelues from the reſt, ſhall do a thing ſinfull. This is my minde: this is my cenſure. <hi>And ſo the good old man departed from vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After his departure, notwithſtanding that Doctor <hi>Bauyn,</hi> to our owne knowledge was very reſolute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our diuiding of Commons; as maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> and diuers others can alſo witnes: yet we know not, how afterwards it came to paſſe (through their Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall practiſes with him) but (as we haue heard) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two dayes he turned his tippet, and incouraging them to take their owne courſe, went his way like a charitable Prieſt, and neuer bade vs farewell. We would be loth to do him iniurie, if this matter hath bin
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:621:20"/>
miſreported vnto vs: but this we do affirme, that ſince that time his credit hath ſo increaſed amongſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, as now he is become one of their Archprieſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants: and that within a day or two after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> and his company, entred into an actuall and publick ſchiſme: they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either to eate or drinke with vs: they left the Hall altogether: they made the Chappell their Buttery, maiſter <hi>Brampstons</hi> lodging their Kitchin, and their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents chamber their Refectory.</p>
            <p>Whileſt Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> and his conſorts were talking, as you haue heard before, of certain great matters which they had againſt vs, why they could not keepe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with vs any longer: he the ſayd good father, to ſhew what good ſtuffe they had in ſtore, called one <hi>Garret</hi> forth, and perſwadeth him to vnfold to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators his owne confeſſion, that vnto <hi>Weston</hi> his ghoſtly father, he had made a yeare and a halfe before. This demy-Ieſuite, although the thing ſeemed moſt abſurd and irreligious, obeyeth willingly to vnfold to the Commiſſioners, either what he had vttered in his confeſſion of one of his fellowes, or at the leaſt, what he had deuiſed between him and maiſter Agent. Well: <hi>propter bonum ſocietatis,</hi> he commeth moſt ſadly (as if he had bin compelled) and telleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he is moſt vnwilling to vnfold that which turneth to the diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a Prieſt: but yet for diſciplines ſake, which was ſeene decayed in the houſe, and for the obedience which he ought vnto his ghoſtly father, he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them of that, which may giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> light to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, as they thought good. Marry he will not haue it knowne, but vnto themſelues in ſecret. This proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, he ſayth, that one of maiſter <hi>Medlye</hi> his men, an heretick told him, how that a Prieſt (and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him) was in the greene chamber (which was the keepers lodging) talking with <hi>Mary</hi> maiſter <hi>Medlyes</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:621:20"/>
may de: and that the Porter (who was in loue with her) was by maiſter <hi>Southworth</hi> willed to go vp to the greene chamber, for that there was ſuch a Prieſt tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with <hi>Mary:</hi> who in all haſt went vp, and finding the Prieſt not in the chamber with <hi>Mary,</hi> he looked into the Study within the chamber, and found him there with an engliſh booke in his hand, whereat he was offended. Now (ſayth maiſter <hi>Weston)</hi> you ſee matter ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for to leade you to giue ſentence with vs. Indeed (ſayth Doctor <hi>Bauyn)</hi> this is a matter that moueth me to be willing to giue my iudgement: what thinke you maiſter <hi>Dolman?</hi> The Romanes being Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans (quoth M. <hi>Dolman)</hi> would not condemne S. <hi>Paul</hi> vpon the requeſt, and accuſations of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> before they heard <hi>Paul</hi> defend himſelf in a publick place: and ſhall we here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne a Prieſt, and in him, 12. more, vnheard, vnexamined, and no place of defence left them? Maiſter <hi>Ba.</hi> I will not do it: but I will heare what the Prieſt can ſay for himſelfe. I do not thinke (quoth <hi>Bau.)</hi> that we can doe ſo: for this matter is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to vs in ſecret, not to be opened againe. How then, ſhal we pronounce an externall ſentence (quoth maiſter <hi>Dolman)</hi> as we are externall iudges, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne theſe 13. but it muſt be knowne? Well, well, this is very ſtrange: and ſo that matter was daſht.</p>
            <p>If maiſter Agent and Doct. <hi>Bauyn</hi> had proceeded with the reſt of their ſuppoſed enormious crimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs (ſo many as filled vp three ſheetes of paper) and that M. <hi>Dolman</hi> would haue bin aduiſed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: you ſee what a prety courſe of iuſtice would haue bin held in theſe aſſiſes. What all thoſe ſeuerall accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were, we could neuer haue the fauour to be informed: either by M. Agent or his aſſiſtants. You may ſuppoſe they were not great, in that we had been recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with great applauſe, as companyons with them of their holy order: if we would but haue yeelded to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:621:21"/>
Fa. <hi>Ed. Weſtons</hi> Agenage, thereby admitting a kinde of Fryer to be the head of ſecular Prieſts: as rare a deuiſe, as lightly hath hapned. But to returne where we left. A ſeparation is made, and maiſter Agent is in his ruffe, ſitting in a corner with his obedient ſubiects. If we ſhould haue tearmed him Vſher of their new Hall, which was his owne chamber, and maiſter <hi>Brampston</hi> in the like reſpect, their chiefe maiſter Cooke, hauing good oportunitie, though he had lyen in his bed, to haue ruled the roaſt: the phraſes had not bin very improper. Howbeit, ſuch manner of conceits were then farre from vs: our hearts being very greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with griefe, to ſee ſo many of our brethren Catholicke Prieſts, and impriſoned for the ſame cauſe with vs, ſo irreligiouſly to ſeparate themſelues from vs. Beſides: we were otherwiſe ſet on worke by them, in laboring to defend our ſelues from their diueliſh practiſes in ſlaundering of vs: as though we had bin the men, that had made the faction, and not they: whereas it was moſt apparant to thoſe that would not ſhut their eyes, that we ſwarued not one iot from that courſe which had bin held both by vs, and our very honorable &amp; reuerend predeceſſors in that priſon: as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that deteſted ſuch childiſh innouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Furthermore, our ſayd griefe was greatly increaſed, in that we were daily aduertiſed from our friends abroad, how many Catholicks in euery corner (otherwiſe very graue and zealous) began to fauour this new deuiſe: being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a conceit, that we (formerly reputed their deere and louing fathers) were become on the ſodaine, without any change at all in vs, perſons of great licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſnes; ſuch as could neither indure any good order nor holeſome diſcipline. Lord (thought we) whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do theſe things tend: or what will be come of the moſt auncient and Catholick Romane Religion; if the old and conſtant profeſſors thereof do begin to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:621:21"/>
delight in change and innouations? And here by the way, we would gladly haue it obſerued, that as well in all the aforeſaid garboyles, as in the reſt that follow hereafter: we that ſtoode for vnitie, haue alwaies been in effect meerely paſſiue, ſtanding ſtill vpon our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: our aduerſaries (for ſo our brethren did make themſelues) practiſing their beſt actiuitie to hurt and wound'vs.</p>
            <p>For to keepe their hands and tongues in vre, this Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſaid new Agent was no ſooner inueſted in his Ieſuiticall authoritie, but preſently he ſendeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad certaine reaſons (fiue in number) to his friends, leaſt he ſhould (forſooth) haue been miſtaken in his ſaid publike ſeparation from vs. In which pretended reaſons, many points being childiſh, and many falſe, we hold them not fit to be here inſerted: only we haue mentioned them, becauſe they driue vs againe to our Apologie, by incountring them with fiue others, which we will alſo pretermit: the fact it ſelfe attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Agent and his confederats being ſo abſurd, and ſchiſmatically handled, as whoſoeuer doth well know it, his owne reaſon and iudgement (if he haue any) are ſufficient to condemne it.</p>
            <p>You haue heard at large before of our troubles, which Doctor <hi>Ba.</hi> and maiſter <hi>Dolman</hi> would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (wee are perſwaded) at the firſt, haue compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but as the matter fell out, their paines therein, did not only, not end them, but through maiſter Agents Ieſuiticall skill in ſhifting and falſe gloſing, were the beginning of other new garboyles. For he hauing gotten into his hands certaine writings and letters of Doct. <hi>Bauyns,</hi> did pretend and giue it out amongſt his friends, that he and his adherents had been very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to haue entred into any good pacification, had we not been ſo obſtinate as no reaſon would content vs. He ſhewed ſome Prieſts of the ſaid Doctors letters,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:621:22"/>
wherein (as it ſhould ſeeme) he affirmed, that their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was in effect, no ſeparation. Beſides, it was giuen out, that we vtterly refuſed to haue the crimes obiected againſt vs, ſifted by the arbitrators and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into. Againe, they ſaid, that we hauing giuen the ſaid Commiſſioners full authoritie to decide all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betwixt vs, did for feare, or becauſe we would be ſtill wilfull in our diſorderly courſes, reuoke the ſame: ſo as thereby nothing could bee effected. Alſo they quarrelled with vs concerning our yeelding to haue receiued ſuch new lawes, as the Arbitrators ſhould thinke good to impoſe vpon vs. All which particulars, with many more ſuch like, being moſt falſly layd to our charges, they went from hand to hand, farre and neere, and were receiued by ſuch Catholicks, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be infected with Ieſuitiſme, as if they had been true: thereby taking occaſion to depraue vs excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. Inſomuch as the good old Father maiſter <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was driuen to write diuers letters, for the cleering of the ſaid falſe accuſations, and was ſo earneſt in them, as theſe and diuers others ſuch like ſentences fell ſometimes from his pen: <hi>Detrahere, aut detrahen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem audire quid horum ſit damnabilus non facile dixerim: it is hard to ſay, whether is the greater ſinne to be a ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, or giue eare vnto him: ſub Christi ſpecie daemon ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que lates? thou art diſguiſed (Sathan) in the habite of Chriſt? O ſecula nostra, hoc phariſaiſmo pleniſſima! our times are pestered with phariſaicall hypocriſie!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By theſe and ſuch like courſes which this Ieſuitical faction did thus practiſe againſt vs, the Catholickes abroad were greatlie diſtracted: ſome leaned to vs, but more inclined to them: it being the fatall calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our Nation to be too much addicted to faction and nouelties. They of the new guiſe, ſent vs word that in oppoſing our ſelues againſt the Ieſuits,</hi> wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured but in vaine, and loſt thereby our reputation: that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:621:22"/>
order being of ſuch excellencie, as it might not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. <hi>An other writ vnto vs a long diſcourſe, dated the 26. of Iune 1595,</hi> how vnwilling the Ieſuits are to take vpon them anie ſuperioritie: that Father Westons Agencie was not worthie to be tearmed by the name of ſuperiority, becauſe it was not <hi>praeeſſe ſed prodeſſe:</hi> that Cardinall Allen a little before had willed ſundrie Priestes that came for England, to acknowledge the Ieſuits for ſuch men, as had beene their ſuperiours and maisters: and that therefore, they ſhould make no difference but keepe peace with them, and goe vnto them for their aduiſe and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>And afterward in the ſame letter,</hi> the Catholickes <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> are ſo wholie affected to the ſociety, &amp; haue them in ſuch estimation, that whoſoeuer ſhall ſhew himſelfe to fauour anie part against them, or not ſo throughlie to affect them, yea though he be one of our owne coate <hi>(meaning a Prieſt)</hi> hee ſhall be leſſe gratefull and welcome to them. <hi>And a third: in his letter dated in Auguſt 1595. the ſame yeere, writeth thus vnto vs:</hi> I can aſſure you, that in the generall opinion of the beſt ſort of Catholickes, the tide is againſt you; and if you loue me, contend not with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weston. <hi>This and much ſuch like ſtuffe wee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the fancifull. But on the other ſide, they that plodded in the old ſteps of antiquitie, and had a great diſguſt of nouelties, did now and then write vnto vs, after another ſort: Sometimes they ſignified vnto vs with great indignation, the abuſes offered vnto vs,</hi> how our fellow priſoners of the faction did write in ſuch manner againſt vs, and they were in horrour to thinke of it: <hi>and how alſo the gallants abroad (being at libertie) did inſult vpon our miſeries, treading vs vnder their feet, as though no ſecular Prieſt were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be named the ſame day, that mention is made of a holie Ieſuit. And ſome of great fame ſaid vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> that Father Westons ſeparation from vs, was ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as they thought it expedient in their opinions, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:621:23"/>
they deuided themſelues from our table, wee ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide our ſelues from their prayers. <hi>An other moued vs to this effect:</hi> that ſeeing the old ſigillum Salomonis, and our Sauiours direction failed, wee would inuent ſome new pentacle to binde theſe furious ſpirits <hi>(meaning the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iticall faction)</hi> which will do much hurt, if God be not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and men prouident. <hi>An other alſo in one mans perſon deſcribeth vnto vs, the right qualities of our Engliſh Ieſuits, as wee our ſelues haue found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and the world in the end ſhall trie them. The man he writeth of, is now one of the aſſiſtants to the Archprelate: and theſe are his words:</hi> he is the Ieſuits Curſitor, alwaies in motion for them, either for gathering of monie, or for harkening after newes. If he can learne of any legacy giuen to your houſe, he ſeeketh by all the meanes he may, to conuert it from you to their vſes, ſo (as I verilie thinke) there is not of a Prieſt a greater enemie to your companie then he is. Notwithstanding if he talke with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, yea, that he likes not, he will moſt palpablie flatter him; but behinde his backe hee will moſt monstrouſlie detract him. Let him be told againe of it in ſuch ſound manner, as with no face he may denie it; then hee looketh a while vp to the heauens, and after anſwereth: hee remembreth no ſuch matter. Neuertheles for humilities ſake, he will ſay he will render what ſatisfaction you will: and ſo with that geſture, and this hypocriſie, hee will ſhuffle ouer all matters, be they neuer ſo foule, that he ſhall be charged with. O Lord graunt him better grace. <hi>And ſome there haue bin, who haue by their letters, bin ſo farre from diſliking of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings at that time: as in Iulie 1595. they moued vs earneſtlie</hi> to continue, as wee had begun, and in no wiſe to giue place to faction, and nouelties: <hi>adding</hi> that they had not talked with any, that were either of learning or iudgement, which did not greatlie condemne father Weston for his vnquietnes: deeming him either to be growne into great melancholines, or els vnto too much ſimplicitie. <hi>We</hi>

               <hi>ſpare to trouble you with more to this effect; our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe onlie being in this point to let you ſee the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church: procured by this breach amongſt vs then at</hi> Wiſbich. <hi>Whereof a godlie father writing thus generallie vnto vs al, ſaith:</hi> if through the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your diſſentions and diſcord, you will ſo greatly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie vs, as we ſhall think: our holie anchor drayling a floote: our viſible Church to be hid vnder a buſhell: our forme (through the great good conceit wee abroad had of you) of heauen, to be now a figure of hell: looke then hereafter for ſmal commiſeration &amp; pitty, when too late you ſhall lament your incurable woe, which by giuing the full reynes to your paſſions, you haue indrenched and implunged your ſelues into.</p>
            <p>But howſoeuer at this time, many Catholicks were growne to be of Father <hi>Westons</hi> faction: yet it ſeemeth that ſome of themſelues, who beſt knew the impietie of it, &amp; what a dangerous ſcandall it gaue to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke cauſe, began to draw backe, as repenting ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much that euer the ſaid Agenage was attempted. For if M. <hi>Perpoint</hi> the lay Ieſuit, be an honeſt man, and his report to M. <hi>Dolman</hi> true, made in Iulie 1595. M. <hi>Garnet</hi> himſelfe vpon occaſion ſaid: <hi>that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer willing with the breach or diuiſion of commons:</hi> which being made plaine to him the ſaid M. <hi>Perpoint</hi> to be as falſe as God is true, his owne letters teſtifiyng the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, he the ſaid M. <hi>Perpoint</hi> anſwered, <hi>that he was well aſſured of it, that M. Garnet did now vtterlie miſlike it.</hi> Whether this laſt cauſe was true or no, it doth not much concerne vs, becauſe no man is able to bind vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Ieſuits word, they haue ſo manie ſhifts, and ſo little conſcience in ſpeaking truelie, except it be one of themſelues to another. Otherwiſe their manner is, to frame their ſpeeches, according to their companie: alwaies applying themſelues to the times and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they fall out: if their diſſeignements proue wel,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:621:24"/>
they take the contriuing ofthem to themſelues: if not, there is none will more condemne them: vtterlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing them, as hauing neuer liked them, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto them. Some further experience hereof, you ſhall finde in the proceſſe following concerning this good Prouinciall.</p>
            <p>You haue heard before in ſome ſort, how we were vſed by the aforeſaid faction amongſt vs at home, and by their adherents abroad in deprauing vs, and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering vs, farre beyond the limits of all Chriſtianitie. They charged vs to be ſtraglers, backbiters, liuers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rapine, extortioners, impugners of order, men of confuſion, violent perſons, deteyners of other mens goods, and with we know not how manie other impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties: whereof our conſciences beare vs witneſſe, wee were as cleare and free as the beſt Ieſuit in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Neither durſt the diuell himſelfe haue bin ſo impudent (as we ſuppoſe) to haue fraught their hearts with theſe conceits of vs, or framed their tongues to haue vttered them, had hee not firſt inueagled them with this moſt odious opinion: That detractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall (ſo that a ſingular perſon be not named) is no offence. Vpon which ground, they ranne a great while, not daring to touch vs with any particularities till at the laſt in plaine termes, they laid theft in effect to ſome of our charges. Now theſe and ſuch other like reports, flying farre and neere againſt vs, as though we had bin not Catholike Prieſts, but diuels incarnate, it pleaſed God to moue the diſcreeter ſort of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes in the North, to ſend vnto vs about a quarter of a yeere (after the aforeſaid ſeparation of commons) two learned Prieſts, M. <hi>Muſh,</hi> and M. <hi>Dudley,</hi> to ſee and vnderſtand how matters went with vs, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee were ſuch men, as the reports (made by our aduerſaries) went of vs. Theſe two, both of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcreete and zealous perſons, men of great traueile
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:621:24"/>
and paines in their vocations, and of eſpeciall eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the parts of their abode, for their great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, learning, and ſinceritie, comming vnto vs, and finding ſuch garboyles amongſt vs: they ſo demeaned themſelues, as on all ſides, we were content to impart our griefes vnto them, and to be aduiſed by them. Whereupon, after the debating of manie things, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing conſidered with themſelues, what courſe it were beſt to hold, for the repayring of the rent that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs (ſo ſcandalous and offenſiue to all true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes) they drew twelue articles, wherof one was, that wee ſhould all ioyne againe in commons in the common Hall: and the reſt did containe ſuch other orders, as they thought meete for quietneſſe to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by the whole companie. Which articles, they firſt offered to M. <hi>Weston</hi> and his fauourers to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, allowed, and ſubſcribed by them: but they albeit they ſhewed then no diſlike of them, yet they intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted M. <hi>Muſh</hi> and M. <hi>Dudley</hi> to carrie the ſame, firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to M. D. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> and M. <hi>Bluet</hi> (hoping as the euent declared) that they would preſentlie haue reiected them, as they had done before D. <hi>Bauyns</hi> ten men and the mouth: whereby hee himſelfe, and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents might haue more iuſt colour likewiſe to diſclame them. But contrarie to his expectation, wee of the vnitie, hauing well conſidered them, did preſentlie without any further delay, ſubſcribe vnto them verie willinglie and readilie. Whereat maiſter Agent and his ſubiects were much amazed: and in fine it pleaſed the good Father vtterlie in effect to reiect them: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that hee and his, had certaine rules of their owne approued vnto them, which they muſt follow, &amp; min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not now to alter or change them, for theſe which they offered or any ſuch like. Hereupon maiſter <hi>Muſh</hi> and maiſter <hi>Dudley</hi> (ſuppoſing they ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe any good amongſt vs) left vs: and tooke
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:621:25"/>
their iournie towards London, of purpoſe to conferre with the Catholickes there, about theſe matters and ſcandals amongſt vs. At their comming to the Citie, they found the laytie generally, &amp; likewiſe manie of the Cleargie, exceeding ſtiffely bent to iuſtifie maiſter <hi>Weston,</hi> with all his proceedings, and to condemne vs, eſpeciallie D. <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> and maiſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> as men of no worth, vnrulie, diſordered, and diſobedient perſons, not to be fauoured or reſpected by any. Beſides, ſuch a preiudicial opinion, they perceiued to haue poſſeſſed mens hearts, through their admiration of Ieſuitiſme, as if the Catholicke faith had neuer beene trulie prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, nor any good order rightlie eſtabliſhed, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, by vs poore ſecular Prieſts, or any of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors: before theſe yonkers thruſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, with high lookes and great bragges into our labours, and that it might be ſufficient for vs, if we might haue but ſome curateſhippes to ſay Maſſe, and ſo much fauour as to attend vpon them, to know their maiſterſhippes pleaſures what they would commaund vs. Theſe two godlie Prieſts, ſeeing the violence of this ſtreame, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the firſt but little reſiſtance: but as though they had inclined to the imputations againſt D. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> and maiſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> drew forth their ſaid articles before mentioned: and hauing read them in the hearing of ſome principall Catholickes, addicted as you haue heard, deſired their iudgements of them: who (thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they had beene maiſter <hi>Westons</hi> rules) did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere verie readilie, that they were reaſonable, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and godlie: ſuch as no honeſt Prieſt would, or could refuſe to admit &amp; allow of. And theſe be the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles (quoth maiſter <hi>Muſh)</hi> that D. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> and the reſt of the vnited companie haue very willinglie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnto: but haue beene verie peremptorilie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by Father <hi>Weston</hi> and the ninteene his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: whereby you ſee, that matters goe not at <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bich,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:621:25"/>
as (I well perceiue) you haue beene informed. Here they that were ſo readie to condemne vs, began to bluſh, and hold downe their heads, being willing to heare and know, what before (like proper iudges condemning Catholicke Prieſtes vnheard vpon an imagined opinion that the Ieſuits could not doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe) they would not indure to heare mentioned. So as after true knowledge, taken of the eſtate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of both ſides, and reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring what letters Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Weston</hi> &amp; his adherents had ſent abroad againſt D. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> and maiſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> and the reſt of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene vnited to the effect, <hi>that no Catholicks ſhould ſend them any reliefe, or countenance them, that therby through want, they might be compelled to yeeld to the regiment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon them by Father Garnet:</hi> they repented them of ſome courſes, which formerly they had held againſt vs: and deſired verie inſtantlie theſe two learned Prieſts to goe back againe to <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> and to ſpare no paines, vntill they had brought vs all to peace &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, giuing them great thanks, praiſe, and benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that which they had done alreadie. Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they anſwered, that they could be well content, to ſpend if it were their liues to bring that to paſſe; but at <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> they thought they could doe no good, except they could firſt perſwade him to order, who had been the authour and contriuer of thoſe nouelties (which had procured ſuch garboyles there) and that was (as they were informed) Father <hi>Garnet</hi> the Prouinciall of the Ieſuits. <hi>If we can</hi> (ſayd they) <hi>bring him to argue with vs touching that action, we doubt not, but that we ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with him: and then our trouble is in effect at an end before we begin: Eius eſt ſoluere, cuius eſt ligare; his letters to maister Weston &amp; his fauourers, were the cauſe of their ſeparation, and a word from him, will be ſufficient to reunite them.</hi> Now (as God would haue it) it ſo fell out, that according to their deſire, they met with maiſter <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:621:26"/>
who at their firſt incounter, ſeemed to be inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, affirming that he ſaw no reaſon why the Ieſuits might not gouerne, and haue as well the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence ouer all the ſecular prieſts in England, as they had at Rome, ouer the Engliſh Seminarie. With which proude anſwere they were ſomewhat ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and entred more roundlIe into farther commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with him: no whit fearing to tell him what they thought, aſwell of his ſaid wordes vnto them, as of other the Ieſuits proceedings in matters of ſtate, ſucceſſion of the Crowne, and ſuch like (hauing late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie peruſed maiſter <hi>Parſons</hi> booke of titles:) and alſo what account the ſecular Prieſts haue had with all true Catholickes, before his ſocietie was borne, and muſt ſtill haue of neceſſitie, except God in his ſecret iudgement, doe purpoſe ſome greater ouerthrow to the Catholicke faith, then they relying vpon his mercie, did any wayes expect. Manie words paſſed betwixt them, and ſome in ſuch heat, as he threatned to be euen with them for their good wils to the Ieſuits: but in the end hee was content to yeeld vnto them, and bidding them farewell, did write his letters to maiſter <hi>Weston,</hi> D. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> and ſome others, of his pleaſure and purpoſe, that the ſaid Agencie ſhould be committed to their further conſideration, to be either retained, or diſanulled, as they ſhould thinke meete: very hartilie deſiring them ſo to compound all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters amongſt themſelues, as that hereafter they might liue in quietnes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amongſt many fayre floriſhes, vſed by him to mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Doctor</hi> Bagſhaw, <hi>he writeth thus:</hi> Edmundum meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tibi ſocium &amp; adiutorem adhibeo. In this buſines, I aſſigne vnto you, as your company on and aſſistant, my beloued mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Edmonds. <hi>And againe:</hi> hiſce ego literis eum vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter moneo &amp;c. by theſe my letters to you, I do earneſtly admoniſh him (maiſter Edmonds) alias Weston, and alſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:621:26"/>
in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and in the vertue of his obedience, commaund him, that he apply his minde ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to the propounding and establiſhing of ſome rules, whereby an honeſt and firme friendſhip may grow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue amongst you. <hi>And in an other of his letters to a friend of his in</hi> Wiſbich <hi>at that time, he ſayth after this ſort:</hi> I do determine, that if an agreement be not now made, to write to the <hi>20.</hi> that Fa. Edmonds may liue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualty as the reſt, all or ſome by courſe performing that which was laid vpon him. <hi>What he writ to Fa.</hi> Weston <hi>we know not: but craftily inough, we are aſſured by his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes towards vs ſince: being as meere a Ieſuite, as if he had bin ſpit out of Fa.</hi> Parſons <hi>mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The aforeſayd two godly Prieſts, hauing wrought with maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> as you haue heard, returned to <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> where notwithſtanding the ſayd letters, they found Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> exceeding loth to lay downe the ſcepter of his Agencie, caſting out ſome words, as though he had not bin bound in that caſe to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his Prouinciall. Howbeit maiſter <hi>Muſh,</hi> and maiſter <hi>Dudley</hi> ſo vrged him before all the company, that ſundry of his owne adherents, perceiuing how the matter went, began to draw back from him, and ſayd, they would haue peace with their brethren, and diuide themſelues no longer from them. Whereupon (quoth maiſter <hi>Weſton)</hi> very pitifully: Ha, my maiſters, will you for ſake me thus? I would neuer haue left you, but ſith it is ſo, I am content to giue ouer: and thus ſpeaking, <hi>corruit inter manus diſcipuloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> he fell downe as if he had bin in a ſwoune, and much ado there was in recouering him. This entrance towards our vnity being made, then many things came in courſe to be debated, and particularly the report of theft publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed abroade by them of the Agenage: <hi>viz.</hi> that mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bluet</hi> and maiſter <hi>Potter</hi> had riotouſly deteyned from them ſo much Pewter, and other furniture, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:621:27"/>
to the value of 17. pound, and that they could haue no iuſtice for the recouering of it. And firſt for the better triall thereof, Fa. <hi>Weston,</hi> maiſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> and maiſter <hi>Potter,</hi> were required by the ſayd two Prieſts, that they would cauſe all the Pewter, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kitchin furniture which they had in their hands, ſeuerally to be brought forth: which was done by them all accordingly. Then maiſter <hi>Muſh</hi> and maiſter <hi>Dudley,</hi> ſent for a Pewterer, and willed him to view all the ſayd Pewter, and kitchin furniture, and to tell them truly, what he iudged it to be worth: which vpon due conſideration, and view had of it by the ſayd party, he affirmed it to be all ſcarce worth foure pound. Well then (ſayd maiſter <hi>Muſh)</hi> yeſterday, you maiſter mine (naming the partie) exclaimed that we had not the courage to ſay with Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt, non licet tibi habere,</hi> but now we aunſwere, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are not comparable to Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> yet as Prieſts muſt tell you playnely: <hi>non licet,</hi> it is not lawfull for you to infame and belye your fellow-priſoners, as we find you haue dealt with M. <hi>Bluet,</hi> and M. <hi>Potter.</hi> For we ſaw your letters abroade, wherein you charged them two, to with-hold from you 17. pound value in Pewter and kitchin furniture: and now we ſee, that all that both you and they haue, is ſcarce worth 4. pound. And therefore we ſay againe with Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt: non licet.</hi> You ought not ſo to haue belyed them, but are bound in conſcience to aske them forgiuenes: and with your ſecond letters to reuoke this ſlaunder that you haue ſo rayſed againſt them: which if you ſhall refuſe to do, we muſt be glad to do it for you. Now it is to be obſerued, that when maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> and his adherents diuided themſelues from vs, and made maiſter <hi>Brampstons</hi> chamber their kitchin, they found an oportunity to go into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon kitchin, and tooke from thence ſuch Pewter and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:621:27"/>
other furniture, as had bin prouided, and euer before vſed for the company in the common Hall; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thought it a kinde of theft, that any was detey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from them, but that they might haue had all.</p>
            <p>Theſe matters and others likewiſe, theſe two good Prieſts hauing compounded amongſt vs, they fell to the draught of new Articles, increaſing the ſaid 12. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much diſcuſſing of them on all ſides to the number of 19. Whereunto we all ſubſcribed in the yere 1595. the 6. of Nouember; and ſo after our long diſſenſions, a generall peace was concluded to our great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we dare be bold to ſay it; and maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> and his friends returned vnto vs againe, and tooke their commons with vs in the common Hall, as before their breach made they were accuſtomed. Now we being all of vs thus reunited, not long after it pleaſed maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> to write an other letter to maiſter Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> dated the 17. of Nouember 1595. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is very ſtrange to conſider, what ioy he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in that behalfe, whereas indeed, we are able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it vpon our owne knowledges, that the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of maiſter <hi>Westons</hi> agencie went to his heart: we meane vexed him, and angred him exceedingly. But heare the diueliſh Politician how he transformeth himſelfe into an angell of light. <hi>When the bleſſed ſoules in heauen</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>did ſing with one conſent, Glory be to God on high, you at Wiſbich preached, and restored comfort and in earth peace to men of good will: then no doubt the princes went before, the ſingers followed after, and in the middeſt were the damſels playing on their tymbrels.</hi> Alſo he telleth vs, <hi>that as there is a coelestiall Hierarchy in Heauen, ſo we had then an other at Wiſbich, which all Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land did reuerence: which the Queene of Saba admired: and which many from the vttermoſt borders of the earth came to ſee and behold:</hi> adding, <hi>that thoſe men were bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together with our ſeruants that ſtood in our preſence,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:621:28"/>
               <hi>that heard our wiſedome, and beheld our mutuall loue.</hi> Hereunto alſo, it may pleaſe you, that we adde ſome other words of his written to maiſter Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> two yeres before, after himſelfe had bin with vs at <hi>Wiſbich</hi> in the yeare 1593. concerning his iudgement of our whole company at that time: <hi>I aſſure you</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that the being with you hath wrought ſuch effect in the barts of all that were with me</hi> (being indeed three or four Gentlemen, whom we afterwards tearmed his Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and Subdeacons) <hi>that they neuer ſaw place or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which more delighted them: and for mine owne part, I tell you very ſincerely, that it was the greateſt comfort to be amongst you, which I had theſe whole ſeauen yeeres. Testis enim mihi eſt Deus, quomodo cupiam omnes vos in viſceribus Ieſu Christi: Which ſentence of S. Paule being read that very day in the Epistle in the Church, when I came firſt vnto you, with other many moſt comfortable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, I was both not a little recreated, with a conſcience of an vnfeyned loue towards euery one of you, and moued to thanke God almighty, Super communicatione vestra in Euangelio Christi à prima die vſque nunc: conſiderans quia qui caepit in vobis opus bonum, perficiet, ſicut eſt mihi iuſtum ſentire de omnibus vobis: And (that which conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me moſt of all) comforted with an aſſured hope, that you are they, who in your ſingular charities will haue me dayly in corde &amp; in vinculis vestris, &amp; in defenſione &amp; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matione Euangelij ſocium gaudij veſtri.</hi> Hitherto maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> then: and now againe in the letter before mentioned he profeſſeth: <hi>that being at that time with vs, he thought himſelfe all that while to haue felt the ioyes of Heauen.</hi> Now we referre our ſelues and our cauſe to your conſiderations, to iudge as God ſhall mooue you: If he the ſayd <hi>Garnet</hi> did thinke then truly of vs, and writ ſincerely as he thought, what cauſe had his ſubiect maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> before the yere 1593. or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, we continuing as before we were, to moyle and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:621:28"/>
make a faction amongſt vs for the ſetting vp of his Agency, as though we had bin not ſuch men, as mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Garnet</hi> ſayth he found vs, but as Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour his ambition reputed vs, that is, perſons of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, licentionſnes, and confuſion. And againe if maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> at his being with vs three or foure dayes, did thinke himſelfe all that while in Heauen: what a hell did he afterwards finde in his conſcience, when he had bin the chiefe cauſe that Father <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> and his adherents did ſeparate themſelues from vs. Moreouer if the ſayd letter congratulatorie for our vniting proceeded from maiſter <hi>Garnets</hi> hart: and that thereby we were indeed in his opinion ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, ſo wiſe, and ſo admirable perſons: how iuſtly may all Catholicks, that tooke part with the ſayd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parators from vs, and factious againſt vs, blame and condemne themſelues, in that we continuing our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſes without alteration, either in our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or in our regiment (if it may ſo be tearmed) from the time that maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> was with vs, vnto the very inſtant of our ſayd reconciliation: the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againe of maiſter <hi>VVeston</hi> and his adherents vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, is now reckoned by him the ſayd maiſter <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> to be a matter ſo glorious both to God and men, as he hath deſcribed it. But we will proceede.</p>
            <p>The aforeſayd Agencie being thus ouerthrowne, and a peace concluded amongſt vs, we for our parts, were repleniſhed with great ioy: but you are farre deceiued, as we our ſelues were, if you thinke as we then thought: that either maiſter <hi>Garnet,</hi> maiſter <hi>VVe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> or their Ieſuiticall crue, did take this ſo great a foyle in good part: we afterwards perceiued to our griefe, that maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> would neuer haue yeelded to haue ioyned in commons with vs againe, except maiſter <hi>Muſh,</hi> and maiſter <hi>Dudley</hi> vnder-hand had conſented vnto them, that if afterwards he and his

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:621:30"/>
It appeareth that by the Ieſuites practiſes here amongſt vs, in diſgracing and abuſing the ſecular prieſts very ſhamefully, there was ſome rumor thereof in <hi>Rome,</hi> to the great impeachment of the Ieſuites cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits there, being then as turbulent in that Citie in their dealing with our Engliſh Seminary, as they had bin, and were ſtill firebrands amongſt vs. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incountering of which rumor, it being thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient, that any of their owne calling by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending themſelues, ſhould take vpon them that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a ſecular prieſt was found out, a man of a quicker penne, then either of wiſedome or ſinceritie: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well acquainted with all the iarres and quarrels betwixt vs, and the Ieſuites; and hauing written him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a letter vnto vs, as preſuming to aduiſe men of farre greater experience then himſelfe, concerning our troubles about the ſayd Agencie: this man (we ſay) did ſo harden his forehead, or in his ſimplicitie was ſo ſeduced, as contrary to his owne conſcience he writ the tenth of Ianuary 1596. to Card. <hi>Caietan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in amongſt many other things, he aſſureth the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, that of his owne knowledge, for twenty yeeres, there had not bin any diſſenſion betwixt the ſecular prieſts and the Ieſuites: and that the reports made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe good Fathers, concerning their ambition, were ſo farre from the truth, as that indeed the Ieſuites were in all places moſt notable examples to the ſecular prieſts of ſingular humilitie, gentlenes, patience, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and charitie. The letter it ſelfe with ſome obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon it, you ſhall finde amongſt other things to this ſtory annexed. With this cunning trick of theſe good Fathers, we were not then acquainted: it was well handled of them, that they had got ſo falſe a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt our ſelues to fit their deſeignements
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:621:31"/>
ſo aptly, that is ſo lewdly, according to their deſire.</p>
            <p>After that maiſter <hi>Weston</hi> had begun his ſaid Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as hath been before mentioned, our brethren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of the grauer and wiſer ſort, began to foreſee: that if the ſame did continue, maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> would ſhortly after, as well by M. <hi>Weſtons</hi> example in <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> as alſo by the example of the Ieſuits gouernment of the Seminarie at <hi>Rome,</hi> challenge, and take vnto himſelfe, ere it were long, the Prelacie and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer all the Prieſts in <hi>England.</hi> For the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whereof, as alſo there being many Catholicke Prieſts in <hi>England,</hi> and many wants, as of authoritie of confirmation for the full accompliſhing of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Baptiſme, and of holy oyle, being of ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie imployment, they thought it conuenient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe certaine orders, for a general aſſociation, amongſt all ſecular Prieſts: and in the end concluded to referre the eſtate of our Church here, together with their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and moſt humble ſupplication to the Popes Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, that it might ſtand with his good pleaſure (if he thought it conuenient) to graunt vnto them that they might haue ſome Biſhop or ſuffragane here: as he had yeelded heretofore to our brethren in <hi>Ireland.</hi> In theſe conſultations, one maſter <hi>Standiſh</hi> a Prieſt was a great intermedler, no man being therein more forward then himſelfe: but finding in the end ſo many fitter men in all reſpects then himſelfe for any imployment or extraordinarie preferment in that companie: he ſhortly after ſhifted his ſayles, &amp; going to the Ieſuits, did acquaint them with the whole courſe that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſts had taken, and intended to proceede in. Whereof they (the Ieſuits) hauing full notice (as we geſſe by the euent) ſent into <hi>Spayne,</hi> to admoniſh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons</hi> of all the premiſſes, aſwell concerning maiſter <hi>VVestons</hi> ſaid Agencie, and the ouerthrowe of it, as of the enterpriſe, which our brethren the ſecular
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:621:31"/>
Prieſts here had in hand: and likewiſe to impart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, an other courſe deuiſed by them, &amp; to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter managed and brought to paſſe by his great poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, wiſedome and credit. What anſwere Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> returned vnto them, wee can but alſo geſſe. But we thinke wee may coniecture it, by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, <hi>viz.</hi> that he would thinke of the matter, and that they ſhould ſend one to meet him at Rome with further inſtructions, for his better proceeding to the accompliſhment of their deſires. Now you haue heard before, what a way they had made alreadie for themſelues, and for the repayring of their credit in Rome, by maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> his falſe letter mentioned, very well knowing, that if any meanes might be had to aduance their credits, and ſet them aloft, it muſt come from thence, and therefore laid that machiuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ground for Father <hi>Parſous</hi> their only hope to work vpon afterwardes: which as you ſee fell out, as they could haue wiſhed at that time.</p>
            <p>Alſo the ſaid Father <hi>Parſons</hi> (then as wee ſuppoſe) or ſhortlie after, hauing taken notice what our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſecular Prieſts were in hand with in <hi>England,</hi> did ſend to ſome of the beſt account amongſt them, and likewiſe to ſome others that in any ſort, they ſhould not proceed in that courſe: aſſuring them that it would be very offenſiue to his holines, becauſe of this knowledge, the very ſame in effect, hauing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore beene offered to his conſideration, hee did vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie reiect the ſame as inconuenient in all reſpects as things ſtood for <hi>England.</hi> Beſides to our further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, and to keep vs occupied with our own concits, that wee might not ſomuch as ſuſpect any thing of theirs: wee in our plaine dealing acquainted them with our whole drift, and purpoſe. Whereunto for a time, they craftilie applauded: as hoping ſhortlie, by their former courſes to haue it daſht: but afterward
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:621:32"/>
perceiuing that their owne purpoſes could not ſo ſoone be compaſſed: (as wiſe men in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fearing the worſt) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they mightilie oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues, and depraued ours. And then maiſter <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> himſelfe amongſt others could write a diſcourſing letter with very much earneſtnes and rhetoricall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt ſo ambitious a cogitation, as once to thinke of any one mans Soueraignty ouer all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, during the times of our perſecution.</p>
            <p>Howbeit wee continuing reſolute in our former purpoſe, but proſecuting the ſame with great dulnes, maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> and his fellowers, diſpatched the ſaide maiſter <hi>Standiſh,</hi> our falſe brother to Rome in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the yeere 1596. there to expect Father <hi>Parſons</hi> comming. We will here leaue this honeſt man about his buſines in that Citie, and put you in mind, that after Cardinall <hi>Allens</hi> death, the ſtudents in the Engliſh Colledge there, felt no leſſe oppreſſion by the Ieſuits their tyranizing gouernours, then wee did at home: becauſe we withſtood their deſeignements in aſpiring to the like ſoueraigntie ouer vs here. It may be that hereafter ſome of our brethren, will ſet out thoſe tragedies at large, which indured long, and will appeare to all men of indifferencie to haue beene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie intolerable. In the meane while you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that two or three, being of likelihood more grieued then the reſt, or hauing a greater ſenſe of our calamities, both at home and abroad, then manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: did write a treatiſe of the Ieſuits dealing, &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it a memoriall, dedicated the ſame in Latine to his holines in the yeere 1597. about which time Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons</hi> being come to Rome, was in the middeſt of all his machiuilian plots, and vnder pretence of compounding the ſtirres in that Seminarie, firſt ſo dealt, as in verie ſhort time by couſoning the Rector, he got that place for himſelfe, and now enioyeth it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:621:32"/>
The imputations laid vpon the Ieſuits in the ſaide memoriall (the effect whereof you ſhall finde at the end of this hiſtorie) were ſo verie ſharpe, and touched their freehold ſo neerely, as no meruaile if Father <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> beſtirred his ſtumps to ſalue their credits by all the meanes and wayes he could deuiſe. And therefore he held it beſt to write his letter to all the ſecular Prieſts: wherin after certaine flouriſhes, how much they were beloued and honoured by him and all his brethren of the ſocietie, he intreateth very earneſtlie their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in their behalfe, againſt thoſe reports made of the Ieſuits in the ſaid memoriall. And that hee might obtaine a faire ſhew of many hands, hee was content to play ſmall game before hee would ſit out (as our Engliſh prouerb ſaith:) and therfore he commendeth to them ſuch a triple anſwere, as he thought would fit the moſt. <hi>Although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are not ſo well known to many of you, as you all peraduenture will pronounce the whole contents of the ſaid treatiſe to be falſe: yet one of theſe three anſwers may ſit all your turnes. Some may ſay all is falſe: other that they themſelues haue nothing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Ieſuits with, and doe not therefore beleeue the ſaid reports to be true: and the reſt may affirme without any ſcruple, that for their parts, they neuer dreamed of the ſaid memoriall, nor doe in any ſort approue the ſame.</hi> And the better to perſwade them thus to anſwere, he ſweareth by more then his little honeſty, <hi>that there is not a true word in it.</hi> There is a ſaying amongſt ſuch lawyers as are of experience, that they ſeldome fall out to be the honeſteſt men, who aredriuen ſo oft to ſeeke teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials for the approuing of their good behauior. But that is no matter with them, and peraduenture, that conceit here holdeth not at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo as maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> did content himſelfe with his owne courſe, and made ſuch haſte therin, as before Auguſt the ſame yeere, the teſtimonial he got, was with Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> in the Engliſh
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:621:33"/>
Seminary. And here we cannot omit one thing, which indeede made vs a little merry in the middeſt of our ſorrow, how good Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> was troubled with one mans ſubſcription to the ſayd teſtimoniall. For thus he writeth: as he pretendeth from <hi>Naples, primo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusti</hi> 1598. to the ſayd party. <hi>After I ſaw a particular testimony of your owne hand in latine, concerning the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall giuen vp againſt the ſocietie, I could haue bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you had not written it: but either haue ſubſcribed ſimpliciter, as many other auncient and graue Prieſts did to the cunning letter, as it was written (being very modeſt and moſt true) or that you had ſayd nothing at all: as well you might haue omitted: the memoriall being writ and ſent from Plaunders, whileſt you were yet in Italy: and ſo that it was done, and exhibited, Te neque conſentiente, neque conſcio (for thoſe are only the words of testimony that you giue) was not needefull: the thing being euident of it ſelfe, and your particular writing ſo bare a thing vnder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon letter, was to detract from all the letter before: and for the matter it ſelfe (which was moſt abhominable, falſe, and ſlaunderous,) you leaue it indifferent to be beleeued, or not beleeued</hi> &amp;c. Were it not that you might hereby perceiue what packing, and practiſing is amongſt theſe fellowes for the maintenance of their owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: and how ſwift they are in the expeditions they take in hand: we would haue made no mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, becauſe thereby our owne dulnes may iuſtly be condemned, who all this while had not ſent our meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to <hi>Rome,</hi> for the information of his holynes, as touching our eſtates here, and the common deſire of vs ſecular Prieſts, for a Biſhop as before is mentioned. In which ſlow proceeding, we will leaue our brethren for a time, and returne to maiſter <hi>Standiſh</hi> attending vpon Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this good Father had gotten the Rectorſhip of the Engliſh Seminary, it then pleaſed his Worſhip
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:621:33"/>
to proceede with the cauſe commended vnto him by his ſubiects in England, Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> and the reſt. We doubt not, but that in the meane time he had confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his friends, and was reſolued of the plot he meant to effect: the execution whereof was in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as followeth. <hi>Standiſh</hi> that honeſt man muſt haue acceſſe to the Popes holynes, accompanyed with two runnagates, both of them Prieſts, Doctor <hi>Haddock,</hi> and maiſter Martin <hi>Array.</hi> Theſe muſt take vpon them, and ſo they did, that they were men deputed from the ſecular Prieſts in <hi>England,</hi> moſt humbly to intreate his Holynes that he would be pleaſed by his moſt preheminent Authority, to appoynt a ſuperior ouer the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And the rather to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him thereunto, they affirmed like very lying wretches, that there was ſuch great diſſenſion betwixt the ſecular prieſts and the laytie, as great inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences would certainely inſue, except one were placed amongſt them, that by his authority might reforme and reconcile them. Now it is too well knowne, that the ſtrife which was heere, reſted betwixt vs and the Ieſuites; no one lay Catholick (for ought we know) being at enmity with any other ſecular Prieſts, then with ſome few of vs, that were at <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> and one or two more abroad that tooke our parts: and the diſlike that ſuch lay perſons had of vs, was procured by the falſe practiſe of the Ieſuites: we our ſelues, otherwiſe hauing neuer offended them, nor interteyned any quarrell with them, God is our iudge. His Holynes hearing and marking well their ſuite, demaunded of them, in expreſſe tearmes, if that which they had ſayd vnto him, proceeded from the deſire and conſent of his louing Prieſts in <hi>England,</hi> affirming that otherwiſe he would in no ſort giue any eare vnto them. Where-unto maiſter <hi>Sandiſh,</hi> very well inſtructed before by Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and ſufficiently aſſiſted by the ſayd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:621:34"/>
two lying Prieſts, anſwered, that what he had preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to deliuer to his Holynes, he had done it moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly by their conſent. If <hi>Ananias</hi> was iuſtly charged with lying to the holy Ghoſt, in telling Saint <hi>Peter</hi> an vntruth, being repleniſhed with that holy ſpirit, we ſee no cauſe, why we may not ſo charge this diſhoneſt company on with all his aſſiſtants (Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> and the reſt) in that they Iyed ſo apparantly to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor the Popes Holynes, who we doubt not, but that he is likewiſe indued with the ſpirit of God in ſuch plentifull ſort, as the excellency of his high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling doth require. For it is well knowne, and may be proued moſt euidently, (if any dare be ſo ſhameleſſe as to deny it) that if you except Fa. <hi>Garnet,</hi> and ſome one or two of his adherents, the reſt of the Prieſts in <hi>England</hi> generally were altogether ignorant of that deuiſe. Inſomuch as the ſayd <hi>Standiſh</hi> after his returne into <hi>England,</hi> being asked by certaine Prieſts, how he durſt preſume ſo impudently to abuſe his Holynes with ſo intolerable an vntruth, he excuſed himſelfe in this ſort, <hi>viz. that when he ſayd, he had the conſent of the ſecular Prieſts in England to make that motion, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere therein was made by him Cautè, that is, ſubtilly, or by equiuocation, meaning to himſelfe, viz. as he ſuppoſed, or preſumed; which words he kept in his minde and vttered not.</hi> By which vngodly ſhift, the tyranny wherewith now we are oppreſſed, was hatched.</p>
            <p>By this ſo falſe and Ieſuiticall a ſleight, the Popes Holynes being abuſed as you haue heard, committed that matter (ſo propounded vnto him) to the further conſideration of Cardinall <hi>Caietane,</hi> protector of the Engliſh Seminary, and to Cardinall <hi>Burgheſius,</hi> which was the very plot that Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> before had layd: the ſayd Cardinall protector, being one, with whom he the ſayd <hi>Parſons</hi> had eſpeciall familiaritie and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and by reaſon of his protectorſhip ouerruled the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:621:34"/>
other Cardinall as he thought good: ſo as they two being appointed for this ſeruice, <hi>Parſons</hi> deſeigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in effect thereby accompliſhed. Well it had hapned to vs, if his Holynes had bin at that time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with that worthie gift of the holy Ghoſt, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>diſcretio ſpirituum:</hi> that when he made this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to the Cardinall, he might haue ſayd to the aforeſayd falſe wretches: why haue you lyed to the holy Ghoſt, that thereby, either ſome extraordinary calamitie might haue fallen vpon them, or his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes haue taken ſome other courſe for the inflicting vpon them ſuch puniſhment as they deſerued. But the matter paſſed as you haue heard: and <hi>Parſons</hi> muſt contriue it as he thinketh it conuenient, which he did in ſort as followeth. One muſt gouerne all the Prieſts in <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Parſons</hi> durſt not name a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite for that purpoſe: that had bin too groſſe dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he muſt then be a ſecular Prieſt, there was no remedie. And who ſhould that be, but maiſter <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> who was knowne to be a chiefe paraſite of the Ieſuites, and would be ſure, if he might haue this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie by them, neuer to do any thing, that might in any ſort diſpleaſe them. Whereupon <hi>Blackwell</hi> is named for the Arch-prieſt of <hi>England:</hi> aſſiſtants are appointed to wayt vpon him: a letter with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals conſent is framed by Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> dated the ſeauenth of March 1598. rules are made, and one in effect you may be ſure, that maiſter Arch-prieſt and his aſſiſtants ſhall do nothing in any matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, without the Ieſuites conſents. All things thus diſpatched, maiſter <hi>Standiſh</hi> (as wee thinke) is ſent back with this ſtuffe into <hi>England;</hi> and euen when our two meſſengers were ready at the laſt to go towards <hi>Rome,</hi> he arriueth: maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth his authoritie, and publiſheth the ſame for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:621:35"/>
want of a Cryer by his owne letters: requiring all Prieſts to ſubſcribe vnto it.</p>
            <p>Hereof when ſundry of vs had notice, we confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together as we could: and finding that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals directions were not warranted, by any Breue from his Holynes: we feared ſome falſe packing by Father <hi>Parſons.</hi> Alſo ſome of our brethren talking with maiſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> about the Cardinals conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tooke him directly with a manifeſt forgery, in pretending certaine to haue come from the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall which he was driuen to confeſſe, were of his owne making. Beſides we conſidered, that if the Pope were made acquainted with the ſayd Cardinals deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; what he did, or allowed therein, was vpon falſe ſuggeſtion, (for as then wee did not certainely know, how <hi>Standiſh</hi> had played the Ieſuite by <hi>Parſons</hi> aduiſe as is before expreſſed. Againe, wee perceiued by the Cardinals inſtructions, that maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> was made no better in deede then an Arch-prieſt of cloutes, being limited to do nothing, but as it ſhould pleaſe maiſter <hi>Garnet.</hi> And it could not ſinke into our heads, that his Holynes being throughly acquainted with theſe plots, would euer haue bin drawne to haue yeelded, that his Clergie of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topt, and controuled by the new vpſtart Ieſuites. We alſo did eaſily ſee into what danger this ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination would bring vs, being left in effect to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons</hi> directions. For theſe, and ſundry other conſiderations, we deſired that we might not be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſubſcribe to the ſayd authoritie, vntill wee might either ſee the Popes Breue to ratifie it, or haue time to know his Holynes further pleaſure: when we ſhould haue informed him the truth in theſe matters. Vpon our ſtay herein, (which ſeemed to vs ſo reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,) it is ſcarſe credible, how we were ſlaundered
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:621:35"/>
and abuſed: inſomuch as through ſuch and many other iniuries offred by the Arch-prieſt and Ieſuites vnto vs, we were compelled to appeale to his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But we were ſtill too ſlow and dull in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and indeede wanted money, and other fit oportunities to make ſuch quick diſpatch as we deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Whereupon Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> and maiſter <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> abounding in all things, and perceiuing our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they preſently diſpatched their curſitors into euery part of the Realme, to get hands to certaine letters (drawne either by them, or by their direction) of thankeſgiuing to the Pope, and Protector, for their ſingular care ouer the Church heere, in appointing vnto them ſo excellent a forme of gouernment: with much more to this purpoſe. And ſuch a courſe was taken with our poore brethren, who many of them had neuer heard of this matter before, as partly through ignorance in ſome, through threatning and feare in others, and by faire promiſes to many; a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of hands were gotten to the ſayd letters. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployt thus effected, they ſent the ſayd letters with all ſpeede to <hi>Rome,</hi> and procured by their meſſengers as they went, other letters, from ſundry perſons beyond the ſeas to their friends in that City to depraue our enterpriſe as much as poſſibly they could, affirming that what our meſſengers, when they came thither, ſhould propound againſt the ſubordination in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> did proceede only from a few that were factious, and that it would be very diſhonorable to his Holynes former proceedings, if they ſhould finde any fauour or countenance there.</p>
            <p>With theſe aforeſaid Machiuilian practiſes, wee were not then acquainted, but as honeſt and plaine dealing men; when our ſaid meſſengers, maiſter <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> and maiſter <hi>Charnock,</hi> two learned Prieſtes, were
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:621:36"/>
readie to goe to Rome to proſecute our cauſes there: we acquainted our Archprieſt therewith and deſired, (if ſo it might ſtand with his pleaſure) to ſende ſome thither alſo, that might be furniſhed to anſwere for him, if we ſhould be thought to informe amiſſe. This motion of ours, was ſo greatlie diſdained by his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip, as wee thinke the higheſt Cardinall in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, could not with greater contempt haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meaneſt Prieſt his ſute y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> liueth. And relying vpon Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and his other ſaid plots, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to tell vs plainelie (to the great preiudice of iuſtice in the Court of Rome) that if we ſent any thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſhould not be heard, but finde that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, which they little expected. Howbeit wee neuer imagined, nor could in deed thinke, either of thoſe meſſages which they had ſent before, or of that which followed: but rather ſuppoſed he had vſed ſuch ſpeeches vnto vs of purpoſe to ſtay vs from procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in our former determination. And therefore we diſpatch them hence, who being gone, our Archprieſt chafeth: the Prouinciall his good maiſter, clappes him on the backe and egges him forward: the reſt of the Ieſuits whet their tongues and prepare their pens to ſpeake and write what they can falſelie deuiſe againſt vs to make vs odious: ſo as preſentlie, we are become a by-word in their mouthes, &amp; are nothing with them but <hi>Rebels, Apostataes,</hi> and what they liſt to report of vs. One <hi>Lister</hi> a Ieſuit writeth a booke to proue vs al ſchiſmatikes, who had appealed to Rome, and both maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> and Father <hi>Garnet</hi> ſubſcribed vnto it. In this booke, beſides the tearmes before expreſſed, we are ſaid <hi>to haue fallen from the Church, and the ſpouſe of Chriſt: to haue troden vnder our feete our obedience due to the higheſt biſhop: to haue loſt our faculties, whereby we ought to haue wonne ſoules vnto Chriſt: to haue made</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:621:36"/>
               <hi>our ſelues irregular: to haue incurred the ſentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication: to haue giuen a ſcandall to all goodmen: to be in all mens mouthes as infamous perſons: to be as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes and ſinners, and to be nothing better then ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers and Idolaters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee haue now brought this ſtory to the ſetting out againſt vs of the ſayd treatiſe of ſchiſme: and for the reſt do referre you for a larger diſcourſe to the bookes lately printed and publiſhed by ſome of our brethren. Therein you ſhall finde that by Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> practiſes, our ſayd meſſengers no ſooner came to <hi>Rome,</hi> but within ſixe or ſeauen dayes they were caſt into priſon, and could neuer be ſuffred to come to the Pope. Whileſt they were in priſon, his Holynes Breue is procured for the confirmation of maiſter <hi>Blackwels</hi> authoritie. Afterwards the poore men are ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, but kept aſunder, and baniſhed into diuers Prouinces, not to repayre into <hi>England,</hi> vntill they ſhould haue leaue from <hi>Rome.</hi> The ſayd Breue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hither: wee being informed thereof, ſubmit our ſelues to our Arch-prieſt: ſhewing our ſelues to be farre from ſchiſmaticks; and ſuch was our deſire of peace, as we were well content to remit all the former ſlaunders imputed moſt falſely vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Beſides, for the auoyding of further contention, we deſired our Arch-prieſt, (whome now we reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced as we were bound in dutie) to take ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as that hereafter there might not be ſo much as once mention made of the ſayd pretended ſchiſme. Whereunto he yeelded very willingly, and made a Decree to that effect: promiſing to be a meanes that our ſayd two brethren might be releaſed of their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. His dealing with vs in this kinde ſort did very much comfort vs, becauſe we being men, who ſtill had bin afflicted, any thing ſeemed a great
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:621:37"/>
benefit to vs. But ſhortly after we well perceiued, that our former appellation and ſending to <hi>Rome</hi> with our refuſall in the meane time to bow vnto him, did ſtick in his ſtomack. For whether prouoked by the malitious Ieſuites, or ſtirred vp by his owne pride, and rancor to be reuenged vpon vs, now that we had ſubmitted ourſelues vnto his gouernment, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the remembrance of the old ſore, contrary to his ſayd decree, and that vnder the pretence of a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſhould come vnto him from <hi>Rome,</hi> from two Ieſuites, <hi>Tichborne,</hi> and <hi>Warford:</hi> wherein he ſayd, it was expreſtely ſet downe, that we were iudged in <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſchiſmaticks before the obteyning of the ſayd Breue, in that we did not ſubſcribe to his authoritie, when the Cardinals firſt letters were intimated vnto vs. And vpon this falſe ground (except theſe two Ieſuites and ſome one or two more of that crue had ſo iudged vs) he writ his letters abroade to that effect, as well what forſooth he had receiued from <hi>Rome,</hi> (concealing the names of the ſayd two Machiuilian Ieſuites) as alſo that he would receiue none to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour or abſolue them, which would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they had ſinned, and giuen a great ſcandale by their ſayd prolonging to acknowledge his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. When we heard hereof, it grieued vs much to ſee the weakenes of our new Gouernour: but more in that we perceiued what new troubles and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions would thereby inſue. We did write therefore both to him and to his aſſiſtants, that they would be pleaſed, the old controuerſie amongſt vs might lye buryed ſtill in the graue of obliuion, and not to be againe now renewed. But they ſhut their eares to our humble ſuites, and reiect vs with contumelious and reprochfull words, for preſuming ſo raſhlie (forſooth) to intermeddle with any thing that they had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:621:37"/>
of. Notwithſtanding becauſe they were our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and many of them before that time ſome of our inferiors; we aduentured once againe to intreate this fauour at their hands, that two or three of the beſt learned amongſt them, might be appointed to conferre of this matter with as many of vs: that ſo the controuerſie might be compounded, before it brake out any further. How this was taken at our hands, it is ſcarcely credible: they tearmed our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication a tumultuous expoſtulation, being fraught (as they ſayd) with the forgetfulnes of our duties, and with the ſpirit of pride and preſumption. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon euen now, that we were become his ſubiects, after we had vnderſtanding of the Popes Breue, and looked to haue bin greatly cheriſhed and defended from iniuries by the ſtrength of his ſoueraigne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, we are againe as ſharply proſecuted with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of ſchiſme and rebellion as we were before, which cauſed vs to propound the queſtion in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie amongſt vs, to the famous Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris:</hi> hauing offered to them before, but in vayne, if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to ioyne with vs therein. That worthie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany after due conſideration, determined the matter on our ſide. Whereof the Arch-prieſt being informed, addreſſeth out his owne edict, and condemneth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their ſayd iudgement: inflicteth great cenſures vpon thoſe Prieſts that ſhould at any time mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine that determination: and ſpareth not likewiſe to mulct the laytie (ouer whom for ought we know he hath no authoritie at all) as many as ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the imbracing and fauoring of it.</p>
            <p>When we ſaw this our Arch-prieſt with his aſſiſtants thus peremptorilie bent by ſtrong hand to oppreſſe vs: and without either conſcience, or conſideration of morall honeſtie to ſpreade abroade againe to our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:621:38"/>
diſcredits their former calumniations, and very groſſe and palpable ſlaunders: we thought it our beſt courſe if it were but to heape coales vpon their heads, to commend vnto them this conſideration: whether it might not ſtand with their good liking to ſend two Prieſts to be choſen by them, with two others of ours to <hi>Rome</hi> to know his Holynes opinion and direction in this cauſe ſo hotely impugned by them: the ſame being the aſſured rule for the ending and finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of it: adding, that if we were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ſchiſinaticks, for delaying our obedience, as is before expreſſed, till we knew his Holynes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we would moſt willingly ſubiect our ſelues to the heauieſt cenſures that might be impoſed vpon vs: and if cleared, the leaſt ſatisfaction that they would thinke good to award vs, ſhould fully pleaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vs. But this our laſt ſuite was more diſdained (if it were poſſible) then either of the former: and ſo farre the Arch-prieſt was from yeelding vnto vs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or to affoord vs otherwiſe the leaſt ſhadow of his fauour, as he caſt abroade his decrees, that our ſayd deferring to receiue his authoritie before the Breue came, was ſchiſme, and prohibiteth any vnder grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous paynes, either by word or writing to affirme the contrary. Whereupon we were compelled, as hauing no other refuge at all, to appeale againe to the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſeate of the holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> thinking with our ſelues that thereby (at the leaſt till the cauſe were decided) our aduerſaries would haue forborne the proſecution of their malice againſt vs. But the humor they are poſſeſſed with, being altogether Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiticall, that is violent and implacable, they ceaſed not but ſtill continued, contrary to all courſe of law &amp; iuſtice, euery day more and more to wound and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe vs. Our ſayd appellation ſubſcribed with the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:621:38"/>
hands of 30. Prieſts, men of good deſert and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they tearme an infamous libell, and preſently vpon the ſight thereof, <hi>de facto,</hi> do ſuſpend and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue tenne of them from their faculties: eight of them being priſoners at <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> and two others, both of them perſons of extraordinary note and worth. There hath bin of long time an old ſaying in <hi>England:</hi> that ſet a begger on horſeback, and he will ride a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop: our ſaid new gouernors ſitting in their thrones, and ſcorning that any ſhould refuſe to worſhip them, can finde no limits for the ſtay of their fury, but ſtill runne on from one miſchiefe to an other. For, our cauſe thus depending, they forbid all the lay Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks to keepe vs company, to relieue vs, or to ſuffer vs to execute any ſpirituall function with them: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that whoſoeuer ſhall be preſent at one of our Maſſes, or aſſiſt vs therein, doth commit a great ſinne: and that to receiue the ſacraments at our hands, is <hi>loco medicaminis,</hi> to receiue a deadly poyſon. None may confeſſe their ſinnes vnto vs, and none may heare vs preach, (at the leaſt of thoſe which are to too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) that yeeld themſelues to the direction and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſuch abſurd commaunders, and wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demners of their brethren, notwithſtanding we be exempted from ſuch their prohibitions by our appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and do therefore ſtill mioy the full libertie of our Prieſthood. The courſe they hold againſt vs, or at the leaſt their ſtomack, may appeere vnto you, by that which a Ieſuite hath written concerning vs, to one of his friends: <hi>Deteſt</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>my deere mother the curſed crue of the diſobedient to lawfull authoritie: if you know any, either of our coate, or of the lay ſort, that be tainted with this pestilent poyſon, eſchue his company, as you would auoyd one that hath a plague-ſore running vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, aſſuring your ſelfe, that if ſuch rebelliow perſons do not ſubmit their necks to the yoke of their ſuperiors,</hi>

               <hi>that vnleſſe God ſhew them ſome extraordinary fanour (which in ſuch caſes he vſually denyeth to ſuch malitious Rebels) their reuolt and Apostaſie from the Catholicke vnitie, will be the iuſt reward of their obstinacie and mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert oppoſition againſt their ordinary.</hi> God be mercifull vnto vs poore men: ſome of vs are priſoners, and are daily in the Magiſtrates hands to be cut off, and finiſh our miſeries at their pleaſures; and on the other ſide, where we ſhould finde comfort, we are dealt with, as you ſee: and all is either becauſe we are readie to offer our liues for the Catholick faith, or refuſe, till we may be heard by the Popes Holynes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to acknowledge our ſelues to be Rebels, Schiſmaticks, contemners of the See Apoſtolick, Ethnicks, Publicanes, Idolaters, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtataes, and what not? becauſe we did not at the firſt ſubſcribe to our Archbiſhops authoritie, but appealed as you haue heard. Which acculations, we truſt no man liuing by learning or arguments ſhall be able to prooue againſt vs: and in the meane time, God is our witnes, how free we are <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> from any of theſe wicked imputations. In the aforeſayd proceſſe with theſe our aduerſaries, ſome of our brethren haue bin as carefull to defend vs from ſchiſme by writing, as they haue bin buſie to accuſe vs: and amongſt ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of our diſcourſes to that eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, if any Ieſuitical humoriſt, ſhall blame or ſeeke to diſcredit vs, becauſe in the premiſſes of this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we haue forborne to vſe any ſharp ſpeeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our common enemyes, we thinke it conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the preuenting of their malitious collections, to yeeld vnto you our reaſons thereof. Firſt, the ſtory gaue vs no occaſion ſo to do. Secondly, we reteyne ſtill the opinion which we haue ſignified to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:621:39"/>
that the Ieſuiticall perſecution begun againſt vs, is much more grieuous vnto vs, then that which we are ſubiect vnto from the State. Thirdly, we haue found by experience, that the rayling courſe which the Ieſuiticall crue haue taken and vſed in many of their treatiſes againſt her Maieſtie: and the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings by the lawes of the Realme: hath done the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick cauſe exceeding much hurt. Fourthly, as our caſe ſtandeth, and for ought we ſee, if the pretended holy Fathers may haue their willes, we ſhall be driuen to relye more vpon her Highnes fauour for our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall reliefe, that we periſh not with famine, before we be cut off by her lawes, then vpon all the world beſides. And laſtly, howſoeuer we diſſent from the State in the profeſſion of our Religion: yet we are her Maieſties borne ſubiects, and vaſſals, and ought not for any cauſe, as we are perſwaded, to withdraw in that reſpect, our duties, loue, and allegiance from her Highnes, or our natiue Countrie: much leſſe to ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or ſecke the cruell ouerthrow of both, as our tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous aduerſaries of the ſocietie, not indeede of Ieſus, but of the Diuell, and their adherents haue done. And thus praying to God with all our hearts, to heape vpon her Maieſtie all temporall and heauenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and vpon our ſtate ſufficient wiſedome and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, for the good continuance of it: and vpon our Countrie all proſperitie and happines, and vpon the Church a dayly increaſe of zeale for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and maintenance of the Catholick faith, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our Ieſuiticall aduerſaries ſuch riches of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as ſeeing the height of their owne pride, and the excremities of their proceedings, they may become humble in their owne eyes, and deſiſt from their very prowde Machiuilian and cruell deſeignements: and vpon all Catholicks ſufficient grace to take heed of thoſe that are the authors of ſchiſme and contention:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:621:40"/>
delighting in nothing, but in factions and nouelties: and vpon our ſelues conſtancie to continue in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and patience, to be able to indure whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer calamities ſhall happen vnto vs for our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the truth, and the diſcharge of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: we take our leaues, and do heere end for this time.</p>

So holie, ſo godly, ſo religious would they ſeeme to be; as nothing is holie, that they haue not ſanctified; no doctrine Catholick, and ſound, that commeth not from them; no diſpenſation auailable, that is not graunted by them: and which is worſe, they haue beaten into the heads of the moſt, that the Maſſe is not rightly, and orderly celebrated of any, but a Ieſuite.</p>

               <p>Further they endeuor, that by all meanes poſſible, both thoſe almes which are giuen for the reliefe of them that are in priſon, or any other poore afflicted whatſoeuer; as alſo whatſoeuer is paid in caſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, may come to their hands. Heretofore (when Prieſts had the collection of theſe almes) priſons were therewith maintayned; the want in Colledges was ſupplyed; the baniſhed Catholicks (whoſe goodes were forciblie taken from them by Hereticks) were yerely ſuccoured: but now, what is done with them we know not. Priſons and Colledges are depriued of them; the baniſhed haue them not; the Prieſts ſee them not: but there are hired herewith ſeditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; deuiſers of fables, ſlaunderers of their brethren, and skorners of the Saincts are herewith enriched; theſe, and ſuch as theſe, receiue large ſtipends of their labours.</p>
               <p>And yet ſo great a maſſe of monies cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, with ſo ſmall charges, and expences, but that the Fathers alſo beſtow much vpon themſelues.

The ſecular Prieſts themſelues do go alſo Gentlemen-like becauſe of danger; but not arayed in that ſumptuous manner, nor guarded with ſo many attendants, as the Ieſuites. They wrangle, and reproue the Prieſts garments, and ſpendings; whereas the expences of one Ieſuite were able to mayntayne twentie Prieſts plentifully, and richly. Neither by

this meanes alſo could ſo great a quantitie of almes be waſted, but that (as the report goes) much treaſure is conueyed beyond the Seas, but to what purpoſe, we know not, vnleſſe it be beſtowed vpon their bodie, their corporation, or ſocietie.</p>
               <p>Beſides they deſire (as ſome conceiue) that <hi>England</hi> ſhould be conuerted of none but Ieſuites only. For they will admit no fellow-laborers: and they vſe the ſame meanes they heretofore vſed in Colledges, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade many for the order of their calling, counſelling them by all meanes to enter into their ſocietie; and this they dayly attempt by flatterie, by gifts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, &amp; ſometimes by threatnings. They neuer ſend one ſcholler out of <hi>England</hi> to the Colledge at <hi>Doway</hi> to ſtudie there, but hinder what they may them that are going thither. They care not for that Colledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot draw it into their ſocietie: nay they haue laboured by all meanes vtterly to diſſolue it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, they challenge vnto themſelues a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Monarchie ouer all <hi>England,</hi> as it may appeare by a certain contention in the priſon at <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> in which there were, and are in hold for the profeſſion of their faith 32. Prieſts, dayly looking for their death. Theſe liuing a long time a godly, and an holy life, did eate altogether, ſtudied altogether, vſed euery day to preach, to diſpute, to intreate of caſes of conſcience, to expound the ſcriptures; and exerciſed the ſame ſtudies, as they were wont to practiſe in the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: all were of one minde; all of one heart; all as brethren; one bearing with another. The towne of <hi>Wiſbich</hi> loued them; all the land praiſed them; the hereticks admired them; the keepers of the priſons greatly affected them: ſo that they inioyed euery day more and more libertie. Their maintenance came to them from all places yea the very Miniſters (though hereticks) very often helped to reheue them. Many

yeeres liued they in this godly, holy, and deuout kind of life, vntill a Ieſuite, one <hi>Edmunds</hi> by name (inſpired we know not with what ſpirit) gaue to ſome occaſion to doubt of the well imploying of the almes receiued. This foundation laid, he ſo inſinuated himſelfe with faire demeanour and falſe deuiſes into the hearts of many, as that he deuided the Prieſts into two parts, whereof the one part drew to him, the other ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
               <p>They vſe alſo to fawne vpon men of noble birth, eſpecially if they be rich, and mueigle them by all faire meanes to ſell all that they haue, and enter into their Societie. Women alſo are induced by them to become Nunnes, and to leaue ſuch goods as they haue, to them. Which thing many that are godly-wiſe allow not. For ſuch rich Laitie (all circumſtances conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) are able to further more the eſtabliſhing of the faith in <hi>England,</hi> then the Ieſuites conſider of. For ſuch as they, might giue maintenance to Prieſts; enrich the priſons of Catholicks with their gifts; help the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: they may more freely, and with leſſe danger ſpeak of the Catholick religion, and faith; more commonly argue and diſcourſe with hereticks. But the Ieſuites conſider not, that theſe, and ſuch other things may be done, and would be done by them without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie. But in this manner do they make merchandiſe of the conuerſion of <hi>England;</hi> thus do they diſpoſe of the laſt wils of the ſick; thus loue they to intermeddle with the mariages of many, with their temporall goods, and indeed with all things: Alwayes taking that courſe with all men, that ſomething happen to their ſhare, hauing minde indeed of nothing, but their owne gaine. They skorne to come to any one, but where they may be daintily, and coſtly entertayned: they looke not after the cottages of the poore, nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter their help to them, be there neuer ſo much need.</p>

Moreouer, they are ſo delighted with equiuocation, or a ſubtile and diſſembling kind of ſpeech, as that to the ſcandall of others they are not aſhamed to defend it in their publick writings. There were read before the Iudges on the bench in open Court, and in the hearing of all the people the letters of a certain Ieſuite named <hi>Southwell,</hi> wherein equiuocations were moſt abſurdly defended, which gaue cauſe of laughter to the hereticks, and occaſion of ſcandall to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. They take pleaſure alſo to ſcatter rumors, and to ſuggeſt certaine nouelties in the eares of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, yea to forge and inuent things that are not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as they are commonly held now a dayes great lyars; and it is come to that paſſe, that though they ſweare, men will not beleeue them.</p>
               <p>All Vniuerſitie men, and ſuch as haue taken any degree in ſchooles (and ſuch in our countrey are moſt regarded) they hate moſt, deſpiſe, contemne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch.

               <p>To conclude, omitting all other things (which are very many) I wil only rehearſe one, which I haue heard of many; that it is come to this paſſe now, that the Catholicks ſtand in more feare of the Ieſuites, then of the hereticks. For the hereticks (ſay they) can but cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the bodie only; but the Ieſuites wound both their bodies, and their good name. They do not indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly cauſe Prieſts to be apprehended, but indirectly. That is, hauing ſpread ſome reports of them, whereby their good name is taken away, ſo as they ſtand ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted either of hereſie, or of ſome other heynous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, no Catholick entertayneth them, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, they are driuen to pouertie, how can they eſcape the hands of the hereticks? And albeit they lye

in priſon, and bonds, and are many wayes tormented, if they be not crowned with the glory of martyrdome, they ſhal neuer be purged from that former ſuſpition, but ſhall be accounted euery day more and more, as hereticks.</p>

                     <p>THere is come vnto my hands the ſentence of M. <hi>George Blackwell</hi> Arch-prieſt, in condemnation of the cenſure and iudgement of the Catholique, aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and renowned Vniuerſity of <hi>Paris.</hi> Wherein was alſo thruſt a very peremptory <hi>Prouiſo,</hi> but moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to auoyd reprehenſion: that no man ſhould vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake eyther by word or writing to defend the ſayd cenſure. I deemed it not impertinent in few words to runne ouer the ſayd ſentence, to ſhew in part the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie of it, as well for the honor of the ſayd ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred faculty of <hi>Paris</hi> (which for the worthy ſchollers it hath brought forth, is highly eſteemed throughout all Chriſtendome) as for the aduertiſement of the abouenamed Arch-prieſt, that he may hereafter be ſomewhat better aduiſed ere he thunder out his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: and do not vainely perſwade himſelfe, that he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:621:48"/>
can either tye the toongs, or ſtay the pennes of men by any ſuch vnreaſonable writ, vnleſſe he take ſome more ſober and conſiderate courſe of proceeding. And for breſities ſake to omit the friuolous preambles that are partly vntrue and wholy to ſmall purpoſe: the firſt of importance is, where he ſayth, That the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> was altogether wrong, and (as it may be thought) fraudulent. His reaſon is: for that they, who liked not his election at the firſt ſtood ſtill obſtinate in their diſobedience, after perfect notice of the Popes breue in confirmation of it, ſent them by their Ambaſſadors (who for honors ſake (you muſt thinke pardye) he alwayes ſo tearmeth) how ſound and true this aſſertion is, all <hi>England</hi> (as I think) knoweth right well. Sure I am, the common fame ſpread in all countryes betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> (where the Engliſh are reſident) approued alſo by ſundry letters out of <hi>England,</hi> and from other coaſts, was, and is cleane contrary: <hi>viz.</hi> that they, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuſpended their iudgements attending his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes reſolution, as ſoone as they were by the Popes breue certified of his pleaſure, ſubmitted themſelues to the Arch-prieſt, and acknowledged his authority. And that I ſtay not about needleſſe proofes in ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious a matter, the very next words after in this his reſcript, declare as much. Mary I muſt needs confeſſe, that they are ſo clarkly and clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ely ſet downe, that they may perhaps couer ſome pretie equiuocation. Theſe be his words. For ſo long as they refuſed not their ſuperior, appoynted by the knowne will of the Pope, they were neuer condemned as ſchiſmaticks: and ſince, whileſt they acknowledged their ſuperior, they were neuer cenſured, but only as ſeditious, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing againſt the Popes order &amp;c. The ſenſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnderſtanding muſt needs be: that at firſt, ſo long as they had not certaine notice by the Popes
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:621:48"/>
breue of his will, and therefore refuſed to accept the new Magiſtrate, they were not condemned as ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. Afterward they vnderſtanding of the Breue, acknowledged their ſuperior: and therefore were not cenſured as ſchiſmaticks, but only as ſeditious. By the latter part of which ſentence, it is moſt euident and cleare by his owne expreſſe declaration: that after certaine knowledge of the Popes commaundement, they acknowledged their ſuperior; and therefore were not cenſured, but only as ſeditious. What can be more contrary to that which he ſayd before? There, he auoucheth boldly, that after certaine notice giuen of the Popes will, they ſtood ſtill obſtinate in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſobedience here, that after intelligence had, they acknowledged their ſuperior. I dare not aske you, whether part of this flat contradiction you will beleeue, becauſe both cannot be true: for you muſt either hold (contrary to the rules of reaſon) both parts to be true, or elſe diſcredit him, that within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a few lines affirmed them both. But no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle: for I am almoſt aſtoniſhed, to ſee ſo many foule ouerſights in this one poore ſentence. Let that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction paſſe: and marke an other in the ſame end of the ſentence. They are cenſured only as ſeditious, ſayth he: in oppoſing againſt the Popes order. What order was that, I pray you? Was it any other, then that they ſhould receiue Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> for Arch-prieſt, and obey him? No ſurely: how then did they oppoſe againſt that order, who in that very time acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their ſuperior, as in the ſame period he hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſet downe? What a wilfull peruerſenes is this, and blinde deſire of ſlaundering others, to cenſure thoſe for ſeditious, whom they know and do confeſſe to haue acknowledged their ſuperiors. But not to ſtand vpon theſe contrary points (which giue but ſmall grace vnto a graue ſentence) I may not omit that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:621:49"/>
ſtrange propoſition conteyned in the former part of the ſentence. It is: that they who liked not of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, were not, before they receyued certaine notice thereof, by his Holynes breue, condemned as ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. This is ſo apparantly falſe, and ſo contrary vnto euery ones knowledge, that I much muſe what he meaneth, and where the ſtarting hole, and euaſion lyeth. If he vnderſtand only, that they were neuer condemned by ſentence of iudge, it may then paſſe: for ſo indeed they could neuer haue bin iuſtly. But to ſay, that he and his fellowes did not ſo call them, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of them, and ſo write of them, and in a rude ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling pamphlet in latine ſo denounce them to the wide world, were (as I take it) to make open profeſſion, that he had made ſhipwrack of verity, modeſty, and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. Hauing thus briefely examined the preamble, I come now to the ſentence itſelfe: wherein I will yet be more briefe. Me thinks he ſeemeth not a little to abuſe that great authority committed to his charge: <hi>ad aedificationem non ad destructionem.</hi> For following his letters patents, and the right order of correction, he is to puniſh enormous faults after they be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vſing alſo before brotherly admonition: to try whether in the ſpirit of lenity, the party may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. But he contrarywiſe goeth about by new decrees to make faults (which paſſeth his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ought that I euer yet could ſee) and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh faults without any warning moſt grieuouſly. But you will ſay: that it is for ſome heynous cryme, or elſe he would neuer haue bin ſo terrible and haſty to reuenge? well: let vs heare what enormous fault it is? Mary ſir, if any maintaine in word or in writing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, the graue, Catholicke and learned iudgement of the famous Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be vpon due information truly giuen (for ſo much his words ſeeme to import) when he ſaith: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:621:49"/>
it be truly giuen or forged, whether vpon true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation or otherwiſe) if he be of the Cleargie, he is preſently to be ſuſpended, and to loſe all his faculties (the greateſt penaltie that he could lay on him) if of the laitie: he is <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> interdicted. I paſſe ouer, that for a light offence, or rather none at all, he hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a grieuous puniſhment, contrarie to that rule of Iuſtice: <hi>Proratione delicti, ſit plagarum modus.</hi> But this would I faine know, for the inſtruction of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: how he commeth by the authoritie to interdict any of the Laitie. Sure I am, that in his letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and the Popes breue, he hath no authoritie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, but ouer Prieſts only: whom neither can he interdict, much leſſe any of the Laitie, ouer whom he hath no iuriſdiction at all, for ought I haue yet heard: let him then take heede, that caſting out thoſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which belong not to him; he doe not himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the true cenſures of his ſuperiours: and for cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring others vniuſtly, fall into the iuſt indignation and diſpleaſure of almightie God. But he taketh it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: and deemeth the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris</hi> to haue failed much. Let that be his opinion.</p>
                     <p>But whether is likelier to faile, trow you: either one Bachelor in Diuinitie, or many Doctors: one as yet raw, and little practiſed in the diſcipline of the church: or many, of long time daily conuerſant in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affaires: one haſty man (as it ſeemeth) and in the heate of faction: or diuers graue aduiſed men, free from all paſſion and affection? If he thinke by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of his titles, to be any whit holpen: the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of <hi>Paris</hi> haue in their facultie preſent diuerſe Protonotaries Apoſtolicke and Archprieſts, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greater officers of their bodie, as Archdeacons, Chancellors, or Vicar generals: that I may omit Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who are commonly reſident in their Dioceſſes. But perhaps ſome will ſay; albeit our Archprieſt be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:621:50"/>
ſurmounted in all other reſpects: yet in reaſons and proofes, he paſſeth them all. Let vs therefore come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his reaſons which are three in number, and barely auerred; but not one of them proued. The firſt is, that the cenſure of <hi>Paris</hi> is preiudiciall to the dignitie of the Sea Apoſtolike. Proue that good ſir. For without proofe, that aſſertion will be taken for fond: and I in a word, will proue it alſo to be falſe: for they ſay, it was neither ſchiſme nor ſinne in that doubtfull caſe of the Archprieſts election, to ſeeke vnto the Popes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines for certaine reſolution, where they are ſo farre off from derogating any whit, from the dignitie of the Sea Apoſtolicke, that they doe highly commend it; acknowledging the right of appellation from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour courts, to appertaine vnto the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is a ſpeciall prerogatiue, whereby we proue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heretikes, the ſupremacie of that Sea. This firſt worthie argument then, is drawne perhaps <hi>a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio ſenſu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, that their cenſure was contrarie to the Popes breue. As iuſt as <hi>Iermaines</hi> lippes. For their cenſure onely was: whether it were ſchiſme or any ſinne, before there was any breue, and wholy abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the breue: How could it then be oppoſite to that, with which it did nothing at all meddle, or any whit concerne? The third and laſt reaſon is: that their cenſures were contrary to the ſentence of the two Cardinals. No ſuch matter good ſir: For the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals ſentence was onely againſt two by name, and for no other matter, as the ſentence expreſſeth, then for that they had exerciſed controuerſies with ſome other men of their owne order (which alſo how true it is, let them iudge, that know their conuerſation) therefore they thought it expedient, that they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into the Countrie for a ſeaſon without leaue. Now let them conſider who are of higher capacitie
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:621:50"/>
then my ſelfe: how this ſentence is oppoſite vnto the cenſure of <hi>Paris:</hi> that in doubtfull cauſes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale or ſue vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> is neither ſchiſme nor ſinne: for my wit is too ſimple to reach vnto it. Well to draw towards an end. After that this good man had in ouer great haſte taxed the cenſure of the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> as preiudiciall vnto the dignitie of the Sea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, and contrarie to the Popes breue and Cardinals ſentence: he forſooth (and if you lift to beleeue him) telleth you that he meaneth not to diſgrace that moſt famous Vniuerſitie. Surely, if he thought, that he could diſgrace it, he deceiued himſelfe fowly. For the grace, credit, and renowne of the vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> little dependeth vpon the verdit of ſo baſe and meane a Magiſtrate, and contemneth the bald vnlearned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of ſuch ſimple Clarkes. If they meane in ſubſtantiall arguing, to coape with ſo honourable a companion: let them put downe plainely the caſe, as it was propoſed vnto them, with their cenſure, and withall in Latine (as they may vnderſtand it) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſion diſproue it like Diuines: and then it may be, if they ſee any thing worth the anſwering; that they will giue ſufficient ſatisfaction to the world of their cenſure. In the meane ſeaſon it muſt needes bee ſmall honour vnto the Archprieſt and others of his band, to oppoſe themſelues againſt the moſt learned, catholicke and famous Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe acknowledgeth it: who doe ſtill auouch, and will vphold their cenſure for iuſt and true in any place, whereſoeuer it ſhall be called in queſtion: which me thinkes ſhould much moue all good Catholickes, not ſo ſtifly to backe that ſide againſt other innocent men, who after ſo long and fruitfull trauels for our Countrey, are now for nothing (as it were) mightilie wronged in their good names and credits.</p>
                     <p>I for my part, who alwaies haue moſt tenderly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Catholicke cauſe, am moſt ſory to ſee ſuch pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:621:51"/>
diſſenſion about trifles: and doe moſt earneſtlie <hi>in viſceribus Domini nostri Ieſu Christi,</hi> requeſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Archprieſt, and thoſe that are ouer paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate on that part; to content themſelues with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others vnto the Popes Holines Breue (which was a high poynt of perfect obedience, conſidering what ſlender audience was giuen vnto thoſe whom they ſent) and leaue off that fruitles iangling, whether they ſinned before or no: or what kind of ſinne it was. Who would not haue thought, but that vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of the Popes Breue, and obedient acceptance thereof, all would haue been quiet and appeaſed: one forgiuing another, if ought before had paſſed amiſſe: and all ioyning together in defence of each others cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and good name, which was and is moſt neceſſarie for the maintenance of the common cauſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all Catholicks. Well at the length yet, for Gods honour, and the holy Churches good, and your owne quietnes, returne vnto that Chriſtianlike and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly peace and charitie, ſo much deſired of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and deuout Catholicks: which that our louing Sauiour may giue you grace to doe, my humble prayers haue alwaies been, and ſhall neuer, I hope, fayle.
