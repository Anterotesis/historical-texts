            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For what can be thought more pleasant or more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then sitting as it it were in the Theater and stage of mans life, (the which a History hath most exquisitely furnished in all points) to be made capable of the perils that other men haue sustained, without further daunger to himselfe: to take examples of alsorts, eyther medicynable for his ownesecure estate, or beneficiall to others: to be so ably furnished for the presence of great men, when with grauest aduice they debate of the most weyghtiest affaires, to discusse the end and sequel of their desires, by example, or answer them by argument. The companye of which worthinesse, to the worthiest is welcome, and the cogitations of the Noblest thoughts do couet.</p>
                  <p>Which profit, without History (considering the shortnesse of mans life) cannot be attaind: Who can compasse in memory the times of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years past, behold the beginings, proceedings, &amp; subuersions of great Empires, to witnes the euils they endured, either priuate or publik, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly to discerne the ground and occasion of them. In euery difficult and daungerous matter, to haue one try the perils, and as it were tread the yce before them, neuer to bee destitute of tryed experience, and by times past which properly and peculiarly appertaineth to the duty of a wise man, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly to foresee what may succeed in all estates, and to iudge of them as yf they were present.</p>
                  <p>Sincc then the ground of such workes are large and spacious to walk and recreat our studies in, it is requisit we prepare our thoughts to the reading of Histories, hauing first a taste of ciuill policy in our selues, which so must gouerne our affections to iudge discreetly of all actions, either pleasinge or displeasing to vs, to be as sufficiently contented with whatsoere we read, &amp; doth resist our inclination, as delighted with that motion keepes fellowship with our nature, and not by the sway of passion bee miserably led, onely with vaine imaginations, and so tosse from one place to another, to read as birds skip from bow to bough, more to prime their bils, then benefit their bodies: but like good Surgions, who search al sores thoroughly to the bottome, ere

                  <p>But it hapneth as at a royall and sumptuous feast, furnished with all sorts of delicate viands, one thing is placed before one man, some set before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, few satisfie themselues of one restoratiue, but euery man of that hely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth best: and although there is but some one kind of measure which nature hath appointed, and one kind of meat simple and in any wise vncorrupted, that is most for the helth and the nourishment of the body, from the bounds of which whosoeuer exceedeth, and followeth his owne appetite, beyond ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther measure or the ordinance of nature, hee may receiue hurt by that was ordained for his necessary good: euen so in that great variety of Histories, wherin there is set downe a thousand counsels, directed to a thousand pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and after what sorte socuer the reader be ledde by fancy or stayed by iudgement, so doth he censure or apply them. Whereby oftentimes that which is ordained for meat, couerts to surfet, <hi>&amp; salutaria pharmica,</hi> the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some medicines prepared for the recreation, infectes the mind, by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse it followes not, a decree be made all food to be distasted, nor any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifit despised, since there is for al men leauied a path-way to vertue, in which who so walketh aduisedly, is praise-woorthy, and who transgresseth ofselfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opinion is to be condemned for his error.</p>
                  <p>Some reading Histories deceiue themselues, imagining the bare stile of the history, is of authority inough in it selfe to instruct the reader, wheras indeed it doth no more but minister matter to learne vppon, offering it selfe to all vses, according as the person is affectioned, in like case as doth the feast, for as he that draws an arrow in a bow, may draw it home or short, as his stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth finds good for him, and as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>e vse of the words, but the inclination of the will. Some read Histories for no other delight but onely in the reading, who seeking no more but a present delectation, do loose the benefit of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant fruites, such men gaine no more by turning ouer the leaues of a histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then they that play vpon an instrument, taking no further delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then to passe away the tediousnesse of the time present, and shottly after enter into a more tedious conflict with themselues: for it is no pleasure that hath not respect vnto vertue. Others there are whome the glittering glosse of glory pricketh so forward, and to such a mishape transformeth them, that they thinke no aduenture to great for them, nor no prehemmence aboue them, being of no ability, for the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the one, nor of desert to at taine to the other; vtterly forgetting, that those glorious examples whych they read, are not set forth by writers for any other intent, then that such as ensuing vertue, may thereby learne to contemne glory being aboue their reach, or if it accompany them, not to be proud and arrogant of it.</p>
                  <p>And although that none but Fooles will enterprise to aspire to the like glory, without the like virtue, yet notwithstanding it is manifest that some finding no other merit in themselues, but that they haue reade the Noble acts of others, do thinke their desert of highest worth, notsparing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb facs="tcp:18325:5"/>
to speake, <hi>Why should not I be either a Scipio or Caesar,</hi> like vnto players of Tragedies, who when they haue put off the apparrell, wherein they haue played the part of most Noble personages, do continue to counterset them in countenance and behauiour.</p>
                  <p>There are also men of rude and vulgar vnderstanding who destract from al record, which is not either newes or wonders, like Ideots that giue more to a mans gay and superfluous cote, then vnto the person or his vertuous parts; that extend large offices to the outward show, if it be gawdy, and neglect the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red instruction within, be the worke neuer so worthy.</p>
                  <p>But whereas, it is the principal commendation, apertaineth to a history, to stirre vp the mind of man from sloath fulnesse, and to fence it from all dangers by the strength of examples, (then the which there is nothing of greater po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer either to perswade or diswade) and that the ancient reseruing of them ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to that end and purpose, yet it commeth to passe through the sloathful se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of men, and the neglect of their good, being so carefully reserued and offered them, by perswading themselues, that other mens perils helpe nothing to their safty, that such acts as are most worthy of remembrance are either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully rebuked, or else heard with deafe and vnsetled ears. Finally their be, that out of an obstinat presumption, transgresse euen against that same part containeth the most graue and carnest matters, as though histories should be written, not as they were done indeed, but as they ought to be done, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iled phrase and fresh inuention, of set purpose onely to' please them. So that partly by meanes of that carelesse security, and partly by the surfet of rash and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduised reading, it commeth to passe that (euen as it wer of corrupt humours) a certaine corruptnesse of Iudgment and peruerse opinion is bred.</p>
                  <p>There is also another of no lesse force then these a forsaid, and that is in the writer of histories, who folowing as it wer the tast of their own Palats, as thogh they wer forgers of their worke themselues, fashion their labour rather to intice the reader to spred their commendation, then to let their hand &amp; pen consent to the truth: wherin they do like Cooks, who oftentimes in seasoning their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters meate rather please their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For a <hi>Historigrapher,</hi> is no other but a reporter of things done, (with whose iudgement if there be any fault) it standeth with him as with a tun of Wine, which (of it selfe being plesant and beautiful) doth either take an euill talent of the Caske, or else is made vnrellishable by being mingled with some other compound, which is either a shameful and intollerable deceit, or a point of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame folly and ignorance.</p>
                  <p>To those then that ingrosse Histories I perscribe this rule, that they write to record, not to flatter. Of those that read them (since I am of firme opinion such authors are profitable to be read) though for no other but for the great aboundance of examples that they entreate off, I request that they circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly and carefully ouerlooke them, considering how great fruites or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities are in them propounded: otherwise it happeneth vnto them that imagine a worke may be read ouer lightly, as with those that hold a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas many of the Romaines, euen such as had attained to the state of consuls, had put the acts of the Romans in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, first in Greeke, and after into other forrain languages: Trogus Pompeyus, (a man of auntient eloquence) whether it were for the desire of the like renowne and glory, or for the pleasure that he had in the variety and strangenesse of the worke, compyled as well the Histories of the Greekes, as the Histories also of the whole worlde besides, in the Latine tongue; to the intent that as our Chronicles are reade in Greeke, the Chronicles of the Greekes might be published in our owne tongue: Wherein he enterprised a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labour both of body and mind.</p>
                  <p>For first seeing many authors haue taken vppon them to set downe the raigne of some one King, or the actions of some one peculiar kind of people, and thoght them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to haue vndertaken a weighty businesse; wee may well thinke Pompeyus to haue bin as bold as Hercules, that durst aduenture vpon the whole world. In whose books are conteined the gouernment of all ages, of all Kings, of all Nations &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: And those things, that the Greek Chroniclers haue disorderly set downe, as euery man thought most conuenient to please himselfe, the same hath Pompeyus compiled into one maine history, omitting nothinge, saue onely those thinges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither vnprofitable to be spoken of. Therefore of these xliiii. volumes (for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did Pompey set foorth) by leisure, during this time of my residence in the Citty, I drew out all such principles as I thought worthy to be remembred, onely leauing out such notes, the knowledge whereof, could not either be delightfull, nor yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for example. I haue therefore gathered, as it were a bundle of Flowers, to the entent that all such as haue knowledge in the Greeke, might fully bee satisfied, and as for them which are therein vnskilfull, matter of instruction.</p>
                  <p>All which I haue dedicated to your Maiesty, not so much to read, and peruse, as to correct, and also to giue an account of my time, whereof <hi>Cato</hi> vvilleth a due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count should be rendred.

                  <p>This vnion by consent thus ended, they appointed next, that at a certaine time each man vpon his courser should present himselfe before the pallace, in the morning by breake of day: and then he whose horse first neighed before

the sunne rising, that man should without any contradiction be their king and sole monarch (for the <hi>Persians</hi> hold this for vnmoueable, that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God saue the sunne onely) and that a horse is helde the onely ioy of the same God, and there vnto him are hallowed.</p>
                  <p>There was amongst the conspitators, one <hi>Darius,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Hystaspis</hi> who being greatly perplexed in thought, howe he might by some cunninge slight, gaine the kingdome to himselfe, bestowed much beating and labour in his troubled pate, till at last his horse-keeper perceiuing the whole matter said: If my Lord there be no other thing to crosse your desire, take courage, and let no thought further trouble you, for assuredly the day shall lighte on your side. Hereupon, the euening before the day appointed, he brought his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> maisters horse to the same place where this appointed meeting was to be, and thither caused a Mare to be brought, thinking that for desire of the Mare, the <note place="margin">The pollicy of a horskee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> thing would so come to passe, as his Lord and maister had desired, &amp; afterward sorted to their desired wish.</p>

Thus was the kingdome brought backe againe out of the hands of vsurpers by the exceeding resolution and valour of seauen of the greatest No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in all the kingdome into the hands of one man to be gouerned.

                  <p>Not long after the <hi>Asstrians</hi> fell into rebellion, taking the citty of <hi>Babilon</hi> by force.

Herevpon hee councelled them, to take warning by this his misery, how they gaue credit to such a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous foe. Further he aduertised them, not to rely vpon the weaknes of their walles, but betake them to their weapons: and if they stood so affected, as to make choise of him to take their part in these actions of warre, because of the <note place="margin">Zopirus tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians.</note> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wronges and wounds he had receiued were still fresh in memory: All which the <hi>Babilonians</hi> hauing thoroughly considered, and giuing credit to the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Nobility of the man, as also for that he was a worthy warryour, and that his wrongs were as a sufficient warrant to credite him, they made him generall ouer all their seruices, and hee to smother and disguise his plot the more, with a small company twice or thrice, set vppon the <hi>Persians,</hi> and still preuailed, especially for that they gaue way to his purpose for the nonce.

                     </gap>ellation, that neither the cold of winter, not the heat of summer was any way offensiue to the naturall inhabitatnts. Also the groundes was so fruitfull, that there is no land vnder the Sun, that bringeth foorth more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance for the vse of man: from hence therefore it may bee very well conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that of right men ought to be borne and brought vp, where the soyle of the Countrey is most pleasant to their constitution.</p>
                  <p>To crosse this their affirmation, the <hi>Scithians</hi> denied, that the temperatenes of the aire, made any thing for proofe of antiquity: insomuch that nature it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> selfe so soone as it hath giuen foorth vnto euery seuerall climate such portion of cold or heat as best befyteth: of it owne accord doth breed such bodies, and such creatures, as shall be able to vndetgo the Climate in most delighte: as men and women in their kind, beasts in their places, and sundry trees, herbes, stones and mettals, in their kind, according to the estate and condition of the places, where they are resiant: and howe much the times of yeare and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, seemed harder and colder in <hi>Scithia,</hi> then in <hi>Egipt,</hi> so much the more harder and stouter were the <hi>Scithians,</hi> rather then the <hi>Egiptians.</hi> But if the world being now deuided into parts, were once in one lumpe: then whether water in the beginning were Lord of the earth, or fire had got the vper-hande <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and so got possession of all things, and by reason hereof, the world wer made, yet the <hi>Scithians</hi> in both of these must of necessity proue the auncienter. For if you will say fire had the first possession of all, that might by little and little be quenched, and so giue place to the earth, from which, no part coulde bee sooner seperated from the fire, by the extreme nipping of the winter season, then the <hi>North:</hi> which euen to this day is by experience knowne vnto all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Nations, that for extremity of cold the <hi>North</hi> claimeth the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence: whereas <hi>Egypt,</hi> and so likewise all the East partes were a long season in finding forth that temperatenes, wherein they could be satisfyed, as for better <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> proofe appeareth by them euen at this day, that they haue such an vnmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable portion of heat from the sun, that it parcheth and scorcheth their bodies in great extremity.</p>
                  <p>But if all the world were once drownd, then it will soone appeare that the higher the place is, the sooner it is discouered: by this reason, that the waters withdraw themselues into the lower grounds, and there abide some course of time before they can be dried vp, and the sooner it is consumed, then the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is it made a place for the breeding of liuing creatures. Now it is wel known that <hi>Scythia</hi> is so much higher then other Countreys and Dominions, that al the Riuers thereof, take their courses downward, and in their fall meete with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Riuer of <hi>Meotis,</hi> and so altogether run from thence into the sea of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and lastly into the <hi>Egiptian</hi> Sea.</p>

                  <p>The first that offered to make warre vpon the <hi>Scythians,</hi> was <hi>Vexoris</hi> king of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who sent his Ambassadors long before, to agree vpon certaine articles <note place="margin">Vexoris ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the first warres vpon the Scithians</note> of obedience. The <hi>Scithians</hi> hauing receiued aduertisement of the kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming against them, made slight account therof, and gaue answere to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors after this manner: We cannot but maruell that the King and ruler of so mighty and rich a people, will so vnaduisedly moue war against vs Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which he should rather haue expected at home at his own doores, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the ende of warre is doubtfull, and victory can yeeld from vs small reward, but very apparant losse: wherefore we <hi>Scithians</hi> wil not abide his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to vs, but withal speed make towards him to meet him on the way, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into his owne lande, for that we know there is treasure of infinite value, worthy the labor we shall vndertake: And accordingly they made good by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what they promised by word. The king vnderstanding that they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned resolute, and that they made vpon him in such speedy manner, sledde for feare, leauing behind his whole army, with all their furniture of warre, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly recouered himselfe into his owne kingdome: But the <hi>Scithians</hi> coulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not make pursute after him into <hi>Egipt,</hi> by reason of the fenny contrys, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <note place="margin">The Scithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans conquer Asia.</note> they were altogither vnacquainted.

At last they were called home, at the great and importunate requestes of their women, from whom they had receiued a message by the whole consent of the women, that if after so long absence, they did not speedily returne, they would <note place="margin">The message of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus became <hi>Asia</hi> tributary to the <hi>Scithians</hi> for the space of 1500. yeares: and <hi>Nynus</hi> king of the <hi>Assirians,</hi> was the last that yeelded this tribute money vnto them.</p>

                  <p>Thus hauing by war purchased peace, they sent for men and accompanied with them: and when any childe was borne, if it were a male, it was presently killed, if a female it was preserued and brought vp: but how, not in idlenesse, neither to learne to spin and carde, but valiantly in feates of armes, as ridinge <note place="margin">The training vp of the Amazonians</note> great horse, hunting, hauking, and al the exercises that belongs to men: and that they should not haue any hinderance of martiall exercises, as shooting, or throwing of dartes, their right paps was seared off with hot Irons when they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> were infants, whereupon they were euer after called <hi>Amazons.</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>Scythians</hi> had now made their third voyage into <hi>Asia,</hi> where they remained the space of seauen yeeres, seperating themselues by this long stay out of the company and remembrance of their wiues and children: For their wiues being a long time wearied by their absence, supposed that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> wars could not so continue, but rather gathered that they were al slaine, and being herin resolued, they generally agreed to marrie euery one their seruant (or slaue) which their maisters had left at home onely to attend their heardes of Cattel. These things thus falling out by contraries, news was brought, that their maisters were returning home with conquest, and brought alonge with them very large spoiles: The seruants to welcome them, banded themselues <note place="margin">The bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Scithians made warre vpon their Maisters.</note> together in most rebellious maner, and at their aproch bad them a most sharp and dangerous fight, with full intent to giue them not the reward of Maisters, but accounting them as their enimies and strangers.</p>

                  <p>They boast highly as well of their first original, as also their great increase among themselves: for it was not by strangers, nor a multitude of raskals ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from all partes of the worlde, that first founded that Cttiy: but they were bred and brought vp, in that same soile and continent, whereas they stil inhabited: and that the place of their dwelling, was also the place of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall beginning.</p>

The <hi>Doriens</hi> hauing vnderstanding that hee that was slaine amongest them was <hi>Codrus</hi> the King, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> were so dismaide thereat, that they presently forsooke the field, without anye more resistance or strokes: And by this meanes the <hi>Athenians</hi> (by theresolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their king and captain, who rather chose to put himself into the hands of death, rather then to make shipwracke of the safety of his Countrey) were preuented and deliuered from this grieuous war.

                  <p>Amongst many worthy actes of this man, this one is to be recorded in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting memory: When the <hi>Athenians</hi> and the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renses</hi> had long fought, &amp; endured many battels and much bloud-shed, about the winning and keeping the Isles of <hi>Salamine,</hi> vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the which both made their claime and challenged as right, and had almost wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and consumed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and their substance in maintnance of this war, Insomuch that the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> made it highe Treason to any, that therafter shuld make claim to any of those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> llandes. Hereupon <hi>Solon</hi> noting the strict edict that <note place="margin">The wise pollicy of Solon</note> went out, grew exceeding sorrowful, least by holding his speech, he should neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the duty he ought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Common weale: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain if he spoke, he broght himselfe within daunger of the Law. To preuent both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which eminent dangers to the State, he fained himselfe starke madde, vnder which disguise, hee might <note place="margin">Solon fained madnesse.</note> not only say, but doe things forbidden: To this purpose, he put himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fooles coate, and so runneth out amongst a multitude of people, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the middle of the rowt (and the rather to further his intended purpose) in certaine broken Rymes and Meeters, of all other to him most vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he began to incite and stirre vp the people to that thinge which was most vnlawfull, wherein (although he were thus disguised) his words so wrought in the eares and iudgements of the people, that sodainly they proclaimed open Warres against the <hi>Megarenses:</hi> In which attempt they ouercame their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and brought backe the Island vnder their subiection.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Megarenses</hi> being thns politikelie preuented, shut not vp their mallice but practised some other way to reuenge themselues vppon the <hi>Athenians:</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:18325:19"/>
at <hi>Eleusis:</hi> Of this had knowledge one <hi>Pisistratus</hi> (a worthy Captain amongst the <hi>Athenians)</hi> who gaue commaundement the women shoulde celebrate these ceremonies, in all points as they had doone before, with iollitye and much reioycing, wherby there should grow no suspition, that they had heard any thing of their enemies intent and purpose, and so laying certaine bands of Souldiers in ambush abroad in diuers places was ready at all assayes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the enimy: At last the <hi>Megarenses</hi> had recouered the coast whereunto they sailed, landed their men, and began to ranke them vp in battell arraye, when vpon the sudden <hi>Pisistratus</hi> brake vpon them, and violently ouercame them, and put them al to the sword, and forthwith entred into their Ships, (in which he put a great number of the women, thinking thereby to deceiue and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and make a shew as if they were prisoners) and presently againe spread their sayles, taking the directcst course they coulde, to returne backe againe to the Cittic <hi>Aegera.</hi>

                  <p>The townesmen of <hi>Megera</hi> looking abroad, discouered their owne Nauie of shippes to be floting vpon the waters, and in those ships they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <note place="margin">The townes men of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gera mistake</note> a multitude of women to be there amongst (all vvhich they vainly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be the booty they had so long sought after) they went forth to meet them, all which when <hi>Pisistratus</hi> perceiued, he instantly raised a power of men and came against them, making much hauocke and slaughter uppon them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and had they not so sodainly recouered themselues againe into their Cittye, he had also bin Lord and conqueror thereof.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pisistratus</hi> after all his great victories gotten, turned them vnto his owne priuate commodity, and not to the generall good of the vvhole Nation, and <note place="margin">Pisistratus by pollicy vsurpeth</note> at last by vsurpation and treason wound himselfe into the sole gouernement and kingdome. To this end, by subtlety and set purpose, he suffied his bodye to be rent and mangled with whips and scourges at his owne house, and in this lamentable maner, he commeth forth among the people, and when they were gathered togither in a route, shewed his wounds, making moste bitter excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> against the Nobility, by whose censure he said this punishment was inslicted.

                  <p>The Cittizens also began to thinke vpon the auncient liberties that they had possessed, and seeing that terror and tyranny gouernd all his actions, they gathered them togither against him, and shortly after deposed him, and after that banished him for euer out of the Countrey.

                  <p>In the beginning of this war, counsell was asked of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> where answere was returned, that either the king of the <hi>Spartans</hi> must die the death, or the Citty be vtterly destroyed.

                  <p>The <hi>Greekes</hi> hauing knowledge of the kings flight, presently drew to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, how it might suddenly be brought to passe, that the bridge which he (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> being Lord of the Sea) had made at <hi>Abydus,</hi> might be rased downe and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to the intent that thereby his passage might be hindred and clean cut off, or els he with his whole army might be vtterly destroied and brought to such an exigent, as if not clearely ouercome, he might be compelled at the least to desire peace at their hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Themystocles</hi> fearing least if his enimies should be stopped of their passages, that it might thereby increase their courage, and so turne their dispaire into hardinesse, insomuch as they saw no way but death on euery side, and so make way by fury of their swords, told them that there were already too many eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <note place="margin">Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles sendeth his seruant a second time to Xerxes.</note> in <hi>Greece,</hi> and therefore his iudgement no way allowed, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> should by such indirect meanes keepe or hinder them against their willes.

                  <p>Whilst they were thus in the middest of their mournings and Lamentes, <note place="margin">Athens again besieged</note> their enemies came vpon them, and so sharpely begirte them on euery side by besiedging them, that they constrained them to abide much hunger, for want of victuals: for they knew well inough that ther was no great number of souldiers left aliue within the towne, and without they so beleagred and stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all the passages, that it was not possible for them to receiue or looke for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny helpe or fresh succors to come vnto them: By all which inconueniences ioyned togither, the <hi>Athenians</hi> were brought into so great extreamitie, partly by famine, and partly by the pestilence, that they desired peace.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon grew a long debating betweene the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and other their adherents, whether it were necessary to be granted or no: At last they came vnto diuers censures vppon the matter; where some were of opinion, and thereunto aduised that the name of the <hi>Athenians</hi> should be vtterly roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, and burne the Citty downe to the ground: but hereunto the <hi>Spartans</hi> would in no wise condiscend and agree, seeing that the <hi>Greeks</hi> hauing but only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> two eies, one of them shoulde be put out: So that in conclusion they granted them a peace vpon these condition.

                  <p>This Citty was first built by <hi>Pausanias</hi> king of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and by him possessed the continuance of seauen yeares.

to either part, sometime it belonged to the one, and sometime to the other, which vncertaine possession, hauing too often fed on the miseries which by such mutations citties indure, made it now stand stifly in the defence of hir own libertie, and the rather, for that during this siedge wherwith <hi>Phillip</hi> had begirte them, neither the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> or <hi>Athenians,</hi> rescued it as their owne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phillip</hi> hauing heere spent the most of his treasure, in the hope he had to make this citty his dignity, and finding by the delay of this warre, the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens grew rather hardie then deliberate, purposed by roauing on the sea, to inforce treasure, wherewith to keepe his siedge setled, without which his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> necessity was such he should be compeld dishonorably to rise, and against his nature to desist: thus he so farre contriued, that he tooke 170. shippes laden with marchandise, wherewith he refreshed his greedy necessity for a season; at last, considering it was little policy or rather lesse profit, so great an army should be detained and excercised aboute the siedge of one onely citty, he caused to be drawne out a number ofhis experienced souldiers, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer whom himselfe hauing taken aduised muster, he marcht with them in person and tooke many cities of the <hi>Chersonesus.</hi> At this time he sent for his sonne <hi>Alexander,</hi> of the age of eighteene yeares, to the intent he might see him traded in the discipline of warre vnder him, holding it a Maxime, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a Soueraigne fathers life, should be a table ofhonorable presidents for his Princely sonne.</p>

The chariot wherin he rode, when the kingdome was imposed vpon him, he placed in the Temple of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and consecrated it for an offering, as a thing accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for Kings to doe at their Coronation.</p>
                  <p>After the raigne of <hi>Gordias,</hi> his sonne <hi>Mydas,</hi> (who was trained vp by <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> in many superstitious Ceremonies) filled all the realme with sectes of <note place="margin">Midas traind vp vnder Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus.</note> religion; by which, more then by his cheualry his life was safe and secure from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> perill and daunger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> hauing taken the towne, and comming into the Temple of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> immediatly inquired for the yoke of the waine: the which being brought before him, and he (vpon sight thereof) finding himselfe vnable to come by the ends of the thonges that were hidden with the wreathes, wrested the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to the vttermost, and cut them asunder with his sword, and so the wreathes being losed, he found the endes of the knots within the braides.</p>
                  <p>As this was doing, tydinges were brought him, that <hi>Darius</hi> approched with an huge army of Men, vpon which fearing to be encompassed within the straights, he made all possible speede to passe the mountaine <hi>Taurus,</hi> in which hast he ran fiue hundreth furlonges. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he came to <hi>Tarsus,</hi> he was much delighted with the pleasantnesse of the riuer <hi>Cidnus,</hi> which runneth through the middest of the Citty, and as he <note place="margin">Alexander in great danger by a surfet.</note> was full of dust and sweat, he threw himselfe naked into the cold water, which forthwith begat such a stifnesse through al his sinewes, that he lost his speech, and was in such danger of death, that he seemed past hope of recouery. Onely there was one of his Physitians, named <hi>Phillip,</hi> which warranted him his life. And yet the same Phisition was had in mistrust, by reason of the letters sent the day before out of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> from <hi>Permenio.</hi> Who knowing nothing of <hi>Alexanders</hi> mischance, wrote vnto him to take heede of <hi>Phillip</hi> his Phisition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for he was corrupted by <hi>Darius</hi> for a great summe of money. Yet <hi>Alexander</hi> thought it his better safety to commit himself into the hands of the phisition, then to abide the danger of his disease, whereof there was litle hope but death. Therefore he tooke the drinke that the Phisition had made him, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him the letter: And as he was drinking, hee stedfastly beheld his face, to obserue and marke what countenance he would carry at the reading thereof.</p>

                  <p>But he was nothing abashed therat, which <hi>Alexander</hi> was very glad of, and the fourth day after recouered his health. <hi>Darius</hi> therefore with three hundred thousand footemen, and an hundreth thousand horsemen proceeded vnto bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. Which huge multitude of enimies when <hi>Alexander</hi> beheld, he was much <note place="margin">The second encounter of alexander &amp; Darius</note> moued, in respect of the small number of his men; yet when he called againe to minde what great enterprizes he had atchieued, and how mighty Countries he had conquered with that small quantity, he van quished all feare with hope (the mindes best comforter) and thought it daungerous to delay the battell, least his men should be discouraged. Therefore he rode about his Army, and with sundry orations did anymate the hearts of his company. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Illirians</hi> and <hi>Thracians</hi> he encouraged with promise of great riches, and substance. The <hi>Greekes</hi> he set on fire with remembrance of their former warres, and their continuall hatred against the <hi>Persians.</hi> The <hi>Macedons</hi> he put in minde of <hi>Europe</hi> already conquered, and of <hi>Asia</hi> now conquered: perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them that in the world there wer not men like them for strength and mag naminitye, and that this battell would make an end of their troubles, and immortally eternize their glory. In speaking these wordes, he commaunded his batels to stand still againe, that by pausing, they might acquaint their eies with the huge number of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius</hi> also was not remisse in ordering of his battels, for whereas it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to the duty of his Captaines to doe it, he went himselfe to each ranke, and exhorted them all to play the men, putting them in remembrance of the auncient renowne of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and of the perpetuall possession of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire giuen them by the the Goddes.</p>
                  <p>This done, with great courage both the armies buckled togeather.

Therefore aduised him either to submit himselfe the same day, or else to prepare himselfe to battell the next day, and not to beguile his hopes with the expectation of any other victory, then what he had tryed already. The next day they brought their men into the field. But sodainely before the battell <hi>Alexander</hi> fell a sleepe, being very heauy, and surprized with the multitude of cares, and discontentments. And when all his men were in readinesse to giue the charge vpon their enemies, the king onely was missing. Who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes being very hardly awaked by <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and of all his men demaunded the cause of his so sounde sleeping in a time so daungerous, seeing he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly accustomed to content himselfe with very little sleepe euen when the quietnesse of his affaires gaue occasion of all leisure, and liberty: he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that he was deliuered of a great feare, and that he had slept of a sodaine content that came on him, &amp; pleased all his sences; for that at once he should encounter with the whole power of <hi>Darius,</hi> which he was afraide should haue been prolonged if the <hi>Persians</hi> had deuided their Army.</p>
                  <p>Before the battell each army stoode in the sight of other. The <hi>Macedones</hi> wondering at the number of their Enimyes, their goodlye personages, and their costly armor: the <hi>Persians</hi> on the other side, amazing that so few should ouercome so many thousandes as they had. The Captaines bestirring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in looking to their seuerall charges. <hi>Darius</hi> encouraged his souldiers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with this, that if they were deuided, the number of them tenne to one excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Enemies. <hi>Alexander</hi> willed the <hi>Macedones</hi> not to be abashed at the multitude of the contrary party, at the hugenesse of their bodies, nor the strangenesse of their colour. But to remember that this was the third time of their fight, and that they should not thinke their enemyes were become better men by their often running away, especially sith they brought with them into the fielde so sorrowfull a remembrance of their owne discomfitures, as of somuch bloodshed as they went away with, in the two former battels. And as <hi>Darius</hi> exceeded him in number of Men, so did he surpasse <hi>Darius</hi> in the greatnesse of strength. Therefore exhorted his men to dispise that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hoste, in which was more gayne then daunger, and glistred more in the outwatrde shew of Gold and siluer, then in the inwarde substaunce of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and vertue: for victory vvas not gotten by the brauery of furniture, but by the force of weapon, and the vndaunted resolution of couragious spirits.</p>

By this battell he tooke awaye the Empyre of all <hi>Asia,</hi> the first yeare after he began to raigne. Whose felicity <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Empyre of Macedon.</note> was so great that no man durst rebell against him, and the <hi>Persians</hi> themselues after so many yeares continuance of their monarchy, paciently endured the yoke of bondage. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                  <p>When he had rewarded, and refreshed his souldiers, he did nothing for forty daies after, but take view of the spoile of his enemie &amp; found lockt vp in the Citty forty thousand talents.

While these things were doing, there came vnto <hi>Alexander</hi> about eight hundreth <hi>Greekes,</hi> who besides their punishment of captiuity, were depriued of some of their limbes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested him that as he had reuenged <hi>Greece,</hi> so he would also reuenge the cruelty of their enemies. When he had put it to their choice either to stay there, or returne into their countries, they rather chose to take certaine lands, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and make their abode there, then to goe home to be a griefe to their friends, and a ioy to their enemies.</p>
                  <p>In the meane season to winne the fauor of the conqueror, <hi>Darius</hi> his owne kinsmen, in a village of the <hi>Parthians</hi> called <hi>Tane,</hi> bound him in setters, and chaines of gold: which was thoght the very ordinance and disposition of the <note place="margin">Darius woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to death by his owne kinsmen.</note> Gods, that the monarchy of the <hi>Persians</hi> should take end in the land of them that should succeede in the Empire.</p>

                     <hi>Alexander</hi> also the next morrow, following vpon spurre, had intelligence that <hi>Darius</hi> was conucied out by night in an horse-litter.

Onely one thing now at the point of death lay in his power to doe for <hi>Alexander,</hi> in requitall and full recompence of all his good turns, which was, that he woulde pray to the celestiall, and infernall powers, and the Goddes of Kinges, to giue him the victory, and Dominion of the whole worlde.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> made no tariance to the battell. But at the first encounter, his horse was wounded vnder him, and he himselfe fell downe headlong to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ground: howbeit his guard stept abouthim and rescued him. <hi>Porus</hi> not able longer to abide the brunt of battell, by reason of his multitude of woundes, was surprized and taken prisoner. Whereat his griefe was so great, for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanquished, that although he found fauour at his Enemies handes, yet would he not recciue any sustinance, nor suffur his woundes to be dressed: but much adoe there was to intreat him to liue. This courage, and valour did <hi>Alexander</hi> so highly commend in him, that in honor therof he sent him home againe with safety into his kingdome. Then builded he two Citties, whereof the one he called <hi>Nicea,</hi> and the other (after the name of his horse) <hi>Bucephala.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwardes he conquered the <hi>adrastes,</hi> the <hi>Stathenes,</hi> the <hi>Passides</hi> and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18325:59"/>
his seuerall home. One shewed his gray head, another his many woundes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other his leane Carcasse, wythered with the multitude of yeares, another his body full of skarres, and maimes. Saying that they alone were the Men that had endured the continual warres of two Kings, <hi>Phillip</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did beseech him (at the least) to restore their poore carcasses to the graues of their fathers, who now fainted, not for want of heart; or goodwill, but for want of yeares, to maintaine the resolute performance of their willing mindes. If he would not regard his Souldiers, yet to haue respect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and not to weary out his good fortune, nor offend with presumpty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being moued with these iust petitions, (as it were to winde vp his victories in more honor) he caused his camp to be set out after more stately sort then was accustomed, that the hugenesse thereof might both put his enemies in feare, and leaue somwhat to sucdeeding posterity to talke of. His souldiers did neuer worke in all their liues, with more alacrity, or free spirits. When they had therefore discomfited theyr enemies, they returned with great ioy and gladnesse. From thence <hi>Alexander</hi> went to the riuer <hi>Acesyne,</hi> and by that he sayled to the <hi>Ocean,</hi> where he tooke to mercy the <hi>Gessones</hi> and <hi>Asybanes,</hi> which were founded by <hi>Hercules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From thence he sailed to the <hi>Ambres,</hi> and <hi>Sycambres,</hi> which met him with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> foure score thousand footemen, and threescore thousand horsemen. When he had gotten the vpper hand of them, he led his hoast against their Citty, which hee finding voide of defendantes, as he looked from the wall, (the <note place="margin">Alexanders valour amóg thousands of enemyes.</note> which before any of his Men he himselfe had scaled) he leapt into the Citty, without any of his guard about him. When his enemyes saw him there alone, they ranne at him on all sides with a great shoute, indeuouring if they could to finish the warres of the whole world in one Mans death, and to be reuenged vpon him for many Nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> on the contrary part, as manfully withstoode them, and being but one man fought against many thousandes. It is almost incredible and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be spoken of, that neither the number of his enemies, the force and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their weapons, nor their confused noyse as they assailed him, could make him affraid, and that being but alone, he should beat downe and put to flight, so great and infinite a company.</p>
                  <p>But when he saw he was ouercharged, he withdrew himselfe to a block, that stoode by a wall, by help whereof standing in safegard, he held them all tacke, till his friendes knowing what perill he stoode in, leapt downe to aide him. Of whom many were slaine, and the battell hung long in suspence, till the time that his Army (hauing beaten downe the walles) came in to his res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue. In that conflict he was striken with an arrow vnder the right pappe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> notwithstanding he bled so sore that he could scarce stand for feeblenesse, yet kneeling on his knee, he neuer left fighting, vntill he had slaine him, of whom <note place="margin">Alexandes sendeth a great hoast to Babylon.</note> he was wounded.</p>
                  <p>The healing of the wound was farre more gricuous then the wound it selfe. Therefore when at length contrary to all hope, he had recouered his health and strength, he sent <hi>Polyperchon,</hi> vvith his host to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and he himselfe
<pb facs="tcp:18325:60"/>
with a number of his most select and chosen Souldiers, tooke shipping, and scowred the <hi>Ocean</hi> Seas, along the coast. When he came at the Citty of king <hi>Ambyger,</hi> the townesmen heating he could not be ouercome by sword, dipt their arrowes in poyson, and so with double wound of death repelled the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <note place="margin">

                  <p>The which being giuen him in drinke, he was forthwith deliuered from theymminent danger, and the most part of the Army was by that meanes preserued. After when he had won the towne by force, he returned into his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> shippes, and made offring to <hi>Neptune,</hi> the Sea-god, with praiers, and petition for safe returne into his Countrey. Then he established the boundes of his Empire as farre as there was any land habitable, or as farre as the sea was able to be sailed, and with prosperous winde entred into the mouth of the Ryuer <hi>Indus.</hi> There (as a monument of his conquests) he builded the <hi>Barce,</hi> and set vp <hi>Altars,</hi> leauing one of his friendes Lieuetenant of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that inhabit the Sea coast.</p>
                  <p>From thence intending to take his iourney by land, as he heard there was scarcity of water by the way, he commaunded pittes to be made in places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient <note place="margin">Alexanders return againe to Babylon</note>

After this, he tooke to wife <hi>Satir,</hi> the daughter of king <hi>Darius.</hi> He also chose out of the Noblest, and most beautifull Ladies and Gentlewomen of all Nations, and gaue them to his Noblemen in marriage: which he did to the intent that the custom and community of the fact, his owne offence might seeme the lighter.</p>
                  <p>Then summond he his Army before him, and enquiring of their debts, he promised to set them free, and pay what they owed out of his owne purse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that they might cary home cleare their booties and rewardes. This liberality was highly extold in <hi>Alexander,</hi> both for the greatnesse of the summe, and in regard of the cheerefull and free guift thereof.

And now they deale not with him by way of petition, but by flat and open rayling. And wish him to sinishe his warres alone with his father <hi>Hammon,</hi> and then go set light by his Souldiers. He on the contrary side somtime rebuked them, sometime ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisht them, perswading with gentle speeches, that they should not darken their famous conquests with rebellion.</p>

At last when he saw his wordes were not auaileable, he rose out of his chaire <note place="margin">13. of thebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners ofthe tumult put to death.</note> vnarmed, and stept amongst the thickest of them, being all armed, to fetch out the Authors of that rebellious contumacy: and without contradiction or resistance brought forth thirteene and lead them to execution with his owne handes. So great a patience in suffering death did the feare of a king cast vpon them, or the customable envring to the discipline of warre giue him bouldnes to put them to death. Then did he cal the <hi>Persians</hi> a part, and speaking to them praised their continuall faithfulnesse both to himselfe, and to their kinges in times past, and rehearsed his benefites towardes them: how he neuer esteemd them as vanquished, but as partakers of his victory, and (to be short) how he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> passed into their lawes, and customes, and not they into the customes of his countrey, hauing made both the conquerors and conquered alike by winning aliance and affinity. And now, he saide he would commit the custody of his owne person not to the <hi>Macedones</hi> onely, but to the safety also of the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therevpon he chose a thousand of their young men into his guard, and to another sort of them he gaue armour, and weapons, and dispearst them into his owne hoaste, that they should learne the orders of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> warres. This the <hi>Macedones</hi> tooke very grieuously, lamenting much that the King should take his enemies to serue in their roomes. And so with teares, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they prostrated themselues at the feet of <hi>Alexander,</hi> requiring him to be more satisfied with punishing them, then with putting them to shame. By which submission they obtained, that Eleauen thousand of the old Souldiers were discharged. And of his friendes there were dismissed, <hi>Polyperchon, Clytus, Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias, Polidamas,</hi> and <hi>Antigonus:</hi> because they were olde Men and by reason thereof not able any longer to endure the trauels of warfarre. <hi>Craterus</hi> had the charge of such as were sent awaye, vvith commffion to take vppon him <note place="margin">Antipater displaced</note> the regynent of <hi>Macedon,</hi> in the place and stead of <hi>Antipater.</hi>

For this cause, as he was making speed to <hi>Babylon,</hi> (to hold a parliament of the whole world) one of the wise men gaue him aduice to refrain his com ming there, for it was the fatall place of his death.

                  <p>Returning therefore to Babylon, when many daies had been ydely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, he began anew his feastings and ryot, which of some long time hee had refrayned: and giuing himselfe wholy thereunto, he spent his time day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and night, in nothing but lasciuious reuelling.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> great with child, yet he forgot them all, both kindred, and alience, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him to be his heire that was worthiest. As if it had not beene lawfull for any to succeed a conqueror, but a Man of courage, and valour. Or to leaue the riches of so great a kingdome to any, that had not proued himselfe a man in the proceedings of Martiall dissipline. With these wordes (as though he had sounded a Trumpet among his Nobility, and sowne the seede of debate and mischiefe) euery one harboured enuy in his heart against other, and with coulorable flattery priuily sought the fauour of the men of warre.</p>
                  <p>The sixt daie when his speech was gone, he tooke the ring from his finger, and deliuered it to <hi>Perdicas,</hi> the which appeased the dissention of his friends, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the which was euen ready to begin amongst them. For although he was not prouounced heire by word of mouth, yet it seemed it was his minde he should succeed him. <hi>Alexander</hi> deseased at the age of three and thirty yeares, and one moneth: a man endued with stoutnesse of courage, and beyond the condition of Mans fraile nature. The same night that his mother <hi>Olimpias</hi> conceiued him, she dreamed she had to do with a great Dragon, neither was she decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the gods in her dreame, for out of all doubt she bare in her wombe, a worke of nature exceeding farre the conceipt of humaine power or capacity. <note place="margin">Tokens that appeared at the death of Alexander.</note> And albeit she was much renowned both for the house of <hi>Aeacus,</hi> from whence by auncient descent of so many hundreth yeares, she was lineally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as also, for that her father, brother, husband, and al her auncestors were kings: yet was she in none of these respects so much to be aduanced, as by her owne sonne.</p>
                  <p>Many wonderfull fortokens of his greatnes apeared at the time of his birth.

In which <hi>Antiochus</hi> being againe vanquished, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with flying many dayes togither, at length came to his father in Law, <hi>Artamenes</hi> king of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> of whom at first he was gently and with good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> respect entertained, but within few dayes after, vnderstanding that he went about to betray him, for sauegard of his life sled back againe from thence. So rouling vp and downe, from one place to another, and finding no room wherin to rest in safety, he was faine to resort for succor to his enemy <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi> whose sayth he thought to be more stedfast then his brothers consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering either what he would haue done to his Brother, or what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued at his brothers hand.</p>

But <hi>Ptolomy</hi> being not so much made his friend, as inlarged his enemy, commanded him to be kept in straight prison, from whence also he escaped by the helpe of a Harlot, whom he had familiar company withal. But being thus escaped from his keepers, as he sled theeues met and killed him. <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> neere about the same instant, hauing lost his kingdome, fell off of his horse, and brake his necke.

In <hi>Asia,</hi> after that <hi>Seluchus</hi> was slaine, <hi>Atigonus</hi> as yet not hauing attained to ful groath and ripenesse of foureteene yeares, was made king. The kingdome of <hi>Capidocia</hi> was surrendred by his father, to <hi>Ariarathes</hi> a very child. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> who for the wickednesse of his offence, was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in derision (sur-named <hi>Philopater)</hi> slewe his father and mother, and vsurped the kingdome of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in sted of <hi>Cleopater,</hi> subroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Lycurgus:</hi> and because there should be store of alterations in those times, <hi>Hanniball</hi> being as yet scarce man-growne, was made Captaine of <hi>Carthage:</hi> not because there was a scarcity of men, of more yeares, or greater experience, but for the naturall and inueterate hatred that was knowne to be rooted in him against the <hi>Romaines,</hi> euen from his very childhood: and as it were, borne to the vtter destruction, not so much of the <hi>Romaines</hi> whom he hated, as of his owne countrey of <hi>Affrcike</hi> whom he serued.</p>
