            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

great light of the Goſpell did appeare to us as a morning Sunne; which impenitency and hardneſſe of heart, ſhould be lamented, if it were poſſible, with teares of blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not to be parrelled; for it doth exceed that of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> for they converted themſelves unto the Lord, and turned from their <note n="a" place="margin">Jonah 3. 8.</note> wicked wayes, by the preaching and the the threatnings of the Prophet <hi>Jonah;</hi> But alas! the preaching of all theſe faithfull Meſſengers of God, nor the Judgements that have been inflicted theſe three yeares upon this Nation, cannot move us to feare and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the laſt <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 15.</note> viols of the wrath of God, that are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall upon our heads, ſo inſenſible and ſtupid are our hearts, that they ſeeme like <hi>Nabals</hi> heart, to be turned into <note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 7.</note> ſtones: And yet there never was more Faſting; nor more dayes of Humiliation, nor prayers addreſſed to the Throne of Grace, in this Kingdome, then there is at this preſent time, and ſince theſe warres began; What may then be the reaſon, that our prayers are rejected at this time by our gracious God? It muſt aſſuredly be this, That our Faſts, our humiliations and our prayers, are all formall, and not ſincere; and that we applaud the <note n="d" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5.</note> forme, but deny the power of godlineſſe; and that we ſerve God with our lipps, and deny him in our hearts; we bowe downe our heads for a day, like a <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 68. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

And as concerning the Generall Reformation of the Doctrine and the Diſcipline of the Church; we are all bound to petition to the Honourable Houſes of <hi>Parliament;</hi> that they would be pleaſed, to make the ſame the firſt worke of their unparrelled labours: And that it may have the precedency of the Civill, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Military Reformations; becauſe the bleſſed iſſue of theſe laſt, depends altogether upon the ſetling of the firſt; as I will endeavour to make it appeare by theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our gracious God is a jealous God, that abhorres all mixtures of Religions; and hath been pleaſed to teach us,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60250:5"/>
to prefer his Glory before all other reſpects: And that all other ends ſet apart, we are to give in all our conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reformations, the precedency to the purity of his ſervice, as he hath given us a preſident for it in the firſt Table of his <note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> Commandements; wherein the Spirituall duties, have the precedency before the Morall, that are contained in the ſecond Table. And this order hath been religiouſlly obſerved by the Prophets, and the good Kings of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and out of a certaine inſtinct of nature, that teacheth men to reverence the Deity, by the very Heathen; as it may be collected out of the lives of <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Solon</hi> and <note n="m" place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in their lives.</note> 
                  <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the Legiſlators of the <hi>Lacedemonians, Athenians</hi> and <hi>Romanes:</hi> Now if we omit, out of carnall ends, to render unto our gracious God, that reverence that is due to him from us, in regard of his glory and worſhip, his jealouſie will be ſo ſpeedily inflamed, and his wrath ſo kindled againſt us, that we ſhall rather draw his judgements upon our heads, then bleſſings upon our Civill, Politique and Military enterpriſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſedome, even ſo the reeſtabliſhing of the purity of his ſervice in the Church, is the firſt meanes to obtaine from him, in time of diſtreſſe and affliction, ſtore of mercies and deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; this point may be proved by may inſtances out of the Book of <hi>Iudges;</hi> when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently delivered, from great ſervitude and tribulations, (that were fallen upon them for neglecting the purity of <note place="margin">See the whole Book of <hi>Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>
                  </note> the ſervice that God had appointed them, to goe a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after Idols, and ſtrange Religions) as ſoone as they ſet a reforming hand to the Church abuſes, and returned and cryed, with ſincere hearts to the Lord their God. The incomparable Mercies and deliverances that God was pleaſed to give to <note n="n" place="margin">2 King. 193 350.</note> 
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> may alſo be a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60250:5"/>
ſpeciall Inſtance for the Proofe of this point; for they proceeded from the zeale he had at the beginning of his raigne to reforme the Church of God of all the abuſes and Innovations that were crept in the ſame, in the time of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Father. And the great Love and Mercies that the Lord ſhewed unto <note n="o" place="margin">1 Kin. 22, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> may be another fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for the proofe of this point; for they ſprang from that unparalelled zeale he had to reforme the abuſes and idolatrie that was crept in the Church, and had defiled the Purity of the Service of God, in the time of <hi>Amon</hi> his Father; for in zeale, and diligent love and affection to purge the Church, and to eſtabliſh a true and cordiall Reformation in Judah, he exceeded all the other good Kings of Judah; And therefore the Lord did for his ſake delay and retard the judgements that he had long before intended to ſend upon Jeruſalem, and granted him that mercy, as they happened not in his dayes; nor was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the ſight of the lamentable deſolation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that befell preſently after upon the Citie, the Temple, and the whole Nation of the Jewes. Out of which Inſtances may be collected, That there is nothing more acceptable unto God then when Kings and Princes, or Magiſtrates doe begin their Reformations, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Precedencie of it to the affaires of the Church, in caſe of reeſtabliſhing the true Puritie of his Service and Worſhip. 3. The retarding of a true Reformation, and reeſtabliſhing of the Purity of Gods worſhip is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in three manner of wayes to a Kingdome or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale. 1. Becauſe diverſitie of opinions in Religion breeds contentions; for alienation of affections are moſt apt to proceed from the contrarietie of opinions in points of Religion, as there is no greater bond to linke mens affections together, then an unanimous aſſent of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60250:6"/>
in matters of doctrine and diſcipline of the Church, and of that Religion they openly profeſſe. And therefore it is no wonder if contentions and diviſions doe abound among us, ſince every one is ſuffered to entertaine what opinion he pleaſes in points of Religion. Now publike contentions breed mutinies, combuſtions, and at laſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and an inteſtine warre; for the proofe of which point, we need no other inſtance then our owne miſeries; for if the Popiſh Religion had been kept under in the Raigne of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and in the Raigne of his Majeſtie that now is our Soveraigne, this unnaturall warre of ours might according to humane reaſon and probabilities have been prevented; for by the raiſing of ſome of that profeſſion to great honours and preferments, they have, to ſubſiſt and ſtrengthen themſelves, withdrawne the Perſon of his Majeſtie, and alienated his Love and his affections from his moſt faithfull Parliament, and from the reſt of his moſt Loyall Subjects, whereby jealouſies have been fomented, two parties formed, and this inteſtine war pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. 2. The retarding of a true Reformation in the Church makes this Reformation more difficult to be performed; for ſince this warre begun, and this licentious libertie of opinions in Religion hath been connived at, the one partie is increaſed in Poperie, idolatry, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Profaneneſſe, Atheiſme, Impietie, and Crueltie; and the other in Separatiſts, Independents, Browniſts, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Antinomians, Socinians, and Libertines, that like ſo many Giants oppoſe Godlineſſe and a true Reformation; for a Civill warre, and a licentious liberty of erroneous opinions is Satans harveſt, and the time that he ſoweth his pernicious ſeed in the field of <note n="p" place="margin">Matt. 13. 25.</note> Wheat of the painfull husbandman, and makes it increaſe as the weeds doe in a garden after a ſoaking ſhowre of raine, or multiply like a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60250:6"/>
ſwarme of Bees in the beginning of the Summer. And we ſee by experience that theſe Sectaries are not onely multiplyed into incredible multitudes, but are become alſo ſo impudent and bold, as to expoſtulate and make Apologies for to obtaine a free Liberty of Conſcience, as they terme it, to cover their licentious and impious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that is, to doe all manner of evill, and to teach all manner of hereſies, and unheard of opinions; And that they may ſay and act what ſeemeth good in their owne eyes; As if there was neither King, nor a Parliament, nor any Magiſtrates in this Kingdome to ſuppreſſe and keepe them in awe; As there was none in Iſrael in the time of <note n="q" place="margin">Judg. 17. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Micah</hi> that made a molten image and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſame in ſtead of the living God. Even ſo if their requeſt were granted (which God forbid) we ſhould have more ſects among us then the Egyptians had deities. And ſuch an <hi>Olio Podrigo</hi> of Religions as never was in any Nation, which would ſpeedily produce a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this confuſion would immediately after bring forth a generall deſolation upon the land in lien of a true Reformation. 3. The retarding of the reeſtabliſhing of the Purity of the Service of God in our Church, makes many to ſtagger, not knowing on which ſide to ſtand, when they conſider the one ſide infected with profanitie and impietie, and the other with Sectaries and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines; whereas if the Doctrine and the Diſcipline of the Church was publiſhed and ſettled, the true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Meſſengers of God that are among us might then be bold to propound to the people in their Sermons and publike Exhortations as <note n="r" place="margin">1 Kin. 18. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Achans</hi> that are the cauſe of all our diſgraces; for they foment the contentions that ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Commanders in Chiefe, betweene their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, between the Lievtenants and the Committees of our Counties: Nay, they dare preſume to foment them in our Senate, Aſſembly, between the Magiſtrates, in our <hi>Militia,</hi> Hals, Citie, and between the Citizens and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, to the end they may ſubſiſt and fiſh in the muddy waters of theſe Civill diſtractions; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no likelihood that a true Reformation may be procured before theſe Sectaries and licentious perſons be baniſhed into the unknowne Iſlands, that the venome of their contagious tenents may not infect no more any of the ſimple or ignorant ſouls of theſe three Kingdomes. I am not ignorant that the Honourable Houſes were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fervent at the beginning of this Parliament to give the precedencie of this intended Generall Reformation to the affaires of the Church, and to the reſtoring of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Service and Worſhip of God, and withall to have cleanſed the Kingdom of this vermine of Sectaries, and accurſed thing of licentious and impious men, as a moſt proper and peculiar work for ſuch wiſe and pious Senators. But alas, our ſins were the cauſe that this fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was quenched, and that holy reſolution retarded by the cunning of Satan, and the deluding inſinuations of his agents, I meane, of the Prelacie and Jeſuiticall faction, which under the colour of the publike good, infuſed the venome of theſe contagious poſitions into the hearts of men, That there was neither Wiſdome nor Policy to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſo ſpeedily the Presbyterial Diſcipline in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe it would deprive the Parliament of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60250:7"/>
the great contributions that might be collected out of the multitudes of theſe Sectaries, that would rather goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, or ſide with the enemy, then to ſubmit or conforme themſelves to that Diſcipline; and that it were ſafer to delay till theſe differences were nearer to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. Wiſe and carnall men, but blind and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in ſpirituall things, this Counſell being like to prove as fatall unto them, as the counſel that <note n="t" place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Ahithophel</hi> gave to <hi>Abſalom</hi> (to enter into his Fathers Concubines at noone day; that he might make him uncapable of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his father) was to himſelfe, for it was as pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in a two-fold manner. 1. That the Contributions of theſe Sectaries might prove among the Contributions of the Children of God, as the mothers that breed or come in a piece of rich cloth, that conſume and ſpoile the ſame in a ſhort time. 2. That by the conniving at theſe Sectaries againſt the ſpeciall Word of God, we might be made ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable with our gracious and heavenly Father. And for to make this pernicious Counſell more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they ſaid it was the Policy of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that doe indeed give a free Toleration to all ſorts of Religions, becauſe they are of all the Nations of Chriſtendome the moſt addicted to the Laodicean Temper, and will doe any thing for gain. But this carnall Policy of theirs is like to prove fatall unto them; for this Toleration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions hath already fomented ſo many diviſions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions among them, that will in all probabilitie be the cauſe of their ruine, if they prevent it not by a ſpeedy and a cordiall repentance: for a Kingdome or a Common-weale divided within it ſelfe cannot <note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 12. 25.</note> ſubſiſt; And it is a wonder and a great mercy of God that we are not already conſumed, for never was a Kingdome more rent with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and contentions then <hi>England</hi> is. Now it ſtands
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60250:8"/>
not with the Honour, wiſedome and pious inclination of the honourable Houſes of Parliament to prefer carnall Counſels before the good of the Church of God. They may be as prudent as ſerpents, and as ſimple as doves; but to allow of, or connive at a ſmall evill, to avoide a greater, it is not convenient to the <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> and the <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> of our times; they are rather to ſay, Should ſuch a <note n="x" place="margin">Nehem. 6. 11.</note> man as I ſlee? or ſhould ſuch men as we diſpleaſe God, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving for a time at Sectaries for their Contributions? Alas, theſe contributions are vaniſhed away like the chaffe that is driven away by a whirle wind, ſuch a blow as we have had of late in the Weſt would ſwallow three yeares of their Contributions, and who can tell if it were not for their Toleration that it was given us; and that theſe warres might have been ended two yeares agoe but for them; But I am ſure that <note n="y" place="margin">Joſh 7. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Achan</hi> was to be ſtoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Army of Iſrael could overcome Ai; And that <note n="z" place="margin">Jonah 1. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Ionah</hi> was to be caſt over-board into the ſea, before the ſhip and the Marriners could obtaine a calme. Nay, the erectors of our New Jeruſalem are to be like <hi>Moſes,</hi> that rejected the honours, riches, and the pleaſures of Egypt, to ſuffer reproach and affliction with his brethren, the Children of God; And like <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> that forſooke the great preferments that they had at the Court of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the two great Kings of Perſia, for to erect the ſecond Temple, and reſtore the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the ancient Service of the Jewes. Now ſo much more as the building of this New Jeruſalem doth exceed in worth and infatigable labour, the reedifying of the old, and as much as the reſtauration of the puritie of the Service and of the true Worſhip of God doth exceed the ancient Service of the Jewes. So much ſhould the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabels</hi> and the <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> of our daies endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

in courage, fervour, and zeale in this great worke and acceptable Service of the Lord, I meane, in perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this true Reformation in hand. But becauſe they are but men, and ſubject to the like paſſions and infirmities as we are, we are all bound in generall, and every one in particular, to addreſſe our fervent prayers to the Throne of Grace, That God will be pleaſed to indue them with all ſuch abilities of courage, reſolution, wiſedome, and unitie, that they may ſpeedily erect the foundations of this ſo long hoped for Jeruſalem upon the Rock of the true Word of God, that it may ſtand like Mount Sion for ever immoveable, notwithſtanding all oppoſitions whatſoever, of the roaring waves, of the ſwelling bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and of the inraged ſeas of theſe Civill diſtractions, to the great Glory of God, to the everlaſting Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Children, and to the immortall honour of the Erectours.</p>

To intimate by her skarfe, her impartiality; by the ballances, her wiſedome; and by the ſword, her activity. By her impartiality ſhe is to make no diſtinction of perſons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be noble, rich or poore, ſhe is to doe Juſtice to all.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60250:9"/>
or moderate her cenſure or judgement; by her activity, ſhe is to be ſpeedy, avoiding delayes and reprives; for time is a producer of accidents that perverts &amp; hinders the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Juſtice, and ſo farre doth naturall morality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct men concerning Juſtice. But Gods Word and the Principles of Chriſtianitie doth informe men, That Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is ordained of God, and one of his greateſt Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; for he is as Juſt as Mercifull; and that he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the ſword of Juſtice to Princes and Magiſtrates to execute impartially, juſtly, and ſpeedily Juſtice and Judgement upon the ſonnes of men, that are naturally prone to evill and backward to good by the ſeed of their originall corruption that remaineth in them, which like Tinder is apt to receive the ſparkes of the fire that Satan ſtrikes by the ſteele of his tentations, out of thoſe carnall objects that are more ſutable to their naturall inclinations. Now this aptneſſe to evill, increaſed by the allurements of Satan, doth inflame their affections to all manner of licentious deſires, and by degrees drawes their will to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the execution of them, and this execution or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of ſin doth create an habite in evill, and this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite produceth an allowance of ſinne, that bringeth forth a ſhameleſſe impudencie to uphold all manner of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety; and ſo by degrees conduces them to a hardneſſe of heart, and without a ſpeciall Grace of God, to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſenſe, that would carry them head-long like wilde horſes to eternall confuſion; if God by his Law and his reſtraining Spirit did not bridle their licentiouſneſſe. Therefore knowing the naturall diſpoſition of men; he was pleaſed for to curbe their wicked inclination, to write with his owne hand upon two Tables of ſtone his ten <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> Commandements, for the regulating of his owne elected people of Iſrael, over whom he committed his

ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> and intruſted him with the ſword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as his ſpeciall Deputy, to adminiſter Juſtice and Judgement to his People; But he finding himſelfe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdered with ſo great a charge, by the Counſell of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro</hi> appointed divers other ſubordinate Magiſtrates ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of the wiſeſt men of all the Tribes of Iſrael, that judged the people, but only in ſome difficult caſes, that he reſerved to himſelfe. Now theſe ten Commandements have been and are the Ground-worke of all other divine and humane Lawes, that have been multiplyed from time to time, according to the increaſe of the malice and the impiety of men. For in the yeare ſixe hundred of the Foundation of Rome, the Romanes had no Law for <note n="b" place="margin">See the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  </note> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides, but at that time an impious ſonne having mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his Father, a law was made he ſhould be ſowne up into a lether ſack, and caſt alive into the River of Tyber. But it is not the multiplicity of Lawes that makes a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on happy, it is rather the ſpeedy and the unpartiall execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; for it fals out too often, That delay of Juſtice is meere injuſtice, becauſe many men are undone by the long and tedious delayes of Juſtice, and divers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſuffer wrong, rather then they will conſume their eſtates in procuring of Juſtice. Now if this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Lawes are ſuffered to have a noſe of wax, that may be turned or conſtrued on the right, or on the left ſide, as the Judge pleaſeth; Or like unto the ſhe Spiders webb, that ſerveth onely to inſnare ſmall ſlyes, that the male Spider may devoure them; but permits the buſſing Waſpe to breake thorow the ſame without impediment; they will be like ſo many Leaches, to ſuck the bloud of the common people, and in a ſhort time caſt a Kingdome into inteſtine contentions, as ours is at this time, and all for want of the execution of the Lawes and wholeſome
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60250:10"/>
Statutes that were eſtabliſhed in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth and Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time againſt the Recuſants and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The ſpeedy and unpartiall execution of Juſtice is then the very <hi>Atlas</hi> that ſupports and maintaines a Kingdome in proſperitie and Peace; It entertaines for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne confederations; It drawes the bleſſing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; It foments love and unity among Subjects; It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth Trade and commerce betweene Merchants, and between Citizen Trades-men and countrey people; Nay, it is the very Court of Guard of all his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. In a word, the Omiſſion and delay of Juſtice is odious to God, deſtructive to Kingdomes, and fatall to families and private men, the which I will endeavour to prove by Inſtances. But that I may goe on in a Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call way, I will in the firſt place inſiſt upon the danger of the delay and the omitting of it. Secondly, upon the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that accrew upon the ſpeedy and unpartiall execution of it.

becauſe he was zealous for his God, and made an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of God for an extraordinary bleſſing to the <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 33. 21.</note> Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> ſaith, <hi>And he came with the head of the people, he executed the Iuſtice of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. meaning that this Tribe above all others ſhould have Rulers that would adminiſter Juſtice ſpeedily and impartially, which was in <hi>Moſes</hi> opinion one of the greateſt bleſſings that could befall men. 3. <note n="f" place="margin">Job 8. 3.</note>

For by him <note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 8. 15.</note> Princes doe raigne and doe decree Juſtice, &amp;c. for they are indeed his Deputies to adminiſter Juſtice. 4.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60250:14"/>
&amp;c. meaning that he was alwayes ready to doe that which the Rulers of Iſrael were ſo unwilling to doe; and that he was angry, becauſe they did not give eare to them that required and called for Juſtice. 8. The Lord is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremely diſpleaſed when Juſtice is delaid, or omitted; as may appeare by this paſſage of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is turned backward, and Iustice</hi>

                  <hi>ſtandeth afarre off: for Truth is fallen in the ſtreet, and equity cannot enter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yea, Truth faileth, and he that departeth from evill maketh himſelfe a prey.</hi> By theſe humane Inſtances, and paſſages of the Word of God, we may ſee how dangerous it is to omit or delay Juſtice, and how pleaſant and acceptable it is to God, when Juſtice is ſpeedily and unpartially admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred: And therefore we are all bound in Generall, and every one in particular to addreſſe our fervent prayers to God, that he would be pleaſed to infuſe into the hearts of all the members of the Honourable Houſes, an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to adminiſter ſpeedy and unpartiall Juſtice. Now they have drawne the ſword out of her ſheath, by the Commiſſioners of war, they have lately appointed to bring to a ſpeedy Triall all thoſe Criminall offenders, that they have in their Cuſtody. Foure of which have been the cauſe of the ſhedding of more Chriſtian bloud then ever <note n="o" place="margin">1 Kin, 20. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> cauſed to be ſplit of the people of Iſrael. And therefore the delay of their Triall is the more dangerous, for time produceth many accidents that hinder and pervert Juſtice. If all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were not acquainted with the unmatchleſſe Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie and indulgent proceedings of the Honourable Houſes toward their priſoners, the Malignant ſpirits would inpute the long retention of ſo many priſoners to Cruelty.

Now of all occaſions or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities the Spirituall, Civill, and Military are of greateſt concernment; for the firſt concernes our ſoules; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, our private and the publike welfare; and the laſt, our lives and liberties. And by conſequence the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of them very profitable, and the omitting of them very prejudiciall to men. But of theſe three the Spirituall opportunities are as much more to be carefully embraced as the Soule is more pretious then our meanes, lives, and liberties; for upon the carefull and diligent obſervation of them depends our perpetuall Bliſſe, and upon the neglect of them our eternall woe. Neither can we expect to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Grace to make a profitable uſe of the Civill and of the Military Opportunities, unleſſe we be diligent and faithfull to obſerve all ſpirituall opportunities, that may conduce to the advancement of the Glory of God, the good of his Church, and to the Salvation of our Soules.

And therefore that we are to be very circumſpect and obſervant to catch her by the fore-lock, as ſhe preſents her ſelfe to us; for if ſhe doe but turne her back, having no hold behind, we looſe her for ever.

As I will endeavour to prove by humane Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and by Inſtances out of the Word of God. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I deſire (for feare of mispriſion) to ground my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon this Principle of Religion, That whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the free-will, the good pleaſure, and the eternall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, is pleaſed to bleſſe a Kingdome with Peace and Proſperity; he will then inable the King, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, Generals of Armies, Magiſtrates, and all other ſubordinate Officers of that Kingdome to make uſe of all opportunities that may conduce to that end. But on the contrary ſide, If his will and pleaſure be to humble, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, or deſtroy a Kingdome, then will he diſable the King, his Counſellours, Generals of Armies, Magiſtrates, and all other ſubordinate Officers of that Kingdome, to omit and neglect all favourable opportunities that may be offered to them, that his will, pleaſure, and eternall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe concerning the humiliation, correction, or deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Kingdome, Common-weale, families, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons may come to paſſe and be accompliſhed in his time. But ſome will object and ſay, If all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, occaſions, or advantages in Spirituall, Civill, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary actions depend meerly upon the free-will, the good pleaſure, and the eternall purpoſe of God, whether we be carefull or careleſſe, wiſe or imprudent, valiant or time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or omit or imbrace all Spirituall, Civill, and Military opportunities it matters not. Why ſhould we then trouble our ſelves to be diligent and zealous in ſpirituall duties? wiſe &amp; prudent in Civill actions, and circumſpect, valiant &amp; expert in Military exploits, ſince the iſſue of all depends upon the will of God? I anſwer, that this ſecret will, and eternall purpoſe of God is a Myſtery to men, and that the wiſeſt men upon earth cannot dive into it, and therefore that we are to obey his revealed will; that is, that we

ſhould be fervent, zealous and diligent in all ſpirituall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to make our calling and <note n="a" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> election ſure; and to be wiſe and prudent in all Civill actions; according to that degree he hath beene pleaſed to indue us withall; and make uſe of the experience, valour, and courage in warre that we have obtained as a gift from him; to conduce all ſuch things we undertake to the advancement of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the good of his Church, and to the peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie of our Countrie; and doing ſo, and in all our ends aiming at that blank, howſoever it pleaſeth the Lord to give an iſſue to our unfained endeavours, we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a good Conſcience before God and men. But if men, in this glorious light, or Sunne-ſhine of the Goſpel, will wilfully neglect the gracious meanes that God is pleaſed to afford them, to procure their Salvation by the merits of Chriſt with feare and <note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 2. 10.</note> trembling; and fall from the faith, and run a whoring after Popiſh Idolatry; or the vaine and erroneous opinions of Sectaries, or the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impious courſes of the ungodly and profane men of theſe dayes; let them lay the cauſe of their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon themſelves, and not upon the ſecret will of our moſt juſt and gracious God, that doth not deſire the death of a ſinner, but rather that he would <note n="c" place="margin">Jer. 36. 7.

Or if the wiſe and prudent men of theſe times ſhould for ſome private ends omit to adviſe or counſell ſuch things as in their owne judgement doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the above bleſſed end, God notwithſtanding will doe his worke, and they will remaine inexcuſable before him. But if they adviſe or counſell ſincerely ſuch things as they judge to conduce to that blank aboveſaid, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the wiſedome and prudence the Lord hath given them, howſoever the iſſue of their Counſell fall out, they have diſcharged a good Conſcience before God and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60250:17"/>
men. Even ſo if our Commanders in Chiefe, or their ſubordinate Officers doe embrace all opportunities that are offered to them, to end or to conduce this warre to a bleſſed peace, howſoever the iſſue of it be, they will be blameleſſe before God and men; but if for any private ends they omit any opportunities, rules, Maximes, or Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemes of Military exploits to ſpinne out this Unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Warre, whereby they may endanger the State and themſelves (as oftentimes it comes to paſſe, that omiſſions in Military exploits hath overthrowne Kingdomes or Common-weales and their Commanders alſo) as it ſhall be proved by Inſtances; yet ſhall the iſſue of this warre turne to Gods Glory and to the good of his Church; for God is not tied to ſecondary meanes; but will in his due time notwithſtanding their wilfull omiſſions grant us a bleſſed peace; but they ſhall be inexcuſable before him, and looſe their honour and reputation with men. For op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, advantages in warre, are ſo many mercies that the Lord doth graciouſly offer to Commanders. Now if theſe mercies be deſpiſed, and theſe advantages omitted wittingly, God is an all-ſeeing God, that will find out a time how cloſely ſoever it be carryed, to reward them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intentions of their hearts. But becauſe there hath beene many faire opportunities loſt within theſe three yeares, that might, if they had been imbraced, have conduced this Unnaturall Warre to a bleſſed Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, and that they are imputed by them that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the events of warre, to the neglect and omiſſion of ſome of our Commanders in Chiefe, I will endeavour to prove by Ancient and Moderne Enſamples; that when God hath been pleaſed to humble, correct, or deſtroy a Kingdome, that the wiſeſt Politicians, and the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Commanders that ever were have omitted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60250:17"/>
greater opportunities then they have done. 1. In the yeare 432. of the foundation of Rome; God being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to humble the Romanes, and utterly to deſtroy the Samnites, did ſo blind the Judgements of the Generals of theſe two Nations, that they let ſlip two faire oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities; firſt the two Conſuls of the Romanes <hi>Titus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turius</hi> and <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Titus 1. vius, decad. 1. lib. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Sempronius Poſthumius</hi> omitted the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie they had to march with their Army to <hi>Luceria,</hi> a City they intended to beſiege by the ſea-ſhore, the way being plaine and ſecure, for to take a way thorow the mountaines, that led them to a paſſe called <hi>Caudium,</hi> invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with ſteepe Rocks and high mountaines, where they were preſently incloſed by the Samnites, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for want of Proviſions to require quarter, which they obtained upon theſe conditions, That they ſhould leave ſix hundred Knights for hoſtages, ſurrender their Armes, <note place="margin">This may be paralelled with our laſt blow in the Weſt.</note> Horſes, Carriages, and baggage, and paſſe under the yoke for their over-ſight. Secondly, the Samnites had here a faire opportunity to have concluded a perpetuall peace with the Romanes, if they had ſet at liberty, and provided the Romanes with Proviſions for their returne, as they were counſelled by a wiſe Senator of theirs <hi>Herenius</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Generall; But they unadviſedly for a little booty were the Cauſe of their own deſtruction; for the Romanes were ſo incenſed with this ignominy received, that they never ceaſed untill they had by force of Armes, reduced all the Samnites and their Countrey unto Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Colonies. 2. In the ſecond Punick warre, The Romanes by the great victories obtained in Sycilia and Sardinia againſt the Carthaginians, being ſwollen up with pride, God was pleaſed to humble them againe, and ſo ſent <hi>Hannibal</hi> with a great Army into Italy, that defeated them in the three famous battels of the River Trebie, of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60250:18"/>
the lake Traſymene, and of Cannes; where they loſt above one hundred thouſand men; yet becauſe God had decreed that Rome ſhould be the fourth, and the <note n="e" place="margin">Dan. 7. 19.</note> greateſt Monarchy in the world; he was pleaſed to infatuate the Judgement of <note n="f" place="margin">See <hi>Hannibals</hi> life.</note> 
                  <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the moſt provident, and the moſt active Generall that ever was, to omit the faireſt opportunity that his heart could have wiſhed to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for his Common-weale a perpetuall Peace of the Romanes; or by advancing immediately after his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at Cannes to the wals of Rome, that was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily amazed, and weakly manned; To have over-throwne by the taking of it, the whole Romane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale; but the Omiſſion of this opportunity was the cauſe of his owne ruine, and of the deſtruction of his native Countrey. 3. The Omiſſion of the opportunity that <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Plutarch in Paulus &amp; Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius his life.</note> 
                  <hi>Perſus</hi> the laſt King of Macedonia had to proclaime warre againſt the Romanes when <hi>Hannibal</hi> was in Italy, and <hi>Scipio</hi> in Affrica, was the cauſe he was ſhortly after deprived of his Kingdome, and himſelfe inforced to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low like a ſlave the Triumphant Chariot of <hi>Paulus Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi> his Conquerour; And yet it is not to be doubted but this King had wiſe Counſellours and Politicians about him; but God had decreed that the Kingdome of Macedonia ſhould be of the number of thoſe Kingdomes that ſhould exalt the Romane Monarchy. 4. The omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the opportunity that <note n="h" place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Lucallus</hi> his life.</note> 
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great had to proclaime warre againſt the Romanes when their forces were buſied in Macedonia, was the cauſe that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in divers battels, conſtrained to make a diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peace with the Romanes; and that Armenia the great was preſently after brought under the Romane yoke by <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Pompeius;</hi> neither did this great Monarch want great Politicians and experienced Commanders;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60250:18"/>
for <hi>Hannibal</hi> attended at his Court, but God had decreed that his large Dominions ſhould increaſe the Romane Empire. 5. The omiſſion of the opportunitie that <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> the <note n="i" place="margin">See <hi>Des Serres</hi> Inventary in <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt his life.</note> Lautrec Generall of the French in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Naples had to take the Citie of Naples, if he had purſued the Prince of Orange, as the rules of warre requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, after he had routed his Army, was the cauſe of this valiant Commanders death, and the loſſe of the whole Kingdome of Naples. 6. The omiſſion of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an houres time that <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth <note n="k" place="margin">See <hi>Des Serres</hi> Inventary in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth his life.</note> King of France had to defeat the Duke of Parme and all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at a ſtrait paſſage leading to the ford of a ſmall River three ſmall Leagues from Paris, where he had purpoſed to fall upon him, was the cauſe he was conſtrained to raiſe his ſiege, and to ſee before his face that great City relieved, that was then reduced to extreme Miſery by want of Proviſions. This ſlip of opportunity proceeding certainly from the ſecret will of God, that decreed that Paris ſhould be yeelded preſently after to the will and obedience of her lawfull Prince, without the ſhedding of a drop of bloud; for <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was one of the moſt active and experienced Commanders of that Age. Now I come to prove by Inſtances out of the Word of God that all opportunities are guided and directed by the ſpeciall providence of God. 1. The favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 14. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Rebekah</hi> comming the firſt of all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to the well, according to the requeſt of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, cannot be ſaid to be accidentall, for the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe ſo clearly manifeſt, that it was guided by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Providence of God. 2. The gracious opportunity of the <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 37. 24, 25, 27.</note> Iſhmaelites comming by preſently after <hi>Joſephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren had caſt him into a Pit; that he might be ſold and led into Egypt, to become the preſerver of all his fathers

family, came not caſually, but by a ſpeciall and gracious providence of God, proceeding from the love and care he hath of his Children. 3. The bleſſed opportunity of <note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter comming down to waſh her ſelfe at the River <hi>Nylus</hi> was not accidentall, but directed by an admirable Providence of God, to ſave <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he might be inſtructed in all the Sciences of the Egyptians, to be more able to diſcharge the great and honourable charge the Lord had appointed him unto, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the deliverer of his elected people of Iſrael, that groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cruell bondage of the Egyptians. 4. The favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opportunity for <note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 4, 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul,</hi> of the loſſe of the Aſſes of <hi>Kiſh</hi> his father came not accidentally, but by a ſpeciall Providence of God, that <hi>Saul</hi> might be privately anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted King of Iſrael, according to the will and pleaſure of the Lord; neither did thoſe ſignes that the Prophet <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> told him he ſhould meet withall upon the way, as he returned homeward, happen caſually, but by the ſpeciall Providence of God; that the words he had ſpoken by his Prophet concerning the election of <hi>Saul</hi> to the Crowne of Iſrael might be confirmed. 5. The gracious oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that. <note n="p" place="margin">2 Sam. 17. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Huſhat</hi> tooke by the fore-lock, to overthrow the wiſe Counſell of <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> came not accidentally but by an admirable Providence of God, that <hi>Ahithophel</hi> might for his former impious Counſell concerning King <hi>Davids</hi> concubines, runne head-long to confuſion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his worldly wiſdome, and that <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſhould receive the juſt reward of his perſidious and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred rebellion againſt ſo loving a Father. 6. The bleſſed opportunity that <note n="q" place="margin">2 Kin. 9. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of Judah tooke upon the blaſphemies of <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> againſt God and the Temple of Jeruſalem, to goe up into the Houſe of the Lord, and there rehearſed all the words of <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60250:19"/>
rent his clothes and humbled himſelfe greatly, was the cauſe that the Lord hearkened to his prayer, and ſent one of his Angels into the Camp of the Aſſyrians, and ſmote one hundred and foureſcore thouſand of his men; and cauſed <hi>Sennacherib</hi> to returne the ſame way he came. 7. The gracious opportunity that <note n="r" place="margin">Neh. 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tooke upon the King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> notice of his dejected countenance for his extraordinary humiliation, becauſe of the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeruſalem, was the cauſe that he obtained a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the King to erect again the Temple of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; and to reſtore there the true worſhip of God; and to deliver from Captivity many thouſands of the Jewes. 8. The bleſſed opportunity that Queene <note n="s" place="margin">Eſth. 7. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſther</hi> took by the fore-lock to petition to the King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> when he was invited to her banket, for the preſervation of herſelf and of her people, was the cauſe of one of the greateſt bleſſings that ever happened to the Church of the Jewes; for it was the cauſe of the preſervation of all the Nation of the Jewes, and of the Houſe and Family of King <hi>David,</hi> from which our bleſſed Saviour according to the fleſh was to deſcend; and therefore an incomparable bleſſing. By theſe and the former Inſtances we may ſee, that the obſervations or omiſſions of all Spirituall, Civill, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary opportunities depend upon the ſpeciall Providence of God; and that they are guided and directed by it to that end, that God in his wiſedome knowes to be moſt convenient to conduce to the greater advancement of his glory, and the good of his Church. And that we are to addreſſe our humble ſupplications to him alone, if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the future to prevent the ſlips of ſuch opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as he ſhall be pleaſed to afford unto us againe, or be able to embrace them as ſo many gracious mercies of his favour to us in Chriſt. And that we are alſo to humble
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60250:20"/>
ourſelves before our gracious God, for having hitherto ſo careleſly omitted ten ſpeciall opportunities, that might greatly have conduced to obtaine a bleſſed peace; and to procure a happy Period to this Unnaturall Warre, if he had been pleaſed to have given us the grace to have embraced them; by which omiſſion of ours; and by as many more faire opportunities omitted by the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the like Providence of his, we may be perſwaded upon a ſure ground; ſince it is his pleaſure to poiſe in the balance of his divine Juſtice the events of this Unnaturall Warre ſo equally, that our Humiliation muſt be greater and more ſincere, before we can be eſteemed fit for to ſee a gracious deliverance, and a bleſſed end of theſe publike miſeries. I ſhould now in this place to illuſtrate this point relate theſe twenty opportunities or advantages omitted on both ſides; but I deſire to be excuſed, ſince they are already but too evident to ingenious ſpirits; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will leave them to be expoſed to the publike view in the next ſucceeding age by ſome that may then relate them truly and unpartially without feare to offend any of the Parties: And will conclude this point with this Chriſtian admonition to the true Children of God; that they are all obliged in the generall, and every one in their particular to pray day and night unto the Lord, that he will be pleaſed to indue his ſacred Majeſty, the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſes of Parliament, the Generals of their Armies, their Magiſtrates, and all their ſubordinate Officers with ſuch ſupernaturall Graces, Wiſedome, and fore-ſight, that they may imbrace cheerefully all ſuch opportunities and advantages that he ſhall be pleaſed to offer unto them, to obtaine a bleſſed Peace with Truth; and to give a happy Period to theſe Civill diſtractions, jealouſies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions that will by degrees if God in his Mercy, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60250:20"/>
they in their care and Wiſedome prevent it not, reduce this Kingdome to an incurable conſumption: for all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and opportunities in warre, except they aime and tend to that bleſſed end of peace above-ſaid, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fatall to ſuch as require it not, when they have an advantage to doe it, for ſo it fell out with the Samnites and with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as it doth appeare by the two firſt inſtances quoted in this Chap. for it is too late to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Treaties of Peace, when a Kingdome is ſo extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of meanes or abilities, that it can no longer contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the charges of warre; becauſe ſuch a peace can neither be profitable or honourable to any of the parties; for Neceſſity hath no law, and neceſſity will conſtraine men to hard conditions; There is more honour and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to give a Peace then to accept of it. This was the <note n="t" place="margin">See <hi>Pierie Mat.</hi> in King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth his life.</note> Maxime of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth both with his owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and with the Houſe of Auſtria, whereby he obtained great honour, and reſtored a deſolated Kingdome into a flouriſhing eſtate; over-rigorous conditions to one of the parties makes a peace of no continuance; It fell out ſo with u <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour of Germany by the rigorous peace he inforced upon <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt King of France, becauſe of the advantage he had, the ſaid King being then his priſoner; but it proved fatall unto him, for after he had conſumed in warre thirty millions of gold; and ſpilt much Chriſtian bloud, he wonne not a foot of ground in France for all his labour and charges. God grant we may rather give an honourable Peace, ſo it be with the continuance of his Truth and his Goſpell, then to accept of a Peace of no continuance with ſeeming ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>APelles</hi> the famous Athenian Painter was not more excellent in his Art then in wit and ingenuity; for to caſt the beholders of his works into a greater admiration, he uſed to place next to the Picture of his beautiful <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> when he did expoſe her to the view of the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the picture of an old deformed and wrinkle faced wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that by her ſwarty complection, grim favour, and ill ſhape, the excellent Symetry, lineaments, and rare fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his <hi>Venus</hi> might ſeeme the more wonderfull. Even ſo it will not be impertinent for me to ſet forth the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Contention, and the dangerous effects of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall fury, before I deſcribe the perfection of the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall beauty of Concord and Unity, that ſhe may bee more cheriſhed and admired, and the other more abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in theſe times of civill diviſions. Contention proceeds from ambition, pride, and envie; as we may daily ſee by experience, that contentious perſons are generally tainted with theſe vices, that come from fulneſſe of bread, eaſe, and a long and continued Peace. Now contentions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce diviſions, and diviſions breed factions, and factions an inteſtine warre; and all theſe an Antipathie of affections which never was greater in any Kingdome then it is in this at this preſent time; for the father is divided againſt his ſonne, and the ſonne againſt the father, and the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band againſt the wife, and the wife againſt her husband, one brother againſt his brother, and one ſervant againſt his fellow ſervant. So that there is not a City, Borough,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60250:21"/>
Towne, Village, Hamlet, Houſe or Family at this preſent in this Kingdome, but is infected with this contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe or venome of Contention. And this is not happened caſually nor accidentally, but by the ſpeciall Providence of God for our correction and humiliation, if we returne unto the Lord unfainedly; but for our utter deſtruction if we remaine and continue in our impenitencie and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart. But ſome may ſay, From whence doth proceed this Epidemicall diſeaſe, or this general diviſion? we that are but wormes cannot dive into the Counſels of God, yet we may by his permiſſion aime at the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary cauſes of theſe our Civill diviſions, and antipathie of affections, which I conceive to be theſe: The long peace that we have injoyed in the time of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> and for 16. yeares together under our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne King <hi>Charles</hi> his raigne, hath increaſed this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in wealth, and inured us to eaſe, idleneſſe, vanitie, and licentiouſneſſe; riches hath bred in ſome of us am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, pride, envie, and ſelf-conceitedneſſe, the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries of contentions and diviſions; And eaſe and idleneſſe have begotten in us laſcivious deſires, ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obſtinacie to doe and beleeve what ſeemeth good in our own eyes; and ſo by degrees we have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our Maker, and like ſtubborne horſes have kicked at, and rebelled againſt our gracious God; I meane, that we are growne deſperately ſinfull, and have deſpiſed his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, erected a will-worſhip, and gone a whoring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter new Innovations; And hereupon the ambition, pride, covetouſneſſe, and profaneneſſe of the Prelacie, ſeconded with the Loanes, Conduct, and Ship-money; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent approaches and inclinations to Popery, by the bowing, crouching, and kneeling at Altars &amp; Railes, have made us groane for a Reformation in Civill and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60250:22"/>
miſcarriages. The which to oppoſe the Prelacie and the Jeſuiticall faction under colour to increaſe his Majeſties Prerogative, have withdrawne his love and his perſon from his moſt faithfull Parliament, perſwaded him to forſake his Royall Seat, to goe to York, to raiſe an Army under colour of a Guard for his Perſon, to annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Priviledges of Parliament, the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties of the Subjects, and ſo formed the firſt partie in the North; whereupon the honourable Houſes were of neceſſity inforced to gather forces, not to oppoſe his ſacred Majeſtie, but thoſe that under his name, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour as much as they can to undoe the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And this is the originall ſecondary cauſe of our ſtate diviſions, from whence aroſe that unparalelled ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall diviſion and Antipathie of affections, afore ſpoken of; But theſe ſtate diviſions are not them that I purpoſe to ſpeak of, but only of thoſe that raign and are fomented in the Religious partie, and in all members of it of what degree ſoever; And this proceeds ſpecially from diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of opinions in matter of Religion, as I have ſaid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in another place; which is a greater ſigne that the wrath of God is greatly inflamed againſt us; for it is againſt the courſe of nature, againſt the Lawes of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and againſt the Principles of Religion: That thoſe that proteſt to fight for the true reformed Religion, The Priviledges of Parliament, The Lawes of the land, And the Libertie of the Subjects, ſhould endeavour, as much as it is poſſible for them, to ruinate all theſe things at a blow by their daily contentions, grounded many times upon punctilloes of vanity, which they term honour. But it is a vain and a carnall one, and not a reall or Spirituall; for the true and ſpirituall Honour is to be lowly and humble in our own eyes; for the more we are ſuch, the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60250:22"/>
more honourable we are before God and religious men. Moreover, every time we contend and hinder the Cauſe by our contentions, everytime we breake our vowes, and the ſolemne Covenant we have made lately before our God. But to reſtraine or appeaſe, if it be poſſible, theſe generall Contentions, I will prove by Inſtances what danger there is to foment them; firſt, between particulars and families. Secondly, between Common-weales; and laſtly, between Kingdomes and Empires. 1. The envie and contention that Satan fomented betweene <hi>Cain</hi> and <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 4. 8.</note>

The contentions fomented betweene the Houſe of Auſtria and the Houſes of Valois and <note n="k" place="margin">See <hi>Sleidan</hi> and the French Hiſt.</note> Bourbon, have been and are ſtill the cauſe of great effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtian bloud; and for no other cauſe, but for the Precedencie and an ambitious deſire of Superiority. 10. The ambitious contentions of the Houſes of <note n="l" place="margin">See <hi>Du Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in the French Hiſtory</note> Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and of Bourgundy were the cauſe of the murder of two Dukes, and of the death of many thouſand men. 11. The contentions fomented between the Houſes of <note n="m" place="margin">See <hi>Stowes</hi> and <hi>Speeds</hi> Chron.</note> Lancaſter and York were the cauſe of the death of the greater part of the Engliſh Nobility, and of the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Counties of this Kingdome. 12.

But becauſe the emulations, contentions, and the Antipathy of affections betweene Commanders in Chiefe, are very dangerous, I will ſhew here by inſtances, that other Nations have to their coſt, as well as we, found that it is perillous and deſtructive to a ſtate, to employ two Commanders in Chiefe in one and the ſame deſigne or Service, if there be an Antipathy of affections between them, 1. The emulation and contention that was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60250:23"/>
between <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Tit. Liv. dec. 1. lib. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> and <hi>Lucius Volumnius,</hi> Generals of the Romanes, had like to have overthrowne their Common-weale, if it had not been ſuddenly preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Senate. 2. The emulation and contention that grew between <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> Generall, and <note n="p" place="margin">Plutarch <hi>in</hi> Fabius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus <hi>his life.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the Maſter of his Horſe had beene fatall to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, if <hi>Fabius</hi> for the good and love of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey had not with admirable humility and meekneſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the affronts of <hi>Munitius,</hi> and relieved him in his eminent danger rather then let him periſh to vindicate himſelfe. 3. The emulation and contention that was fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced by ſome factious men betweene the two French Generals ſent into Italy by <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, the Lord <note n="q" place="margin">See <hi>Des Serres</hi> Inventary in the year 1500.</note> 
                  <hi>Aubigni</hi> and the Lord <hi>Trivulce,</hi> had been the cauſe of the loſſe of all Lombardia; for what the one built with one hand, the other flung downe with another; If that wiſe King hearing of it had not preſently ſent them as far diſtant one from another as Picardy is diſtant from Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardia. The Antipathie of affections, and the contentions that had been fomented formerly between the <note n="r" place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of France in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.</note> Admirall <hi>de Villars,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Boullion,</hi> when he firſt ſided with the League and the other with the Royaliſts; But being at that time all reconciled and united under the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth King of France; They were with equall Authority and Power ſent by the King to beſiege Douclance, and to over-runne and waſte the Countie of Artois the Spaniards dominion, but meeting a ſtrong Army of the enemies, they came to a fight, wherein the Admirall furiouſly and valiantly ingaged himſelf ſo deep with a Regiment of horſe in the midſt of the Battalia of the enemies, hoping it ſeemes to be as well ſeconded by the Duke, that he was ſlaine and the greater part of this Regiment. His death and want of reliefe being imputed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60250:24"/>
to proceed from the ſparkes of the fire of the former divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of affections, that were not utterly quenched in the breſt of the Duke. And ſo for a private vindication a great part of the French Army was routed, and the ſiege of Dourlance retarded. Many other Inſtances might be produced to prove how dangerous it is for a State to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Commanders in Chiefe in one Service, that have had formerly, or may yet have ſecretly, ſome Antipathie of affections; ſo much predominant are the paſſions of men over their naturall reaſon, except they be curbed and reſtrained by a great meaſure of ſupernaturall Grace. Now having ſufficiently deſcribed ſome part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and of the dangerous effects of this fury of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and diviſion. I come to ſhew the ſweet Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and the excellent fruits of Unity and Concord. The whole frame of nature without Concord and Unity would ſuddenly be changed into a <hi>Chaos</hi> of confuſion, if the powerfull hand of the Almighty did permit contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to raigne between any of the elements; for we ſee what ſtrange combuſtions happen in the aire for a ſmall diſtemper that befals ſometimes between the Meteors. Concord and Unity is the humane ſaviour and preſerver of Kingdomes and Common-weales; <hi>A</hi>

And how much leſſe ſhall a weaker party ſubſiſt, if it be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by contentions and Antipathies of affections, as ours is. It was an ingenious Metaphor uſed by a Scythian <note n="t" place="margin">See <hi>Herodolus</hi> his Hiſtory.</note> King, to induce his ſonnes to Unity, To command a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his to bring before him a bundle of Arrowes knit together, and to charge his ſonnes one after another to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to breake the ſame, but they were not able, whereupon he bad them to take them one by one, and they brake them all eaſily. Even ſo ſaid he to them, If
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60250:24"/>
you remaine conſtantly united one with another, it will be impoſſible for the neighbour Nations to ſubdue or overcome you; but if you let diviſions and contentions be fomented among you, you will become the prey of your meaneſt enemies. And for the greater confirmation of the point, I will endeavour to prove it by Inſtances both ancient and moderne. 1. As long as the Ancient Greeks continued in unitie one with another, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for <note n="u" place="margin">See <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> his life.</note> 
                  <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt King of Macedonia to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them into ſervitude, But as ſoon as they by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe of ſome of their Oratours were divided into factions, it was an eaſie thing for him and <hi>Alexander</hi> the great his ſonne to deprive them of their liberty. 2. As long as the Romane Senatours were linked in unity one with another, the Romane liberty was preſerved, and their Common-weale flouriſhed and commanded the greater part of the world; but as ſoon as they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into factions, ſome for <note n="x" place="margin">See <hi>Pompey</hi> his life.</note> 
                  <hi>Pompeius,</hi> other for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> other for <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and other for <hi>Lepidus; Caeſar</hi> in a ſhort time deprived them of their liberty. 3. As long as the ancient <note n="y" place="margin">See <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commentaries</note> Gaules and Britanes were united together, they flouriſhed and ſacked the Citie of Rome; But when they were divided into factions by the Romane agents, they were in a ſhort time ſubdued by the Romanes. 4.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60250:25"/>
Conde and <hi>Monſieur Dandelot</hi> and others; yet with his humility and meekneſſe he did quench all contentions that did ariſe from this Antipathy of diſpoſitions; and kept alwayes their will and affections conſtantly united to the Generall Cauſe. 4. The unity and concord that was between <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> &amp; <hi>P.</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Titus Livius, dec. 1. lib. 10.</note>

The unity of <note n="c" place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in their lives.</note> 
                  <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles</hi> and <hi>Aristides</hi> (that were otherwiſe mortall enemies in their private affaires) was extremely profitable to all the Greeks in the Councell of warre, that was called by <hi>Euripidias</hi> their Generall before the battell of <hi>Salamine,</hi> for their unity in opinion was the cauſe to obtaine that famous victory, and of the preſervation of all the Greeks. 6. As long as the Duke of <note n="d" place="margin">See <hi>Stowes</hi> Chron.</note> Sommerſet and the Lord Admirall his brother, in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth King of <hi>England,</hi> were united and linked in love and affections one with the other, they preſerved their credit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours at Court againſt all their oppoſites; But as ſoon as they came to be diſunited, and that by the inſtigations of their Ladies, private diſcontents and contentions were fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, the Lord Admirall was preſently arraigned, by the connivance and the want of the aſſiſtance and ſupport <note place="margin">See <hi>Speeds</hi> Chron.</note> of the Lord Protector his brother, and he himſelfe ſhortly after by the potency of his adverſaries brought to the ſame miſerable end. To conclude this point, all the well affected Chriſtians are obliged to pray daily to our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, that he will be pleaſed to indue abundantly the honourable Houſes, our Commanders in Chiefe, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines, the Civill Magiſtrates, the <hi>Militia,</hi> the Committees in the City and in all the well-affected

               <p>OF all the Judgements of God that are familiar to men, the Peſtilence, the Famine, and the Sword are reputed to be the greateſt; And of theſe three, Warre is eſteemed the moſt dreadfull; And of all Warres, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is conceived to be the moſt deſtructive. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no wonder, (when the Lord ſent his Prophet Gad, to King <hi>David,</hi> ſaying, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Chron. 21. 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Chooſe thee Either three yeeres famine, or three monthes to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before thy foes (while that the ſword of thine enemies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh thee) or elſe three dayes the ſword of the Lord, even the Peſtilence,</hi> &amp;c.) if that good King did rather chuſe to fall into the hand of the Lord (for very great are his mercies) then into the hands of cruell men. Neither doe we finde in any ancient or moderne Hiſtories, that any Nation or Kingdome hath been utterly deſtroyed by the Peſtilence, or the famine; for theſe two Judgements proceed more immediately from the hand of God that is mercifull, and leave alwayes a remnant, as an evidence to men of his incomprehenſible compaſſions and mercies. But Warre ſeemes more to proceed from men (yet there is not any warre that hath any beginning, continuance or end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60250:26"/>
the ſpeciall will and pleaſure of God) that are of a more cruell diſpoſition then Tygers, when the Lord hath caſt the bridell of permiſſion over their neckes. And therefore it is by warre that ſo many Nations, Kingdomes and Common-weales have been utterly deſtroyed and conſumed, and above all by an inteſtine and Civill warre; for a Nation being weakned by her own hands, it breeds an opportunity for forraigne Princes to fall upon it, and ſubvert and conquer the ſame. But forraigne warres are often profitable to Kingdomes or Common-weales, ſo they be managed without the limits of thoſe Kingdomes or Common-weales; Carthage flouriſhed as long as <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Hannibal</hi> in his life.</note> 
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> waſted Italy. But when <hi>Scipio</hi> came with a great Army to their gates, miſery and deſtruction iſſued upon it; <note n="c" place="margin">See the Chronicle of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>England</hi> flouriſhed when war was maintained in France, but when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were driven home, it was waſted and deſolated by Civill commotions, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine warre; And therefore it is a ſound and a ſure Maxime or Reaſon of State to entertaine warre abroad, that a Kingdome may be freed from it at home; And this Maxime was carefully obſerved by the Romanes for a long time, but as ſoon as they neglected the ſame, they fell into civill contentions and into inteſtine warres. As long as the French Nation entertained warres in Italy to recover the right they had in the Kingdome of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and in the Duchy of Milan, France did proſper and flouriſh; but as ſoon as that fatall Peace was concluded between <note n="d" place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of France.</note> 
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond King of France, and <hi>Philip</hi> King of Spaine by the procurement of the Conſtable of France (that aimed more at his own ends, then to advance the honour of his King and the good of his native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.) And that Savoy, Piedmont, and the reſt of the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that the French held in Italy were made over to the

                  <hi>Elizabeth</hi> undertake the protection of the Low Countries, that the Engliſh Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity might have employment abroad, and exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Military exploits, that ſhe might have alwayes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60250:27"/>
ready ſome experienced Commanders and Officers of Capacity to leade an Army, if her enemies attempted any invaſion upon her dominions; and this her wiſe and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick courſe ſucceeded moſt happily, for ſhe maintained thereby her Kingdome in peace and in a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſuppreſſed the rebellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> aided the French with her Treaſures, and with experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Officers, and Souldiers, curbed the inſolencie of the Spaniard by Sea, and made the naturall colour of that element to be often changed into Crimſon, by the undaunted valour and the great experience of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Officers, and Mariners in Sea-fights: And by her warlike expeditions to Cales and the Weſt India in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed her Ships and Navies, and all manner of Trade and commerce, and left at her death <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in a proſperous peace and condition. By theſe Inſtances and many more that might be produced to the ſame end, it is apparent that forraigne warres are often times profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in theſe foure caſes, ſo they be managed out of the limits of a Kingdome or Common-weale. 1. It purgeth them of licentious men. 2. It frees them of Civill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and inteſtine warres. 3. It is a Nurcery for Commanders and experienced Officers. 4. It increaſeth commerce and trading, and doth rather inrich a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then waſte the ſame. 1. The Romanes never inro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any ſouldiers for their forraign warres out of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants or Citizens before all the licentious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious men that are apt to breed Civill commotions had been <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius <hi>in his</hi> Decades.</note> inroled; and when they had ſubdued a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or Province, they erected Colonies in it, where they ſent all the moſt licentious men of their City, and their old ſouldiers, to whom they appointed ſo much land as they might live with all. 2. It frees a Kingdome
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60250:27"/>
from Civill commotions; for if licentious and needy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple find but ſome diſcontented Nobles to ſide withall, they will preſently foment a party, and kindle the fire of a Civill warre; but as the only way to quench a fire is to take from it the combuſtible matter that increaſeth the ſame; even ſo to prevent Civill diſtractions, we are to purge the City and Kingdome of licentious and decaied men, and to ſend them away into forraigne warres. 3. Few or none are ignorant that the Germane and the Low Countrie warres have beene the Nurcery of the greater part of the experienced Engliſh, French, and Scotch Commanders and Officers that are now in theſe dayes: It is true that of theſe three Nations, the number of the Engliſh is the ſmalleſt, becauſe that in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Raigne of King <hi>James</hi> Commanders and Officers of experience in warre were not regarded, yet thoſe that out of a naturall inclination to Armes, went thither to be trained up, are not inferiour to any, but the number of them is ſo ſmall, that they are now conſtrained to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy licentious Germanes for principall officers; but <hi>Germany, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> it ſelfe is beholden to the Scots for Commanders and Officers of warre; And for the French the Maxime of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth afore related hath much increaſed the Capacity of the French Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of their foot ſouldiers in martiall exploits, ſo that for ſeiges, or battels, they are not inferiour to any. And therefore forraigne warres are the Nurcery of experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Commanders and Officers of warre. 4. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Trade and Commerce, the forraigne warre that the French and the Hollanders have maintained theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares againſt the Houſe of Auſtria hath much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their trade and commerce, and are now growne more opulent in wealth then all other Nations in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60250:28"/>
This may ſeeme a paradox to ſome, yet it is moſt certain, for although the French are extraordinarily burdened with taxes, yet becauſe the Countrie men are freed from plundering and pillaging, and their cattell and corne ſecured, and trades men ſet at worke, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of all manner of Commodities in requeſt, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the great Armies they entertaine upon the enemies frontiers, the money of their contributions remaineth in the Kingdome; &amp; as it goes out of one hand for taxes and contributions, ſo it comes in on the other for the great ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance they have of all their Commodities. But alas it is cleane contrary in this Civill and Unnaturall Warre of ours; for the trading and commerce is utterly decaid in the City, and in all the Boroughs and Market Townes of the Kingdome, moſt of the Countrey people are plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their moneys, goods and cattell, the Gentlemen have their grounds caſt up upon their hands, although they pay all charges, and abate halfe their rent, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe to be had; and the Sequeſtrations of the one ſide or the other bring them to penury, and diſable them be they never ſo willing to contribute any longer to this warre; by which meanes this Kingdome is likely to fall into an incurable conſumption, becauſe of three pernicious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (beſides the miſeries above-ſaid) that pertaine to her alone, and not to other Civill warres. 1.

Or like unto a fire kindled in a houſe ſeated in one of the corners of a long ſtreet, the flames of which fire being driven by a violent wind along that row of houſes, doth at laſt conſume the whole ſtreet, for want of pulling down ſpeedily three or foure houſes, next to that houſe that was firſt of all ſet on fire, to ſtop the flames of it to proceed any further. Even ſo the flames of the fire of this unnaturall warre that brake forth in the North, was driven by the violent winds of jealouſie and diſcontent into the North Weſt, and then to the South Weſt, and at laſt to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part of the Weſt; and ſo by degrees hath conſumed already three parts of the Kingdome, and left in the other part but a ſmall degree of vitall ſpirits, for want of pulling down three or foure houſes to ſtop the flame of it from going any further. I meane, for want of ſuch Counſell as was given to <note n="g" place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of France</note> 
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh King of France by his wiſe Counſellours, that he ſhould give over (to quench the fire of the Civill contentions fomented between the Houſes of Orleance and Burgundy, that had almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his Kingdome) into the hands of Juſtice, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of Burgundy, ſome of his Favourites that had their hands in the murder of his father; to which Counſell he condeſcended unto, although this murder had been committed with his aſſent, whereby ſuch a firme reconciliation was procured between theſe two Houſes, that it fell out to be the ſecondary Cauſe of the reſtoring of that deſolated Kingdome into its former flouriſhing Eſtate. Or for want (after the Noble Ambaſſage, and the humble Petitions of the Honourable Houſes had been rejected) to have ſent ſpeedily a thouſand horſe in the North, untill a ſtrong Army had been ſent to ſtop the flames of this fire to goe beyond the River of Trent.

ſent to <hi>Woster,</hi> the fire of this Unnaturall Warre hath ſpread it ſelfe, as it is to be ſeen at this preſent day, and is like to ſpread further and to conſume the reſt, if God in his Mercy prevent it not; and induce the Honourable Houſes to change the Method of this lingring and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Warre.</p>
               <p n="2">II. For the unparallelled infidelity of ſome of the Agents of one of the partiés, all the Civill warres of the ancient Greeks and Romanes, or of the moderne inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine warres of the French and the Germane Nation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce ſo much infidelity and apoſtacy as may be collected out of theſe three yeares warre. For where they ſided at the firſt, they remained conſtant to the laſt in that party, and never deſerted the ſame, untill an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was procured. Nay, divers of them have ſealed their conſtancie with their <note n="h" place="margin">See <hi>Caeſars</hi> Comment. in the warre of Affrica.</note> death, rather then to accept of their liberty upon condition to ſerve againſt their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But divers of ours that make ſhow to fight for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more then for pay, betray the truſt repoſed in them, and doe us more miſchiefe then any of the contrary party. And it is no wonder, for Chriſtian Runagadoes are more cruell to Chriſtians then the naturall Turks; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Apoſtates, are greater enemies to the godly then the profeſſed Papiſts; and the hypocriticall Saints, are more violent againſt the true Power of Godlineſſe, then the Prince of darkneſſe. The cauſe of this infidelity may proceed 1. From the toleration of divers religions; for men that are not well grounded in the true Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are never cautious of their wayes, and will betray their own fathers for money. 2. From the great Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Honourable Houſes, for if the perfidious <hi>Synons</hi> of the North had been ſeverely puniſhed, ſo many <hi>Iudaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> would not have been found in the Weſt to procure
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60250:29"/>
that blow, that we have received there lately. Clemencie is an Heroicall vertue, but infidelitie is incapable of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo pernicious a ſeed, that except it be pulled up by the root, it will over-grow the garden of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale. 3. From the partiall election of our poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Military Officers, that are for the greater part preferred by favour, and not for their ſincerity in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or for their integrity and wiſdome in politick or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill affaires; nor for their valour or experience in Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exploits; but for feare to diſpleaſe or to pleaſe ſome in Authoritie; and that is the reaſon why we have ſo many weake Committees in the City and in our Counties; and ſo many unexpert Commanders and Officers in our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that dare not look the enemies in the face; nor know not how to leade a Troope of horſe to a charge; nor ſet a Company of foot in a poſture of defence; And theſe are they that out of timiditie, inconſtancie, and for want of experience in warlike affaires, ſpinne out this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Warre, by ſurrendring of places of great concerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that will prove deare favours unto us. The remedy of this is, to puniſh ſeverely the <hi>Synons</hi> of theſe dayes, and to imitate in our elections the method and wiſedome of <note n="k" place="margin">See <hi>Du Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of France</note> 
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth King of France; for it is recorded that he never elected any of his Chiefe Commanders or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of warre, or any of his Counſellours of State, Judges or Magiſtrates, to favour any of his favourites, or at the ſute of any of his Peeres; but for their own merits, made known to him, by their former actions in Military, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Civill employments; And by this Method and unpartiality in his elections, there never was King more ſucceſſefull in his Military enterpriſes; nor more happy in his Politick Reſolutions; nor more beloved of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, becauſe Juſtice was unpartially adminiſtred in his dayes.</p>

III. For the unknowne Method of this warre, it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Method of the ancient Greeks and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, and from the moderne Method of the moſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Nations of theſe dayes, In theſe particulars, 1. In the true ſeaſon of warre. 2. In our Scouts. 3. In our marches. 4. In our preparations. 5. In our Diſcipline. 6. In our rules of warre. 7. In the ſtratagems of war. 8.

                  <p>There hath been from time to time one ſeaſon more fit and convenient for warre then another, as it may appeare 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 1. <note n="l" place="margin">1 Chro. 20. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>At the time that Kings go out to battell, Ioab led forth the power of the Army, and wasted the countrey of the children of Ammon, and beſieged Rabbah,</hi> &amp;c. But becauſe the ſeaſons doe differ according to the climate of the ſeat of every Countrie or Nation, I will ground this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the Climate of thoſe that come neareſt to ours. In <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.</note> Affrica the latter end of February was the ordinary ſeaſon for Armies to take the field. In Italy in the midſt of March, and in France in the beginning of April; ſo that our moſt convenient ſeaſon ſhould be to take the field at the furtheſt in the midſt of April; and to withdraw our armies into their garriſons at Holland Tide, or at the latter end of October. But if we made uſe of Tents (as we ſhould indeed for the greater expedition of this warre) then we might conveniently keepe the field, untill the latter end of November. But as the watermen that row againſt tide make leſſe ſpeed, and have far more labour to goe to their Journies end, then thoſe that take the opportunity of the Tyde: Even ſo to ſpinne out this Warre, and to increaſe the labours of it, and to waſte our men and money, we ordinarily imploy the greater part of the Winter time in actions of warre, and ſuffer the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60250:30"/>
to paſſe away in recruiting our Armies, or in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of warre, whereas Winter is the moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time to raiſe and inrole Forces, and Reſerves, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit thoſe Forces; and to get ready all manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and neceſſary implements for warre; And this is a great cauſe of the ſpinning out of the publike miſeries.</p>

                  <p>One of the greateſt Secondary cauſes of the ſpinning out of this warre is our want of faithfull and diligent Scouts; The City of London ſhould never be without ſixteen young, active, and faithfull Scouts, that it might have every other day true intelligence from all the parts of the Kingdome, and every day from our Armies; for it would be the beſt ſpent mony of any, and that would ſoon come in again twenty for one; beſides, it would prevent many falſe rumours, that are daily ſpread in the City, greatly prejudiciall to the City and State. Moreover, for want of faithfull Scouts, the City may very well be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed or taken unprovided of many neceſſaries for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive poſture, as many other have been for want of them; and divers others preſerved by the ſpeedy activity of their Scouts, as I might prove by inſtances, if I did not feare to make this Treatiſe greater then I purpoſe to doe. And for our Armies, faithfull and active Scouts would be the only preſervation of them, and the way to prevent for the time to come the ſlips of ſuch Military opportunities that they have loſt heretofore; but theſe Scouts are to be experienced ſouldiers, and very ſwift horſemen, and not ſillie countrey men, or unexpert ſouldiers, but ſuch as are acquainted with all the ſtratagems of warre; and that have the capacity to judge by the march of the enemies their project or intentions. <note n="m" place="margin">

But ſome will ſay, you perſwade us to incredible and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60250:32"/>
unneceſſarie charges, for the greater part of theſe things we can procure in thoſe Counties thorow which our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies doe march, or intend to lay ſiege againſt any of the enemies Garriſons: I anſwer, it is a great improvidence for an Army to be without the neceſſaries that belong to it; and we know by experience that before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie can be ſummoned to bring in Ladders, Barowes, Pick-axes, Shovels and Spades, (for that only can be found in the Country) that an Army may be intrenched about a Garriſon Towne; and ſuppoſe they bring them in ſooner, yet are they ſo worn, broken, and out of repaire, that they are of no ſervice but to ſpinne out time; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when one of our Armies was laſt yeare to ſtorme or to ſcale Baſing Houſe, that they were conſtrained to ſend to London to have them made, and ſo loſt a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night of faire weather, and then when the Ladders came, the weather being rainy and cold, they were inforced to raiſe the ſiege for want of Tents; Now had they had all theſe implements with them, they had come off with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and taken that houſe; and not left the worke to be done this yeare, or for the next, as they carry themſelves before it: The very charges then, that hath been caſt away about that houſe, would have paid for ten times as many implements as are here ſpecified; beſides, the loſſe of the time which is worth as much more, and the blemiſh of the reputation of the undertakers, which is more then all the reſt. I conclude then, that an Army is not to advance without all theſe implements, to croſſe Rivers, to beſiege Townes, to intrench it ſelfe, to make mines, to erect plat-formes, gabions, and to ſtorme, or aſſault ſtrong-holds, without looſing halfe a dayes time by ſtaying for materials, to hinder their proſecution in any warlike attempt.</p>

For an Officer this Summer againſt the ſpeciall order of his Commander forſook his Station, and by it indangered the whole Army, and was the cauſe of the loſſe of many valiant men.

there befoure or five ſmall Redoubts to flanke the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: if it be ſuch another Towne as Newarke, an Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone forme will ſerve, ſo there be two bridges erected over the river and two ſmall redoubts erected to ſecure them, that the one ſide may be preſently relieved by the other, if it be a great City the Dyadecagone forme is to be uſed, and the trenches are to be lined within piſtoll-ſhot from the wals or rampiars; for the neerer the ſafer: And for the approches that are of al things the moſt dangerous, they are to be directed by the Engineers; by whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and ſome Mantelets to preſerve the Pioners from the enemies musket ſhot, there will be no great loſſe, ſo there be Brigades appointed to ſtand ready to hinder the Sallies out of the enemies. Two good Engineers in a ſiege may doe more ſervice to the ſtate then a thouſand men, by their counſell and directions. And for want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced ones, we are daily foiled; there can be no money better imployed, nor that will be more beneficiall to the State, then by a good round pay to procure the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and experienced Engineers that can be obtained.</p>

                     <head>2. Of a fortified Camp.</head>
                     <p>There is no erecting of fortified Camps, without Tents; and that is the reaſon why I preſſe the <hi>Militia</hi> to have a thouſand or twelve hundred alwayes ready of that ſize ſpoken of, for to expedite ſieges, that will be long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious without them, and will conſume a number of men by diſeaſes; but having Tents, a fortified Camp is to be erected upon a raiſing ground without Cannon ſhot of the Towne, if it be no bigger then Newark, one fortified Camp will ſerve, ſo it be ſeated in the midway of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Trenches between the two Bridges, that reliefe may be ſent to all the trenches ſpeedily; but if it be a great City that hath a river running in the midſt of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60250:34"/>
it, then there is to be two fortified Camps, on either ſide at a juſt diſtance on both ſides of the river; I meane, that there may be no more diſtance on the right hand to the river ſide, then on the left, and from each of the two Camps there are lines of Communication to be made to relieve without danger the trenches or the two Brides, that are erected on both ſides the City. I will therefore ſet out the proportion of a fortified Camp, to containe twelve hundred Tents of that ſize aboveſaid, that will harbour foure thouſand horſe and eight thouſand foot with conveniencie; if the Army be greater, it is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, if ſmaller, it is to be diminiſhed proportionably. The forme of this Camp is to be ſquare and of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards on each ſide of the ſquare, that makes foure and twenty hundred yards of continent, and is to have foure bulwarks at the foure Corners, to ſet two pieces of Ordnance in each bulwarke, for to flanke the Dikes of it; that are to be of ſix yards broad and foure yards deep, the rampier to be of ſix yards thick in the bottome; and of foure yards thick at top; and three yards high beſides the Parapet, that is to be foure foot high and two yards thick. This Camp is to have foure broad gates, one in the midſt of each ſide of the ſquare, and a ſquare market place of two hundred yards one each ſide of the ſquare, that make eight hundred yards of continent juſt in the midſt of the Camp; then it is to have foure broad ſtreets, that are to be drawne upon a ſtrait line from every gate to the market place of twelve yards broad, in manner of a perfect croſſe, and foure great ſtreetes more, drawne out from one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Camp to the other; and every one diſtant from the rampiar ten yards, that the ſouldiers may without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment come from all parts to defend the rampier. Now the foure angles that remaine are to containe the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60250:35"/>
Tents that are to be ſet up back to back, and on both ſides a ſtreet of eight yards broad to come in to the Tents, the ends of which are to be cloſe together, that there may be no paſſage between them, The two Angles toward the South are to be reſerved for the lodging of men; and the other toward the North for the horſe; The Generals Tent and other Chiefe Officers Tents are to be ſet up in the foure corners of the ſtreetes next to the market place; that all the officers may the more ſpeedily repaire to him, and the Courts of guard are to be placed in the eight Tents that make the eight corners of the foure Croſſe ſtreetes next to the gates. A Camp thus fortified and ſo ordered having lines of Communication to the trenches of the circumference that begirt the Towne or City, will be able to make good a ſiege againſt an Army that ſhould come to raiſe the ſame of forty thouſand men, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did in <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commentaries in the Wars of Affrica.</note> Affrica before Adrumet, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth did before <note n="x" place="margin">See the ſiege of Amiens in Hiſtory of France.</note> Amiens againſt the Archduke <hi>Mathias,</hi> and the laſt King of <hi>Sweden</hi> before <note n="y" place="margin">See the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Souldier.</note> Norenberg againſt the Duke of Walſtaine. This fortified Camp may be finiſhed by ſix thouſand foot ſouldiers in eight dayes, if the Army be provided, as it is aboveſaid, ſo the ſouldiers have but four pence a day paid them every night above their pay, as a gratuity to encourage them in this work; and a Towne ſo beſieged will be ſooner reduced in a moneths time, then it will be in three moneths, if the Army quarter in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent villages, and with more eaſe and leſſe danger of the enemies, or of any diſeaſes to infect the Army, for in ſuch a Camp with Tents and Straw they lie as warme and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer then in a City; and for proviſions the two hundred Waggons, and the twelve Commiſſaries of Victuals above ſpoken of will furniſh the ſame plentifully, ſo the horſe-men be appointed to cauſe the adjacent Townes

                     <p>The deſigne of the ſcaling of a hold, or Garriſon Towne is to be kept very private, and then it may be done as well by the Garriſon of a contrary partie ten or twelve miles diſtant as by a ſiege; ſo they march all night and keep all goers and commers in their Garriſon the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The fitteſt time to ſcale a Towne is one or two houres before day, for then the ſouldiers of a Garriſon are moſt of all overcome with ſleep, and the Ladders are to be ſet up all at an Inſtant; the number are to be two hundred at leaſt, placed ſome ſix yards aſunder, that if one Ladder ſhould be caſt downe, it may not cauſe ſeven or eight to fall after it, and alſo for the greater diverſion of the enemies, that ſhall not be able to oppoſe in ſo many places, the ſouldiers are to be very active and ſpeedy, and the foremoſt are to have Rondaches in the one hand, and ſwords in the other, and the next Musqueteers, and the laſt Pikemen, as ſoon as an hundred are upon the Rampier they are to fall upon the Court of guard that is neere to the next gate, that they may breake it open; ſome do alſo carry with them a couple of Petars that are to be made faſt to the gates to blow them open, while the other ſcale the Towne. This way of taking a Caſtle or Garriſon Towne ſhould be uſed in theſe dayes for expedition more then it is, becauſe of the ſmall charge, and the little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there is in it; for all our Garriſon Townes, Houſes, or Caſtles have no Caſamates that flank the Courtines even with the foot of the Rampiers or wals; the which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamates were the preſervation of Geneva when it was ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for the Ordnance in them broke and caſt downe all the Ladders, and therefore the ſcalers here are out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Ordnance.</p>

                     <p>We keep as little order in our Mines as in all other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; Mines are the cheapeſt way after the ſcaling, to take a hold or a Garriſon Towne, only they cannot be done ſafely before the hold or the Garriſon Town be begirt with trenches, for the Mines are to have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in them; and although foure Mines are ſufficient to take a great garriſon Towne; yet I conceive it to be a ſafe Policy to begin eight Mines againſt a reaſonable gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon Towne, and twelve againſt a greater. To delude the enemies, that if ſome of them be found out and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſome may be left to ſerve to performe the deſigne; the mouth of every one of them is to begin in the trench that begirts the hold or Towne, at equall diſtances, that they may goe round about the Towne, and they are to be made upon a ſtrait line, untill the Mine be brought under the midſt of the wall or Rampier, and when it is ſo, then every Mine is to be made as it was begun, ten yards on the right and ten yards on the left hand, like a perfect T. The Mine is not to be in no place above two yards broad and ſix foot high, and at every yard it is to be propt with two rowes of the deale poles ſpoken of, that are to be ſawed in two, and the deale boards are to ſerve for baſes below and above, for without boards under and above the props, they will ſinke into the ground, and it will cauſe the earth of the Mine to cave and overthrow the worke; the Mines or foure of them being ready, the very morning that the Commanders intend to ſtorme, there are foure, ſix, or eight barrels of Powder to be carried into each Mine, (for if they were carried the day before, they might be taken away before the next morning by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,) according as they are fitted with powder; or in caſe of neceſſity foure will ſerve, but the more there is, the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60250:36"/>
greater and the more levell will the breach be when the Mines are ſprung; when theſe barrels of Powder are ſet in the Mines at an equall diſtance one from another, if there be foure barrels, at foure foot diſtance, if there be ſix, at three foot diſtance; then are the Cannoneers to ſet a traine of Powder between every barrell, and a traine to come from the croſſe of the T. down to the foot of the trench; but the Mines are to be ſtopped at the croſſe of the. T. with rammed clay, only a hole of foure Inches ſquare is to be left being ſupported with ſtones or brickes for the traine of Powder to paſſe cleare from the very trench to all the parts of the Mines, and when the Commanders have ſet their reſerves in order; as it is deſcribed in the next Chapter but one; then is the fire to be ſet to the Traine; that as ſoone as the powder of the Mines hath done her operation, the reſerves may ſuddenly enter the breaches.</p>

And theſe ſix Canons being charged and pointed they are to be fired all at one Inſtance, for ſuch a thundring clap will molter more earth or ſhake a ſtone wall more then forty Canon ſhot will doe, if they be ſhot by intermiſſion of time; beſides, the defendants cannot repaire a breach that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60250:37"/>
is made after ſo violent a blow, as they may when it is made by intermiſſion of time. Now before the platformes for the battery be erected, the moſt experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Officers and Engineers are to view the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers or wals of the Towne, for to take notice of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt places of it, and of the moſt convenient places about the towne to raiſe the platforme, for if there be neare the towne any riſing ground, it will ſave a great deale of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and charges if they erect their battery there, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the platforme is not to be erected at the moſt above a musket ſhot from the rampier or wall; for if it be but halfe a musket ſhot it is the more powerfull, and theſe platformes are to be defended with ſtrong gabions of earth, to prevent that the enemies Canon doe not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount ſome of the ſix Canons upon it, and alſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Canoneers lives that would otherwiſe be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Canon ſhot of the enemies. If it be a City or a great garriſon Towne, then it requires two platformes and two batteries with ſix Canons apiece, the one on the one ſide of the towne, and the other on the other ſide; and both theſe platformes and batteries are to be made, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to play at the breake of the day that ſhall be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſtorme; and ſo they are to continue without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion untill they have made two breaches of twenty yards broad apiece; and the dikes to be levelled with the rubbiſh even with the firme ground; Now if theſe brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cannot be done in one day, then are the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to give order that ſome Companies of Muſquetteers be appointed to ſtand on the two flanks of the breaches all night, one company after another, to fire their Muſquets at randome into the breaches, to hinder the defendants to repaire the breaches, or from retrenching of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within it; And then the next morning to ſtorme
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60250:37"/>
againe without intermiſſion untill the breach be ſufficient and the dike levelled as afore-ſaid. And in the meane time the Commanders may ſet in order their reſerves to come to a generall Aſſault after this manner following.</p>

                     <p>There is an erroneous opinion crept in the minde of ſome men that ſay we are not to take Townes or Caſtles by ſtorming &amp; aſſaults, to avoid the ſhedding of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an bloud, but we ought rather to take them by famine. But theſe men are either ignorant of the events of warre; or deſire this unnaturall warre ſhould be ſpinned out, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Kingdome were utterly conſumed. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that long ſieges conſume more men by diſeaſes ten for one, then are ſlaine by ſtorming or aſſaults, as it ſhall be proved by Inſtances. 1. <note n="2" place="margin">Titus Livius, Decad. 1. lib. 5.</note> Vigentia a great City in Italy was beſieged ten yeares by the Romans, (and at that ſiege was the uſe of Tents firſt of all invented, becauſe of the number of Souldiers that periſhed by diſeaſes, that did proceed from the wet and cold they endured in Winter time) and <hi>Furius Camilius</hi> took the ſame in a moneth by a Mine and a generall aſſault. 2. The ſiege of <note n="a" place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of France</note> 
                        <hi>Marſeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> under <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, and the ſiege of Meſts under <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond Kings of France, conſumed above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand men by diſeaſes; becauſe the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth ſtrove to take them by famine. 3. The Proteſtants in the ſecond Civill warre of France beſieged the City of <note n="b" place="margin">See the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Warres of France.</note> Poitiers with an Army of thirty thouſand men, and becauſe they did not ſtorme it at their firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, they loſt above ſix thouſand men by diſeaſes, and were inforced to raiſe the ſiege. 4. The <note n="c" place="margin">See <hi>Des Serres</hi> in his Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</note> Earle of Foix Generall for the French in the Kingdome of Naples, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beſieged the City of Naples, loſt his owne life and the greater part of his Army before it by the Peſtilence,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60250:38"/>
becauſe he fell not a ſtorming of it at his firſt coming. In a word, long ſieges conſume more men, treaſure and time then townes that are taken by aſſault; There are ſo many accidents that happen by the long time that a Towne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires for to be taken by famine, that the events of it are very ſeldome ſucceſſefull or happy, and there is no towne or Caſtle but may be taken by ſtorming, as it may be proved by inſtances. 1. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth took <note n="d" place="margin">See <hi>Pierre Matthew</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourths life.</note> Mout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meillan Caſtle in eight dayes that had required two yeares ſiege; for it ſtood upon a ſteep Rock, judged of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his Commanders impregnable, and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of Ammunition and proviſions; But he having viewed thes at of it himſelfe, ſaw there was another ſteep rock, within Canon ſhot of it; whereupon he gave a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Switzers a Largeſſe, to draw up upon that rock ſix Canons with the ſtrength of their armes; and theſe being pointed and ſtorming the ſame furiouſly, the defendants yeelded upon compoſition; If the like was done to Scarborow Caſtle, it would be taken in three dayes; for it is nothing to the fore-named in ſeat and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, and it hath alſo a hill that commands the ſame; and likewiſe Beaver Caſtle, that is alſo commanded by a hill. 2. The Towne of Gravilling, one of the ſtrongeſt Garriſons in Flanders that had required two yeares ſiege to take it by famine, becauſe it had three double dikes of forty foot broad and twenty foot deep, and all flanked with baſtions made with Caſamates, and no probabilitie to come to an aſſault without Galleries; yet the French did ſo terrifie the defendants by their furious batteries and aſſaults, that they were conſtrained to deliver the ſame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on compoſition, before it had been fully beſieged three months. 3. Our brethren the Scots might have endured many a wet and cold night before New-Caſtle, and have
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60250:38"/>
ſpinned out that ſiege untill the next Spring, if they had not nobly and valiantly ſtormed the ſame. If Baſing houſe and Banbury Caſtle had been ſtormed with ſixe Canons that might have made ſuch breaches as are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before, and had the beſiegers given ſuch an aſſault, ſo ordered and the men ſo armed as followed, they had not loſt their reputation as they have; nor left that work undone, to ſpinne out this warre to the next yeare.</p>
                     <p>When a breach of twenty yards broad is made, and the dike filled up, as aforeſaid, even with the firme ground; then are three reſerves to march after one another in this manner, but if there be two breaches then ſix reſerves are to be in a readineſſe, and every reſerve is to conſiſt of fifty nine men, that is for every breach one hundred three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſeventeen men, and for the two breaches it is three hundred fifty foure men. Theſe men are to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen men of the moſt valiant and experienced ſouldiers of the Army; for raw ſouldiers are not to have that honour, neither would they ſtand to ſo furious a ſtorme; but would turne back and run away, and over-throw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; (for among the French the Marſhals of France, Earles, and Barons doe not diſdaine to be of the firſt ranke that go up to the breach;) and thoſe of the firſt ranke are to be of the moſt <note n="e" place="margin">See <hi>Montlus</hi> Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> eminent in birth and degree; this firſt ranke are to be all Rondachiers, armed from the head to the knees with armour of proofe, with broad ſwords in their right hands to cut the enemies pikes, their Rondachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the left, and a Piſtoll ready charged at their girdle, and are to be placed a foot aſunder, that the next ranke of nineteene Muſquetteers may fire their Muſquets between that foot light, and theſe Muſquetteers are to be armed with good ſwords on their ſide, a buffe coat on their back, and a Piſtoll ready charged at their girdle, and a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60250:39"/>
head piece on their head, they are to march two yards diſtant from the Rondachiers, and next to them are to be a ranke of twenty Pike-men armed with Corſelets and Cuiſiers of proofe; and are to march within two yards of the Muſquetteers, as it is here prickt downe:</p>
                     <p>Now theſe three reſerves are to march within three <note place="margin">Rondachiers. Muſquetteers. Pikemen.</note> yards one of another, that if the firſt give ground the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond may ſucceed, and ſo the third; but if it get ground, they are to preſſe on; Now the nineteene Muſquetteers of every reſerve having fired their Muſquets are to wheele about to ſhelter themſelves behinde the Pikemen, for to charge their Muſquets againe; And the Pike-men are to advance in their place to ſecond the <note n="f" place="margin">See <hi>Bayard</hi> Commentaries</note> Rondachiers, and to make good the breach untill the other reſerve comes up to the breach, if in caſe the Rondachiers were tired, or ſome of them wounded. Now on both ſides of the breach there are freſh Regiments or Companies of Muſquetteers to be placed for to ſecond theſe reſerves in caſe they looſe ground, or to enter furiouſly the breach if the enemies looſe it; for it is continuance and conſtancy that carries it away in aſſaults; for the beſiegers being foure to one will by continuance tire the defendants, as it came to paſſe at the ſiege of Malte. In a word, if our breaches were made ſo broad, and our men ſo well armed, and this order ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, I make no queſtion but our men would go on like Lions; but when they are to enter into Coney-holes in ſtead of breaches, and have no armour of proofe to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Muſquet ſhot and the Pikes of the Defendants, it is no marvell if they turne their backes and come off with diſhonour; now if there be two breaches or more
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60250:39"/>
made by Mines or by the ſtorming of the Canon, they are all to be entered at one inſtant, for the greater diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the enemies forces; and beſides theſe breaches it is wiſedome to have two hundred Ladders ready and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to be made, they ſhould be placed as farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the breaches as they can, that freſh ſouldiers may get up upon the rampier, and ſo wheele about to fall upon the backes of the enemies, while they defend the breaches: for by this ſtratageme <hi>Scipio</hi> tooke the ſtrong City of new <note n="g" place="margin">

                        <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth King of <hi>England,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed by an Army of the French near to Agincourt, exceeding his Army foure for one, commanded his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to dig in the night great and deepe trenches round about his Camp; and to ſtick in them long pointed ſtakes, and then to fill them againe up as lightly as they could with the looſe earth; by which ſtratageme the French Army was utterly defeated; for the French horſe coming in the morning furiouſly to fall upon the Engliſh Camp, they fell upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one anothers backs in theſe hallow grounded trenches, where the Engliſh Archers ſlew them at their pleaſure. 4. <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth King of France, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from the Conqueſt of the Kingdome of Naples, was incompaſſed by an Army of all the confederated Princes of Italy, (exceeding in number his Army three for one) as he came downe the Mountaines of the Alpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, neare to <note n="l" place="margin">See <hi>Des Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of France.</note> 
                        <hi>Farnone,</hi> where he had periſhed and all his Army for want of proviſions, if he had not by a ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme freed himſelfe from the ſtrait he was in, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding over night that all his Ordnance, carriages, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60250:40"/>
baggage ſhould be placed at the breake of day in the midſt of his foot, and that his horſe ſhould equally be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Brigades, the one for the Van, and the other for the reare, and himſelfe riding in the front of his Van, charged the enemies ſo furiouſly, that he broke tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their Army, ſlew divers thouſands of them, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a paſſage for himſelfe and all his Army to returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to France without impediment. Now had we not beene ſo barren in ſtratagemes of war as we are, our Army in Cornwall had, as well as theſe, come out of their ſtraits with honour and reputation, for it was inferiour to all theſe: But as I have ſaid heretofore, It was Gods pleaſure it ſhould be ſo, to humble us by that blow. 2. Strong holds that would require long ſieges may be reduced by a ſtratageme of warre in an houres time. <note n="m" place="margin">See the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.</note> 
                        <hi>Montluc</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intelligence by his Scouts that the Governour of a ſtrong Caſtle ſeated upon the lake of Canſtance, did uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally goe to recreate himſelfe at a farme houſe of his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two miles of his Caſtle, placed an ambuſh to intrap him, that tooke him and brought him before his Caſtle gate, and by threatning to ſtrike off his head from his ſhoulders, the Caſtle was yeelded and ſurrendred up. A good <hi>memorandum</hi> for ſome of our Governours, that goe a hunting with five or ſix horſe, and indanger themſelves and their garriſon to be ſurprized by the enemies. 2. The Governour of Dorlance took the ſtrong City of Amiens with this ſtratageme, he laid an Ambuſh in the night time within halfe a mile of the City of two thouſand foot, and of a thouſand horſe, and ſent ſixe Waggons laden with Hay, under which Hay were ſix armed ſouldiers in every one of the Waggons, and upon the laſt Waggons two ſouldiers diſguiſed like countrey-men, having ſome baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets full of Wall-Nuts, and commanded them they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60250:41"/>
ſhould not come to the City before the opening of the gates; where being come, the Souldiers of the Court of Guard knowing ſome of the Carters by ſight, ſuffered the Waggons to enter, without driving a Pike (as the rules of War require) thorow the midſt of their Loads of Hay, and the laſt Waggon ſtaid ſtill in the midſt of the gate, to hinder that the Percullis might not be let downe, faining ſomething was amiſſe at his <note n="n" place="margin">See the French Hiſtory</note> Waggon, and then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed ſouldiers let willingly one of their baskets of Wal-Nuts fall down, whereupon all the ſouldiers of the Court of Guard forſooke their Armes, and ranne to the gate to ſcramble for theſe Nuts. But in the meane time, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſouldiers of the enemies leapt out of the Waggons, and ſlew them all, ſecured the gate, and did let in their Ambuſh, and ſo poſſeſſed themſelves of the City, before the Governour could gather Forces to oppoſe them. 3. The ſtrong garriſon Towne of Breda was taken alſo by the ſtratageme of a ſmall Ship laden with Turffes, under which were hidden a Commander and twenty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Souldiers, and this <note n="o" place="margin">See <hi>Demetres</hi> Hiſtory.</note> Ship being ſuffered to enter the Towne, after it had been careleſly ſearched; The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander and his ſouldiers tooke their opportunity in the dead time of the night to fall upon a Court of Guard next to the gate where their land Ambuſh was laid, and ſlew all the ſouldiers of it, ſecured the gate, and let in their Ambuſh, that poſſeſſed themſelves of the Towne. 4. For to prove the antiquity of the Stratagemes of War; it is recorded that <note n="p" place="margin">Joſh. 8. 12.</note> Ai and <note n="q" place="margin">Judg. 20. 36.</note> Gibeah two ſtrong Cities of the Amorites were ſurprized by ambuſhes that were laid in a hallow, attending when the enemies ſhould come forth, for to enter and ſet them on fire, and to fall upon the backs of the Inhabitants of them, whereby they were utterly deſtroyed. And hereupon I conclude, that our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60250:41"/>
barrenneſſe in ſtratagemes of warre is one of the cauſes of the ſpinning out of this Unnaturall Warre. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the enemies garriſons might be taken with ſmall charges, if the Governours of ours, were as active and as much experienced in ſtratagemes of warre, as other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60250:42"/>
upon the ſame paſſage of <hi>Guichardin</hi> ſaith, that an Army divided into ſmall Brigades, except they be in ſight one of another, is like to a river that is divided into divers channels, that is fordable any where: Even ſo an Army that marcheth not in a full body is eaſily routed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated; for as it was impoſſible for <note n="y" place="margin">See <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in the life of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> to take the City of Babylon before he had divided the great river of Euphrates into divers ſmall channels; ſo is it almoſt impoſſible for to defeat a potent army if it march cloſe in one body: becauſe it is like a roaring flood that drives all before it. But ſmall forces cannot performe any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſervice, becauſe of their imbecility; and doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſume the Counties where they are, then free them from the oppreſſion of their enemies. For Inſtance, if we conſider what the weak, the divided, and the independant Forces of the Counties of North-hampton, Warwicke, Darby, Nottingham, Rutland, and Leiceſter have done ſince the beginning of this warre, we ſhall finde they have onely waſted themſelves upon a defenſive poſture, and have not hitherto freed their Counties of any of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies garriſons, that like ſo many leeches ſuck their bloud, and will conſume them by degrees, like a lingering fire that conſumes a blocke of Timber. Except it pleaſeth God to infuſe into the hearts of the Honourable Houſes, to reduce all their forces into two potent Armies; the one for to endeavour to drive the flames of the fire of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall war in as ſmall a circumference of ground as may be; for the ſmaller it ſhall be, the eaſier it will be quenched, and the ſooner ſhall a bleſſed peace be obtained: And the other to endeavour to cleare all the Counties one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of the enemies garriſons; for they are the fomenters of this war, and the virulent humour of our Hectick fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe they revive the fire of diſcord every where;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60250:42"/>
and recruite ſuddenly the diſperſed Armies of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Now the bleſſed fruits that the conjunction of three Armies into one hath produced this Summer ſhould in my opinion induce the Honourable Houſes to change this deſtructive Method of warre, to embrace this I ſpeake of: for according to huumane reaſon, the rules of war, and our late experience, it is like to prove more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull, becauſe we ſee that the dividing of our Army this yeare into two bodies hath annihilated this Summers worke; whereas if it had kept it ſelfe in one body, it had in all probability freed the City from the fear of the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt garriſons of the enemies, and driven the flames of the fire of this unnaturall war into the Weſterne parts; And ſo by the omiſſion of this Maxime of war, the <note n="z" place="margin">Jer. 8. 10.</note> harveſt is paſt, and the Summer is ended, and yet we are not ſaved, &amp;c. Now I come to the ſecond, that is of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment then the firſt; <hi>viz.</hi> That peace is the end of war, and that no war can have a bleſſed end, except the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end of it tend to peace: And that the fitteſt ſeaſon for a ſtate to tender propoſitions of peace, is when it is in a proſperous condition in Armes: And notwithſtanding this proſperity, their propoſitions are to be equall and juſt, that the peace grounded upon them may be of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For the firſt, if the Carthaginians had required a peace of the Romanes after their victory at Cannes, they had undoubtedly obtained a peace upon honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; but becauſe they delaid to require a peace till <note n="a" place="margin">

Peace, but becauſe he delaid to require a peace, till he and all his Forces were driven out of Greece, and himſelf with a potent Army defeated in <hi>Aſia,</hi> he was inforced to accept very hard conditions of peace, which was, to forſake all the dominions he had on this ſide the Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> &amp; to leave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the will &amp; pleaſure of his victorious enemies.

                        <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth concluded with his rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subjects, and with the Houſe of Auſtria, were of long continuance, becauſe it was the Maxime of that generous King, to be rather too remiſſe then rigorous in his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace: for when he had brought the Catholike <note n="g" place="margin">See <hi>Pierre Matthew</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourths life.</note> League upon their knees, that had rebelliouſly proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him incapable of the Crowne, injured his ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and deſolated his Kingdome by the forraigne For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they brought in to diſ-throne their naturall King; yet did he grant unto them honourable conditions of peace; and ſpilt not a drop of their bloud in vindication of their abhorred carriage towards him. And for the Houſe of Auſtria, although it had hatched that Cockatrice of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60250:43"/>
Catholike League, and fomented the Civill warre in France for three and thirty yeares together; yet after he had recovered the City of Amiens out of their hands, and driven back the potent Army of the Archduke <hi>Matthias</hi> into Flanders with great loſſe and diſhonour, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing into Artois with his victorious Army; he embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Propoſitions of peace that were offered him by <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond King of Spaine, and was ſo juſt and equall in his demands; (notwithſtanding he had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in Armes) that the Peace that was then conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was of long continuance. But the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth by the rigorous conditions of Peace he impoſed upon <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt King of France (that was his priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) againſt the wiſe counſell of that famous Politician <note n="h" place="margin">See the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Hiſtory.</note> Cardinall <hi>Ximenez,</hi> (that counſelled him to ſet freely the ſaid King at libertie, and to take no advantage at all of his impriſonment, nor to require but equall and juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace from him;) filled all Chriſten dome with war, and brought upon himſelfe ſuch incredible charges, that cauſed his hoary head to deſcend to the grave with ſorrow and vexation of mind. And the greateſt Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of our dayes, the <note n="i" place="margin">See this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals life.</note> Cardinall <hi>de Richlieu</hi> did counſell <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth King of France, to be in all the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of peace that he tendered to the Dukes of Savoy and Lorraine, and to his owne Proteſtant ſubjects, rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too rigorous; as being the ſafer way for to attain to a ſure and a conſtant peace. Now ſince it hath pleaſed God to infuſe into the hearts of all the Members of the honourable Houſes ſuch an earneſt deſire to Peace, as they are now ready to tender, and to ſend Propoſitions of Peace to his ſacred Majeſtie, I conceive we are all obliged in generall &amp; in particular to addreſſe our fervent Prayers to the throne of Grace, that God would be pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe

               <p>THe Perſeverance in the wayes of righteouſneſſe is a ſupernaturall Grace, and a free gift of God, but in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, Politike and Military actions, it is a gift of nature, or a property acquired by education or practiſe, that doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes overcome the naturall inſtinct in men, and in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable creatures, as it ſhall appeare by theſe inſtances: 1. <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Morals.</note> 
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> that was reputed by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> the wiſeſt, the moſt temperate, and the meekeſt man of all the Greeks, was naturally inclined to inconſtancie, licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and wrath, as he did aver before his Diſciples, when they derided in their ſchooles one that affirmed by the Phiſiognomy of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he was naturally addicted to theſe infirmities; but he overcame them by a conſtant obſervation of the rules and of the Principles of Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. 2. <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his life.</note> 
                  <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to induce the Lacedemonians to a conſtant Perſeverance in the auſtere diet and Military Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline he had eſtabliſhed in their Lawes, cauſed a Maſty, a Greyhound, a Hare, and a Porrige Pot, to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and having looſed the Dogs, ſet down the Pot, and let goe the Hare; the Maſty ranne after the Hare, the

Grey-hound to the Porrige Pot; whereupon he ſpake thus to them, this Grey-hound was reared in a kitchin, and this Maſty among a kenell of hounds, and cuſtome hath over-maſtered their naturall inſtinct; even ſo, this auſtere diet, and military Diſcipline, that ſeemes irkſome to you, will be eaſie and pleaſant in continuance of time. Whereupon I obſerve, that our want of Perſeverance in Armes doth rather proceed from the long neglect of our breeding and practiſe in war, then from our naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that was formerly addicted to <note n="c" place="margin">See the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Chron. in the lives of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. &amp; <hi>Henry</hi> the 5.</note> Martiall exploits. But before I come to the particulars of this want of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant perſeverance in Military actions, and to prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the redreſſe of it by inſtances, I deſire to anſwer an objection that will be objected by ſuch as are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the degrees of this perſeverance. You ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge (will they ſay) in your laſt Chapter, that our Civill warre is the greateſt evill and the moſt dreadfull judgement of God that could fall upon this nation; And notwithſtanding you perſwade us to perſevere in it, and complaine that the want of our perſeverance in it, is the cauſe of the ſpinning out of this war; which ſeemes a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox to us, becauſe we conceive the leſſe we perſevere in it the ſooner we ſhall have an end of it? I anſwer that I do not perſwade any to perſevere in this war, to the end to prolong the ſame, but to endeavour by a conſtant Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in Armes, to obtaine by Gods favour a bleſſed peace, from which we are deprived yeare after yeare, by our want of perſeverance in Military actions, as it ſhall be proved in this Chapter: Neither doe I complaine onely that it is the cauſe of the ſpinning out of our miſeries; But do alſo wiſh that my head were full of <note n="d" place="margin">Jer. 9. 1.</note> water and mine eyes a fountain of teares, that I might weep day and night for the deſolations that this unnaturall war and this want

hath brought already upon this Nation. The which to redreſſe, if it be poſſible, I will endeavour to prove that a conſtant perſeverance in all profeſſions, is the way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to honour in this life, to peace in this world, and to eternall bliſſe in the life to come.

                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> was utterly overthrowne for want of Perſeverance in Armes, for in ſtead to keepe the ſame in their Winter Camp, as his uſe was, he lodged them in the laſcivious City of Capua, whereby they became ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, that they loſt by it their former valour, and could never be reduced againe to their auſtere Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; And for this reaſon did <note n="q" place="margin">See <hi>Plut.</hi> in <hi>Marius</hi> his life.</note> 
                  <hi>Marius,</hi> and divers other wiſe Commanders of the Romans, keepe their Armies in their Winter Camps, farre from any Citie, or Market Townes, that they might exerciſe their ſouldiers in the auſtere labours of war, and rather then they ſhould be idle, (for idleneſſe breeds licentiouſneſſe) they kept them at work in digging deep channels, to come out of one River into another, to inrich the Countrey by Navigation. This point deſerves to be taken into conſideration by them in Authoritie, that the Winter quarter of our Army may be placed upon the enemies Counties, and as far diſtant from the City of London as may be, for it is the bane of our Officers and ſouldiers, becauſe they grow licentious and effeminate, by their ſwilling and drinking in the City all the Winter time, whereas if they lay conſtantly in their Winter quarter farre from the City, and in the enemies Counties; they would be conſtrained to be in action, and this would inable them in the perſeverance of the auſtere labours of war, and greatly preſerve our Counties that are now waſted by our owne Armies; and by degrees would reduce the enemies to that ſmallor circumference

of ground, of which I have ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of before. Now we may conceive by all theſe Inſtances, how neceſſary it is for us to obtaine this conſtant perſeverance in Armes, that hath three degrees. 1. The ſlow. 2. The ſwift. 3. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and conſtant: The ſlow is irkſome and of no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: the ſwift is fiery, dangerous, and of no conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; but the moderate and conſtant carries the Bell away; and this is the degree of Perſeverance that we ſhould endeavour to attaine, becauſe the want of it, is the cauſe of the ſpinning out of this unnaturall war; but it is altogether unknowne to us: but the ſlow and the ſwift are too familiar with us. The ſlow is ſeen in our tedious marches and preparations; and the ſwift appeares in our fights and skirmiſhes, that are fierce and fiery, but of no greater continuance then the fire of thornes under a Pot. <note n="r" place="margin">See <hi>Plut.</hi> in <hi>Sertorius</hi> his life.</note> 
                  <hi>Sertorius</hi> a wiſe Commander of the Romanes that was conſtrained to fly into Spain, to avoid the tyrannicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Sylla;</hi> to induce his Army that was compoſed of raw ſouldiers, to this conſtant and moderate perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in war I ſpeake of: cauſed a ſtrong and a weak horſe to be brought before them, and commanded one of his ſtrongeſt ſouldiers, to endeavour to pull off the weakeſt horſe taile at a pull, but being derided by the Army for his vaine attempt, <hi>Sertorius</hi> charged a young youth to pull haire by haire the taile off the ſtrong horſe, and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees pulled the ſame quite away in a ſhort time; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Sertorius</hi> ſpake thus to his Army: If you perſevere conſtantly in your Military attempts, it will be as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Romanes to overcome you, as it was for this ſtrong ſouldier to pull off this weake horſe taile at a Pull: but if you fight by fits, and then lye ſtill, as your Method is; It will be as eaſie for the Romanes by their conſtant perſeverance in Armes, to reduce you under their yoke, as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60250:47"/>
it was for this youth, to pull away by degrees this ſtrong horſes taile. This Metaphor cannot be applied in a more ſeaſonable time then this; for our warre may properly be compared to barley-breake players, for after they have by their ſwift running brought in ſome of their oppoſites, that were iſſued out of their Centry, they breathe and reſt themſelves for halfe an houre together, and ſo goe to it againe: Even ſo, if we have obtained by Gods favour ſome victory, we breath and reſt our ſelves ſo long, till our enemies have recruited their routed Armies ſtronger then ever they were before. The Lord was pleaſed to fight for us at Keinton, at Newbery, and neare to Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter; but for want of this conſtant perſeverance in war I ſpeake of, we made no uſe at all of theſe three vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories; And yet ſuch goodly Trees, according to the rules of war, ſhould not come without fruits. I meane without the reducing of ſome Counties, or ſtrong holds of the enemies; our Commanders can by Gods favour overcome their enemies, as well as <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but we lack a <note n="*" place="margin">See Hannibals life.</note> 
                  <hi>Maharbell,</hi> a Maſter of their horſe, to tell them they can make no uſe of their victories; And as it is with our Armies, ſo is it with the forces of our Garriſon townes, in the greater parts of our Counties; for if they have by Gods bleſſing defeated the Forces of one of the enemies garriſons, and greatly weakned the ſame, in ſtead to make uſe of their victory, and ſuddenly (according as the rules of war doe require) to beſiege and to begirt with ſtrong trenches that towne, and to endeavour by ſtorming and violent aſſaults to carry it away, while the defendants are amazed and weakly manned, becauſe of their laſt blow: They retreat homeward, breathe and reſt themſelves for three months together, and then they will endeavour to have another bout; Or will, it may be, undertake to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege

that towne, when there is no probability to take the ſame; becauſe it is better provided then ever it was; and ſo are inforced to come off with the ſame reputation as the beſiegers of Baſing and Banbury have done. Surely this is not the way to conduce this war to a ſpeedy and a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed period; but rather to ſpinne out the ſame, untill the Kingdome be conſumed. It muſt be upon a conſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in Armes, that we muſt relye upon, for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a bleſſed peace; it is not thirty, threeſcore or an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or two hundred horſe taken in this or that skirmiſh, that will give an iſſue to theſe warres, that is as a little oyle caſt into the fireto inſlame it the more; The Counties are to be freed of theſe garriſons, and all the fire of this war is to be driven into a ſmall circumference of ground by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Armies, that it may be the ſooner quenched; and our advantages in war are to be followed cloſe at the heeles; for it is more dangerous for ſouldiers to play with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of war, then it is for children to play with ſharpe edged tooles. <note n="s" place="margin">See <hi>Hannibals</hi> life.</note>

that our Commanders in Chiefe doe not endeavour to attaine to this honour, to be called after God, the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers of their Countrie. And ſpecially ſince they fight for the advancement of Gods glory, his ſacred Majeſties juſt prerogatives, the Priviledges of Parliament, and their own liberties. <note n="x" place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Solons</hi> life.</note>

Now if this heathen did repute him happy, that lived and died thus; our Commanders, Officers, and Souldiers have better grounds to be perſwaded, that they ſhall be eternally bleſſed, if they live religiouſly, and die valiantly in the defence of the cauſe they have in hand. And this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance ſhould in my opinion be a great motive to induce them to expedite this war; and to conjoyn with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant perſeverance in armes, the ſpirituall perſeverance that I now come to ſpeake of (for the firſt will not availe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſecond) that is of a higher nature and of greater concernment then the Civill, Politicke and Military, as much as the Salvation of mens ſoules is more precious and more excellent; and by conſequent more to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then the preſervation of their bodies; becauſe it is the moſt neceſſary Grace for Chriſtians, to attain to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bleſſedneſſe; for upon their perſeverance in the wayes of righteouſneſſe, or the neglect and intermiſſion of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends their eternall woe, or their eternall bliſſe. And this ſupernaturall grace is as free a gift of God, as faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is, and not incident to naturall, or unregenerate men, but only peculiar to the true children of God; and is as it were the very ſeale of their Election, Adoption, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and Juſtification, and a true earneſt of their future
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60250:48"/>
Glorification. For except they perſevere in the wayes of Piety and Righteouſneſſe, from their firſt Calling to their end, in mortifying their corruptions, carnall deſires, the luſt of the fleſh, and live religiouſly and ſoberly in this preſent world; they will utterly fall away from the faith, as did <note n="a" place="margin">Tim. 2. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> and looſe all that they have wrought. Now the greater this gift of Perſeverance is the more are they to be earneſt and diligent by fervent and continuall prayers, and humble Supplications to God to obtaine it; and the greater is their obligation to him, when they have received the ſame. This excellent Grace is compared to a Race, where all run, but none obtaines the prize, but ſuch as perſevere to the end: for it is nothing for men to begin well, and to be fervent and active in all the duties of Piety for a moment of time, or to caſt forth flaſhes of zeale, to ſeeme to advance the Glory of God, and their owne private, or the generall Reformation that is now in hand, except they continue till the worke be done, that they may ſo run, that they may <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 24.</note> obtaine. The Architector that begins an excellent ſtructure, and does not make an end of it, nor finiſh it after that exquiſite Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry that it was begun, but for want of patience or to ſave charges leaves it unperfected, or changeth the forme or compoſition of the firſt erection, from a Corinthian forme to the Toſcan, or Jonique, that are inferiour to it in charges, beauty and excellency, doth diminiſh his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and not increaſe the ſame; for it is not the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but the compleating of a work in all perfection that honours and recommends the workmen. Even ſo will it be with private men, that begin well and walke fervently in the wayes and duties of Piety, but doe not continue to the end. And alſo with our Worthies, if they ſhould not porſevere to the end in this bleſſed worke of the true
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60250:49"/>
Reformation they have begun: For as the Apoſtle ſaith concerning our Chriſtian Calling; <hi>That there are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe, nor many mighty, nor many noble after the fleſh called:</hi> Even ſo among ſo many millions of men of all <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 26.</note> degrees, that inhabite theſe three Kingdomes, there are but ſome few hundreds, that have been called to this bleſſed worke of the Lord; And this extraordinary grace and honour they have received of him, ſhould, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, induce them to perſevere in this great worke, till it be perfected; for the leſſer the number is, the greater will be their honour, becauſe their unparalelled labours will be the greater: And as for thoſe that out of that ſmall number have deſerted the work, preferring, like <note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Demas</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> the love of this world before the glory of God; let not their Apoſtaſie be a motive of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the faithfull Ones, but rather of a greater aſſurance of their perſeverance in grace, from which the others are fallen off, as I will endeavour to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by inſtances. 1. They began to run in the race, but they continued not; for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us, but they went out, that they might be made</hi>

For the gifts of God, ſaith the Apoſtle, are without <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 11. 1. 29.</note> repentance, &amp;c. 3. Nor the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to run the race that was ſet <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> before them, &amp;c. 4.

And will alwaies be ſo, untill it be proſecuted before all other affaires, by an unanimous Perſeverance and integrity of heart, by them in Authority, that God out a ſpeciall mercy to
