            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY your leave room for such Wit as your Friends and sparkling Canary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents you with: you have it from persons who entertained no serious thoughts, or notions at that time. 'Tis sufficient, that this small volume hath been before a lawfull Iudicature: and certainly it cannot but be the better thought of, in regard it hath been too severely dealt withall; for Gold, though it be the richest production of the Sun, is very often expos'd to the Touch-stone. Such a triall have every one of these Copies endur'd. And believe it Reader, it hath passed the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of a Grand Iury: The truth is, there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly came forth a Book intituled <hi>Wit and Drollery,</hi> which contained so many refined Fancies, that had not this appeared, it might (for things of that nature) have given a full satisfaction to the curious. But since we have made so noble and so large a discovery, I hope, Reader, thou wilt not be angry that we have not been Concealers, and Hoarders of our wealth. For to deale plainly with thee,

S.</hi> have already taken notice, how these worthy persons are likely to suffer by Copies, to which their names are shortly to be affixed: Papers onely to be protested against; and indeed those who knew those Gentlemen, can assure the Reader, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they never allowed of the publishing of their Copies, nor will ever descend so much from their own prerogative, as to own those which they never wrote. Neither have we such a dearth of other Wits, there are other ingenuous persons in our little World of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> more youthfull, as familiar and joviall with the Muses as ever they were, and such as when they please to be right Drollers, can be as little in love as they, such as are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved never to study <hi>Romances,</hi> or to be guilty of the false praises of women. You may meet with severall Pamphlets, Reader, but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether they be not rak'd from the simple collections of Short hand prentices. Of these
<pb facs="tcp:104656:4"/>
surreptitious Editions there is no end; and if such trifles are allowed, we shall see Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads inserted shortly, to as much dishonour of our English Wit, as if <hi>Don</hi>'s Poems were turned into Dutch. The onely misfortune, as when meere Rimers, and such like pittifull Gleaners of the scraps of Wit, shall, like <hi>Marsyas,</hi> pretend to play with <hi>Apollo.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Reader, this volume is exposed to thy cleare censure; onely take notice, if you can finde out a Christian, and Sirname by the letters in the Title, as they are placed, you will do little lesse than devine.

            <l>ONe came to Court a wench; she was precise,</l>
            <l>And by the spirit did the flesh despise:</l>
            <l>One mov'd a secret Match betwixt them two;</l>

            <l>He did reply, So sweet and fair as she,</l>
            <l>Made of the stuff all other women be,</l>
            <l>Ought by the law of woman to be kinde,</l>
            <l>And shew her self to bear a woman's minde.</l>
            <l>Well, Sir, quoth she, you men do so prevail,</l>
            <l>With cunning speeches, and a pleasant tale:</l>
            <l>'Tis but a folly to be over-nice:</l>
            <l>You shall; but twenty shillings is my price:</l>
            <l>If you a brace of Angels will bestow,</l>
            <l>Come such a time, and I am for you. So</l>
            <l>He took leave then, and with her husband met;</l>
            <l>Told him, by Law he was to pay a debt,</l>
            <l>Intreating him to do so good a deed</l>

            <l>And th' other willing on his wife to spend,</l>
            <l>So taking leave of him, he went his ways,</l>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:104656:19"/>And told him, Sir, I was at home to pay</l>
            <l>The twenty shillings which you lent last day;</l>
            <l>And with your wife, because you were not there,</l>
            <l>I left it: pray you with my boldness bear.</l>
            <l>'T is well, quoth he, I 'm glad I did you pleasure.</l>
            <l>So coming home, questions his wife at leasure:</l>
            <l>I pray, Sweet-heart, was such a man with thee,</l>
            <l>To pay two Angels which he had of me?</l>
            <l>She blush'd, and said he had been there indeed:</l>
            <l>But you did ill to lend: husband, take heed;</l>
            <l>It is not good to trust before you try.</l>
            <l>Pray lend no more: for it may breed some strife,</l>

            <l>The world is of a vast extent we see,</l>
