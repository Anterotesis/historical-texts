            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHereas the Enemies of the Peace of this Kingdom, being ſufficiently ſenſible how all their deſigns for the ruine and deſtruction thereof have, by the bleſſing of God upon our endeavors, been rendered abortive and made ſucceſsleſs to the producing of that effect, have notwithſtanding, out of their reſtleſs deſire to bring their wicked purpoſes into execution, watched for and purſued all opportunities, that they could either make or meet with, conducing to that end; and have not ceaſed to lay upon us and lade us with all manner of Slander and Calumny, that might not only make us unacceptable to thoſe of whom We have beſt deſerved, but alſo render Us odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all the World: And being informed that the ſaid Enemies of the Kingdom have, upon occaſion of ſome of our late juſt and neceſſitated Actions, given publikely out, and written to the parts beyond the Seas, that We intend to put all into Ruine and Confuſion, and to ſeize upon all Mens Eſtates, deſtroy Propriety, Trade and Commerce, and that their goods cannot be in any ſecurity while We are in this Town, or keep in our hands any of the ſtrengths of the Kingdom; and underſtanding that thereupon Bills of Exchange begin to be queſtioned, and ſome perſons begin to convey away their goods; We being very ſenſible how much the Wealth, Peace and Happineſs of this Kingdom is concerned in the Freedom and Fulneſs of the Trade and Commerce thereof; and how much the ſaid Enemies of Peace ſhould prevent their foreſaid wicked end, if their ſaid Calumnies ſhould go on to be beleeved: We do therefore hereby declare, That as by all the Adventures of our Lives and Blood We have ſought nothing more then the proſperity of this Kingdom, and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs in the Land; ſo there is nothing that We more abhor then thoſe wicked Calumnies, that We ſhould invade the Propriety of any not wilfully making themſelves Enemies, or do any thing any way, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or obſtruct that Trade and Commerce by which this Kingdom doth both ſubſiſt and flouriſh: But that We ſhall, in a moſt eſpecial manner, protect, defend, encourage and maintain, in all juſt ways (according to the Law of Nations, and the manner hitherto practiſed in this Kingdom) all manner of Trade, Traffique and Commerce either by Engliſh or Strangers: and that We ſhall neither do, nor ſuffer to be done, as far as is in our power, any violence, wrong or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to the perſons or goods of any, as aforeſaid, exerciſing any Trade or Commerce in this Kingdom, either by Sea or Land: Which we thought fit to publiſh for the ſatisfaction of all perſons concerned herein.</p>
