            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON the 25th of the 7th Moneth 1670. ſeveral of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid People, being peaceably aſſembled at their uſual Meeting place aforeſaid, (not in Stubbornneſs, nor in contempt to Magiſtracy, but in tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God) There came in ſome Musketteers, and haled them forth into the Street<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Troopers came, and rod in amongſt them in a violent manner, beating and abuſing both Men and Women, and punching them in the Faces and Bodies with their Carbines; and ſoon after the Foot-Souldiers came, and fell upon them alſo, and beat both Men and Women in a Cruel and Outragious manner, alſo punching them on the Feet with the But-ends of their Pikes and Muskets, till they broke ſeveral of them, alſo running the Muzzle of their Muskets with violence againſt the Bodies of many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then a Party of Horſe came deſperately, and ſought to ride over them; but the Horſes being more merciful then their Riders, and not going forward, they turned their Horſes, and by curbing and reining them backward, ſtrove to do what miſchief they could. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that were Wounded, and ſorely Bruiſed, and had their Blood ſpilt this day were above twenty Perſons.</p>
            <p>On the 2d day of the 8th Moneth, They being kept out of their Meeting-place aforeſaid, there came a Party of Foot and a Party of Horſe, who laid on upon Friends in a violent and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el manner, knocking them with their Muskets and Pikes, and the Horſe-men with their Carbines, until the Blood lay in the Streets; and ſo they continued for a long time until they brake ſeveral Pikes, and Muskets, and one Carbine; and then took the Barrel by one end, and gnaſhed their teeth, ſtriking till ſeveral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66144:3"/>
were ſo beaten and bruiſed, that their lives were in danger. There were wounded, and ſorely bruiſed, this day above thirty Perſon.</p>
            <p>Again, The 9th of the 8th Moneth, The Souldiers, both Horſe and Foot, came to the Meeting at the aforeſaid Place, and one of them having a Shovel threw the Dirt and Mire on both Men and Women, in a ſhameful manner, and after him came both Horſe and Foot, and fell upon them, Striking and Knocking down, without reſpect to Age or Sect, in a very cruel manner, until they ſpilt the Blood of many; and when ſome of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in pitty took them into their Houſes, to ſave their Lives, the Souldiers forced open the Doors, and haled them into the Street again, and pluckt off their Hats, that they might ſtrike on their bare Heads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſomuch that many had their Heads bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a grievous manner, and thus they continued a long time; alſo tearing Men and Womens Clothes off their Backs, and haling Women through the Mire by their Horſe ſides; ſome of the Foot-Souldiers putting their hands under the Womens Coats, uſing unclean Expreſſions and immodeſt Behaviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And a Red-coat Souldier ſtruck one Woman Friend twice with his Musket on the Belly, and once on the Breſt, another flung Dirt in her Face; and ſince that, ſhe hath never been well, but hath Miſcarried, theſe abuſes being the cauſe of it, it hath been the Death of her Child, her Life being in great Danger: And a man Friend they abuſed with Blows, and afterwards took him, and carried him into a backward place, being there, one deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Money, and endeavoured to rifling his Pockets, ſwearing, GOD DAM HIM, <hi>he would</hi> STAB <hi>him, if he would not give it him;</hi> ſwearing again, <hi>He would</hi> PISTOL <hi>him.</hi> The number of thoſe that were wounded, and had their Blood ſpilt, and were ſorely bruiſed this day were above fifty Perſons.</p>
            <p>And on the 16th day of the 8th Moneth 1670. Being again kept out of their Meeting-place, there <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>me a great Party of Horſe and Foot, and would preſently have fell on, upon them, had there not been. Conſtables there, who for ſome time kept them off, but at laſt they broke out into a great rage, and ſome of the Foot with the But-ends of their Mu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with great thick Trunchins and Staves, ſaid on upon them in ſuch a violent manner, as if they would have killed all in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66144:3"/>
place; and in a ſhort time the Blood ran down about the Ears of many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And above twenty Perſons received ſore Wounds and cruel Bruiſes; and one of the Conſtables endeavoring to ſtop them from ſhedding Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to keep the Peace, they fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him alſo, and broke his Head; and when they were rebuked of their cruelty, ſome anſwered, <hi>If you knew what orders we have you would ſay we dealt Mercifully with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Subſtance of the Relation, before mentioned, was laid before the King and his Council, and for ſome time there was ſome ceſſation of their Cruelty, but ſince they have begun again in the like manner, though not in ſame degree, with great threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to be worſe and worſe in their ſavage behaviour towards them, which cannot well be, except they directly murther in the place.</p>
            <p>Alſo it is to be obſerved, that when the Troopers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers have come, and thus abuſed and wounded the Innocent; ſome have asked them ſaying, How can you deal thus with a people that have love and good will to all men, and make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance nor oppoſition; and then they have replyed, We had rather, and it would be better for us, if you did reſiſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: And ſo it is manifeſt, they do thoſe things to provoke oppoſition, that they might imbrue their hands in our blood, and have our Lives and Eſtates for a ſpoil and a prey.</p>
            <p>Now that ſuch barbarous inhumane Cruelties ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (in a Nation reputed famous for Chriſtianity, and the excellency of its Laws) by mercenary men, in time of peace, is that which cannot be paralell'd among the Heathen; and its a great ſhame and reproach to the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry of this Nation, that men ſhould be found therein ſo void of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; ſo far degenerated from the true nature of mankind; ſo ſtony and hard-hearted; ſo ſeared in Conſcience, that they can act and exerciſe ſuch bruitiſh Cruelties upon a peaceable people, who have love and good will to all men, and whoſe Principles leads them to follow peace, and enſue it.</p>
            <p>Well, If ſuch hard-hearted unreaſonable men ſhall be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and tolerated to rifle us, and knock us on the head, and ſpil our Blood in the Street, bruiſe and mangle our Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66144:4"/>
we are brought to a Trial, or Condemned by Law; then farwel good Government, and the Fundamental Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which are very tender of the Liberties, Eſtates, and lives of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Magiſtrates, who are ſworn to do juſtice and right to all men, and to execute the Law without reſpect of perſons may endeavor to get a diſpenſation for their Oathes, but we would hope better things.</p>
            <p>Here are a few of the names of thoſe who had their Blood ſpilt, and were ſore wounded, as Witneſſes to the truth of theſe things, and in the behalf of themſelves, and the reſt.</p>

            <p>ANd now Oh ye Rulers of this Nation, I know the way to pleaſe many of you, would be to ſmooth you up with fine words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the way to pleaſe the Lord of Heaven and Earth, who is greater then you all, is to deal plainly with you; and that I may be clear of you in the Day of God, it is with me thus to write.</p>
            <p>Certainly God is Angry with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that not without a Cauſe given him by you; he hath tried you long, to ſee what you would do for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath ſent his Servants, and otfen warned you to abſtain from Violence and Iniquity, but you have had little regard to it: Look back, and conſider what you have done at all your Sittings, ſince you were choſen and brought into place, and ſee if you can find one Act made or revived by you for the ſubduing of Prophanneſs and Debauchery: Do not all ſorts of ungodly Meetings abound in your Cities and Countries; as Stage-Plays, Beare and Bull-Beatings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cock-Fights, Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal and Cudgel-Plays, Race-Running both Horſe and Foot, Huntings, Revelling?

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66144:4"/>
by you; or do you not rather, many of your ſelvs, keep open houſe for ſuch to come ſometimes, with Moris-dancers and Mummers? And how doth Drunken-Meetings abound with Dice and Cards, filled with Curſing and Helliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oaths, and the Noiſe of Fiddlers and Vagabonds roaring like Beaſts and Swine? So that one may ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Hell hath enlarged her ſelf:</hi> And is not there daily new Inventions of Wickedneſs? And was there ever more Pride, and Whoredom, and Oppreſſion, in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> then is now found amongſt a People Profeſſing Chriſtianity? What is become of the good wholſom Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which were made for the ſuppreſſing of Prophanneſs? You have neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived them by Proclamation nor Converſation; but ſtill at your Sitting, one of your chiefeſt buſineſſes hath been to impoſe heavy Burdens upon People Conſciences, that are tender towards God: But ſuch whoſe Conſcience will ſerve to run to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Meetings before mentioned, they have Liberty enough, and are upheld and incouraged, and may have DRUMS and TRUMPETS to gather ſuch Meetings in the open Streets; and if one cometh in the Name of the Lord to reprove ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he is in danger of his Life, and may be to be, ſent to Priſon, and called a Rebel, a Heretick, and ſuch like; and Wickedneſs is now grown to ſuch a hight, that naſty Songs and Ballads may be heard in your Streets, and hung upon the Gates of your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be ſold, to corrupt Youth; but Meeting-Houſes for the Worſhip of God are pulled down, and defaced, and drunken Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers carry away of the Timber to ſell, that they may feed their luſts; but many Play-Houſes are built and repaired, and ſets the Kings Arms upon ſuch, and to theſe one may repair, and not fear being Fined, and there both Knaves and Fools may ſtand up, and Lye, and Swear, and uſe all the Tricks Hell can afford, and teach People Vanity; but I hear of no Fines that are levied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe kind of Teachers or Houſes, though theſe are the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Meetings, that draw People from the Grace of God, the Anointing within, which would teach People to live Soberly; and ſuch Meetings as theſe are a terror and trouble to the Kings good Subjects, and a diſturbance to the Peace of them that love Righteouſneſs, and are Subjects to Chriſt's Kingdom. And therefore, before you go about to meddle with tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66144:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
humble your ſelves under the Hand of God, that you may know your own purged; and alſo, ſtop that Fountain of Wickedneſs, which ſince you came in place is ſet open, more then formerly; and call in all thoſe Laws which you have made, and cauſed the Innocent to ſuffer by; and acknowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your Sin to God, and the Nation; and open the Priſon Doors, that thoſe that make Conſcience of Oaths, and Feeding Deceivers, and have long ſuffered under you, may once again enjoy their Families and Native Rights; for I am to tell you, Poor <hi>Naboth</hi> in the Eye of the Lord, hath as good Right to his little Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, as <hi>Ahab</hi> to his Crown; and it is not the Swearing of the Sons of <hi>Beliel</hi> that can make a juſt Birthright, or yet prevent the heavy Vengeance of the Lord from overtaking the Oppreſſors of thoſe whom God loves.</p>
            <p>And now conſider what Honour you have got by your laſt Act againſt religious Meetings; it is true, you have almoſt undone many hundred Families, not leaving a Cow to give their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Milk, or Bed to lie upon. Old <hi>Pharoah</hi> had a bad name, but you have done worſe then he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though, like you, he refuſed to let Gods People Worſhip him aright; yet I do not read that he put them in Priſon, or took away their Goods and Cattle as you have done. I have alſo made inquiry who for the moſt have aſſiſted you in this Work through the Conntries, and I find chiefly Drunkards, ſuch as could Swear any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; Hang<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men, and ſuch as were burnt in the Hand formerly for theft, and Pick-Pockets, and ſuppoſed High-way men, and baſe Fellows that have ſpent their Eſtates in Prophaneſs; theſe, and ſuch like, have been your Informers in many places; as alſo rude debaucht idle Souldiers; and many Officers have heen made for fear of ſuch, and alſo leſt they ſhould pay a fine, to act againſt their own ſouls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and violate the Law of God in their own Conſciences: And theſe your Doings an All-ſeeing Eye hath beheld, and though you are as lords in the Earth, the Almighty God, who is Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, will call you to Judgment, and then you ſhall know with him there is no reſpect of Perſons.</p>
