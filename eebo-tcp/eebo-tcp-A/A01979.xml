            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as <hi>Preaching</hi> is of power eſpeciallie to worke vpon the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſo Printing may be one eſpeciall meanes to informe the iudgement.<note place="margin">Vox audita pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, littera ſcripta manet.</note> For that which is Printed lieth by a man, and may againe and againe be read, and throughly pondered, till a man come to conceiue the very depth of that he readeth. Beſides, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is a great benefit of printing, that the gifts and paines of Gods ſeruants are made much more common then otherwiſe they could be: hereby wee partake of the labours of thoſe who haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in former times, or in other Countries, and whom we could neuer haue heard ſpeake. Now a good thing,<note place="margin">Bonum quo communius eo melius.</note> the more common it is, the better it is. It cannot be denied but that knowledge and learning haue wonderfully encreaſed by the benefit of Printing.

If it be ſaid, that there can nothing be written, but what hath beene written before, I anſwer, that though it ſhould be true in regard of the ſumme and ſubſtance of matters, yet in regard of a more full opening, a more perſpicuous deliuering, a more euident prouing, a more powerfull vrging and preſsing of<pb facs="tcp:3457:4"/> points,<note place="margin">Aliquid novus ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But may not the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be alleadged againſt Preaching? and doe not many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge it? Howſoeuer ſome, too enuiouſly minded, cenſure the meanes which God in mercy hath affoorded for the building vp of the body of Chriſt Ieſus, my deſire is euery way to doe what good I can; and therefore I haue beene bold to commit to your eies and reading, ſome part of that which I haue heretofore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to your eares and hearing. I doe now make a triall of my paines in this kind: if I ſhall obſerue that Gods Church reapeath any benefit thereby, I ſhall be encouraged to take the more paines hereafter, as I ſhall find any leaſure. I am the ſeruant of Chriſt, and of his Church; ſo long as my life, health, ſtrength, liberty, or any ability is by the good prouidence of God preſerued vnto me, my deſire is to ſpend it in the ſeruice of Chriſt, and of his Church. Among others I eſpecially entreat you (my beloued Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners and Auditors, of what rancke or degree ſoeuer ye be) in the beſt part to interpret, and with the beſt mind to accept theſe my endeauours; whereby, though I haue aimed at a more generall good, then I could by preaching (hoping that many whom I neuer knew, nor ſaw, may reape ſome benefit by my paines) yet eſpecially I intend your good, whoſe proper and peculiar Miniſter I am, and for whoſe ſoules I watch, as hee that muſt giue an account. In this triall which I make of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ſome of my meditations, I beginne with the laſt part of my labors, becauſe they are freſheſt in your memories that heard them preached, and containe points more largely diſcuſſed, and, as I take it, of greater vſe then any other, which throughout the courſe of my Miniſtry I haue handled. For the time of our life being a time of warre, a time wherein our ſpirituall enemies (who are many, mighty, malitious, ſedulous, and ſubtile) put forth their ſtrength, and beſtir themſelues to the vttermoſt that<pb facs="tcp:3457:5"/> poſsibly they can,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Seeking whom to deuoure,</hi> what can bee more behoueful, then to diſcouer their cunning ſtratagems and wyles, to declare wherein their ſtrength lieth, to furniſh Chriſts Souldiers with compleat armour and ſufficient defence, and to ſhew how our enemies may bee diſappointed of their hopes, and we ſtand faſt againſt all their aſſaults? This is the <hi>ſcope</hi> of this Treatiſe. The <hi>Analyſis</hi> and <hi>Tables</hi> which I haue cauſed to be ſet before and after the Booke, doe point out the ſeuerall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct points contained therein, ſo as I neede not here make any repetition of them. I haue laboured to bee as perſpicuous and briefe as I could, in handling ſo weighty matters. I haue in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places deliuered no more then the heads of ſuch points as I largely handled in deliuering them out of the Pulpit: which any may well coniecture to be ſo, that ſhall know that the ſubſtance of almoſt an hundred ſeuerall Sermons is contained in this Treatiſe. My deſire of breuity moued me to referre the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moſt places of Scripture vnto the margent, and to leaue the Text to be ſearched out by the Reader, which I wiſh thee to doe as thy leaſure will permit thee.

The ſame it is for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which thou haddeſt before: for I find no iuſt cauſe to alter any part of the ſubſtance thereof. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here and there ſomething hath beene added, to make ſuch points as ſeemed too conciſe and obſcure, more perſpicuous.</p>
            <p>Some there were, that finding the head of <hi>Faſting</hi> in the Table, looked for a diſtinct and larger diſcourſe of that point, which when they found not (for I did but briefly by the way touch it, as an helpe to Prayer) they entreated mee to take a little more paines thereabout. To their good motion I haue yeelded, and according to my poore abilitie, and little lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I haue more copiouſly handled that very-needfull, but too-much-neglected dutie of <hi>Fasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was further informed that the point of <hi>not praying for them that ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> would much trouble the conſciences of ſome, if they were not informed in the nature of that ſin; and thereupon I haue beene mooued to annex a Treatiſe concerning that ſinne: in handling whereof, leſt Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In this Edition there are for thy helpe more diſtinctions of ſeuerall points then were before. For that which before was ſet forth as one Treatiſe, is now diuided into three ſeuerall Treatiſes, and the Treatiſe of the <hi>Sinne against the Holy Ghost,</hi> added thereto, maketh a fourth.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeuerall <hi>Treatiſes</hi> are alſo diuided into their diſtinct

                     <p>THat wee may bee the rather mooued to renounce all vaine confidence in our ſelues or other creatures, and be bold, valiant, and <hi>ſtrong in the Lord,</hi> caſting our whole confidence in him alone, the Apoſtle addeth theſe next words (<hi>in the power of his might</hi>) which are a very forceable amplificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this former point. Some diſtinguiſh theſe two words, <hi>power</hi> and <hi>might,</hi> as the <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
<hi>might</hi> to God, and <hi>power</hi> to the Saints, &amp; ſo make
<hi>Gods might</hi> the cauſe of <hi>their power,</hi> as if hee had ſaid, bee ſtrong <hi>in that power which yee receiue from the might of God.</hi> But I take this diſtinction heere to bee, Firſt too <hi>curious,</hi> and without good ground. Secondly, <hi>impertinent,</hi> becauſe that which the Apoſtle aimeth at, is to raiſe vp our faith to God, and to ſettle it firme in him, and therefore he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth foorth the power of God, as it is in God himſelfe. Thirdly, <hi>not agreeable</hi> to the phraſe, which is the ſame in this clauſe as in the former, <hi>in the Lord,</hi> &amp; <hi>in the power,</hi> &amp;c. which implieth that the <hi>power</hi> heere ſpoken of, is a power in the Lord, and that as the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelfe is without vs, and aboue vs, ſo is this <hi>power.</hi> The phraſe therfore which the Apoſtle heere vſeth, I take to be an <hi>Hebraiſme,</hi> which ſome for perſpicuitie ſake tranſlate thus, <hi>in his mightie power,</hi> and not vnfitly. This very phraſe is vſed<note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 1. verſ. 19.</note> before,<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3457:18"/> and by moſt tranſlated <hi>his mightie power:</hi> this Hebraiſme
<hi>power of might,</hi> addeth great emphaſis, and implieth, that
<hi>might</hi> by an excellencie and propriety belongeth to Gods power onely; and that all other power in compariſon of it, is meere weakneſſe.</p>
                     <p>The point hence to be noted is this, that</p>

So if a Chriſtian ſhall be hot in faith, and cold in loue; or haue great knowledge, and ſhew little obedience: or bee full of deuotion, and empty of diſcretion, ſurely hee is a monſtrous Chriſtian: the want of ſome graces make the other to bee of no vſe.

It is a point of notorious folly to be deſirous of a thing, and careleſſe in doing that whereby our deſire may bee accompliſhed. Yea, it is a cunning wile of the Diuell in good things to make men ſeparate the meanes from the end, but in euill the end from the meane; as to make men deſire and looke for the good and happie end of righteouſneſſe, and yet bee backward in walking in that way that leadeth thereto: and contrariwiſe, eagerly and ſwiftly to runne in the way of ſinne, and yet not feare the wages of ſinne, and the Iſſue of that courſe.

                     <p>As his names are, ſo is his practiſe, full of many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, full of much craft. It is an infinite taske, a matter of impoſſibility to diſcouer all his cunning ſtraragems and ſubtill deuices. He hath old trickes, which long hee hath vſed, becauſe by long continued experience, he hath found that ſilly men are ſoone deceiued with them, and that the harme of ſome cannot warne others: and yet doth he daily inuent new vpon new, euer ſhifting from one to another: if one will not ſerue, he hath another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in a readineſſe. For diuers perſons, diuers conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſpoſitions, he hath diuers temptations. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee playeth the part of a roaring rauenous Lion: ſomtimes of a craftie fawning Fox: ſometimes appearing in his owne ſhape, ſometimes changing himſelfe into an Angell of light, doing any thing for his aduantage. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle holdeth himſelf cloſe to the metaphor taken from warre, I will alſo follow it, and vnder it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſome few particular ſtratagems, leauing it to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meditation of others to finde out other.</p>
                     <p>1. He can well tell how to marſhall and ſet his armie in array;<note place="margin">Satans ſhifts.</note> he well knoweth how to order his temptations: For firſt he vſeth to make the on-ſet with light skirmiſhes and to begin with ſmall temptation; and then by degrees to follow with greater and mightier forces. Thus came he to<note n="a" place="margin">Gen 3. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Eue;</hi> firſt onely he made a queſtion whether God had forbidden them any of the trees: and then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees he came<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 3. 4.</note> directly to contradict the expreſſe word<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3457:32"/> of God. So when he tempted Chriſt,<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 4. 3. 9.</note> he began with a doubt whether Chriſt were the Sonne of God or no, and laſtly tempted him to monſtrous idolatry.</p>
                     <p>Thus he maketh men careleſſe at the firſt, and his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation lightly to be regarded, till he haue gotten ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage; which when he hath gotten, he will follow with all the might and maine that poſſibly he can.</p>

                     <p>1 By heauenly matters, I meane ſuch as principally reſpect Gods glory (for God being himſelfe <hi>Heauenly,</hi> whatſoeuer tendeth to his Honour, is in that reſpect <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly,</hi>) and then ſuch as reſpect our ſoules ſaluation: for as the things which concerne the temporall good of our body are <hi>earthly,</hi> ſo the things which concerne the eternall good of our ſoules are <hi>Heauenly:</hi> for to Heauen they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, and in Heauen ſhall they enioy their happineſſe.</p>

                     <p>For proofe that they be heauenly things which Satan eſpecially aimes at, obſerue thoſe ſeuerall temptations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scripture: I will giue a taſte of ſome.

An eſpeciall point of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it is duly to conſider our owne folly and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe together with the Diuels craft and power, how in our ſelues (without this Armour) there is no compariſon betwixt vs and our enemies: yea, alſo to conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſinne, and our proneneſſe thereunto; that ſo we may reſolutely ſet our ſelues againſt all temptations, not yeelding any whit at all to any.

                        <hi>the euill day.</hi> By <hi>euill</hi> is meant not ſo much <hi>ſinne</hi> as trouble: and <hi>day</hi> is put for any continuance of time. Some take
<hi>euill day</hi> for the whole time of a mans life, yea for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this World, all which time Satan aſſaulteth vs, but no longer.</p>
                     <p>This I take to be too large an extent of this phraſe, for in the originall there is to each word adioined an article,
<hi>that day, that euill day,</hi> which implieth ſome ſet and diſtinct time; wherefore other reſtraine it to the day of a mans death: but that I take to be too ſtrict a reſtraint: there are many other daies and times wherein vſe is to be made of Armour. Wherefore in the meane betwixt both, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the euill day to bee that time wherein Satan ſhall any way ſet vpon vs and aſſault vs, whether by outward afflictions, or otherwiſe. All his temptations tend to euil; and therefore the time wherein he aſſaulteth vs may well be termed an euill day.</p>

                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is no more knowne before hand then the day of death, or the day of iudgement. Whenſoeuer the Lord letteth looſe the raines to Satan, then is that euill day. That time wherein the Diuell depriued <hi>Iob</hi> of all he had, ſmote his body with ſore boiles, vexed him by his wife and friends, were euill daies to <hi>Iob.</hi>

A Souldier-like courage: for as white-liuered, freſh-water, faint-hearted ſouldiers are ready vpon euery brunt to yeeld and run away: ſo valiant cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious ſouldiers ſtand ſtoutly againſt euery brunt; and will rather ſtand and die, then ſtirre and yeeld.</p>

                     <p>3 A watchfulneſſe oppoſed to luskiſhneſſe and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe: an heauy headed, idle, luskiſh ſouldier, is euer ready to lie downe, like a tired Oxe or Horſe; but a wiſe watchfull ſouldier ſtandeth to receiue his enemy when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he maketh any aſſault.</p>
                     <p>4 Perſeuerance with armour ſtill on the backe: faint-hearted weake ſouldiers being loth long to beare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of their armour, will oft put it on and off: when a skirmiſh is paſt, off goes the armour, and ſo is laid aſide till they be forced againe to put it on: but old well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſouldiers ſtand ſtill with their armour, looking for a freſh aſſault, and for more conflicts.</p>

In this fight Chriſt eſpecially aimed to defend himſelfe, and to repel his aduerſaries weapons. Therfore all his anſwers are framed directly according to Satans obiections.

                     <p>SOme apply the <hi>Truth</hi> here mentioned, to doctrine and religion, as if only the ſoundnes of it were meant: others reſtraine it to the vprightneſſe and ſincerity of our hearts and affections: others vnderſtand it of the truth of our words and ſpeeches: and others expound it of the purity and innocency of our practiſe and carriage.</p>

                     <p>1 Truth of iudgement is the ground of all the reſt:<note place="margin">Truth in iudgement the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the reſt.</note> for though our hearts be neuer ſo ſincere, our ſpeeches neuer ſo true, our actions neuer ſo plaine, yet if in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we be miſled, all is but as ſtraw and ſtubble, which when it commeth to the fire of tryall, will ſoone be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. It ſeemeth that before <hi>Paul</hi> was inſtructed in the truth of the Goſpel, he had a kind of truth in his heart, for he<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 22. 3.</note>

                        <hi>he thought in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he ought</hi> to doe what he did: he had not a double heart, a double tongue; he pretended not what he neuer intended; yet becauſe he wanted truth in iudgement, all was but<note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> droſſe, and loſſe vnto him.</p>

                     <p>3 But what if a man which profeſſeth the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">Where truth of heart is, there is truth of ſpeech and action.</note> thinke he hath a ſingle heart, and yet bee giuen to lying, and to deale deceitfully? Surely hee diſgraceth<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3457:74"/> his profeſſion, and giueth iuſt cauſe of ſuſpition, that hee hath no honeſt heart: for the heart is as a fountaine. Out of the abundance of the heart, proceed a mans words and actions: yea the heart is as a Queene, and hath a command of a mans tongue, and of al his outward parts: ſo that if there be truth in it, there will be truth in all the other parts: ſincerity in the heart will keepe the tongue from lying, and the whole carriage of a man from diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation and deceit.

In this ſence this metaphor is<note n="f" place="margin">1 King. 18. 46</note> oft vſed,<note place="margin">2 King 4, 29.</note> and therby Gods people were taught<note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 12. 11.</note> to remoue all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their Chriſtian courſe and iourney,<note place="margin">Luke 12. 35.</note> and to be as well prepared as they could be to performe the worke of the Lord. In the latter ſence the metaphor is taken from ſouldiers, who are wont to knit their Armour cloſe and faſt vnto them, and ſo tye their loynes hard, partly to keepe their Armour from looſing and ſhaking, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keepe their body ſteddy. <note n="h" place="margin">Iob. 38, 3. &amp; 40. 2.</note>In this ſence the Lord<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3457:74"/> ſaid to <hi>Iob;</hi>

                     <p>Here it is to be taken in this latter ſence, and ſignifieth a ſouldier-like girding of the loines: for which purpoſe, they who weare armour, vſe to haue a ſtrong faire girdle, commonly called a <hi>belt,</hi> whereby they knit faſt together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cloſe vnto their middle the vpper and lower peeces of their armour, as their breſt-plate, and their taſſets and cuſhes. Theſe belts as they were ſtrong, ſo they were ſet with ſtuddes, being faire and large. There is a double vſe of them: one to keepe the ſeuerall peeces of armour faſt and cloſe together, and to hold the loines of a man firme, and ſteddy, that he might be able to ſtand the ſurer, and hold out the longer. The other to couer the ioints of the armour, that they might not be ſeene. The firſt vſe was for ſtrength: the ſecond for ornament.</p>

                     <p>1. Becauſe the phraſe which the Apoſtle vſeth is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfull and ambiguous, there are many diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant opinions about that which is meant thereby.</p>
                     <p>Among thoſe many, there are two which come neereſt to the point, and are implied vnder the deſcription of this grace, though neither of them (as I take it) be the grace it ſelfe. One is <hi>Knowledge of<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3457:92"/> the Goſpell,</hi> the other is <hi>Peace of Conſcience.</hi> The former is implied vnder this word
<hi>Goſpell,</hi> (for without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpell the ſoule cannot be ſetled. The Goſpell vnto him which knowes it not, is no Goſpel, of no vſe at all.) The other is implied vnder this word
<hi>Peace,</hi> whereby is meant that <hi>Peace of Conſcience,</hi> which by the knowledge of the Goſpell is wrought in vs. But the <hi>Preparation</hi> here ſpoken of, is another grace diſtinct from both theſe; euen an effect which followeth from them both. Wherefore as the cauſes of a thing are not the thing it ſelfe, ſo neither of thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeuerally conſidered in it ſelfe, is the diſtinct peece of Armour here meant. The Syriach Tranſlator well cleareth the meaning of the Apoſtle, who thus turneth it;

<hi>Goſpell of Peace,</hi> to goe on to God thorow all difficulties. Now the very grace it ſelfe which thus ſetleth the ſoule, I take to bee <hi>Patience:</hi> for it is without all doubt, the drift</p>
                     <p>1. Some take the <hi>preparation of the Goſpell</hi> to bee a readineſſe to preach the Goſpell, thinking that the Apoſtle alludeth to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Jſaiah; How beautifull are the feete of him that declareth peace.</hi> Iſa. 52. 7.</p>

                     <head>§. 5. Of that Peace which the Goſpel cauſeth.</head>
                     <p>THe Peace heere ſpoken of,<note place="margin">2 What peace is here meant</note> is our reconciliation with God. In the beginning God made man after his owne Image, by vertue whereof, there was a ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and concord betwixt God and man; God hauing reuealed vnto man what was his good will, pleaſing and acceptable vnto him; man being both able, and alſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to doe that which was acceptable to God. But long this Peace did not laſt: it was ſoone broken, and that wholly, and onely through mans default. For man wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly ſinned againſt his Creator, and thereby iuſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked his wrath: thus came enmity betwixt God and man. Such a breach was made by mans rebellion, that all creatures in Heauen and earth were not able to make it vp. Chriſt therefore, the eternall, true, naturall, proper, onely begotten Sonne of God, tooke vpon him to be a Mediator betwixt God and man. Hee ſatisfied his Fathers Iuſtice, pacified his wrath, procured his fauour towards man, whereby God was moued to offer recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation vnto man;<note place="margin">Deus appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur pacis quia per Chriſtum ei reconciliati ſumus, qui eſt pax noſtra, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eron. Hedib. quaeſt. 12.</note> withall he gaue vnto man his ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, to breed faith in him, that thereby man might receiue and embrace this reconciliation. In this reſpect God is called the <hi>God of Peace</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20.) and Chriſt
<hi>our Peace,</hi> (<hi>chap.</hi> 2. 14.) <hi>Prince of Peace</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6.) And God is ſaid <hi>in Chriſt to reconcile the world vnto himſelfe,</hi>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:3457:95"/> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19.) Thus through the mediation of Chriſt, God offering, and man accepting reconciliation, a moſt perfect and inuiolable peace is made betwixt them, and this is the peace here meant. As fruits of this peace there flow from it remiſſion of ſinnes, quietneſſe and comfort of conſcience, ioy of heart, willingneſſe and ability to doe that which is pleaſing vnto God, freedome from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſinne, from the power of the Diuell, from the euill of all croſſes, from the ſting of death, and of the graue, and from the feare and fire of Hell.</p>

                     <p>1 The ſubiect matter of this glad tidings, is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Peace and reconciliation betwixt God and man. The Goſpel firſt declared, and ſtill continueth to publiſh the ſame: neither the Law, nor any humane writings can doe this: therefore ſo ſoone as<note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 2. 10, 11</note> one Angel had declared this glad tidings, an whole troope of heauenly ſouldiers cryed out<note n="g" place="margin">14.</note>

                     <p>Many and ſundry were the troubles, inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by open enemies, and deceitfull friends, on Sea and land, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> went thorow, and that with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible courage and reſolution: the cauſe of all is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be that<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 8 31, 32, &amp;c.</note> knowledge which he had of Gods loue to him, and of his reconciliation with God.

                     <p>THat wee may the better apply this Apoſtolicall dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as before in generall wee ſhewed the neceſſity of patience, ſo here in particular we will ſhew how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is that patience haue this perfect worke.</p>
                     <p>This will appeare by the kinds of croſſes whereunto we are ſubiect.</p>
                     <p>1 They are not ſcar-crowes, troubles in ſhew and appearance onely, but ſuch as pierce both body and ſoule, and make the ſtoureſt to ſtoupe and ſhrinke. Therefore counterfeite patience will ſtand vs in no ſteed.</p>
                     <p>2 The number of trials whereunto wee ſhall bee brought, is vncertaine: one calamity vpon another (as waues) may fall vpon vs:<note n="k" place="margin">Iob. 1. 16, 17. 18.</note> that which is written of <hi>Iob,</hi> how one meſſenger followed another, all bringing dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full newes, ſheweth what may befall any of vs. Now ſuppoſe wee ſhould as patiently beare ſome, as <hi>Iob,</hi> but<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3457:102"/> yet taint vnder the burden of others; where is the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of that former patience? Some that haue endured im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, baniſhment, and ſuch like trials, yea who haue beene ready to endure ſword and fire in time of perſecution, haue beene diſcouraged and turned out of their good courſe by reproch, and diſgrace, in time of peace: other that can patiently paſſe ouer publicke trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, are ſo diſquieted with priuate loſſes, and croſſes at home in their families, that they are made vnfit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any Chriſtian duty to God, or man. Other that can well endure paine of body, ſickeneſſe and ſuch like croſſes, cannot beare vexation of mind, or diſturbance of their paſſion.</p>
                     <p>3 It is alſo vncertaine how long we ſhall be ſubiect to tryals, becauſe the continuance of our life is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.

The apprehenſion of Gods wrath, and feare of hell fire, may worke ſome ſorrow for ſinne committed; yea alſo it may reſtraine a man from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting many ſinnes, at leaſt for a time: but that which altereth the naturall diſpoſition of the heart, which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and reformeth it, is Faith in the remiſſion of ſinne:

                     <p>True Chriſtian loue alſo is a reflection of Gods loue to man: till a man feele Gods loue to warme his heart, and to ſet it on fire, he can loue neither God nor man.

                     <p>This extent of a good conſcience reſpecteth rather the integrity of the heart, then the perfection of the work: for perfection of the worke is a full and perfect fulfilling of all the commandements of God, whereunto none can attaine in this world.</p>
                     <p>Integrity of heart is a true and equall endeauour to performe them all, and that though they ſeeme neuer ſo contrary to our corrupt humor: for herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt Faith vnfeined and hypocriticall. The luſts of an hypocrite rule him, &amp; preuaile ouer his Faith:
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Mar. 6. 17, &amp;c.</note> in ſuch things as croſſe not his luſts, he can be content to obey, but no further: loath he is to try himſelfe: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth not that any other ſhould try him.</p>

                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:3457:141"/> But vnfeined Faith controuleth all naturall conceits and worldly deſires: it maketh both reaſon and will to yeeld to Gods word and will: and ſo maketh a man ready to doe whatſoeuer hee knoweth to be Gods will: yea, it breedeth an holy iealouſie of himſelfe (as<note n="a" place="margin">Iob 1. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Iob</hi> had of his children,) ſo as he is very carefull in examining his heart and wayes, and willing that others ſhould trie him, yea, deſirous that God would ſift him, and diſcouer ſuch hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſinnes and corruptions as himſelfe cannot find out. Hence it followeth, that</p>
                     <p>1 For ſinnes paſt, which by his owne, or other mens, or the Lords meanes are found out and diſcouered, he is truly humbled, and giueth no reſt to his ſoule till he haue ſome aſſurance of pardon, as<note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 13.</note>

                     <p>2 FOr the ſecond, the ſeuerall conditions and qualities of the perſons to whom ſeuerall promiſes are made, are exceeding many. Sometimes they are made to Faith, ſometimes to obedience, ſometimes to vprightneſſe, to cheerefulneſſe, to conſtancy, to loue, to feare; to ſuch as mourne, hunger, are heauy laden; to ſuch as pray, heare Gods Word, keepe his Commandements; to the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, widowes, captiues, poore, ſicke, &amp;c. It is not poſſible, neither yet is it needfull that I ſhould reckon vp all: they are here and there to be found throughout the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>The vſes of Faith in reſpect of the perſons to whom the promiſes are made, are theſe.</p>
                     <p>1 To aſſure vs that we are they to whom they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
                     <p>2 To make vs apply them to thoſe ſeuerall qualities which we find in our ſelues, as if we hunger, to beleeue we ſhall be ſatisfied; if we mourne, that we ſhall be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo in the reſt.</p>

<hi>That a man ſhould take a ſhield to quench fire:</hi> A ſhield is rather to keepe off a blow.

                     <p>For the metaphor, a <hi>Dart</hi> is a kinde of weapon that is flung, ſlung, or ſhot at a man farre off, which if it hit him, will deepely pierce him, and ſorely gall him.

If by prayer they keepe their hearts aloft, they are the more free from being intangled by Satan. Faithfull prayer, and purpoſe to ſin, cannot ſtand together.

By prayer haue the Saints a free acceſſe vnto the glorious throne of Gods grace: yea they haue a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acquaintance with him. It is a great prerogatiue, that God in his Word vouchſafeth to ſpeake to man; but not comparable to this, that man ſhould talke with God. God by his Word ſpeaketh to all, euen to the wicked and rebellious, but none but Saints by Prayer ſpeake to him: (the Prayer of the wicked is no Prayer, but meere lip-labour.) We know that it implyeth much more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity for an inferiour freely to ſpeake to his ſuperior,<note place="margin">Eſther 5. 2.</note> then a ſuperior to his inferior. <hi>Eſther</hi> though a Queene, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a great fauour, that ſhe was louingly and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted, when ſhe approached into the preſence of a mortall Monarch. Now conſider how infinitely farre greater the diuine Maieſty is, then any humane can be, and this will ſhew how high a dignity it is to haue a free acceſſe vnto his glorious preſence; eſpecially if withall we conſider how full of grace and goodneſſe he is to all that come before him. The glorious Angels doe admire the Saints, in regard of this honour vouchfafed vnto them.</p>

                     <p>Things not abſolutely promiſed they pray for with ſubiection vnto Gods will and wiſdome. For there are<pb n="370" facs="tcp:3457:198"/> many things which are good in their kinde, yet ſo farre make more or leſſe to Gods glory and mans good, as it pleaſeth God by his wiſe prouidence to diſpoſe them. For example, God hath made an abſolute promiſe of the perpetuall continuance of the Church, but not of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall outward flouriſhing eſtate thereof; for hee can turne the perſecution of his Church to the encreaſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">Sanguis Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrum ſemen Eccleſiae.</note> and ſo gaine honour to himſelfe, and bring good vnto his people thereby. Thus for the time of accompliſhing Gods promiſes, ſometimes a long date, ſometimes a ſhort date, may moſt make to his glory: and for the meanes, ſometimes one kind of meanes, ſometimes another, with other like circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>In all theſe, wee muſt in our Prayers either expreſſe, or reſerue in our minds ſome ſecret limitations; as theſe, If God ſee it to be good; if his good pleaſure be ſuch; if it may ſtand with his glory, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>HEre we ſee what abundant matter of thankſgiuing is offered vnto vs. If we ſhould ſpend our whole time (as the triumphant Church in heauen doth) in lauding &amp; praiſing God, wee could not want matter, conſidering that ALL THINGS are matter of thankſgiuing.</p>
                     <p>If I ſhould ſay we haue more matter of thankſgiuing then of petition,<note place="margin">More matter of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing then of petition.</note> I ſhould not ſpeake amiſſe: for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which any of Gods children, any of thoſe who truly beleeue in Chriſt, haue receiued already, are much more, and farre greater then the things which they want. God hath long ſince elected and choſen them to bee veſſels of mercy &amp; glory: when he created man, as he made man moſt happy, according to the image of God, ſo before he made man he created all things needefull for him, that ſo he might be deſtitute of no good thing: for he made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and the whole hoaſt thereof, earth and all the fruites of it, yea the aire and water and all creatures in them; in a word God made all things that were made, for the good of man. The price of mans redemption is already paid: All true beleeuers are reconciled to God, adopted to bee his children, made actuall members of Chriſts body, effectually called, and taken into the kingdome of grace, being perfectly iuſtified euen in Gods ſight by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe<pb n="410" facs="tcp:3457:218"/> of Chriſt Ieſus. What are the ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which wee want, that may bee comparable to theſe which we haue receiued?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. We haue not receiued freedome from, and full victory ouer all ſinne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How farre we are freed from ſinne.</note> Sinne hath receiued a deadly wound: though it aſſaile vs, yet ſhall it not get conqueſt ouer vs. Beſides the guilt &amp; puniſhment of thoſe very ſins, which yet we are ſubiect vnto, ſhall not be laid vpon vs: they are cleane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and in that reſpect we fully acquitted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. Wee want many good and comfortable graces, and faile in the meaſure of thoſe we haue: our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is not perfect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How far ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</note> All the faithfull haue al ſuch graces as are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary vnto ſaluation, actually wrought in them. As a childe borne of a woman hath all the parts of ſoule and body, ſo he that is borne againe of God hath al the parts of a new man. No Saint wanteth any grace that may hinder his ſaluation, though he ſhould inſtantly die. As for that meaſure which ſome want, it is not ſo great as can iuſtly impeach the truth of grace: that grace which they haue is true, though it may bee weake: and their ſanctification is ſound, though imperfect. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of ſanctification is not ſo great and powerfull a worke, as the firſt beginning of it. The moſt effectuall &amp; powerfull worke of Gods ſpirit in the faithfull, is their very new birth, the firſt act of their conuerſion. For when a ſinner is firſt conuerted, he is a new created: of nothing (I ſpeake in regard of of our ſpirituall being) he is made ſomething: of a man dead in ſin, he is quickned, &amp; hath ſpiritual life put into him. Now the growth in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, is but a proceeding from one degree to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame kinde: yea the very perfection of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication<pb n="411" facs="tcp:3457:218"/> is but an attaining to the higheſt ſtep &amp; degree of that which was begun before. It is therfore a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull worke to beget a ſinner to God, and to worke his firſt conuerſion, then after he is regenerate and conuerted to perfect that good worke which is begunne. Whence it followeth that faithfull Saints haue more matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing for the grace they haue receiued, then of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the grace they want.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Why many Saints want outward things.</note> 1. God ſeeth it to bee good for them to want ſuch neceſſaries.</p>
                     <p>2 Inſteed of theſe outward neceſſaries, they haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward graces which are much more valuable &amp; profitable as inſteed of of outward refreſhing of the body, they haue inward comfort of the ſoule: inſteed of outward<pb n="413" facs="tcp:3457:219"/> ornaments of the body, inward graces of the ſpirit: wanting outward eaſe, they haue ſweet peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: wanting plenty, they haue contentment: In a word, God depriueth his children of no outward thing, but he ſupplieth the want of it with ſome ſpirituall recompence: their want therefore cauſeth matter of thankſgiuing.</p>
                     <p>As all the Saints haue receiued more good things then they want,<note place="margin">Saints are freed from more euils then ſhal euer fal vpon them againe.</note> ſo alſo vndoubtedly are they freed from more euils then iuſtly they can feare to fall vpon them. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in Chriſt, they are freed from the feare of hell, from the curſe of the Law, from the wrath of God, from the ſting of death, from the victory of the graue, from the power of him that hath the power of death, the diuel; from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, from the rule and dominion of ſinne, and from infinitely more, both ſpirituall, and bodily euils.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> Many Saints are ſubiect both to many ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall euils, (as trouble of minde, doubt of Gods fauour, ſnares of the Diuell, fallings into ſinne, with the like,) and alſo to many temporall diſtreſſes, as paine, ſickneſſe, captiuity, impriſonment, ignominy, penury, &amp;c.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This may bee as feruent as if it were vttered. For in regard of the ardency of <hi>Moſes</hi> mentall praier, God ſaith,
<hi>Why crieſt thou vnto me?</hi> And <hi>Annah</hi> ſaith, <hi>She powred out her ſoule before the Lord.</hi> This oftentimes cauſeth the eies and hands to be lift vp, or caſt downe, and forceth ſuch outward ſignes.</p>
                     <p>This is vſed becauſe God is a ſearcher of the hearts,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> and knoweth the ſecrets thereof, and needeth not words to haue a mans thoughts made knowne to him, as wee ſhewed<note n="*" place="margin">§. 4. and 6. <hi>Vſe.</hi>

                     <p>3 Becauſe words doe not onely declare, but alſo ſtir vp and increaſe the affection of the heart. For as fire hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a chimney, and the reflexion of heat which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the chimney maketh the fire hotter, ſo the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the heart prouoketh words, and words make the heart more ardent and earneſt.</p>
                     <p>4 Words are an eſpeciall meanes to keepe the minde in praier from wandering, and to hold it cloſe to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

So moderate care concerning the buſineſſe &amp; affairs of this world are lawfull and needful, yet when we goe to prayer, they muſt be laid aſide, and our ſoules emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of them. For they are as heauy burdens, and clogs which will hold downe our hearts, and keepe them from flying vp into heauen. Now note the counſell of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,

                     <p>1<note n="i" place="margin">Num. 23. 24.</note> God preſcribed a ſet forme of bleſſing for the Prieſts conſtantly to vſe. The 92. Pſalme, which is a Pſalme of praiſe, was preſcribed <hi>a ſong for the Sabbath day:</hi> and 102. Pſalme preſcribeth <hi>a prayer for the afflicted when he is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, and powreth out his complaint before the Lord.</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">2 Chr. 20. 21.</note> The 136. <hi>Pſalme</hi> was ſung after <hi>Dauids</hi> time.<note n="b" place="margin">and 29. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>Hezekiah the King, and the Princes commanded the Leuites to praiſe the Lord with the words of Dauid, and of Aſaph the Seer.</hi> If a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed forme of praiſe may be vſed, then alſo of prayer: for there is the ſame reaſon of both.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Chriſt himſelfe preſcribed an excellent forme of prayer which hath been vſed in all ages of the Church ſince this time, and is by an excellency called <hi>the Lords Prayer.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> obſerues a ſet forme of bleſſing in the beginning and end of his Epiſtles. Thus we ſee preſcribed prayer warranted by Gods word.</p>
                     <p>2 Many weake ones who haue good affections, but want inuention, vtterance, and ſuch like parts, are much helped by preſcribed formes: for when they reade or heare words fitting their wants and occaſions, their hearts can well goe with their words, yet can they not inuent fit words.</p>
                     <p>3 Preſcribed formes of prayer in the publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe is a good meanes to maintaine vniformity in ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Churches.</p>

                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> The ſpirit is ſtinted hereby: neither can a man vtter that which the ſpirit moueth him vnto, when hee hath a ſet forme preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſpirit in him which prayeth by a ſet forme, is no more ſtinted, then the ſpirit is ſtinted in thoſe which heare another pray: for to them which heare others, words are preſcribed. To the hearers it is all one whether hee that prayeth vſeth a preſcribed forme, or conceiue, and inuent his prayer, for they goe along in their hearts with his words.</p>
                     <p>They who ſimply and altogether condemne preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed prayer, doe thinke too childiſhly of God, and deale too iniuriouſly with Gods little ones. They conceit God to be affected with variety, and make the power of praier to conſiſt in copie of words, and nouelty of matter, which is many times an hinderance to true deuotion: for while the minde is too much occupied in inuention, the heart cannot be ſo free to deuotion, as otherwiſe it might bee. Prayer is not like a noſe-gay, which is no longer ſweete then the flowers are new and freſh: For the ſweete ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of prayer conſiſteth in the ſincerity of heart, and ardency of affection, whereby alſo the power of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is manifeſted.</p>
                     <p>2 The iniury which is done to Gods little ones is this, that they ſeek to depriue them of an eſpecial help, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their weakeneſſe might be ſupported, yea to hinder them of the benifit of prayer. For many are not able to conceiue a prayer of themſelues, yet if they finde a forme anſwerable to their occaſions, they can pray heartily and earneſtly.</p>
                     <p>Thus wee ſee that preſcribed prayer is not onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but alſo needful. So far forth as we finde it an helpe to deuotion, we may vſe it: but yet wee may not alwaies<pb n="429" facs="tcp:3457:227"/> tie our ſelues vnto it: to ſay the leaſt, they are very weake Chriſtians that cannot pray without a preſcribed forme.</p>
                     <p>Now it is a ſhame for any Chriſtian to be a weake one all the dayes of his life: it is required at our hands to grow in knowledge, iudgement, diſcretion, faith, and other like graces.</p>

                     <p>IF the weakeſt Chriſtians doe but carefully obſerue the order that others vſe, and withall take notice of their owne ſinnes in particular, of their particular wants, and of the particular bleſſings which God beſtoweth on them, they may with vſe and practiſe come to conceiue a good Prayer. And when once in any competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they can pray for themſelues, by degrees they come to pray for others alſo. But many are too idle and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh in making triall: they will not offer to make experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the gift of Gods Spirit: but rather vtterly quench it; as a man may doe, and too many ſo doe, by tying themſelues too much to ſet formes.</p>
                     <p>Though publike leiturgies for vniformity ſake are to be conſtantly vſed in ſet formes (prouided that there be ſeuerall prayers fit for diuers, yea, for all publike occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo neere as may be) yet it is not ſo meete for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons alwayes to tie themſelues to one ſet forme.

                     <p>The former hee doth in preaching the Word and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the Sacraments. For <hi>God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)

                     <p>1 That the food which in ſuch a caſe is taken, be not delicate, but rather courſe; ſo it be agreeable to his nature that taketh it.</p>
                     <p>2 That it be not taken vnto fulneſſe, but rather ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, as the perſon which faſteth may feele the want of foode; ſo as no more then needs muſt for the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health and ſtrength is to be taken.</p>
                     <p>Such a Faſt as this,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 3.</note> was that which <hi>Daniel</hi> kept for three weekes; and with the forenamed prouiſoes was it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
                     <p>2 Among the perſons that keepe a Faſt, ſome may be of a good &amp; ſtrong conſtitution, and able without weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their bodies to abſtaine from all ſuſtenance a day or two: theſe ought altogether to abſtaine, though they feele ſome want of foode. Others are ſo weake, as if their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks be cleane empty of all food, they are vnfit for any good duty: yea, if long they continue empty, they may be ſo weakened as hardly they will recouer their ſtrength againe.

                     <p>TO know the right and due continuance of a faſt, it is needfull to put difference betwixt a faſt <hi>in whole,</hi> and
<hi>in part.</hi> A faſt <hi>in whole</hi> is ſuch a faſt as wee haue deſcribed, wherein there is an vtter abſtinence (except in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity) from refreſhing the body with any food at all. A faſt <hi>in part,</hi> is when a man taketh ſome nouriſhment in the daies of his faſt:<note place="margin">What is a faſt in part.</note> and this is when there is occaſion of faſting longer then a man is able to forbeare all manner of ſuſtenance: for example a man of great vſe, whoſe<pb n="457" facs="tcp:3457:241"/> death is a very great loſſe, is ſtrucken with a dangerous ſickneſſe, and lieth betwixt hope and feare ſome weeke or more: their iſſue being vnknowne, his friends earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous of his life, continue to faſt and pray euery day, till they ſee what iſſue the Lord will giue: now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the long continuance of ſuch a faſt, euery day they take one meale to preſerue the ſtrength of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The like faſt may bee vſed when a City is beſieged, and the inhabitants incloſed by their enemies on euery ſide. Now becauſe ſuch a faſt may be long indured, and the occaſion thereof may bee longer or ſhorter, no ſet time can be ſet for the continuance of it, but onely that it bee ordered according to the occaſion that God giueth.</p>
                     <p>As for the other more true and proper Faſt, a Faſt <hi>in whole,</hi> which was deſcribed *<note place="margin">§. 102. &amp; 103.</note> before, and whereof we doe now eſpecially ſpeake; a whole naturall day is a fitte time for the continuance of it.<note place="margin">A naturall da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In the Law the day of a faſt is called a Sabbath:<note place="margin">Leu. 16. 31.</note> the time of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath muſt therefore bee allotted vnto it: now a Sabbath containeth the ſeuenth part of a weeke, which is foure and twenty houres.

                     <p>In the ſpace of foure and twenty houres onely one ordinary meale is forborne, (the Faſt beginning at the end of one meale, and when the Faſt is ended, another meale being taken:) but leſſe then one meale in a Faſt cannot be forborne. This therefore is the ſhorteſt time, which yet will appeare to be long enough, if a Faſt be rightly and duly obſerued. For the laſt meale which is<pb n="458" facs="tcp:3457:242"/> taken before a Faſt, ought to be a very moderate &amp; ſpare meale; ſo moderate, as ſo ſoone as it is taken, wee may without heauineſſe, drowſineſſe, and dulneſſe, ſet ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to examination, meditation, conference, reading, prayer, and ſuch like religious exerciſes in priuate, as a preparation vnto the more ſolemne exerciſes to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a Faſt. Moſt meet it is that this preparation be in the euening, and the Faſt then to beginne. <hi>From euen to euen</hi> (ſaith the Law) <hi>ſhall ye celebrate your Sabbath:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Leu. 23. 32.</note> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Faſt. So as immediatly after a ſpare ſupper, all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile workes of our calling laide aſide, the forenamed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is to beginne, and continue ſo long as conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wee can ſit vp, euen longer and later then on other daies we vſe to goe to bed. Then after ſome ſleepe is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in the next morning riſing ſooner then ordinarily we vſe to doe, after ſome renewing of our preparation, the reſt of the time euen till the foure &amp; twenty houres from the beginning of our euening preparation, be ended, is to be ſpent in the ſolemne exerciſes of Religion appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a Faſt. If a Faſt be continued, as hath been before ſet downe, two whole dayes, it is as much as our weake nature can wel endure, without impairing the health and ſtrength of our body.</p>

                     <p>AS the occaſions of faſting and vowing are publike or priuate, ſo muſt they bee done publikly or priuately. Becauſe there was a publike iudgement on the land,<note n="d" place="margin">Ioel. 2. 14.</note>

                     <p>A publike faſt or vow muſt bee appointed by publike authority (as were all the publike faſts and vowes recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and commended in the Scripture) and performed by all that are vnder their authority, &amp; in their dominion who command it. When <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> proclaimed a publike faſt, it is noted that <hi>they came out of all the Cities of Iudah:</hi> and when <hi>Ioſiah</hi> made a publike vow and Couenant with the Lord: <hi>He cauſed all that were found in Iudah, and Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamine to ſtand to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Miniſters of the word, ought to put the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in minde of theſe extraordinary exerciſes, when there is occaſion (as <hi>Ioel</hi> did) The Magiſtrate ought to appoint them: and Magiſtrates, Miniſters, People, and all obſerue them: and for the better obſeruing thereof, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together in publike places, and vſe the publike Miniſtery of the word: for which wee haue a notable pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the time of <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> for when the people were all aſſembled together, with faſting to make a ſolemne vowe:<note place="margin">Neh. 9 3.</note> the <hi>Leuites read in the book of the Law of the Lord their God, one fourth part of the day, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fourth part of the day they confeſſed, and worſhipped the Lord their God.</hi> Theſe two fourth parts, were all the time that paſſed betwixt the morning and euening Sacrifice, namely from nine to three.</p>
                     <p>As for priuate faſts &amp; vowes if they be performed in a family, the Maſter thereof who is a King, Prieſt, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in his owne houſe, hath the ordering therof.

                     <p>VVEighty motiues there be to ſtirre vs vp to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Prayer.</p>
                     <p>1 It ſheweth that we goe along with Gods good gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding prouidence: that we obſerue Gods iudgements, and are moued with them, and take notice of his bleſſings, and are accordingly affected: that as the iudgements of God are greater, ſo our ſupplication and humiliation more extraordinary: as his bleſſings more needefull and ſcanty, ſo our petitions more earneſt and feruent: and as they are more excellent and plentifull, ſo our thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more ſolemne. They who content themſelues with their ordinary manner of praying, (like mil-horſes going round in their vſuall tracke) and neuer take any occaſion of extraordinary prayer, but thinke all is well, becauſe they are not <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> which neuer call vpon God, plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcouer how little they regard Gods dealing with them. If they did, as God dealt extraordinarily with them, ſo would they extraordinarily carry themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
                     <p>2 Extraordinary prayer is extraordinarily powerfull and effectuall, either for preuenting and remouing great iudgements, or for obtaining and recouering ſingular bleſſings, as we haue<note n="*" place="margin">§. 99.</note> before ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>3 It is an extraordinary honour done vnto God: the more we ſtoop vnder his iudgements, and the more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we account his bleſſings and fauours, the more we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God.</p>

 and the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall occaſions of extraordinary prayer from time to time affoorded vnto vs, wee cannot but condemne our ſelues for neglect of this duty, and extraordinarily hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelues, euen becauſe wee haue not extraordinarily prayed, as iuſt occaſion hath oftentimes beene giuen vnto vs. How many iudgements hath God laid vpon vs yeere after yeere? ſtrange ſickneſſes, extraordinary fiers, froſts, inundations of waters, droughts when raine was neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, tempeſtuous and rainy weather, when calme and faire weather would haue beene very acceptable, with the like. Among other publike iudgements, I cannot let paſſe that ſore, heauy, grieuous ſtroke, whereby the life of that worthy admirable Prince was taken away, vpon the ſixt of <hi>Nouember</hi> 1612. Had extraordinary prayer in time been vſed, no doubt but many of theſe iudgements might haue beene preuented. Would there be ſo many inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, idle, careleſſe, corrupt Miniſters, as are in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? or would the diligence and paines of many learned and faithfull Miniſters be ſo fruitleſſe as they are, if extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary prayer were more vſed? What may be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that many marriages, offices, callings, and the like matters of moment are ſo vnproſperous? that many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians long lie vnder ſore and grieuous temptations and croſſes, that other iudgements are inflicted vpon their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, their children, yea, and their owne perſons, and many needfull bleſſings denied?

The ſecond at the firſt houre, becauſe then hee was led to <hi>Pilat.</hi> The third at the third houre, becauſe then he was mocked. The fourth at the ſixt houre: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then he was crucified. The fift at the ninth houre, becauſe then he gaue vp the Ghoſt. The ſixt in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe then hee was taken from the Croſſe. The ſeuenth in the completory, becauſe then he was buried. Theſe reaſons are ſuperſtitious, no good grounds. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houres wee may finde other things done to Chriſt, as his bringing to <hi>Annas,</hi> to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, ſcourging, &amp;c. and ſo make euery houre a cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall houre for prayer. Wee haue better reaſons, as I ſhewed<note n="*" place="margin">§. 120.</note> before.</p>
                     <p>2 They place Religion in the very obſeruing of ſet times.<note place="margin">2. Religion is placed in them.</note> We doe not ſo: for we ſet not the ſame continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for all, ſome may hold out an houre, ſame halfe, ſome but a quarter, ſome longer, ſome ſhorter. Neither doe we tye all to the ſame houre. A ſtrong able perſon that vſeth to riſe betimes, may pray at three or foure, or fiue of the clock in the morning, as ſoone as heriſeth.

                     <p>3 They content themſelues with ſaying ouer ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers as may bee in ſuch a ſet time,<note place="margin">3. They are ſtinted with time.</note> though their<pb n="477" facs="tcp:3457:251"/> hearts goe not with one word: for their prayers being in lattin, many cannot vnderſtand what they pray. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſuch prayers meere lip-labour. Neither doe wee meaſure our prayers by a ſet time, but wee meaſure our time by our deuotion and affection in prayer.</p>
                     <p>4 They appropriate their canonicall houres to eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall perſons onely,<note place="margin">4 They are appropriated to certaine perſons.</note> as Prieſts, Munks, Nunnes, &amp;c.

                     <p>5 Some of their houres,<note place="margin">5 They are vnſeaſonable.</note> namely, at mid-night, are very vnſeaſonable to be ordinarily and daily performed: they are neither meet for the health of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (that being the moſt ſeaſonable time to reſt in) nor for the worſhippe of God, which muſt needes at that time bee drouſily performed.

                     <p>6 Their houres are ſo many,<note place="margin">6 Too much time is ſpent in them.</note> that other neceſſary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes muſt needs be omitted: they affoord not time enough for Miniſters to ſtudy, and performe other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall functions belonging to their place. Our times are ſuch as may well bee affoorded to prayer, by thoſe that haue the moſt and greateſt imployments.</p>
                     <p>7 They are ſo ſuperſtitious on the one ſide in keeping their number and ſtinted houres,<note place="margin">7 Too great ſtrictneſſe in fulfilling the time.</note> and on the other ſide ſo careleſſe in the due time, that they giue tollerations to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all the ſeuen houres in one part of the day, and none in the other part.

                     <p>2 In that they conceit hee ſhall come in the night, which is vncertaine, for he may come as well in the day time for ough any man knoweth. Indeed Chriſt ſpeaking of his comming to iudgement, ſaith,<note n="i" place="margin">Luke 17. 34.</note> in that night: but this word <hi>Night</hi> is taken ſenecdochically for day or night, a part for the whole:<note n="k" place="margin">&amp; v. 20.</note> a little before he calleth it the <hi>day,</hi> when the ſonne of man ſhall be reuealed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, that when he commeth, men ſhall be eating, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, buying, ſelling, planting, building, which are works of the day time. Yet I will not deny but that he may come in the night time.</p>
                     <p>3 In that they imagine that <hi>they</hi> which <hi>are</hi> aſleepe<pb n="491" facs="tcp:3457:258"/> when Chriſt commeth, cannot be well prepared to meet him. Whereas in truth a man that hath repented him of his ſinnes, and with faithful prayer commendeth himſelfe to God, and ſo goeth to ſleep, is as fit in his ſleepe to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked and taken vp to iudgement, as if he were in the act of prayer.</p>
                     <p>4 In that they interpret that precept of Chriſt,<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 24. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>wake,</hi> of bodily waking: and <hi>watching</hi> here in this text of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watching. But waking and watching in theſe and ſuch like places, imply not onely a keeping of the eyes, but of the heart alſo awake &amp; attentiue vpon that which is done.</p>

                     <p>TO let all theſe &amp; other like erronious conceits paſſe, &amp; to returne to our matter. As outward watchfulneſſe of the body is nothing acceptable to God, vnleſſe the ſoule alſo be watchfull, ſo the ſoule cannot poſſibly bee watchfull, vnleſſe it haue the helpe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies watchfulneſſe: for the parts of the body are thoſe
<note n="*" place="margin">Organa.</note> inſtruments whereby the powers of the ſoule are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed. Wherefore both muſt bee ioyned together, as eaſily may bee gathered out of Chriſts charge to his Diſciples,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26. 41.</note> 
                        <hi>Watch and pray.</hi> That hee ſpeaketh of <hi>bodily watchfulneſſe</hi> is cleare, for he found them aſleepe, and therefore ſaid, <hi>Watch.</hi> As cleare alſo it is that he ſpeaketh of <hi>ſpirituall watchfulneſſe</hi> becauſe he inferreth this clauſe,
<hi>that yee enter not into temptation:</hi> it is not bodily watchfnl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe alone that can keepe vs from temptation. Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this metaphor of watching hath a large extent: for it is a military word, and the Apoſtle ſtill holdeth on like a wiſe Captaine to inſtruct Chriſtian ſouldiers what to doe. In time of warre there are certaine appointed conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to watch in ſome ſconce, watch-towre, or other<pb n="492" facs="tcp:3457:259"/> like eminent place, where they muſt rowſe vp themſelues throughly that they ſleepe not, and not onely remaine awake, but prie and view vp and downe euery where and diſcry what may be hurtfull or helpfull to the army. So as watching vnto prayer implyeth a diligent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of all ſuch things as may help vs or hinder vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. In this ſence the Apoſtle ſaith of Miniſters, that they
<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 13. 17</note>

                     <p>I might out of the full meaning of this metaphor col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect many particular duties, and diſtinctly handle them all, but for breuity ſake I will drawe all to one doctrine, which is this,</p>

Other things for which eſpecially perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in prayer is needfull, require a more particular and preſent anſwere of God, as a temptation, ſickneſſe, or any diſtreſſe which hangeth ouer our heads, or lieth vpon vs, or ſuch bleſſings as we ſtand in preſent neede of: theſe are to be prayed for till wee obtaine our deſire, as <hi>Iaakob</hi> would not let the Angell goe till he had bleſſed him: or till wee haue ſome better thing in liew thereof, as <hi>Paul</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Their blaſphemous ſlander was, that <hi>Chriſt cast not out diuels but by</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>the prince of Diuels.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verſ. 24.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſlander doth Chriſt firſt remooue, by ſhewing that it was neither <hi>probable,</hi> nor <hi>poſsible,</hi> that by Satan ſhould Satan be caſt out.</p>
                     <p>Not <hi>probable</hi> either in <hi>the thing it ſelfe,</hi> or in <hi>their opinion</hi> who ſaid it.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Verſ. 25.</note> another of a <hi>Citie,</hi> the third of an <hi>Houſe,</hi> neither of which if it be diuided againſt it ſelfe can ſtand: ſo nor Satan.</p>

                        <pb n="566" facs="tcp:3457:296"/> Now what probabilitie is there, that Satan an old, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique, experienced Prince, as deſirous as any other, to maintaine his owne Power and Dominion, ſhould wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly ſeeke his owne ruine and ouerthrow.</p>
                     <p>Nor <hi>in their owne opinion</hi> was that which they ſaid of Chriſt <hi>probable;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verſ. 27:</note> becauſe they otherwiſe thought of other men that caſt out diuels. Their owne children (men bred and brought vp among themſelues) that caſt out diuels, as Chriſt did, were not by them thought to caſt out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels by the power of Satan, but by the finger of God. Is it then likely, that in their conſciences they thought that which they vttered with their tongues, that <hi>Chriſt cast out Diuels by the Prince of Diuels?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That it was not <hi>poſsible,</hi> that by Satan, Satan ſhould be caſt out,<note place="margin">Verſ. 29.</note> Chriſt proueth by that ſuperiour power which he caſteth one our, muſt haue ouer him that is caſt out: he muſt bee able firſt to binde him, and then to ſpoile his houſe. But Satan hath not a ſuperiour power ouer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: It is impoſſible that Satan ſhould be ſtronger then Satan.</p>
                     <p>Thus our Lord Chriſt hauing cleane quenched the fire of that blaſphemous ſlander (for a ſlander caſt on him that is innocent, is as a fire-brand put into water) and by his iuſt apologie ſtopped their blacke mouthes, ſo as they had not to oppoſe againſt that he ſaid, he ſetteth forth the high pitch of their impietie, which proceeded to plaine
<hi>blaſphemie againſt the holy Ghost:</hi> and from thence taketh occaſion to declare the vile nature, and fearefull iſſue of that ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Two Euangeliſts record the Summe of that which Chriſt deliuered, concerning the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, I will therefore ſet downe the text out of them both.</p>

                     <p>THe firſt point to be noted is Chriſts Preface: whereby he ſheweth, that what he deliuereth concerning this point, is both a certaine and infallible truth: and alſo a point of weight and moment. Chriſt auerreth it vpon his authoritie and credit. <hi>I ſay</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I that am a faithfull and true witneſſe, I who cannot lye, I who am the very truth, I ſay.</hi> So as, of what authoritie our Lord, the eternall Son of God is, this which he hath here deliuered is alſo, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, true,<note place="margin">Mar. 13. 31.</note> certaine, infallible, vnchangeable, <hi>Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away, but his word ſhall not paſſe away.</hi> With this authority doth Chriſt<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5. 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44.</note> oft ratifie and confirme that expoſition which he gaue of the Morall Law: and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it to the light credit of the ancient Doctors of the Iewes, ſaying, <hi>You haue heard it ſaid of old,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you,</hi> &amp;c. ſo as his authoritie is more then any others can be, for Chriſt is the onely true Doctor of the Church: as he himſelfe teſtifieth of himſelfe,<note place="margin">Math. 23. 8.</note> ſaying, <hi>One is your Doctor, euen Chriſt.</hi> He hath power in his own name, by his own authoritie to deliuer any thing to his Church: which power is intimated vnder this imperial phraſe <hi>(I ſay.)</hi> And herein his manner of teaching is different from all others. For the vſuall phraſes of the Prophets were,<note place="margin">Iſa. 56. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Thus ſaith<pb n="571" facs="tcp:3457:298"/> the Lord:</hi>

                        <hi>The word of the Lord: The burden of the word of the Lord:</hi> with the like. To make doubt of any thing which Chriſt ſaith, is to call his authority into queſtion. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word ſpoken by the Prophets was ſtedfaſt, how much more ſtedfaſt is the Word ſpoken by the Lord himſelfe, Chriſt Ieſus?</p>
                     <p>The particle ſet by Saint <hi>Marke</hi> before the clauſe of Chriſts authoritie, is in the Greeke <hi>Amen,</hi> and in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew ſignifieth <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſo not vnfitly tranſlated <hi>Verily.</hi> It is a note of an earneſt and vehement aſſeueration.

                     <p>The reaſon why Chriſt firſt vſed this Preface, was to moue them who heard it, to giue the greater credence, and the more diligent heed to that which hee deliuered, leſt at any time they ſhould let it ſlip. And it is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by the Euangeliſts, that wee which reade it, or heare, ſhould know that the points heere deliuered are worthy our due and ſerious meditation: points needfull to be taught and learned.</p>

                     <p>In regard of the matter of <hi>Blaſphemie,</hi> God is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med two wayes: either <hi>Priuatiuely,</hi> by taking away from God that which is due vnto him, and wherein his honor conſiſteth: or <hi>Poſitiuely,</hi> by attributing that vnto him, which is vnbeſeeming his Maieſtie, and diſhonorable to his great name.</p>
                     <p>The honor due to God is taken from him two wayes.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Simply,</hi> when that which properly belongeth vnto him is denied him.

                     </p>
                     <p>2 <hi>By conſequence,</hi> when that which is proper to the Creator, is attributed to the creature: thus the Scribes and Phariſies imagining Chriſt to bee a meere creature,<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 3.</note> and not thinking that he was God, becauſe he tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to forgiue ſinnes (which is a power proper onely vnto God) accuſed him of <hi>Blaſphemie:</hi> and againe, the<pb n="578" facs="tcp:3457:302"/> Iewes went about to ſtone him for <hi>Blaſphemie,</hi> becauſe (as they alledge) he <hi>being a man,</hi>

                        <hi>made himſelfe God.</hi> Though their cenſure of Chriſt were moſt falſe and ſlanderous, yet thereby they plainly ſhew what was accounted <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.</hi> But to make this point more cleare, the Holy Ghoſt expreſly ſaith of the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, that <hi>they committed great blaſphemies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Neh. 9. 18.</note> becauſe they ſaid of the molten Calfe which they ſet vp, <hi>This is thy God which brought thee vp out of the Land of Aegypt,</hi> whereby they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the <hi>Calfe,</hi> a creature of their owne making, that which <hi>God</hi> the Creator of all things did.</p>
                     <p>The other kind of <hi>blaſphemie,</hi> in attributing ſuch things to God which are vnbeſeeming his <hi>Excellencie,</hi> is noted in thoſe Iſraelites that cauſed their ſonnes to paſſe thorow the fire, making God thereby like vnto the Diuell, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in mans blood: a thing moſt diſhonorable to the Diuine Maieſtie.

                        <hi>In this haue your Fathers blaſphemed me.</hi> Thus it is noted of thoſe on whom the Viall of Gods wrath was powred out,<note place="margin">Reu. 16. 11.</note> that <hi>they blaſphemed the God of heauen for their paines:</hi> their blaſpemie, without queſtion, was that they impeached God of iniuſtice, vnmercifulnes, cruelty and ſuch like things, much vnbeſeeming his glorious name.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>deſpitefulneſſe</hi> added to <hi>reiecting of the Goſpell,</hi> brings a man into a moſt fearefull and deſperate eſtate: yet all that aſcend to this high pitch of impiety, doe not ſimply therein ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt: for all this may be done on ignorance.

                     <p>The particular forme whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from all other ſinnes, is in theſe words (<hi>After that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath ſupernaturally perſwaded a mans heart of the truth and benefit thereof.</hi>) Out of which I gather theſe conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, concerning the perſons that commit this ſinne.</p>
                     <p>1 They muſt haue knowledge of the Goſpell: their iudgement muſt be euicted of that truth which they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:<pb n="602" facs="tcp:3457:314"/> whereby they come to ſinne againſt their owne knowledge and iudgement.</p>
                     <p>2 This knowledge muſt not onely ſwimme in the braine, but alſo worke vpon their will, and diue into their heart: ſo as their will giue conſent, and their heart aſſent to what their iudgement coneiueth to bee true. There muſt be a perſwaſion as well as knowledge; whereby they come to ſinne againſt <hi>conſcience,</hi> that iudge which God hath placed in mens ſoules to accuſe or excuſe them.</p>
                     <p>3 This knowledge and perſwaſion muſt be wrought not onely by euidence of vndeniable arguments, (for ſo an Heathen man may be euicted, and perſwaded) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by a ſupernaturall and inward worke of Gods Spirit, whereby they are in their very ſoules perſwaded that they gain-ſay the vndoubted word of God, and ſo ſin againſt the worke of the Spirit in them.</p>
                     <p>4 This inward ſupernaturall perſwaſion muſt bee of the benefit of the Word, as well as of the truth thereof: that the Word which they deſpitefully gain-ſay, is the Word of ſaluation (which, whoſoeuer beleeueth, ſhall not periſh, but haue life euerlaſting) and the only meanes of ſaluation (whoſoeuer reiecteth it, ſhall be damned.) Thus in ſinning againſt the forenamed worke of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they ſinne againſt their owne ſoules, and bring ſwift damnation vpon themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Briefly to ſumme vp all that hath been deliuered of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt: It conſiſteth of theſe degrees.</p>

<hi>in this world, or in the world to come,</hi> with blaſphemy againſt the Sonne of Man, by the conſequence which they inferre, it would follow that blaſphemy againſt the Sonne may be forgiuen in the world to come; which is directly againſt their owne principles: for all blaſphemy is a mortall ſinne; but they ſay<note n="*" place="margin">Purgatorium projis tantum eſt qui cum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialibus culpis moriuntur.

                     <p>8 If any ſinnes might be forgiuen in the world to come, by the order of the words in this phraſe, (<hi>nor in this world, nor in the world to come</hi>) it would follow that the more hainous ſinnes ſhould be forgiuen in the world to come: elſe Chriſt would haue ſaid, <hi>Nor in the world to come, nor in this world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9 Chriſt here ſpeaketh of remitting the <hi>Fault:</hi> but by their doctrine onely the <hi>puniſhment</hi> is remitted after this life: for they acknowledge that<note n="*" place="margin">Culpas ipſas.

That which being done againſt a meane man, will ſcarce beare an action in Law (as we ſpeake) committed againſt a King may proue a capitall matter, a matter of high treaſon, and bring a man to the gallowes. Now euery ſin is a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods Law, and committed directly againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Maieſtie; and in that reſpect it is infinite in nature, and deſerueth an infinite puniſhment. But the creature is finite, and cannot in time beare an infinite weight of vengeance, and therefore it lieth eternally vnder it. There is then a proportion betwixt the ſin of the damned, and their puniſhment: both are infinite. Sin in quantity and greatnes, the puniſhment in time and continuance: what ſin wanteth in continuance, it hath in greatnes; and what the puniſhment wanteth in weight, it hath in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

This is the caſe of the damned. Gods wrath is an infinite burden, by Gods law it is held vp ouer mens heads: ſinne is a ſword, whereby the coard of Gods law is cut: by faith and repentance Gods wrath is ſtaid from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on man.
