            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But what Prerogative is this to have God in
the midst of his Church?<note place="margin">Quest.</note> where is he not?
he is an immense, infinite being, and his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
is every where. <hi>Psal. 139. 7, 9.
Whither shall I flie from thy presence? If I take
the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
parts of the Sea, even there shall thy hand lead me.</hi>
What priviledge is it to have God in the midst
of his Church, seeing he is in the midst of his
enemies too?</p>
            <p>There is a twofold presence of God.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. There is his <hi>universal presence,</hi> whereby
he is in all places<note n="*" place="margin">Deus est in loco repletivè.</note>. <hi>Jer. 23. 23. Do not I
fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?</hi> This is no
priviledge at all; for this universal presence is
with the damned, they have the presence of
his power and justice.</p>
            <p>2. There is <hi>a peculiar presence</hi> of God,
and this is confined to his people. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God is either, 1. <hi>In heaven,</hi> which is
nothing else but his glorious presence. <hi>Psal.
11. 4. The Lords Throne is in heaven.</hi> Or,
2. <hi>On earth,</hi> and that is either,</p>
            <p>1. His <hi>favourable</hi> presence, whereby he
manifests the pledges of his grace and goodness
towards his people; and so he is present in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106552:6"/>
Assemblies of his Saints, breathing forth the
sweet perfume of his Spirit. <hi>Exod. 20. 24.
In all places where I record my Name, I will come
unto thee, and I will bless thee.</hi> This is that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
the Saints desire in the Ordinances, Gods
quickning, sanctifying, comforting presence;
the smiles of his face, the kisses of his lips; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is so delightful, as to <hi>hold the King in the
Galleries</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 7. 5.</note>. and have the <hi>Banner of his love</hi>
sweetly display'd, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>Or, 2. His <hi>providential</hi> presence, wherein
the Lord appears admirably for his people in
his providential actings, shewing himself to
be a wonder-working God; and this is chiefly
meant in the Text, <hi>God is in the midst of her,</hi> to
defend, to deliver, to bless: Thus he was with
his people <hi>Israel</hi> by the pillar of fire, and a
cloud; and thus will he be present with his
Church to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>The Reasons why God is in the midst of his
Church to defend and bless it, are,</p>
            <p>1. The dear interest he hath in it.<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> The

the Church is Gods Vineyard and Enclosure,

For their sins he may sometimes lay these

<hi>Psal. 132. 13, 14, 15. The Lord hath chosen Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,

with a more common love, his Church hath
the cream of his love: 'Tis one love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

And as they have the beauty of inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

is vehement, like the <hi>Coals of Juniper,</hi> or the
Sun-beams contracted in a burning Glass,
which are more intense and ardent; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loves <hi>Sion,</hi> therefore he is in the midst
of it, to defend and bless it. <hi>Zeph. 3. 17.
The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty,

and throw off Christs colours, they would
have none to oppose them; but because they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106552:8"/>
espouse Christs quarrel, and fight under the

<hi>Ammon,</hi> and all the powers of Hell unite and

               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> It appears,</p>
            <p>1. By his <hi>strange</hi> preserving and delivering
his Church.</p>
            <p>1. By <hi>unthought of</hi> means; whe <hi>Israel</hi>
were hem'd in, the red Sea before, <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
and his Host pursuing behind, God preserves
them by unthought of means, they never
thought of the parting of the waters; Who
would have imagined that God should have
made a Cawsey in the Sea? So when flesh
failed in the Wilderness, the people of <hi>Israel</hi>
could not devise how God should spread them
a Table there; there was no plowing or sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106552:8"/>
nothing to be seen but wild Beasts and
Serpents; the Lord made the Heavens a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and rained down bread upon them; here
he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the midst of his people.</p>
            <p>2. By <hi>contemptible</hi> means: The <hi>blowing of
Trumpets,</hi> and <hi>blazing of Lamps,</hi> made the
walls of <hi>Hiericho</hi> fall down, <hi>Judg. 7. 20. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi>
was drawn out to the Dungeon by <hi>rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
rags,</hi> Jer. 37. 11. God often saves his
Church by despicable instruments, he makes
use of <hi>rotten rags.</hi> God raised up <hi>Luthar</hi> in
<hi>Germany</hi> against the Pope, the Enemy looked
upon him with a contemptible eye, one of
them said, <hi>He was fitter to pray in a Cloyster, than
to do any great Exploits abroad:</hi> But God made
him a rare Instrument in his Church, he did so
shake the Popes Chair, that never to this day
hath he sat safe in it.</p>
            <p>3. By <hi>contrary</hi> means: That the Rock
should be set abroach, that <hi>Jonah</hi> should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
by being swallowed up; God made the
Fish a Ship in which he sailed safe to shore.
That the Raven, who is so unnatural, she will
hardly feed her young, should bring meat to
the Prophet <hi>Eliah,</hi> this shews God is <hi>in the
midst of his people:</hi> How often is it seen that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106552:9"/>
God makes use of a <hi>contrary wind;</hi> the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of his Church shall do his work, he will
play his game by their hand.</p>
            <p>1. Either he will make his Enemies friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his people. <hi>Exod 12. 35. The children
of Israel borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and jewels of gold, and the Lord gave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
favour in the eyes of the Egyptians.</hi> God can
make wolves to suckle his lambs: Or,</p>
            <p>2. He will work divisions among his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and turn their own weapons against
themselves. 2. <hi>Chron. 20. 23. The children of
Ammon fell upon the Inhabitants of Mount Seir,
and after that, every one helped to destroy another.</hi>
Thus God makes the <hi>Seed of the Serpent,</hi> a
means to break the Serpents head. We read
in Ecclesiastical History, in the time of the
good Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> when the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
did shoot their arrows against the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
by a sudden and violent wind their arrows
were driven back, and did flie in their own
faces.</p>
            <p>2. It is evident that God is in the midst of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his Church, by his <hi>seasonable</hi> appearing for his
people. When the Church of God hath been
brought very low, nothing in view but despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106552:9"/>
their power hath been gone, and their
hopes gone, then God hath step'd in for their
relief, and given the Victory on the Churches
side. <hi>Deutr. 32. 36. The Lord shall repent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for his servants, when he seeth that their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is gone, and there is none shut up and left.</hi>
When <hi>Peter</hi> was sinking, <hi>then</hi> Christ put forth
his hand, and took him into the Ship. When
the Church of God hath been <hi>inter malleum,
&amp; incudem,</hi> like <hi>Isaac</hi> on the Altar, going to
be sacrificed to the rage and fury of men, <hi>then</hi>
hath the Providence of God step'd in as the
Angel, and said, <hi>Lay not thy hand upon the child.</hi>
God may let the Enemy nibble at the heel of
his Church, but still he defends the head; when
malice is boil'd up to revenge, and the designs
of men carry destruction in the Front, now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
the Churches morning star of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
This shews God is in the midst of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
because when things have seemed to be in
the forlorn hope, and all given for lost, now
God hath come riding in the Chariots of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Here is good news for the Church

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106552:10"/>
to their expectation, <hi>God is in the midst of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
He hath a special super-intendency over
the Affairs of his Church; God hath more
care of his Church than we can. We read in
<hi>Ezekiels</hi> Vision, of a <hi>wheel within a wheel,</hi>
Ezek. 1. 16. Gods Decree is the inner wheel
that turns al the outward wheels of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
the Church never wants Enemies to
assault, and make inrodes upon her, but <hi>God is
in the midst of her.</hi> Here is a River of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
whose chrystal streams may refresh the
City of God. Gods eye is upon his people for
good; <hi>The eye of the Lord is upon them that
fear him</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 33. 18.</note> and it is a watchful eye, for he
<hi>neither slumbers nor sleeps,</hi> Psal. 121. 4. But
what priviledge is this that Gods eye is upon
his people, his eye is upon the wicked too? I
answer, Gods eye which is upon <hi>Zion,</hi> is
not only an eye of <hi>inspection,</hi> but an eye of
<hi>benediction: Zion</hi> hath not only his eye, but
his heart. <hi>Psal. 5. 12. For thou Lord wilt bless
the righteous, with favour wilt thou compass him,
as with a shield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If God be in the midst of <hi>Zion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Branch.</note> then
see the Churches beauty and strength.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Churches beauty, God is in the midst of

Zac. 2. 5. <hi>I will be the glory in the midst of her.</hi>
This is the best Jewel of the Churches Crown;
as the Diamond to the Ring, as the Sun to the
World, which doth bespangle it with its
beams, so is Gods presence to his Church. The
<hi>Ark</hi> which was the emblem and sign of Gods
presence, was stiled, <hi>the glory of Israel.</hi> Why
is the Church called a <hi>Royal Diadem,</hi> and <hi>a
Crown of beauty,</hi> Isa. 62. 3. but because God
casts his resplendent lustre upon her? <hi>I will be
the glory in the midst of her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. See here the <hi>Churches strength.</hi> God is

be in the midst of <hi>Sihon,</hi> he will be both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive

by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106552:11"/>
who is the sword of thy excellency!</hi> God is a
golden shield to his people, and a flaming
sword to his enemies, <hi>Zach. 2. 5. For I saith
the Lord will be unto her a wall of fire round
about. A wall,</hi> That is defensive; a wall of
<hi>fire</hi> that is offensive, <hi>Isa. 27. 2. In that day
sing ye unto her a Vineyard, of red wine, I the
Lord do keep it, I will water it lest any hurt
it, I will keep it night and day.</hi> They that
go to overthrow the Church must do it in

When we look upon things with an humane

over-topped: that the Sea should be higher

So that the power and force which seemes to

If God be in the midst of his Church, let<note place="margin">3 Branch.</note>
us do two things.</p>
            <p>1. Let us take heed of driving God from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
us. There are wayes whereby we may drive
God from the Nation. As when Bees are in
the Hive, and bring their honey, you may
drive them out with smoak. So sin is a smoak
that will drive God out from a people. Isa.
65. 3, 5. <hi>A people that provoketh me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
these are a smoak in my nose.</hi> In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
there are Nine sins which drive God out
of a Land, and when he marcheth out, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
marcheth in.</p>
            <p>1. Idolatry. 2 King. 17. 12, 18. <hi>For they
served Idols, whereof the Lord had said unto
them, Ye shall not do this thing, therefore the
Lord was very angry with Israel, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them out of his sight.</hi> Idolatry is a sin
which breaks the Marriage-knot, and makes
the Lord disclaim his interest in a people,
Exod. 32. 7. <hi>Thy people have corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
Before, God called <hi>Israel, HIS
PEOPLE,</hi> but when once they had defil'd
themselves with Idolatry, then God disclaims
them; he doth not say to <hi>Moses, MY</hi> people,
but <hi>THY</hi> people, as if he had quite discar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106552:16"/>
them, and cut off the entail of mercy.
Take heed of Idolatry; yea, and of Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too, which is a Bridge leading over to it.
Superstition is an intermixing our fancies and
inventions with divine institutions; 'tis an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
offered to God, as if he were not wise
enough to appoint the manner of his own
worship.</p>
            <p>2. Rapine and Oppression. Jer. 12. 7, 8.
<hi>I have forsaken my house, my heritage is to
me as a speckled bird.</hi> Or as a bird of prey.<note n="*" place="margin">Uncis unguibus tanquam digi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis in praedam involans. <hi>Jun.</hi>
               </note>.
When Gods Dove becomes a Vulture, and is
given to ravening and cruelty, staining her
feathers with blood, God will then break up
House, and be gone.</p>
            <p>3. Uncleanness Hos. 7. 4. <hi>They are all
Adulterers, as an Oven heated by the Baker.</hi>
They who should have been <hi>Temples of the
Holy Ghost,</hi> are hot Ovens burning in lust<note n="*" place="margin">Urbs est jam tatae Iupanar.</note>.—
Vers. 12. <hi>I will spread my net upon them.</hi>
That is, I will spread the net of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
over them, and they shall be taken in the
Net.</p>
            <p>4. Covetousness. Jer 6. 12. <hi>I will stretch
out my hand upon the inhabitants of the Land,
for from the least of them, even to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106552:16"/>
every one is given to Covetousness.</hi> When
men smell rank of the earth, when they love
the <hi>Exchange</hi> better than the <hi>Temple,</hi> and are
more for the earthly Mammon, than the
heavenly Manna, God will take his leave, and
be gone. God is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> he can no more
converse with an earthly people, than a Prince
can converse with a Swine.</p>
            <p>5. Apostacy. Jer. 6. 28. <hi>They are all grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
revolters, Reprobate silver shall one call
them, because the Lord hath rejected them.</hi> This
made God remove his golden Candlestick
from the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> because she had
left her first Love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. And if apostacy
will make God depart from a people, then
how can we expect he should stay long with
us? Where is that zeal for God, and love to
truth, as formerly? We live in the fall of
the leaf; There are many who courted the
Queen of Religion when she had a Jewel hung
at her ear, but when she is in her night-dress,
and her Jewels of preferment are pull'd off,
now they desert her. <hi>Lots</hi> wife was turned
into a <hi>pillar of salt,</hi> for looking back. If all
who look back, should have this judgement
inflicted on them, we should hardly go in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106552:17"/>
streets for meeting pillars of salt. Merchants
tell us of divers Ships cast away at Sea; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there have been of late more shipwracks
at Land, than at Sea, I mean, such, as have
made <hi>shipwrack of faith and a good conscience.</hi>
The golden head is degenerated into Iron, a
more faeculent and impure mettal—<hi>Desinit
in piscem mulier formosa supernè.</hi>—</p>
            <p>6. Weariness of Gods Ordinances; <hi>Amos
8. 5. When will the New Moon be gone, and
the Sabbath?</hi> Vers. 11. <hi>Behold, the dayes
come, saith the Lord, that I will send a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in the Land, not a famine of bread, nor a
thirst for water, but of hearing the Word of the
Lord.</hi> God hath fed this Nation with the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
of the wheat,</hi> even the bread of life, we
have had the Cream of Ordinances, God hath
come down to us in a golden shower of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
the Vintage of other Nations, hath not
been so good as the gleanings of <hi>England,</hi> but
have not we said, <hi>What a weariness is it?</hi> Mal.
1. 13. Is not our sin Sermon-surfeiting?
though we have liked the dressing, we have
loathed the food; we have said, Who is this
<hi>Moses?</hi> and what is this Manna? and may not
we fear God is now coming to punish us for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106552:17"/>
this sin? When we have lost our stomacks,
God may cause the cloth to be taken away;
and would not that be dismal? How sad is it
for any Nation, when their <hi>Seers</hi> are blind!
In what a condition is that people, who have
husks given them instead of Manna, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
instead of food! Weariness of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
forfeits the Gospel. If God sees that
Sanctuary-blessings bear but a low price, he
will remove the Market.</p>
            <p>7. Perjury. <hi>Jer. 11. 10. The house of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
and the house of Iudah have broken my
Covenant; therefore thus saith the Lord, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
I will bring evil upon them, which they
shall not be able to escape, and though they shall
cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Chrys ost.</note>.
When a people play fast and loose with God,
breaking their Solemn Vows and Obligations,
whether Sacramental or other, this is a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoking
sin, it will make the Lord go away
from a Nation, and though they cry after
him, he will turn a deaf ear. God will
pass by <hi>infirmity,</hi> but he will punish <hi>Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Hatred of Reformation. When God
calls to a people by his Word, Spirit, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106552:18"/>
but they regard him not, he will pack
up and be gone. <hi>Jer. 7. 13. I spake unto you
rising up early, but you heard not, therefore
will</hi> I <hi>do to this house which is called by my
Name, as I did to Shilo.</hi> Why, what did
God to <hi>Shilo?</hi> There the Priests were slain,
the Ark was carried away captive, all the signs
of Gods presence were removed, the Vision
ceased, and we never read that the Ark re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Shilo</hi> any more. Hath not God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to us to be an holy reformed people, but
are there not those found among us, who hate
Holiness, and cry down Reformation? Oh
take heed that God doth not do to us, as he
did to <hi>Shilo,</hi> unpeople us, unchurch us, and
send a <hi>flying roll</hi> of curses against us.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Incivilities offered to them who labour
in the Word and Doctrine. God will avenge
the wrongs done to his Embassadors.</hi> 2 Chron.
36. 16, 17. The Lord God of their fathers sent
to them by his Messengers, rising up betimes,
and sending, because he had compassion on his
people, and on his dwelling place; but they mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the messengers of God, and despised his words,
and misused his Prophets, until the wrath of the
Lord arose against his people, till there was no
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106552:18"/>
remedy. <hi>Let us take heed of these sins, which
will cause God to depart from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If God be in the midst of his Church,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
let us do what we can to keep God among us.
<hi>Israel</hi> endeavoured to keep the <hi>Ark</hi> among
them, which was the sign of Gods presence,
<hi>Hos. 9. 12. Wo to them, when I depart from
them.</hi> If God be gone, then all other blessings
go too; peace and trading will be gone; Oh
let us strive to keep God among us. What is
the glory of a Nation, but the presence of
God in his Word and Ordinances? <hi>Zach 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>5.
I will be the glory in the midst of thee.</hi> If
God be once gone, <hi>the glory is departed.</hi> If
God be gone, <hi>England</hi> will be like an house
that hath the furniture taken down, and is
falling to ruine. <hi>Isa. 13. 31. Owles shall dwell
there, and Satyrs shall dance there.</hi> If God
be gone, Satan will be the next Tenant.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi>

Is not God upon the <hi>threshold of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
ready to fly? Are not the shadows of the
evening stretch'd out? And may we not fear
the Sun-setting of the Gospel? Oh let us by
humble prayer lie at Christs feet, and <hi>constrain</hi>
him to stay with us; Prayer makes a sweet
sound in Gods ears, and he will not go away
where there is that musick.</p>
            <p>2. By setting upon the work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Ier. 7. 3. Amend your wayes, and your
doings.</hi> There is a prophane party in the
Land, who drink, and roar, and <hi>declare their
sin as Sodom;</hi> These <hi>Sampsons</hi> are like to pull
down the house upon our head; instead of
bringing the water of tears to quench Gods
anger, they adde oile to the flame. The men
of <hi>Lystra</hi> seeing the miracle wrought by <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> cry'd out, <hi>The gods are come
down to us in the likeness of men,</hi> Act. 14.

Harlot, yet let not Iudah offend,</hi> Hos. 4. 15.
Though others are licentious and exorbitant,
(being carried to hell with wind and tyde)
yet let us keep our garments pure, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Virginity of our Consciences; let us
labour to reform our selves, and mourn for
what we cannot reform in others. Let us walk

Let us shine forth in a kind of Angelical
brightness, that we may not only profess the
Gospel, but beautifie it. Were we such a
Reformed People, we might keep God still
<hi>in the midst of us,</hi> and as a pledge of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
presence, he would entail his Gospel,
that Crowning Blessing, both upon us, and our
Posterity.</p>

<hi>Sodom,</hi> if there had been <hi>ten</hi> righteous

<hi>tens</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> Isa 65. 8. <hi>As new wine
is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it

<hi>England</hi> is so blasted, that the Lord might cut
it down, yet there are some good Clusters,
and for these God may spare the Vine, and say,
<hi>Is there not a blessing in it?</hi> Were the godly,
(who are the <hi>Charets and Horsemen in Israel</hi>)
removed, the Lord would make quick work
with the Nation; he would destroy the weeds,
were it not for the Corn. The Ship of Church

were not in it. The Saints stay Gods hand

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Another seed of hope is, that the lord
keeps up a spirit of prayer among his people.
The <hi>Spartans</hi> Walls were their Spears. The
Wall, and Bulwark of a Nation, is Prayer; as
there are <hi>crying sins in</hi> the Land, so there are
<hi>crying prayers.</hi> Whole <hi>Vollies</hi> of sighs and

the Lord intends to pour out the <hi>Vial</hi> of his
indignation, he stops all the sluces of prayer.
<hi>Ier. 7. 16. Pray not for this people.</hi> God hath not
said so yet; Prayer is a powerful Orator for
mercy, it comes, as it were, with Letters of
<hi>mandamus</hi> to heaven. <hi>Isa. 45. 11. Concerning
the works of my hands command ye me.</hi>
               <q>—Et Dominum mundi flectere vota solent<note n="*" place="margin">Martial.</note>—</q>
Prayer staves off wrath from a Land. <hi>Exod.

This gives some crevis of hope, that God will

the names of his people upon his breast, and
sets them as a golden Signet upon his heart;
his prayers go up to heaven as sweet odors. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.

8. 4. The smoak of incense ascended up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God out of the Angels hand.</hi> Though out
sins go up to heaven, as the smoak of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
yet Christs prayers go up as <hi>the smoak
of incense.</hi> Christs intercession is meritorious,
his blood will never leave crying, till the blood
of his enemies be shed.</p>
            <p>5. A fifth seed of hope is, the mercy of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
God. <hi>Isa. 63. 9. In his love, and in his pity
he redeemed them.</hi> God is <hi>the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
2 Cor. 1. 3. Mercy doth naturally is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
from him. He is <hi>rich in mercy,</hi> Ephes. 2. 4.
He <hi>delighteth in mercy,</hi> Mic. 7. 18. Justice is
Gods <hi>strange work,</hi> Isa, 28. 21. Mercy is his
proper work: Why may not Mercy give the
casting-voice? And that which may make us
hope in this mercy, is, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The mercy of God
is free. <hi>Hos. 14. 4. I will love them freely</hi>

Mercy sends out its pardons to whom it will;
Mercy doth not go by <hi>desert,</hi> but by <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
I will love them <hi>freely.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God is healing. <hi>Hos. 14. 4. I will heal
their back-slidings.</hi> Mercy can heal the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity
and stubbornness of a people; Mercy
can as well give <hi>repentance,</hi> as <hi>deliverance.</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
can destroy the sins of a Nation, and save
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106552:22"/>
the Nation. It can burn up the Chaff, and
save the Corn. <hi>I will heal their back-slidings.</hi>
Mercy can stop <hi>the bloody issue</hi> of sin, and so
make way for <hi>the issues from death,</hi> Psal. 68.
20. <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, the water-courses of <hi>Rome</hi>
are the worlds wonder; but behold here a
Sacred Water-course <hi>of Gods mercy,</hi> this is
a sweet wonder; Mercy can overcome a sinful
people, it can save a Nation in its Climacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
year; We read that <hi>the fire of the Lord
fell, and licked up the water,</hi> 1 Kings 18. 38.
Thus the fire of Gods mercy can lick up, and
devour the water of our sins.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. The last seed of hope for <hi>England,</hi> is,
That there have been many sins committed <hi>in</hi>
the Nation, which are not the sins <hi>of</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
some have perjured themselves, but all
have not; A sober and considerable party in
the Land (however traduced) have entred
their dissent, and openly protested against the
scandalous actings of others; so that it is to
be hoped, the Lord will not impute the sin of
some to the whole. There are a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that said as <hi>David, 1 Sam. 26. 11. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that I should stretch forth my hand against
the Lords anointed.</hi> They looked upon it as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106552:22"/>
impious and irrational, to go to cut off the
<hi>HEAD,</hi> to preserve the body. Thus I have
showed you a <hi>Rain-bow in the cloud,</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you some probable grounds of hope, That
the Lord will still be <hi>in the midst</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
Which I intend as a preservative against de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency,
not as fuel for security.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quest.</note> But how is it possible there should
be any good towards us? That the sins in
which the Nation hath been so steeped, and
parboil'd, should be forgiven? that our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and animosities should be healed, Gods
Ordinances refined, and the Lord continue
his gracious presence in the midst of us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> I say with our blessed Saviour, <hi>Luke
18. 27. The things which are unpossible with
men, are possible with God.</hi> What cannot that
God do, that can create? God can bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
those things, which in the eye of sence
are not feasible. That Iron should swim, that
the Rock should be a Spring, is in nature im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
but God hath brought this to pass.
Cannot God untye those knots which do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
and puzzle us? <hi>Zach. 8. 6. If it be
marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this
people, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106552:23"/>
saith the Lord of hosts.</hi> Can difficulties pose
the Almighty? <hi>Jer. 32 27. Is there any thing
too hard for me?</hi> Did not he make the <hi>dry bones</hi>
live? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 7, 8. God can bring <hi>light out of
darkness</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 4 6.</note>, harmony out of confusion; he
can do more than we can <hi>think</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 3. 20.</note>, else he should
not be God. How apt are Gods own people
to be discouraged with seeming impossibilities?
<hi>Moses</hi> who was one of the brighest Stars that
ever shined in the Churches Orb, yet ready
to hesitate, and sink at seeming impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>Numb. 11. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. The people amongst whom I
am, are six hundred thousand footmen, and thou
hast said, I will give them flesh that they may eat
a whole month; shall the flocks and the heards be
slain for them to suffice them? or shall all the fish
of the Sea be gathered together for them to suffice
them?</hi> As if <hi>Moses</hi> had said in plain English,
he did not see how such a numerous people
could be fed for a month. God gives him a
kind of check for his infidelity, <hi>vers. 23. Is the
Lords hand waxed short?</hi> Do I find mouths, and
not meat? Cannot I make provision for my
houshold? <hi>Is the Lords hand waxed short?</hi> That
God who brought <hi>Isaac</hi> out of a <hi>dead womb,</hi>
and the <hi>Messiah</hi> out of a <hi>Virgins womb,</hi> what
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106552:23"/>
cannot he do<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap> Chrysostom.</note>? When things act never so ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly,
God can put them in joint again.
When his Church is so low, that she seems to
be in the Grave, and have a Tombstone laid
upon her, he can in an instant cause a glorious
resurrection. Therefore let us not be out of
heart, but still rest on the arm of Gods power
and Soveraignty, remembring there are no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Cases with God.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, the Lord may let his
Church be a while under hatches, to punish her
security, and awaken her out of her slumbering
fits, yet, surely the storm will not continue
long; The Church shall not dye in travel, but
God will manifest that he is <hi>in the midst of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and after his Church hath suffered a while,
(as her head Christ hath done) he will cause
the morning star of her Salvation to appear,
and she shall come out of all her troubles, <hi>as
the wings of a Dove covered with silver, and
her feathers with yellow gold.</hi>
