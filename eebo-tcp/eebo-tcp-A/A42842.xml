            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT has been an Inveterate Objection againſt the Society of <hi>Poets,</hi> that
their moſt Natural and Regular Performances have been at beſt but
the forc'd and ſpurious Off-ſprings of Bribery or Ambition; The Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of which will be very obvious from the Characters of the Objectors,
who have been ever look'd upon by the more impartial Criticks, as a Pack
of envious Pedants; as much beneath a Capacity of Conceiving, as a
Power, or Deſire of Emulating their moſt Excellent Patterns; whereas the
true and genuine Springs that actuate a <hi>Poet</hi>'s Invention, are the Actions,
and Paſſions of Hero's; The mighty Purpoſes, and Deſigns of Worthies;
<pb facs="tcp:55635:3"/>
And, in ſhort, all the Eminent Productions of Great Souls: And the very
Original Title of his Profeſſion will allow him only to Copy out and Imitate
the more remarkable ſtrokes of the Great Ones: In which Province he is
ſo much unworthy of Cenſure, that he ſeems to ſerve an apparent Turn of
Providence, by ſupplying the defects of Age, and Memory, with Immortal Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Monuments, which Reſcue the Hiſtory of Honourable Acts from the
devouring Efforts of Fate and Oblivion.</p>
            <p>But I do not offer this to Reconcile Your Grace to a favourable Opinion
of that Order, as hoping my ſelf to be included in the Gracious Indemnity,
(For I have no Pretenſions to the Adoption of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> tho' have always
admir'd that noble Oeconomy,) But becauſe I know how much the Favour
and Patronage of ſo great a <hi>Mecoenas</hi> would acuate and encourage the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
and Induſtry of the more refin'd, Wits vigorouſly to purſue the
<hi>Roman</hi> Paiterns, and recover the clapſed Majeſty of that Incomparable
Style.</p>
            <p>But when I ſaw that Matchleſs Scene, which, by this time, All <hi>Europe</hi>
knows the late Funeral was: When I conſider'd the ſingular Occaſion, the
Death of that Illuſtrious Princeſs, of whoſe Worth the moſt ſpeculative
Head can ſcarce form an adaequate Idea; The Order and Harmony of the
whole Proceeding, And have ſince obſerv'd the great Omiſſion of thoſe
Encomiums that were due, even from thoſe that have boaſted of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
I could not but preſume to offer this little Specimen of my private
Senſe; And have at laſt ventur'd to Intitle it to Your Grace, as the
Great Maſter of the Publick Solemnities; Being till now deterr'd from the
Attempt, by the ſenſe of thoſe many Imperfections which are chargeable upon
it. VVhen I remember'd the Maxim, viz. <hi>Of two Evils, chooſe the leaſt,</hi> I
thought it more eligible to be too obſequious, than neglectful.</p>
            <p>Therefore I humbly deſire to ſhelter theſe Lines under Your Grace's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
hoping the Defects and Irregularities that their Author has In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
on You, will be Remitted upon his Promiſe; that when Maturity and
Experience ſhall have prun'd the laviſh Creſcences of his Pen, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
both his Thoughts and VVords by the beſt Models, ſomething ſhall
then be offer'd more worthy of their Patron by,</p>

               <l>Thus ſpake my Extaſie, 'twixt Doubt and Fear.</l>
               <l>What! Is ſome an Angel fall'n? ſome God Dethorn'd,</l>
               <l>Or is there Rage in Heav'n that's unatton'd?</l>
               <l>Has ſome Dear Minion of the Stars of late,</l>

               <l>Is <hi>Albions</hi> Genius in a Lethargy?</l>
               <l>Or Nature dead? and all mankind agree,</l>
               <l>To meet, and weep their Mothers Obſequy;</l>
               <l>Or if Perfection, Sufferings would allow,</l>
               <l>I'd think the God of Nature ſuffer'd too:</l>
               <l>For ſuch a Gen'ral ſorrow cannot be,</l>
               <l>The common Tribute to Mortality.</l>
               <l>Such are the ſtrokes of Extaſie, and Flame,</l>
               <l>Such the <hi>Idaeas,</hi> ſuch the Thoughts that came,</l>
               <l>From one, whoſe Judgment up to Madneſs flew,</l>

               <l>A Lady that fat by, and heard the whole,</l>
