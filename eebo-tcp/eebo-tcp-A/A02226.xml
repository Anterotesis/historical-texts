            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>YOV are desirous, in regard of the trust you put in me, to vnderstand mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, how you should carry your selfe through that <hi>labyrinth,</hi> wherein it seemes time, &amp; mischance haue imprison'd you. It was a wisdome among our Ancestors not to deale betweene the barke and the tree, otherwise than with Confessors, Shrifts, and such like superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rites, as discharging our selues, did vainely charge others with our desires. But the twine is so strong, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with your Worth and Fauour haue bound me, as I will imagine our Predecessors <hi>aphorismes</hi> in that point, to be rather a modesty out of sloth, or ignorance; than any Precept, fit to guide our loues, or liues by. For first, the liberality of Knowledge makes no man poorer; and then the charity is much more meritorious, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues distressed mindes, than distressed bodies. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to break through these mists (with how little wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome soeuer, yet with reuerent good-will) I must first compare the state you were in, with that wherein you stand now: then your nature with your Lords: and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:21544:160"/>
lastly, the priuiledges of a Wife, with the authorities of a Husband.</p>
                  <p>When you married him, I know for your part, hee was your first Loue; and I iudge the like of him. What the freedome, and simplicity of those humours were, euery man is a witnesse, that hath not forgotten his own youth. And though it be rather a counsell of remorse than helpe, to lay before you your errors past; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they teach you to know, that time is it which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the same thing <hi>easie,</hi> and <hi>impossible,</hi> leauing withall an experience for things to come; I must in a word lay occasion past before you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madame!</hi> In those neere coniunctions of society, wherein death is the onely honourable diuorce, there is but one end, which is mutuall ioy in procreation; and to that end two assured waies: The one, by cherishing Affection with Affection: The other, by working Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, while she is yet in her pride, to a Reuerence, which hath more power than it selfe. To which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired aduanta ge, or at least equality; Art, as well as Nature. For Contempt is else as neere as Respect, <hi>the louingest minds being not euer the most louely.</hi> Now though it be true that <hi>affections</hi> are <hi>relatiues,</hi> and <hi>loue</hi> the surest <hi>Adamant of loue;</hi> yet must it not be measured by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate elne of it selfe, since <hi>prodigality yeelds fulnesse, satiety a desire of change</hi> and <hi>change repentance:</hi> but so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered euen in trust, enioying, and all other familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the Appetites of them we would please may still be couetous, and their Strengths rich. Because the decay of either is a point of all Huswifery, and they that are first bankrupt shut vp their doores.</p>
                  <p>In this estate of mindes, onely gouerned by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written lawes of Nature, you did at the beginning liue happily together. Wherein there is a liuely image of that <hi>golden</hi> Age, which the <hi>Allegories</hi> of the <hi>Poets</hi> figure vnto vs. For there Equality guided without absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Earth yeelded fruit without labour, Desert peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in reward, the names of Wealth and Pouerty were strange, no owing in particular, no priuate improuing
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:21544:160"/>
of humors; the traffick being loue, for loue and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, all for all: exorbitant abundance being neuer curious in those <hi>selfe-seeking</hi> Arts, which teare vp the bowels of the earth for the priuate vse of more than milke, and hony. Notwithstanding, since in the vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situdes of things, and times, there must of necessity follow a <hi>Brazen</hi> Age; there ought to be a discreet care in loue: in respect the aduantage will else proue theirs that first vsurpe, and breaking through the lawes of Nature, striue to set downe their owne reaches of Will.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Madame!</hi> had it beene in your power; you should haue framed that second way of peace, studying to keepe him from euill, whose corruption could not be without misfortune to you.
For there is no man, but <q>doth first fall from his duties to himself, before he can fall away from his duty to others.</q> This second way is, that where affection is made but the <hi>gold,</hi> to hold a <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> farre more pretious than it selfe: I meane Respect, and Reuerence; which two powers, well mixed, haue exceeding strong, and strange variety of working. For instance, take <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> who (<hi>Plutarch</hi> saith) loued worthinesse for his Mothers sake. And though true loue containe them both, yet because our corruption hath, by want of differences, both confounded words, and beings, I must vulgarly distinguish names, as they are current.</p>
                  <p>The wayes to this Respect, and Reuerence (as shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes to the bodies of worth) are placed not in the Sense, but Vnderstanding; where they stand vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse degrees, and strengths of Reason, not to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the flattering familiarity of inferior hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; as hauing no affinity with desire, and remorse; high, or low estate: Whence we see Kings sometimes receiue them not from their Vassals, but rather pay them as tributes to them. In this mystery lies hidden that which some call (applying it to matters of Estate) the <hi>Art of Gouernment;</hi> others the Art of men; whereby Equality is made vnequall, and freedome brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21544:161"/>
subiection. Example all Soueraigne Estates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ouer other men, borne as free as their Rulers; and those Soueraignes ruled againe, by the aduantage of worth in their inferiors,</p>
                  <p>Into this superiority (<hi>Noble Lady</hi>) it seemes, your Husband hath stept before you, not by any counsell of Worth, which with a naturall motion drawes respect and reuerence vpward; but by a crafty obseruing the weakenesse of men, wherewith men are best acquainted. For as our desires are more vntemperately earnest than Womens; so are our repentances more strange, and easily inclined to change, if not to loathing. Of which <hi>forbidden tree</hi> when the affections haue once tasted, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, as in the <hi>Brazen</hi> age, naked <hi>Eue</hi> must hide her shame, sowe that she will reape, and no more enioy the full measures of reciprocall loue, but be stinted with the vnconstant proportions of Power, and Will. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the knowledge of euill doth euer teach the first Offender to seeke aduantage; and so when they haue sinned against the true Equalities of loue, to take pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge in the false sanctuaries of place, person, sexe, or time; deceiuing the truth with that which should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. Here diuision drawes out her vnreconciled <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralels,</hi> to make the vnity of man and wife, to become lesse one; and then it followes, that they which yeeld most doe not command most, as before in the lawes of naturall affection: but contrarywise, they that giue, enrich them that take, they that loue must suffer, and the best is sure to be worst vs'd. Because the ends of society are no more now to <hi>loue,</hi> or equally partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, but absolutely to <hi>rule;</hi> and where that is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, what need <hi>Statutes,</hi> or <hi>Recognizances</hi> to tye those humble natures, that passe away the <hi>Fee-simple</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, either with Selfe-louingnesse, or superstitious opinion of Duty? For it is with them, as with the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers</hi> that runne out their waters into the Sea <hi>Caspium;</hi> the more goodnesse, the lesse returne.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this step, it seemes, your Husband stood, when he began to thinke of something more than <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi>

                     <hi>enioying;</hi> as drawing the familiaritie of natiue Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections vnder the affected absolutenesse of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands power. Here false Pleasure (which springs and withers with our flesh) began, as <hi>Gluttony</hi> doth, to kindle new appetite with variety of meates. Here comes in change of delights, and delight in change; the riches of desire in that it hath not; the triumphs of opinion, which though the flesh of any one bee a true Map of all flesh, yet doth it racke vs still with ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous longing after strange, and vgly Images of it. For the restlesse confusion of Error hath this plague, that her peace must be still in the power of others, where Nature hath placed both the way, and guide of true peace within our selues. But who are they that can walke this <hi>milky way?</hi> Not those vnconstant spirits, which are wandred into the wildernesse of desire; nor those, whose vgly prospect is vnrepentant horrour; whose senses are but Spies of Conscience vpon their faults; their Reasons purchased into bondage, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of their <hi>seruant-affections;</hi> and whose informing Consciences stand, like <hi>Tormentors,</hi> with stained tables to giue in euidence of secret deformity. No <hi>Madam;</hi> This <hi>milkin way</hi> for those single, and simple spirits, who foolish, and ignorant in euill, thinke the passage to it hard, if not impossible; or when they idly slip, doe yet recouer, with a <hi>regenerate industry;</hi> not ioying, as those other vagabond soules, after they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued themselues, to stray abroad, and deceiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>This is a generall description of the fall of Mindes; wherein there is notwithstanding an Infancie, and a Mans estate; because as easie as the <hi>euill</hi> is, yet no man <hi>growes by and by to her extremities.</hi> Besides, there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and differences, according to the state, frame, and mixture of Humours in the body: some inclin'd to one frailty, some to another; some languishing, some violent; some proper to ages, fortunes, times, with such expectations as are in particulars vnder all vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall rules.</p>

                  <p>SInce therefore in this Glasse you may see where you were, and where you are; there rests now a consideration of the <hi>limited authorities</hi> of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and the priuiledges of a Wife; vpon which I will not stand long: Because you poore Wiues doe in that, runne a common fortune with those Estates, which by vsurpation of time, or violence, haue nothing left of their former Conquests, or greatnesse, but fame, and ruine. So as I will not vainely trauaile to winne that againe, which corruption, and confusion haue won of you, and the truth; but onely make mention of their names, or natures in passing; as they serue to your end; and open those other three wayes, which in the <hi>falne</hi> estate, wherein you stand, offer themselves to your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. The first is to <hi>mend</hi> him: the second, to <hi>master</hi> both his euill, and his estate: the third, to <hi>please</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>Vnto <hi>amends</hi> (<hi>Miracles being aboue our power</hi>) there is required either the authority of <hi>credit,</hi> or <hi>fauor.</hi> For <hi>credit,</hi> how you should haue any by the truth, where it hath none, your owne Wisedome can answere you; and that it hath none, his faults to himselfe, and you, are pregnant witnesses. What little <hi>fauor</hi> you haue, if you repeate the story of his life to your selfe, it will be manifest. For first (you know) his deuotion, &amp; affection, are long since carryed from you to his <hi>Mistresse;</hi> by which reuerend name men commonly call those, whom they meane, by corrupting, to make their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. And though shee, either out of craft, or cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, deny him the enioying of her body; yet is that no aduantage to you: To him it is the <hi>Art</hi> of his ruine. For <hi>vnsatisfied desire is too earnest for counsell, too confident for mistrust, too omnipotent for remorse.</hi> So as, right like the poëticall image of <hi>Phaëton,</hi> it inflameth the whole <hi>Horizon</hi> of Mans nature with irregular, and dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd motions. What wonderfull effects those enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing denials haue wrought, there are records in euery
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:21544:162"/>
Age. The same <hi>Poëts</hi> make, in the chastity of <hi>Diana, Endymion</hi> our example. <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> with his constante re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall of <hi>Phaedra,</hi> and his deuotion to <hi>Phoebe,</hi> a Martyr. The fable of <hi>Ixion,</hi> where instead of <hi>Iuno</hi> he embrac'd a <hi>cloud,</hi> begetting monsters in strong imagination; with many moe. All which doe but expresse, how farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wonder we stand in of this <hi>well-disguised ashes,</hi> your flesh, while the wheeles of desire are woond vp, than when they are run out with enioying. For in this craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty forge are framed wanton modesty, entising shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'dnesse, faint reproofes, with what other charmes so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer are fit to stirre vp the blindnesse of our Selfe-loue, or Pitty.</p>
                  <p>But methinkes (<hi>Noble Lady</hi>) I euen now see your face blush, while your thoughts tell me, that your <hi>Lords</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections haue so many vents, as there is no danger of breaking the vessell with fulnesse; nor yet of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying deuotion, by restraint. It is true, that <hi>Liberty disperseth,</hi> and so makes the streames of fantasie lesse vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent: Notwithstanding, <hi>Dotage</hi> is an <hi>vnscrutable depth,</hi> it puts seales to blancks, makes contradictories true, and sees all things in the superlatiue degree. To be short, it is a prospect into the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Ignorance;</hi> which (they say) no man can describe, but he that is past it. Nay, it is such a kinde of enchantment, as makes the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse of others endeere her bewitching refusalls; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety, which iudgeth with scorne, yet honours her; <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> being no more able to qualifie desire, than <hi>Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is to reuiue it. So as you being already bankrupt in his fauour, in this course of amends, I will onely aduise you to pray, if your <hi>faith</hi> serue: or if you will goe farther, I must bring against you the fatall doomes of <hi>Sisyphus,</hi> rowling the stone; <hi>Belides</hi> filling the sieue; with the <hi>Poets</hi> phrases of <hi>catching the wind, ploughing the Seas,</hi> and such like <hi>Metaphoricall Hyperboles,</hi> as describing infinite, and impossible, lay them to your charge. Therefore (<hi>worthy Lady</hi>) remember <hi>AEsop;</hi> seeke not your Husband against the streame, vntill he be dead.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Master</hi> his mind, which is the second way, hath
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21544:163"/>
yet in the fore-front some more possibilitie. For the evill is <hi>malitious,</hi> and yet <hi>subiect, changing,</hi> because <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection cannot stand alone; amorous,</hi> for that <hi>euery thing seemes louely, compared with the deformitie of euill it selfe.</hi> But it may please you to remember, that <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi> hath so strong a wall of craft about it, as it is hard by sophistication of Wit; to master the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of euill: it being old borne with vs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with euery corner, accesse and recesse of our mi ndes. Besides, it comes not into the nature of man with cleare, and open euidence, as true theirs doe; but as Vsurpers, whose vnderminings are hardly to bee seene, while they may be preuented; and when they are seene, beyond care, or contention. For the <hi>being of e uill</hi> being nothing, but onely <hi>a depriuing of the good,</hi> and <hi>the captiuing of our free-will-lights to the workes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi> it must needs come to passe, that when her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering venimes are once distilled through all our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and wee won with our selues, that there can bee no thought within vs to heare, or entreat; and without vs, though Authority may cut off the infection of ill Example from others, yet can it no more take away the Diuels part in vs, than call vp the dead. Out of which I conclude: <hi>whatsoeuer cannot be mended</hi> (without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) <hi>cannot be ruled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if you will examine the preeminences of a Husbands estate, you shall soone discouer what huge armies of Vsurpation, Custome, Municipall Lawes, are in this strife of mastering him against you; truth in some degree; fortune, and opinion vniuersally. <hi>Archime des</hi> held that it was possible by Art to <hi>remoue the vnremoueable Earth,</hi> if he could find vpon what <hi>Basis</hi> hee might fix the foot of his engine: the same doubt I may make to you, which is, where you will lay the ground of that strength, which should master him? If vpon his <hi>Humours;</hi> then (as I said) the centre is Craft; the circumference Inconstancie; neither strong ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, nor vices; but changing, and irregular <hi>fantasie;</hi> as <hi>vnfit to rule, as hard to beruled:</hi> especially since ill Nature
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:21544:163"/>
and good Fortune learn easilyto know their strengths, &amp; like proud Cowards, tyrannize where they find right in the guard of loue, or weakenesse. If vpon his <hi>estate,</hi> then doe you assaile him in his strength. For hee is by lawes aboue you: the words of your Contract, <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> of his, <hi>Love:</hi> the Reuenew his, Liberty his friend, Honour scarce indifferent, Fame against you; prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting euer on the side of <hi>Strength,</hi> not of <hi>right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as contention with Superiors is but that which the Poets figure in the fable of <hi>Anteus</hi> wrestling with <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> wherein they feigne him euer too weake, while hee was lifted from his earth, and his onely recouery of strength by falling to it. This earth of your estate is Patience, and Humility; aboue which what light desire, or offence soeuer doth lift you, lifts you aboue the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges of a Wife, and with more harme, and losse, will at the last make you fall, to vnderstand your own estate.</p>
                  <p>If you trust not these prophane Images, I will lay a diuine before you; that you may see iniust &amp; impossible haue like condemnation both in Nature, and Grace. When the fleshly <hi>Babylonians</hi> went about to preuent a second deluge, and so with Mans power to limit Gods; they purposed to raise a <hi>Tower</hi> equall to the heauens, thinking thereby, that God should either fauour their dwellings, or destroy his owne. What came vpon them? Marry, <hi>a confusion of tongues,</hi> to the end, that they which vnderstood not their Maker, might much lesse vnderstand themselues. <q>An excellent course of the Wisedome, to punish vaine ends by fruitlesse labors.</q> And sure the like Destiny lies wrapt vp still, to fall vpon those, that for want of measuring their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires with the circumstances of time, estate, and worth, doe vndertake the <hi>Giants warre,</hi> and so burie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their owne earth. Therefore by my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (<hi>Honourable Lady</hi>) you shall in stead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering him, master your selfe; and auoid that other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent course, which requires wilfull vrging, seruile pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, broken shame, with all kinds of <hi>indecorum;</hi> such as the worst speed best with; and yet so, as they that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:21544:164"/>
winne their Ends, are sure to lose their Honours. Yea, the Truth is in euery part such a proofe of it selfe, as who so will narrowly obserue the complexions of those Wiues, that vsurpe vpon the authority of their Husbands, shall see, that the very change of the office, workes almost a <hi>Metamorphosis in</hi> Nature; the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man growing mannish, and the Man womanish. For it is most true that Ages, and Sexes haue their distinct Lawes; so as the same is not the same in both, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse; as the Wise man saith Vertues be in men, &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Our fame lying in hazard, armies, bloud; theirs in silence, modestie, restraint: Our Reputations not easily shaken, and many wayes repaired; theirs, like <hi>Glasse,</hi> by and by broken, and impossible to bee healed. Since therefore your owne <hi>Genius,</hi> Honor, and Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, do all oppose against this aduentrous practise, let vs leaue it; and conclude with the Poet, that
<q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Who so will the Deuils Master bee,</l>
                           <l>Must haue a mind more mischieuous than he.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last point, which is to <hi>please,</hi> hath in it a face both of Diuine, and humane Duty; possibilitie in the censure of rumour, that speakes most, and knows least. Besides, the meanes that are vsed in it, as Vowes, Prayers, Sacrifice, Obedience, &amp;c. are all milde Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels; and such as rather <hi>enrich,</hi> than <hi>impouerish</hi> those that vse them. Let vs therefore striue to wade through or swimme ouer this depth of <hi>Pleasing:</hi> in which there are two branches, either to please him with <hi>your selfe;</hi> or with his <hi>owne humours.</hi> To please him with <hi>your selfe</hi> (considering the Map wee haue already described his Nature in) I thinke you must be sometimes short, sometimes long; now faire, now browne; wanton, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, &amp; al at once. <q>For they must take on many shapes, that will please a man of many mindes; sense being there a Iudge; motion quiet; and their felicity in such wandring desires, as onely ioy till they doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy.</q> So as these two excellent mediators; <hi>Worth,</hi> and <hi>Merit;</hi> can be no more to them than light is to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or musicke to the dease. Nay, Beauty it selfe,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:21544:164"/>
which is the <hi>obiect of vncorrupted sense,</hi> is nothing vnto these sensuall natures; who are so bewitched with this disease of Nouelty, as vnwealdy fatnesse, discoloured skinne, and such like vncouth prouokers of appetite, are often dearest vnto them.
What hope then to stay, or fixe this vagabond <hi>Lust?</hi> 
                     <q>Since as those <hi>Shadows</hi> that goe before the bodies which make them, can never by the same bodies be ouertaken:</q> so these shadowy natures haue neitherstrength enough to leaue worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of others, nor to esteeme those that worship themselues; but like <hi>Smokes,</hi> kindled with euery flame, are dissolued againe into euery new ayre about them.</p>
                  <p>The second of these branches is, to please him with <hi>himselfe.</hi> For the better vnderstanding of which course, if we doe examine the wayes that common Subiects doe hold vnder the vnquiet nature of Power; wee shall finde that way doth corrupt vs, in not working a large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but narrownesse of heart: and so making vs, like the <hi>little flies,</hi> apt to couet after the flattering light, wherein we burne. For vpon this Stage, if Superiors delight in <hi>lust,</hi> Panders are the Ministers of Credit; if in <hi>wealth,</hi> the sparing negatiue voyces be the counsels of Aduancement; if they be <hi>iealous,</hi> then the deprauing Corporations, which keepe downe all spirits of hope, all encouragements of honor, with false narrow axioms of Tyranny, are the charmers we must giue eare vnto: helping to drowne our Superiours in the inundation of their owne follies, and make their Thrones a <hi>Grange,</hi> wherein there shall be nothing but selling of Honour, to purchase scorne abroad, and seruile feare at home. <q>For it is most true; that the Iealousie of Vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in power is so infinite, as where sloth, ignorance or basenesse haue once giuen it leaue to giue Law, it endures none vnder it, but such as are either outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deformed, and so borne with their owne crosses; or inwardly defectiue in wit, and courage; the right estate of those mindes, which though they be borne free in the lawes of Nations, are yet slaues in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:21544:165"/>
moulds of their own affections; or lastly, such, as in the extremitie of want, or obscurenesse of birth,  must be long Prentises to their Superiours.</q>
How vgly a prospect such rootes, and branches must be to all free mindes, you shall easily see, if it please you to look vpon the Poeticall <hi>Mappe;</hi> wherein the Painter liuely describing a Pageant of worldly vanities, with the plagues, and deformities of euery sinne, represents mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen humane shapes vnto vs; either long tayles, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen feet, hornes, or such like Antikes, as with too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or too few members liuely represent vs the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous births of error.  And when you haue exactly view'd it, I dare vndertake, you shall not see in that Mappe so horrible, and fearefull images to the soules of men; as you shall in those tyrannicall courts to the bodies, and fortunes of the worthiest, and not without danger to the <hi>Libertines.</hi> 
                     <q>Since as true Worth is euer iealous to the fearefull nature of Tyrants: so are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme vnworthinesses a scorn, both to their pride, and power.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Madame!</hi> by the ill example, and dangerous consequence in these misgouern'd Courts of Princes, you may comparatiuely see what such by-wayes will worke in a priuate family: Faults hauing there no <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to couer them, nor yet great hopes to excuse errors. So that, the ends, and instruments, being both of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity base; and neither with Vertue, nor Fortune re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd from the scorne of seruile vices; it must needs be with them, as with the sinkes, and vessels of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which they that vse are asham'd to haue appeare. Besides, the reproch will be greater in meane estates; because there they want the helps of feare, which maks Murmur wary how shee speakes aloud of Power; and redeemes imperfections with rewards of magnificence and liberality. Againe, if you will needs corrupt your selfe, to make the line you leuell by, more crooked; then must your first step be ouer the shoes in <hi>Shame.</hi> For you must combine with his Mistris, who will perchance measure you forth some part of that, wherof the whole
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21544:165"/>
is yours: I meane your Husbands loue. And whether she will, in this false glasse of Dotage, discouer your fall of spirit, and so teach him to be more absolute, it is doubtfull; <q>because the more sandy the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Craft be, the more charge, and care is euer to be vsed in building vpon it.</q> Moreouer, this is one essentiall difference, betweene the counsell of Honour, and Craft; that if the successe of Subtilty be euill, it doth blast, and blacke the stocke it is grafted in, where the counsell of Honour doth in mischance it selfe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the reputations of them that bee gouerned by it.</p>
                  <p>Therfore (as I said) if you will aduenture vpon these vnfound counsels, which haue base conditions, hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding successe, and infallible infamy; you must first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face honour, shame, religion, and all other honest limits in your selfe: <q>because it is an vnprosperous, and half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted course, to thinke of remorse, after counsell ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to haue good by the Deuill. And who but those natures that can be as euil as they list, are fit to guide themselues by that iron Industry, wakefull Faithles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, aduantageous Contracts, which they must passe through that intend to master, or please corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted  Power?</q> The conclusion, and end of my counsell therefore is, onely to perswade you, that you neuer stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be wiser than the truth; and so neither striue to <hi>master, mend,</hi> or <hi>please</hi> him.</p>

                  <p>To beginne therefore with our <hi>flesh.</hi> Euer since the <hi>curse of bondage,</hi> which God breathed out vpon the <hi>first sinne,</hi> each degree of life in it is onely a change, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety  of seruitude. <q>The Childs innocency being in weakenesse, his food in the Nurse, his frailties vnder the rod; Man vnder man, his faults vnder Lawes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vnder will; <hi>nothing constant but the inconstancy of the euil,</hi> and her appearance of liberty the extremest of of all bondage</q> Nay, to goe further; the vniuersall corruption of inferior Elements is such, as euen world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisedome it selfe workes but as our <hi>vulgar Physicke</hi> doth, which passing through the imperfections, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties of our natures, and diseases, doth helpe and hurt together; still multiplying the <hi>curse</hi> of our <hi>fall,</hi> in the false changes of diseases, and cures; appetites and opinions. Neither can the confluence of <hi>worldly</hi> things yeeld any other rest or stability, than such as is in the <hi>Kingdome of sleepe,</hi> where the best is but <hi>a dreame.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where <hi>imperfection</hi> is, there <hi>disquiet</hi> must be; and where <hi>disquiet</hi> gouernes, there Nature is as apt to <hi>wander,</hi>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:21544:166"/>
as to be <hi>weary. Nouelties</hi> (like <hi>instants</hi>) come, and passe; that which we desire proues like to that we haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy'd; the <hi>faire</hi> deceiues, and the <hi>vntasted</hi> is onely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing. Wee may therefore as well seeke <hi>fish</hi> vpon the <hi>mountaines, trees</hi> in the <hi>Sea,</hi> as <hi>peace</hi> in <hi>flesh:</hi> which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a promise to them that care not to finde it there. To proue this; if we obserue the progresse betweene God and vs: In his first Testament, the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the condition of <hi>sixe dayes labour,</hi> not of rest: here a figure only, hereafter a being; in this life a thing we taste of by <hi>faith,</hi> performed in eternity to them that haue passed through this flesh as an <hi>Inne,</hi> not as an <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> So as this Body, this composition of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is but onely a <hi>purgatory of the soule,</hi> either to cleanse, or corrupt, as the Affections of it looke vp or downe.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Madame!</hi> now that wee haue done with this fleshly prospect, if we consider the <hi>World,</hi> we shall finde that to be vnto a man (like a <hi>Sea</hi> to an <hi>Island</hi>) full of stormes, vncertaineties, violence; whose confusions haue neither <hi>iustice,</hi> nor <hi>mercy</hi> in them. If we examine the motiues that caused the man to make Art his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and borrow wooden feet to walk ouer her mouing waters; we shall finde them to haue beene Necessity, Couetousnesse, Curiosity, Ambition, and some such other enemies to rest, as with false Greatnesses (while men could not endure little things) inforced them through paine, and danger, to suffer all the torments of vncertainty. To apply which comparison <hi>Madame!</hi> you shall see the same impotent humours are they, who hauing first wearied vs within, doe after perswade vs to seeke peace in the World without; where we being forced to wrestle with others, because we could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome our selues, in stead of one euill are constrain'd to encounter many.  And iustly; since where in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wayes to peace, man needs no Lawes but Gods, and his owne Obedience; if he once goe into trafficke with the World, his desires are there bound with the <hi>snares</hi> of Custome, the <hi>heauy hand</hi> of Power, the <hi>enammels</hi>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:21544:167"/>
of Authority, which conceale (as the Poets say) vnder the <hi>golden garments</hi> of <hi>Pandora,</hi> all the venome of her <hi>bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen tonne.</hi> 
                     <q>And in that bottomelesse pit of Humours shall we not finde deceit as infinite as desire; Honour but the throne of Care; Prosperity both the child and  mother of labour?</q> To be short, we shall there finde (though too late) that all Fortunes, and Misfortunes are but moulds of momentary Affections, spunne out with proportion, or disproportion of Time, Place, and Natures. So as since no estate can priuiledge this life from death, sicknesse, paine (<hi>Power it selfe being alike fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and fearefull</hi>) must we not thinke to gather our <hi>roses</hi> among <hi>thornes,</hi> and consequently the World to be a <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering glasse,</hi> wherein man rather sees how to change, or adorne his euils, than any way to reduce, or amend them?</p>
                  <p>Through this false Paradise (<hi>Noble Lady</hi>) we must therefore passe, as <hi>Vlysses</hi> did by the enchanted desarts of <hi>Circe;</hi> stopping our eares, and closing our eyes, lest our rebellious senses, as apt to flatter, as to be flattered, chance to take part with the diuersity of beguiling ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and so lead our misty vnderstandings captiue to perdition. The company of <hi>Vlysses</hi> (like multitudes strange in <hi>sense,</hi> and weake in <hi>reason</hi>) by making loue to their owne harme, were with open cares, and eyes, transformed into sundry shapes of beasts: the Poets figuring to vs, in them, the diuerse deformities of <hi>bewitching frailties,</hi> wherewith for lacke of diuine Grace, or humane Caution, they get power to ensnare vs.  And in this captiuity, let no Ignorance seem to excuse Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; since the <hi>light of truth</hi> is still neere vs; the <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and accuser at such continuall warre within vs; the <hi>Lawes</hi> that guide, so good for them that obey; and the <q>first shape of euery sinne so vgly, as whosoeuer does but what he knowes, or forbeares what he doubts,</q> shall easily follow Nature vnto Grace: and if he in that way obtaine not the <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of <hi>eternity,</hi> yet shall he purchase the Worlds time, and eternity, by <hi>morall fame.</hi> For <hi>Obedience,</hi> not curiosity; as in heauenly, so
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:21544:167"/>
in earthly things is the most <hi>acceptable sacrifice of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi> Because this inherent tribute of Nature vnto Power (like a reuealed light of vniuersall Grace) refines Mans <hi>reason,</hi> rectifies his <hi>will,</hi> turnes his <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries,</hi> and learnings inward againe whence they came, ioynes words with things, and reduceth both of them to their first beings. To conclude, this is that inward fabricke, by which we doe what we thinke, and speake what wee doe.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Madame!</hi> In this narrow path, your helps, both against inward assaults, and outward temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, must be those moderate sweet humours which I haue knowne to bee in you, and some of yours. This Moderation of desires being a farre freer, and surer way, than the satisfying of them can bee; <hi>Repentance</hi> following the one, and <hi>Peace</hi> the other; the one course making Nature go as well too fast backe, as forwards; and so must consequently offend others with that which first offended themselues: where these moderate Affections doe with a naturall Harmony please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and then must not the Ayre of that vntroubled world naturally yeeld peace to euery creature that breathes in or about it? Besides, this Moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brings forth few desires; strong humblenes to pay the tributes of Power, Patience, as an armour against oppression; Truth, as a sacrifice: whereby the World which giues but what it hath; and the euill of others, that desires to oppresse, or infect; can the hardlier finde meanes to trouble them, or colour why they should study to doe it. My counsell is therefore <hi>Madame!</hi> that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich your selfe vpon your owne stocke; not looking outwardly, but inwardly for the fruit of <hi>true Peace,</hi> whose rootes are there; and all outward things but ornaments, or branches, which impart their sweet fruits with the humble spirit of others.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Noble Lady!</hi> because you are a Woman, and a Wife; and by the Lawes of both these estates, in some measure ordain'd to liue vnder meane, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame authority: my intent is not, while I perswade

you from the captious <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of practise; to leaue you without such reasonable latitudes, as Passengers haue in their trauailes, who when they cannot clime ouer steepe mountaines, find means to go about them, and so by length cut away the danger, or possibilitie of precipitation. In which course <hi>Madam!</hi> because <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents are esteemed the best guides for humane ignorance to follow;</hi> I will first lay before you the Opinions of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, borne vnder Tyrants, and bound to obey, though they could not please; the comparison hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in some affinity betweene a Wifes subiection to her Husband, and a Subiects obedience to his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. <hi>Brutus</hi> would leaue nothing in his mind <hi>feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> to Power, nor in his fortune exorbitantly to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted; as resolute either to be safe by Innocencie, or Contempt; or if both failed yet to haue <hi>extremitie a warrant against extremities.</hi> Some haue thought the way of security to be in <hi>not vnderstanding</hi> the abstruse cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Power. Others aduise vs (with the <hi>Moone</hi>) to acknowledge all our light to the <hi>Sunne.</hi> Some would haue vs imitate the <hi>Spheres,</hi> who carried about with the violent course of the <hi>first Mouer,</hi> doe yet steale on in their <hi>natur all,</hi> which slow, and vnsensible motion; with many of like nature, which I forbeare to number, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that <hi>no man can gouern his life wholly by precepts:</hi> 
                     <q>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Wisdome it selfe varying with circumstance of occasion, place, time, and nature; and so neither the same in all things, nor still the same in any.</q>

Because all things there are so gouern'd by the two false rudders of <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> as though (like the boat of <hi>Charon</hi>) they refuse no passinger, yet carry they none ouer either into Rest, or Honour. In example of Diuine power; when God led the children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of bondage into the land of promise, to witnesse his Omnipotencie, he vsed the miracle of <hi>cloud</hi> and <hi>pillar;</hi> one to <hi>lighten</hi> darkenesse, the other to <hi>shadow</hi> the beames of glory: which <q>two signes the people of God had reason to adore; since it is credible that hee who created the world should be in loue with his worke; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee not curious to deceiue, in whose power it was to create, maintaine, and destroy. Besides to giue all, and take nothing, proceeds of an vncaused good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and so necessarily of an vnabusing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Princes of the earth haue two like ensignes; viz. <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Hope:</hi> the pretence of the one, to awake our dull spirits out of the idle sleepes of ignorance to serue the ends of actiue spirits; the other, to keepe the exorbitant desires of multitudes vnder the seruice, and cautious of supreme Will. Of these humane clouds, and pillars we haue more reason to be iealous. First, in respect that whatsoeuer is created, is affraid of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and so in loue with it selfe. Then because wee know, that as many Riuers must lose their names, to make vp one Sea: so Absolutenesse must winne, and keepe aboue, with the losse of all, or at least many branches of vniuersall Freedome. And therefore the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:21544:169"/>
Fox did not conclude amisse, when he saw his fellowes steps march towards the Lions denne, and none return, <hi>Nos haec vestigia terrent.</hi> But more clearly to discerne these gilt, or painted fetters, from a true golden free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let vs examine the specious wisedomes of mans <hi>absolute Gouernements:</hi> and for the most part wee shall find them to maintaine that which is stollen by craft; vsurpations by might; and for a further enlargement of their narrow foundations, to stroake vs with our owne hands, threaten vs with our owne strengths, and reward vs with the spoyles of our owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
                  <p>Yea, so much they abhorre equality from whence they came, as they clime ouer Law, Religion, and Truth, to keepe more and more aboue that sweet or be of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and equall peasing Lawes. If then euen the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and foolish spirits doe feele enough to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this, of what haue we more cause to be idealous, than of these two cloudy pillars <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Feare?</hi> Since by no other racke can the Nature of man be more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improued to the aduantage of Power, and disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his natiue freedome: the one bewitching, the other amazing vs; the one mastering the strength of number with a multitude of scattered desires, the other entising, or forcing vs to giue away our rights for feare to lose them: both (as they say of <hi>Esops dogge</hi>) making vs forsake the <hi>true flesh,</hi> to catch at the reflexion of <hi>Shaddowes.</hi> So that the best course for vs inferiors is, neither (like little children) to play away our times with the babies which we our selues haue made; nor yet to feare the Antickes of our owne painting; since we lend the hornes, and nayles which make them vgly, but rather to suppresse desire, and affections within our selues, by which we shall wither <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Feare</hi> (<hi>two crafty spies of Power</hi>) giuing intelligence what may be forced within vs, hereby to enhaunse the tributes of Tyranny, till it haue drawne vp our browes after our sweat, and giuen lawes to thirst, as well as drinking. Therefore <hi>Madame!</hi> vntill the smart of sense haue so v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:21544:169"/>
will and vnderstanding, as all men in like for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes may haue like ends; till the beasts beginne to know their strengths; the vnwritten lawes blot out the written; and the temporall cease vnder the eternall; there is neither in yours, nor in any other subiection, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>true peace</hi> to be gotten by <hi>trust</hi> of <hi>Superiors;</hi> nor <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> by <hi>strife</hi> against them. Whence may I not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratiuely conclude, that <hi>wakefull Power must needs winne of all inferiors, who striue or venture to win of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Madame!</hi> when Nature in her vniuersall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge foresaw this distresse, or taxe, like to fall vpon her freedome; she, which is no step-mother to any of hers, straightwaies gaue Honour more wings than one, to the end, those which cannot haue it in commanding, might haue it in obeying; and those that want power to <hi>doe nobly,</hi> may yet finde latitudes to <hi>suffer nobly</hi> in. Out of this came the Wise-mans words, deliuered vnto vs from the trauailes of his minde: That <hi>there are times to rest, and times to labour; Times to be well, and times to be sicke; times to hope, and times to vnhope, &amp;c.</hi> In which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoping time you must resolue to finde your selfe, and by counsell of the Wisdome limit all vnquietnesse of desires; lest they being vnseasonable, adde shame to your other misfortunes. Let nothing therefore make you hope, where an ecclipse of many humours hath darkned your Sunne. Trust not; for <hi>vnlouelinesse, and vnworthinesse are euer vnsafe.</hi> Venture not; for besides that this fortune is in it selfe misfortune, <hi>Power</hi> being too hard for <hi>right,</hi> the very Multitude, who iudge of <q>actions by the whorish conduct of effects,</q> will by and by censure them that vndertake, and prosper not, either vainely to haue fixed impossible ends to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or foolishly neglected the meanes: and from these grounds euer conclude aduersity in the wrong, and prosperity in the right.  If your <hi>Ladyship</hi> desire <q>a reason of this error, it is; because Mens common iudgements vpon common same, neither will, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can, well examine the different constellation betweene your Husbands nature, and yours; your
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:21544:170"/>
merits, his demerits: but will infallibly sticke fast in the skinne, and outside of estates, preeminences, and authorities; iudging well of that in their folly, which in their basenesse they resolued to worship.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be short; the Wit of People is so many times vnder the truth, and their Care so much lesse than their Wit; <q>as it is with them euer a lesse fault to doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury than to haue ill lucke.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Noble Lady!</hi> I cannot aduise you either to complaine, or mutiny against the stronger; for the one discouers inconsiderate weaknesse, the other langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing errors: but rather as the vegetable things in the wisdome of nature doe, so aduise your <hi>Ladiship</hi> to doe; which is draw all your sap, in this Winter of thoughts, downe to the root; and be content to want leaues, till the sweet Spring of time, or occasion come to inuite them vp againe. For besides that these Iuries of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion will euer when they doe best looke vpon Law, and not Equity; vpon Custome, not on Nature; Strength, &amp; not Right: euen the clearest humane iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will hardly conceiue so monstrously of mankind, as shall be sufficient to acquit you, and condemne your Husband. The reason is; because these extremities of good, or euill will not easily be beleeued to raigne in these middle natures of flesh, and blood: In respect that GOD hath decreed the Angels to heauen, the Diuels to hell; and left the earth to Man, as a meane creation betweene these two extremes. So that he must be a kinde of Diuell himselfe, that can easily beleeue there should be Diuels raigning within, or amongst vs. Besides <hi>Madame!</hi> how vncomely it were for you (like the <hi>Crow</hi>) to goe out of your <hi>Arke</hi> of duty, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer extraordinary <hi>Seas</hi> of vanity in your Husband, the Lawes of Honour will tell you. Let God the <hi>searcher of hearts,</hi> and Time the <hi>discouerer offaults,</hi> moue those links of shame, and punishment, whereto our errors are tyed; and let it be enough for you hence-forwards not tow or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Idols, <hi>who haue eyes that see not, and eares that heare not.</hi> For, as they say, when euery <hi>particular</hi> dies, he hath
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:21544:170"/>
his <hi>owne doome;</hi> though the generall <hi>Doomes-day</hi> bee to come: so may I say; that what soeuer your husband hath to all the world else, he hath neither life, loue nor sense to you. Therefore since Power lies in him; Desire and Dutie in you; pay your tribute, doe your homage, and make your reward to bee the secret peace of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing; cutting off all other thoughts of rest by him, who not hauing of it in himselfe, cannot possibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it vpon others. For by that meanes your Honour will bee safely guarded from these muddy visions of Hope, which (as I said) is one chiefe pillar of incroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Power; and in which the fooles of the world, sleeping away their liberties, doe vainely make Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority their heires.</p>
                  <p>Now that we haue shaken our hopes, the next chiefe engine of power is <hi>terror;</hi> a breath which seemeth to pierce neerer, and not to leaue vs safe or free within our selues. Because it hath slander at commandement, spies, accusers, violence, and oppression; which fooles vnderstand not, and base men giue ouer-much reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto. Against these I can onely say this; that they be the fires in whose heat Worthinesse is re-puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and by whose light the glories of it are farthest seene. So as for these violences of temptations, I perswade you to make <hi>Iob</hi> your example; a type whom God gaue the Diuel leaue to persecute in his <hi>goods,</hi> his <hi>children,</hi> and in his <hi>person</hi> with such infirmities of body, as had both paine, and lothsomenesse in them. And marke againe in the same afflicted <hi>Iob,</hi> in whom the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wisedome of constancy is figured; hee neither did sacrifice to his euill Angell, nor studied amends, or reliefe at the hands of his tempter, but walled his flesh with <hi>patience,</hi> and his conscience with <hi>innocencie:</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the Diuell that which was his; I meane his body, and fortune, subiect by <hi>Adams</hi> discreation to the Prince of sensuality. And what small power the Princes of this world haue ouer the resolutions of Faith, Honour, or Nature, examine (if it please you) by those paines, which your selues suffer for children,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:21544:171"/>
hereticks for opinion, pride for fame, feare for feare; wherein the rod makes the child endure the corrosiue. So as the vnmeasurable measures of these things haue some resemblance with the infinite, yet mercifull <hi>word of God;</hi> wherein the <hi>Lambes</hi> may safely <hi>wade,</hi> while the vaste bodies of the <hi>Elephants</hi> shall be <hi>drowned.</hi> Beleeue therefore with the wise; that betweene misty obiects, and more misty senses, many things doe rather terrifie, than oppresse; and so force fraile mankinde often to labour more in opinion, than in things. To goe farther in this example of <hi>Iob;</hi> you may remember, that it was his Wife that bade him, <hi>Curse God, and dye:</hi> in her sexe the Scripture expressing weakenesse; and in weaknesse, the boasts of rage, and childish violences of passion: yet did <hi>Iob</hi> refuse the Counsell, but not the Wife:
The <q>way of righteousnesse being to hate the <hi>vices,</hi> and not the <hi>persons;</hi> lest contrary to the duties of Charity, and Affinity, we should make our selues a warre with all flesh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, to deale more particularly with this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power; there are but three wayes in which it can be heauy vnto you. Ill dealing with your <hi>selfe:</hi> a hard hand vpon your <hi>children:</hi> or <hi>separation.</hi> For your <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> remember the Image of <hi>Cecropia:</hi> in whose nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and vnlouing nature, there is yet expressed an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable, and bewitched loue of her owne. Besides, the rule is vniuersall; that <hi>where there is no worth within, merits</hi> (like <hi>Cyphers</hi>) <hi>stand for nothing:</hi> because it must be a <hi>spark</hi> that can be made a fire with blowing. Rest ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your religious, and motherly care in this, neither vpon <hi>merit,</hi> nor demerit, but onely vpon his <hi>selfe-loue,</hi> which is such an vnseparable knot betweene frailty and her owne, as it is impossible either to adde, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract any thing from it. And be confident, that while your Husband remaines subiect to his selfe-affections, there will euer be partiality enough within him, to keep his children safe from disinheriting.</p>
                  <p>For your <hi>selfe;</hi> if in your estate he restraine you; first, consider you haue lost his loue, a thing farre more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:21544:171"/>
to your mind (I know) than his fortune can be. And you haue lost withall the experience of that losse, if you haue not learnt by it, to beare the rest more easily. Besides, it is <hi>desire</hi> that <hi>makes vs poore,</hi> or <hi>rich;</hi> so as where you cannot feele necessity, the measure of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or too little, is in your owne moderation; and in this according to the old prouerbe; <hi>No body hurt, but by their owne excesse.</hi> Againe, of all the <hi>Apostles,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member who it was that caried the <hi>purse;</hi> and whether the errour bee a destiny to the Office, or Officer; it is Childish to complaine, and Madnesse to striue with Disaduantage.</p>
                  <p>But perchance this credulous selfe-pittie (which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer makes Opinion more, or lesse than the Truth) may perswade you, that these imprisonments of fortune doe really both imprison Honour, and Nature.
Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (for answere) be pleased to consider; that there is <q>none so poore, but hee may haue <hi>liberall thoughts;</hi>
                     </q> of <hi>wisedome</hi> as much vse as of the <hi>Elements:</hi> For shee is <hi>patience in Misfortune,</hi> and <hi>moderation in good: Chastitie</hi> needes no purple to become it selfe: and as for <hi>Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> Princes can neither command, nor forbid it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, affliction is rather a <hi>spurre</hi> than a <hi>bridle</hi> to that vertue; our flesh being like a <hi>Toppe</hi> which only goes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with whipping. Lastly, pleasure it selfe is not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of bondage; since there may be <hi>peace</hi> within, and <hi>Fame</hi> without, to the <hi>sincere conscience:</hi> So that the error is onely mans, in his not seeking rest in that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune vnder which hee liues; but in Change, which is euer in the power of others. To proue this, let vs goe a little further, and examine of how many complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this pleasure is; some finde it in <hi>labour,</hi> others in <hi>ease;</hi> some in <hi>women,</hi> others in <hi>bookes,</hi> &amp;c. So as there being no truth, but opinion in it; fortune can haue no aduantage of those excellent tempered natures, that when they may not chuse delights, can yet make them to themselues. And who so are not indifferent to this indifferent humour, are but like <hi>little children,</hi> that crie when their parents, or fellowes take their toyes from
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:21544:172"/>
them. Yea, so subiect is our life to the oppressions of Power, Chance, and negligence, as the practise of times will shew; that hee who cannot endure to <hi>lose,</hi> can much more more hardly endure to <hi>liue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of <hi>separation,</hi> which is the last, I wil bestow few words; because I am wel acquainted with your goodnesse, and seuere lawes ouer your selfe. Besides, I know your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands nature, which is rather weakely than strongly euill; full of respects, desires, feares; iealous, and carelesse; factious, and vnresolute; rather incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Craft, than Violence. What bee the counsels of such natures? Whispering, murmur, conspiracy in speech, slander; sweare, and breake; loath, and keepe; dispraise, and loue; a tyrant (in words) valiant ouer a Wife. And from thence all the harme, onely a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of those excellent humours in you, which vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the degrees of euill; while you thinke him worse than hee is, are amazed; and when you hope for better, wounded with being deceiued in him. But learne to know for your owne ease, that <hi>euery man,</hi> though hee would, yet <hi>cannot become excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently evill at once;</hi> since both <hi>weeds,</hi> and <hi>herbs</hi> are more, or lesse perfect in their kindes; according to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of earth, and ayre, wherein they grow. So that your <hi>Ladiship</hi> may bee assured it is vnpossible for his hollow, and wauing minde to goe ouer the shame, and opposition of the World; the swarme, and faction of Wiues; the courage and credit of your priuate Friends; and the customes of <hi>England,</hi> to a diuorce; though you were as ill as he would haue you: much lesse hauing a well-gouerned Innocency, with all these other humane guards, to breake thorough.</p>

                  <p>IF you therefore stand firme against the temptations of <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Hope;</hi> there remaines an excellent end in your passage, to which all those necessities, and misfortunes are no other kindes of lets, than <hi>raine,</hi> or
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:21544:172"/>
                     <hi>stormes</hi> vpon the land be, which cannot stay resolued passengers, though it moyle their clothes, and make their way slippery. This end is, to haue the honour of being an <hi>excellent wife:</hi> in which womanlike ambition, the principall actor is <hi>Obedience;</hi> an attribute from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to superior duties. I speake not of <hi>loue,</hi> since that wonderfull affection must be stirr'd either by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary worth, or by a naturall sympathy of loue againe; both which obiects I thinke your estate in your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to be very barren of, and therefore aduise you to nothing vnnecessary, or vnpossible. To satisfie our selues that <hi>Obedience</hi> is necessary, let vs againe examine the nature of Authority; and we shall finde it to bee, <hi>A commanding power, that hath relation to the obedience of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors.</hi> And then if we consider from what root it sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, we shall find it to be, out of nature in some things, in others from a lauish giuing away of our owne liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thirdly, that prescription, which binds equals, still giues superiors an increase of freedome. Fourthly, that custome priuiledgeth humours aboue nature, so as time must pull downe that which aduantage, and time hath established. Out of which particulars I thinke we may conclude <hi>Obedience</hi> to be necessary; and that <q>they who striue to remoue the vnremoueable rockes with chaines draw themselues to the rockes,</q> but not the rockes to them.  Neither in this question is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>supreme,</hi> or <hi>meane</hi> authority materiall, nor what diuerse foundations they haue; since it falls out in Power, as it doth in Knowledge; that <hi>who is any thing at all, is all the world aboue vs.</hi> Therefore <hi>Madame!</hi> be pleas'd to weigh what folly it is for a SubIect vnder a Prince, or a Wife vnder the yoke of a Husband, to striue alone with the strong corporation of Power: Since in Obedience we need ouercome but one (our selfe I meane) where in these other contentions, we must serue many Masters, worship Equals, flatter Inferiours, and trust in Strangers: that course being (as I haue shewed) subiect besides to treachery, ignorance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy of instruments; together with Mischance,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:21544:173"/>
which hath greatest rule in all these vnruled hazards. The fearefull examples of those men that haue walked this icie path, and been vnfortunate, by disproportion betweene their natures, places, and times they liu'd in, are innumerable. <hi>Seianus</hi> vnder <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> vnder <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> many of our Dukes, and Barons vnder our owne Kings, in that false stage of our <hi>Barons warres.</hi> All which I shortly lay before you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your estate is (as I said) such a modell of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects estates vnder Princes, as mans <hi>little world</hi> is of the great; differing onely in <hi>more,</hi> or <hi>lesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Obedience</hi> is iust, the Customes of Nations, and Lawes of Nature will assure you; who giue the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Preeminence, and the stronger, Rule. Againe, those excesses which arise out of Authority, are they not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>rods of trials</hi> which we inferiors must kisse, and that God onely may burne, which made them; or else <hi>mists of mutinous selfe-loue,</hi> which deceiue, and make man as well misunderstand his diseases, as their remedies? And so by misplacing equality, and inequality, at once ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine both publike and priuate security. These be indeed <hi>Meteors,</hi> that encourage man to vndermine Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, examine Soueraignity, and measure the <hi>Arcana</hi> of all Estates by the crooked line of our owne Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now <hi>Madame!</hi> If you please to apply this to your selfe, it hath this instruction in it; that if because you are vnequall, and haue aduantage of your Husband in loue, chastity, piety, and sincerenesse, you will thinke your selfe equall with him in liberty, wealth, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; whereof some are proper by nature to his sexe, as a Man; some by ordinance vnto his person, as a Husband; you shall erre in confusion of merit, while you doe not distinguish vertue from vertue, right from right; but out of selfe-loues counsels, striue to haue equality in one become an equality in all. In which false path, the <hi>iron pot</hi> doth often meet with the <hi>earthen;</hi> and then you know which is broken. Besides <hi>Madame!</hi> in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions betweene crafty strength, and well-beleeuing weakenesse, spies must be maintain'd, and rumours paid
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:21544:173"/>
to the watching of errors, and vncouering of shame in your owne nest; which quire of foule spirits, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours be so foolish to coniure vp, the Superiours will euer take aduantage by; <hi>authority giuing authority to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths:</hi> so that all strifes with Superiours must needs proue <hi>idle,</hi> where we cannot; and <hi>vnnoble,</hi> where we may not either stand, or leaue with the prosperity of Honor. Therefore, let vs conclude, that <hi>necessity is the Law of time;</hi> and consequently whatsoeuer is <hi>iust</hi> to be onely, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>wise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you desire an example of this <hi>Obedience,</hi> which I vrge you to; It may please you, in that arch-story of loue, to read the licentious affection of <hi>Antonie</hi> toward <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Where you shall see, that if his vertuous wife <hi>Octauia</hi> had striuen to master his dissolutenesse; <hi>Augustus</hi> was her Brother, and his Competitor in the Empire; whereby Right, and Strength, might with some possibility haue lifted vp her ambition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge from the barren grounds of Duty. If shee had striuen to please him with change, whom she could not keepe from it; the pride of <hi>Rome</hi> did then minister va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of delights, and the seruile instruments of Time, and Greatnesse, would soone haue had an eye to their Gaine, and her Fortune. If she would haue rowled the stone of <hi>Sysiphus,</hi> and studied with merit to call backe his loue; she was as yong, equall in beauty, stronger in honour; but euer the same, which (she knew) was not so pleasing to him, as the same in others. Besides, she had the colour of Estate to enammell all reuenges vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his vngratefulnesse. Notwithstanding this worthy <hi>Lady</hi> would neuer yeeld to aduenture her Honour vpon the dice of Chance, nor vainly seeke to haue power ouer him, that had none ouer himselfe; but diuiding her innocency from his errors with the middle wall of a <hi>seuere life,</hi> she remained still his good Angell with <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius;</hi> temper'd publike iealousies, and all aduantages of priuate wrongs; and to be short, was content, when she could not doe the workes of a well-beloued Wife, yet to <hi>doe well,</hi> as <hi>becomes all excellent Women.</hi> In which
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:21544:174"/>
course of moderation, shee neither made the World her Iudge, nor the Market her Theater, but contented her sweet minde with the triumphs of Patience, and made solitarinesse the tombe of her Fame: which Fame, as true to her Worth, and enuious to his Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuiousnesse, hath multiplied her Honour, and his Shame, to liue (as you see) many ages after them both.</p>
                  <p>Where, if on the other side she had, with her first thoughts, descended into the counsells of impatiency, pleaded distresse in teares, and wrongs in complaint; who sees not that she had therein not onely lost Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>reputation,</hi> the <hi>true shadow of great hearts;</hi> but stirred vp Murmur, which handles all things, but either neuer concludes any, or at least concludes in the worst part? And so perchance, by ouer-acting, might haue brought her right, and his errors into an equall bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. <q>For it is most true, that exorbitancies of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions doe many times (like <hi>Players</hi> vpon <hi>stages</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the office of a King, in the person of a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</q>
                     <hi>Aristides</hi> constancie, with the weakenesse of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus;</hi> and the resolute courage of <hi>Turnus;</hi> with the cowardise of <hi>Nicias,</hi> acting that which they are not; and consequently, either out of felt, or adopted impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, vainely striuing to deny Chance her Tributes; Error her Changes; and Tyranny her Iniustice; fall suddenly into that kind of weakenesse, which vnder Power must be forced to endure many stormes, and burdens; because it could not endure the petty, and incident passages of life. Therefore good <hi>Madame!</hi> Since I haue shewed you by reason, that <hi>Obedience</hi> is iust, and necessary; by example that it is possible; be not restiue in their weake stubburnnesse; that will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keepe, or lose all: but thinke what <hi>folly</hi> it were for a man, in the naturall decaies of age, not to <hi>goe</hi> because hee cannot <hi>runne:</hi> and beleeue that it will proue the like kind of headinesse in a Wife, to forsake herselfe, for his ill that hath already forsaken her. Therefore <hi>Noble Lady!</hi> proceed constantly to your end; beare,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:21544:174"/>
and deale with these weakenesses of your Husbands; not with hate of your selfe, or of him: but as <hi>Mothers</hi> doe with the <hi>wantonnesse of children;</hi> who cry not to still them, nor threaten imperfection, and malice with one rod, but first take away the offence, then suffer them to enioy those toyes they delight in.  For looke what <q>a Mothers loue is towards her children, the like is a  Husbands power ouer a Wife:</q> They will not punish, you cannot.</p>
                  <p>To confirme this more clearely; let vs examine the commodities that arise out of this iust, and necessary <hi>Obedience.</hi> The <hi>Poets,</hi> who sometimes vnder clouds of beasts, describe the beastly courses of degenerate men, tell you; that <hi>Iupiter</hi> after he had made many wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering pilgrimages from heauen downe to the earth, brought still some of that earthly metall vp with him; so as his affection became diuided, and euery day lesse kind to <hi>Iuno.</hi> She (as a <hi>Goddesse</hi>) acquainted with his power, and with all the tempestuous powers of Lust, found that she, which hitherto had brought to passe many things by his loue, could now worke nothing by it. Neuerthelesse wisely considering that all affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mixt betweene heauen and earth, haue wauing hopes, reuenge, desire, feare, and repentances in them, which contrariety of passions had likewise their times, and places of raigne; <q>Sensualities in man not being made of one, but many humors.</q> Out of these peircing grounds, shee neither forsakes herends, nor takes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her that <hi>languishing despaire,</hi> which made the first <hi>Monke,</hi> nor that earnestnesse of rage, which is euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of it selfe: but where strength of Credit fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, shee there vseth the traffique of Wit; obseruing his humours, and their changes; learning out of them so to temper, and allay one thought with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now bearing, now vrging, that (as those graue <hi>Authors</hi> affirme) <hi>Carthage</hi> was long kept vp by <hi>luno's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, in despite of <hi>Venus</hi> her constant ambition to build <hi>Rome</hi> vpon the ruines of it: which proues, that no man being made all of loue, they haue not lost
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:21544:175"/>
all, that haue (how vnhappily soeuer) lost it. The art wherewith she thus wrought <hi>Iupiter,</hi> lay vndisclos'd; as the faults of Power do; <hi>selfe-loue</hi> couering them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and <hi>flattery</hi> without: vnder which two veyles the will of Supreme Authority is many times stolen away; and the <hi>Lions skinne</hi> become the <hi>Foxes priuiledge:</hi> The Agents going still vnpunished, because <q>it is not stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but stealing ill, which Husbands as well as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces take offence at.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Noble Lady!</hi> as the <hi>straight line</hi> shewes both it selfe, and the <hi>crooked:</hi> so doth an <hi>vpright course of life,</hi> yeeld all true wayes of aduantage, and by mastering our owne affections, anatomizeth all inferior passions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king knowne the distinct branches out of which the higher powers of kindnesse, respect, and admiration doe arise. A <hi>Mappe,</hi> wherein we may by the same wisdome of Moderation, choose for our selues that which is least in the power of others. Besides, it plainely discouers; that <hi>Iealousie</hi> acknowledgeth aduantage of worth, and so becomes the triumph of <hi>Libertines;</hi> that <hi>Griefe</hi> is the punishment of wrong, or right ill vsed; Curiosity euer returnes ill newes; <hi>Anger</hi> how great soeuer it seemes, is but a little humour, springing from opinion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; her causes lesse than vices, and so not worthy to be loued, or hated; but viewed, as liuely images to shew the <hi>strength,</hi> and yet <hi>frailty</hi> of all passions: which <hi>Passions</hi> being but <hi>diseases of the minde,</hi> doe so <hi>disease-like</hi> thirst after false remedies, and deceiuing visions; as the weake become terrified with those <hi>glow-worm</hi> lights, out of which wise Subiects often fashion arts to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne absolute Monarchs by. For <hi>Madame!</hi> as <hi>nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which feeds, and maintaines our Life, is yet the perfect pledge of our Mortality: so are these <hi>light-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi> Passions true, and assured notes of little natures, placed in what great Estates soeuer. Besides, by this practise of <hi>Obedience,</hi> there grow many more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Since first, there is no losse in duty; so as you must at the least winne of your flesh by it, and either make it easie for you to become vnfortunate, or at least
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:21544:175"/>
finde an easie, and honourable passage out of her intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate lines, and circles. Againe, if it be true, which the <hi>Philosophers</hi> hold; that <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>vices,</hi> disagreeing in all things else, yet agree in this; that <hi>where there is one in</hi> esse, <hi>in</hi> posse <hi>there are all:</hi> then cannot any excellent faculty of the Minde be alone, but it must needs haue Wisdome, Patience, Piety, and all other <hi>enemies</hi> of Chance to accompany it; as against, and amongst all stormes, a calmed, and calming <hi>Mens adepta.</hi>

all vpon one wheele; others vpon many: Diuers pleas'd (like <hi>children</hi>) with little things; while the greater bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies must haue greater mindes to moue them: some (like <hi>Heraclitus</hi>) <hi>bewailing</hi> the World with the teares of Selfe-pittie; others (like <hi>Democritus</hi>) iouially <hi>laughing</hi> at griefes, afflictions; rather with an easinesse of nature than any strength of worth, or counsell: Chance the end of many, and Change of more: toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the libertine, or seruile effects of too many, or too few distinctions, or respects in our <hi>morall</hi> liues.

And in this new delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be no impertinent counsell; first, to examine the difference of worths required in seeking to <hi>winne one,</hi> or the <hi>world;</hi> or in a third progresse, by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing both to winne <hi>credit with God.</hi> In which mysticall worke, the fine mixture of Grace, and Nature toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, makes it more easie to <hi>mend</hi> our errours, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was to <hi>couer</hi> them; and consequently our flesh as capable to receiue the <hi>immortality</hi> of good, as it was to run head-long vnder the eternall <hi>curse</hi> of <hi>Sinne.</hi> Againe, since it is flesh onely that receiues immortality of <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Euill;</hi> &amp; vpon the same flesh no heauier tax laid in these worthier courses than you were charged with before; I meane a resolution to turne all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and without you to the best: <hi>Noble Lady!</hi> gather your powers together; and know that where, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer imprisonment of Thoughts, Reason, Wrong; and Occasion were all kept subiect to an ouer-tender affection in our selues; they shall in this bee set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and spread as farre as the limits of Nature, or Grace, can possibly be extended. Besides, in all the course of Choice, or Change, whosoeuer will but compare what aduantage the strength of one <hi>Mouer</hi> hath ouer another, he shal see all hardnesse, and inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in the wayes to bee reconciled in the force, and preeminen<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the <hi>Mouers:</hi> so as <hi>pleasure</hi> hauing a weake <hi>entrance,</hi> and an easie <hi>Adamant; Honor,</hi> a <hi>crabbed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>first</hi> step, but an <hi>omnipotent</hi> obiect; the <hi>light</hi> goes as easie <hi>vpward,</hi> as the <hi>heauy, downe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To beginne therefore with the first, which is the <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of one;</hi> there is in that course required neither exact Vertue, nor Vice; but a happy temper in both, to a nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vse of either. Here yeelding, soothing, seruing must be our sacrifices; humours, our study; and wee bound (like <hi>Shadowes</hi>) neither to be shorter, nor longer, than befitteth those <hi>bodies</hi> we resolue to worship: so as the most <hi>factious</hi> spirits, are often the most <hi>fortunate</hi> in
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21544:177"/>
these courses. For as in <hi>Coynes</hi> it is the <hi>stampe,</hi> not the <hi>metall</hi> that goes currant; that which is <hi>gold</hi> here, going perchance euery where else but as <hi>copper,</hi> so doe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy choices of <hi>fauour</hi> often make Natures meanest creations passe for superlatiue. Nay more, if by the influence of a good Destinie, wee chance to honour a <hi>worthy</hi> man; yet shall wee but take <hi>on,</hi> and not take <hi>in</hi> Worth by that traffique:
<q>and then how can they truly merit, that doe well for any respect, but <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> it selfe?</q> This was it, that made the piercing Iudgements of times past, note a difference betweene the affability of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Caesar;</hi> it being <hi>artificiall</hi> in this to his end, and in the other a <hi>naturall</hi> sweetnesse of bowels; in the one an <hi>art</hi> of <hi>Ambition,</hi> in the other <hi>nobleness,</hi> and <hi>ingenuity.</hi> Whereby wee may conclude; <q>that it is no great inriching of mans Nature to bring forth pleasing fruits to one <hi>Land-Lord,</hi> how fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or imperious soeuer.</q> Besides, these <hi>humour-hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> onely master those affections of minde, which are not honourable in the large extents of <hi>Truth,</hi> but in the narrow limits of <hi>Opinion;</hi> and thereby sometimes make vs creatures to our Equals; seruants to Vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse; lesse than our selues, by seeking to winne a man perchance worse than our selues; rather impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Craft, than Wisedome; Seruitude, than Honour. In all which, true Worth must necessarily suffer allay, as being changed from generall approuings to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and thereby forced to imprison Nature within <hi>Municipall,</hi> and seruile Humours, or Constitutions.</p>
                  <p>The second part, which is the winning of the <hi>World,</hi> hath many, &amp; large respects in it: since therein our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator must be <hi>Fame,</hi> a spirit <hi>neuer entreated,</hi> but <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> vp; our study <hi>Honour,</hi> as a pledge which the world doth trust, and beleeue in; <hi>Magnanimitie</hi> must bee our Scepter, wherein the Equall finde <hi>strength,</hi> and the Inferiour <hi>protection; Liberalitie,</hi> that all desires may hope; <hi>Iustice</hi> which distinguisheth right from estate, or persons; <hi>Mercy,</hi> that frailty may not despaire with such like great strengths of minde, as are vniversally
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:21544:177"/>
currant, and doe giue euidence to the World that wee despise those pettie things; which the rest doe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at; and by affecting the generall loue of all men, bring forth that, which all men loue in vs. Besides, the end is more noble to <hi>winne</hi> Reuerence, than to <hi>yeeld</hi> it; to <hi>create,</hi> than <hi>pay tribute;</hi> the powers of the mind, that are vsed more strong, as doing, and not suffering affections; the proportion of the meanes larger, and of more difficulty, requiring better formes, perfecter health, and greater strengths: because in our <hi>ends,</hi> we embrace the ends of all men; and thereby are aduanced without preiudice, or discontent to any. Hence, from <hi>Equalities</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> grew vp all <hi>Estates</hi> of <hi>Superiority;</hi> this is that <hi>seruing</hi> of the <hi>Multitude,</hi> which commands them; this is to be least, and greatest; one, and rule many: yea, euen this is that <hi>great Art,</hi> which hath ever flourished in the brauest spirits, and most flourishing Ages; and which being forgotten by the corruption, or vicissitude of times (as the most excellent <hi>Sciences</hi> haue beene) is growne strange among men; and which being but renewed in shew, the vaine World (made to bee deceiued) will without suspition embrace; as a liuely picture of her ancient Pompe, and Greatnesse.</p>
                  <p>Againe, since the nature of the <hi>Multitude</hi> is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the <hi>Earth;</hi> which (not made for it selfe) while it lies common brings forth nothing to enrich, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceales many treasures vnder her skinne, and bowels; and on the other side, moued, or manured, yeelds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for his paines that husbands her: since (I say) these two being paralell'd; euen as the first authors in all Innouations, while their mend not, but change the complexion of Passions, shall find audacity in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the hardest of their worke; as being forced to bee presidents to themselues: so againe, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence must of necessitie proue faire, and easie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that noueltie is euer as welcome, as fearefull; and the whole flocke apt to follow the first sheepe: In which vndertaking to become an example; hath some thing in it worthy of aduenture. Therefore, if you
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:21544:178"/>
compare the winning of one, and the world together, you shall finde the world exceeds one both in number, weight and measure; and then as our English prouerbe saith, <hi>The more cost, the more worship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this second step if you will climbe up to the third, &amp; though with absurdity, yet for vnderstandings sake, compare finite, and infinite together; I meane the winning of the world with the worship of God, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the circumference, him that made all things with that which was made of nothing; the ends differ no more in excellency, than the wayes, and meanes to attaine it doe. For in the one we worke with our owne strengths, which are but weakenesses; in this with his, that is Omnipotent; in the first with flattering promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that will deceiue; in this with him that is greater than all things, and onely equall with his word; as whose each part is of his owne essence, indivisible, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and eternall.</p>

                  <p>A Letter written by <hi>Sir Fulke Greuill</hi> to his Cousin <hi>Greuill Varney</hi> residing in <hi>France;</hi> wherein are set downe certaine rules and obseruations, directing him how he may make the best vse of his <hi>Trauels.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>MY good <hi>Cousin,</hi> according to the request of your Letter, dated the 19. of <hi>October,</hi> at <hi>Orleance,</hi> and receiued here the 18. of <hi>Nouember,</hi> I haue sent you by your Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant for your present supply, and had sent you a greater summe, but that my extraordinary charges this yeere haue vtterly vnfurnished me.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Cousin,</hi> though I will be no seuere exacter of account, either in your money or time, yet for the loue I beare you, I am very desirous both to satisfie my selfe, and your friends, how you prosper in your <hi>Trauels,</hi> and how you find your selfe bettered thereby, either in knowledge of <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>world;</hi> the rather because the daies you hauc already spent abroad are now suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent both to giue you light how to fixe your selfe an end with counsell, and accordingly shape your course con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly vnto it. Besides, it is a vulgar scandall of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers</hi> that few returne more religious than they went out. Wherein both my hope and request is to you, that your principall care be to hold your foundation, and to make no other vse of informing your selfe in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and superstitions of other Nations, than onely thereby to engage your owne heart more firmely vnto the truth. You liue indeed in a Country <hi>Bigarre</hi> of two seuerall Professions, and you shall returne a <hi>Nouice</hi> from thence, if you be not able to giue an account of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:21544:179"/>
progresse, &amp; strength of each in reputation, and party, and how both are supported, ballanced, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by the State, as being the contrary humours, in the temper, or predominancy whereof the health of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of that body doth consi st.</p>
               <p>These things you will obserue, not onely as an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman,</hi> whom it may concerne to know what interest his country may expect in the consciences of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but also as a <hi>Christian,</hi> to consider both the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and blemishes, the hopes and dangers of the Church in all places.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>world,</hi> I know it too well to perswade you to diue into the practises thereof, rather stand vpon your guard against all that tempt you therunto, or may practise vpon you in your conscience, your reputation, or your purse. Resolue that no man is wise or safe, but he that is honest. And let this perswasion turne your studies and obseruations from the complement and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures of this debauched Age to more reall grounds of wisedome, gathered out of the stories of Time past, and out of the gouernement of the present State.</p>
               <p>Your guide to these is the knowledge of the <hi>Country</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> among whom you liue.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Country;</hi> though you cannot see all places, yet if as you passe along you enquire carefully, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe your selfe with Bookes that are written of the <hi>Cosmography</hi> of those parts; you shall thereby suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently gather the strength, riches, trafficke, hauens, shipping, commodities, vent; and the wants and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages of all places. Wherein also for your own vse hereafter, and for your friends, it will be fit to note their Building, Furniture, their Entertainments, all their Husbandry, and ingenious Inuentions in whatsoeuer concerneth either Pleasure or Profit.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>People,</hi> your trafficke among them while you learne their language will sufficiently instruct you in their Habilities, Dispositions and Humours; if you enlarge the priuacy of your owne nature to seeke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the best sort of Strangers, and restraine
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:21544:179"/>
your affection, and participation from your own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men of whatsoeuer condition.</p>
               <p>In the story of <hi>France</hi> you haue a large and pleasant field in the three lines of their Kings, to obserue their Alliances and Successions, their Conquests, their Wars, especially with vs, their Counsels, their Treaties, and all Rules and Examples of Experience and Wisdome, which may be lights and remembrances to you hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to iudge of all occurrents at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>Lastly, for the <hi>gouernment;</hi> your end must not be like an <hi>Intelligencer,</hi> to spend all your time in fishing after the present newes, humours, graces, or disgraces of Court, which haply may change before you come home; but your better and more constant grounds will bee to know the Consanguinities, Alliances, and Estates of their <hi>Princes;</hi> the proportion betweene the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Magistracy,</hi> the constitutions of the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> the state of their <hi>Lawes,</hi> as well for the making, as for the executing thereof. How the <hi>Soueraignty</hi> of the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth it selfe into all acts and ordinances: How many wayes they lay Impositions and Taxations, and gather Reuenewes to the Crowne; what be the Liberties and Seruitudes of all degrees; what Discipline and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for Warres; what Inuentions for increase of Trafficke at home, for multiplying their commodities, incouraging Arts or Manufactures, or of worth in any kinde: Also what good Establishments to preuent the necessities and discontentments of the People, to cut off suits at Law, and Duels, to suppresse Theeues and all disorders.</p>
               <p>To be short, because my purpose is not to bring all your obseruations to heads, but onely by these few to let you know what manner of returne your Friends ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from you, let me for these and all the rest giue you this one note, which I desire you to obserue as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of a Friend: Not to spend your spirits, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious time of your <hi>trauaile,</hi> in a <hi>captious preiudice,</hi> and censuring of all things, nor in an infectious collection of base <hi>vices</hi> and <hi>fashions</hi> of Men and Women, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:21544:180"/>
corruptions of these times; which will bee of vse onely among <hi>Humorists</hi> for iests and table-talke: but rather straine your wits and industry soundly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct your selfe in all things betweene heauen and earth which may tend to <hi>Vertue, Wisedome,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and which may make your life more <hi>Profitable</hi> to your <hi>Countrey,</hi> and your selfe more <hi>Comfortable</hi> to your <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>acceptable to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to conclude; let all these riches bee treasured vp not onely in your Memory, (where time may lessen your stocke) but rather in good Writings, and Bookes of accompt; which will keepe them safe for your vse hereafter. And if in this time of your liberall traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, you will giue me any aduertisement of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in these kindes, I will make you as liberall a returne from my selfe and your friends, here as I shall bee able. And so commending all your good endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to him that must either wither or prosper them, I very kindly bid you farewell.</p>
