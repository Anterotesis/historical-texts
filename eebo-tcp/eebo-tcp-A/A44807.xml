         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AN highly applauded <hi>Pamphlet</hi> fell into my hand, at
that instant when I was sealing my last Letter to you,
relating to the <hi>Penal Laws and <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ests,</hi> I then purposed
to tell you my thoughts thereof in a Postscript, but being
diverted till the Post was gone, and yours of the 8th Instant
mentioning the thing, this comes to tell you, that I have
slightly run it over, and do perceive the <hi>Wordy Author</hi> designs
thereby to allure the <hi>Dissenters</hi> to a Contempt and Rejection
of the <hi>Kings</hi> benigne Purpose to them. Its Title, and another
Circumstance, <hi>your early notice of it,</hi> inclines me to conclude that
it was wrote to you; whether so or not; I shall briefly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque
upon it. The <hi>great Man</hi> sets out floridly; As a <hi>Modish</hi>
Person, he accosts the poor <hi>Dissenter</hi> by way of <hi>Address.</hi> The
Courtship seems to me sudden and surprizing, and I suspect
the Design, for I take it to be something <hi>Iudas-like,</hi> for
one of the <hi>Epistlers Figure</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> to approach a <hi>Mechanick,</hi>
and a <hi>Schismatick</hi> to boot, in the humble way of <hi>Hat and Knee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he doubts not of kind reception, provided that his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63375:2"/>
               <hi>Dissenter</hi> will take his Word, when he affirms, that he is
neither <hi>a Coward, nor a designing or freetfull Man.</hi> I wish he
had put his Name to his Letter, because some will have it, that
the <hi>Author</hi> is a Person so transcendently <hi>Haughty</hi> and <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi>
that he little regards what, or whom he Sacrifices, may
he but become <hi>head of a party.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>If he gains not the Point, by the glorious <hi>Character</hi> which
he ascribes to himself, his <hi>reasons</hi> must undoubtedly (as he
conceits) win him the Day; his <hi>friendship</hi> commanding you
to allow them to pass Muster, for he pledges his Word, that
<hi>the time of day,</hi> disposes him to <hi>Charity,</hi> therefore in this nick
of time, you are neither to call into Question his Wisdom,
Honesty, or Affection; <hi>a most lucky period.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In confidence that I have at least an equal title to your
<hi>Friendship,</hi> his being but newly contracted, and ours what
Storms hath tryed; I shall, in my old plain-dealing way with
you, observe, that the <hi>Gentlemans</hi> stock both of <hi>Charity and
Truth</hi> is very suddenly exhausted, for he instantly charges to
his <hi>Dissenters account</hi> both the <hi>Exclusion and Rebellion:</hi> Were
the Fact so, and the Brat laid at the right Door; Why should
this high <hi>Pretender to Loyalty,</hi> check in any <hi>Delinquent,</hi> a graet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Resentment of his Majesties <hi>Forgiveness?</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Should the <hi>Fanatick</hi> (to avoid wrangling with the <hi>Church
of England</hi>) agree to make an equal Partition with her, of the
mentioned Crimes, and their deserved shame? The half
would far exceed his due share: Then will it be consistent,
with <hi>her breeding, and superlative Vertue,</hi> to yeild <hi>him</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of all the <hi>Repentance and Confession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place your <hi>Friend craves audience,</hi> and passing
the Complement, that he yet <hi>hopes you in your Wits, he bids
you beware of New Friends</hi> (a very pertinent caution, your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with him being yet in the blossom) and</p>
            <p>He bespeakes you to be a <hi>prudent Christian,</hi> and not to
<hi>hazard the publick Safety, by the desire of Ease or Revenge.</hi> Good
again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63375:2"/>
To enforce the first (<hi>viz.</hi>) that you are to <hi>suspect new Friends,</hi>
he insinuates, that you are not to be carried over, <hi>by smooth
Language now put on to engage you,</hi> by the way, the expression
intending to insinuate <hi>a cheating Design,</hi> had been as well
<hi>worded</hi> (Words (with abundance of spite) being mainly what
fills the Paper now before me) had it said, putting off of
smooth Language, or making what is Gilded over, to
pass as Current Coyn; but whether off or on be best, in
this place; in the next, the <hi>Gentleman</hi> doffing his Clothes,
personates an enraged slighted <hi>Mistress</hi> (or <hi>Rival</hi>) and tells
you, that <hi>she</hi> (for to follow our Amorous Author, we must
for a time change the Sex) had the <hi>the first offer,</hi> and you have
ouly the coy Ladies leavings. It is then evident (and shall
be anon further made out) that <hi>she held a parl; with your new
Lover,</hi> ay, but if you will credit her, she saw his <hi>Deformity,</hi>
and therefore <hi>rejected</hi> him. I doubt you will get little by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
of the <hi>Sqeamish Dame,</hi> whether punctillios of Honour,
hopes of higher Terms, or the Devils Pride and Envy, did
not occasion her rash refusal, and whether she doth not too
late repent it? for Questions of this kind do rarely receive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and honest Answers. I shall therefore according to my
wonted freedom, exhort you to <hi>stand upon your Guard,</hi> that
she may not play you a trick, and then reproach you. He
now (for the Aggressor in Love, must be concluded to wear
Breeches) <hi>makes court to you,</hi> examine carefully, I beseech you,
whether you are <hi>his Choice, and not his Refuge,</hi> if the last,
it will be your wisdom to make sure terms with him, and
allowing the <hi>Gentleman</hi> to mean as he would be taken, you
have his own advice, that <hi>you are not to yeild over hastily to new
Friends</hi> upon their bespeaking you fairly. He tells you, that
<hi>you cannot reasonably flatter your self that there is</hi> (with your Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
<hi>any inclination to you:</hi> I incline to think as he doth,
if he takes it, that beding together is to be the next thing in
the case, (then 'tis probable that no Love is lost) but I have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63375:3"/>
heard, that a Person disappointed in his first Amour, is ever
after cold, and indifferent, in Affection; and therefore since
<hi>the Church of England</hi> affirms, that she <hi>refused to strike up
a Bargain,</hi> I will believe, that <hi>a chast Dissenter,</hi> may live in
the same Kingdom, with the <hi>Romanist,</hi> without the hazard
of a <hi>Rape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They</hi> (the Papists, saith the Letter) <hi>never pretended to allow
you any Quarter, but to usher in Liberty to themselves, under that
shelter.</hi> Well then, you are out of danger of being <hi>put to the
Sword,</hi> you may have <hi>Quarter,</hi> a Grace refused you by <hi>the
Church of England.</hi> Ay, may you say, but what are the terms?
why, such as are very equall, and highly reasonable, both
Parties have been long and sorely galled by the <hi>Canon of the
Church of England.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> will now help to <hi>dismount
them,</hi> and they call for your aid; I pray what harm in all this,
and why so much noise against it?</p>
            <p>And it proceeds; <hi>Nay, at this very hour they can hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
in the height of their Courtship, to let fall hard words of you,
so little is nature to be restrained.</hi> The Gentleman may well
say,
<q>
                  <l>Pudet haec opprobria nobis,</l>
                  <l>Et dici potuisse, &amp; non potuisse refelli.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>You and I do know, <hi>at this very hour,</hi> and so doth he, the
names of <hi>dignified Sons of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>who declare,
that the Devil will have both Papist and Dissenter.</hi> This I'm
sure is none of the softest Language.</p>
            <p>But you are told in the next Paragraph, <hi>That Liberty and
Infallibility are the two most contrary things in the World.</hi> I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that it is beyond contradiction true, that our <hi>errable
Church of England</hi> has run to the Arguments of that Church,
which claims <hi>Infallibility;</hi> to justifie her self, in her attempts,
to extirpate Dissenters; and (<hi>right or wrong</hi>) they had
been Ruined, had not the present <hi>Kings</hi> Clemency rescued
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63375:3"/>
But <hi>the Principles of the Roman Church allow not Liberty to
Hereticks.</hi> Nor do those of <hi>the English Church to Schismaticks;</hi>
such she esteems her <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and as such, she (when in
Power) constantly treats, and labours to destroy them.</p>
            <p>If so, the argument of <hi>present hugging, in order to the better
squeezing hereafter,</hi> vanishes; and <hi>the seting up Bills, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Plaisters for tender Consciences;</hi> may deserve as great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
from <hi>the Romish,</hi> as from <hi>the Lambeth Church,</hi> and in our
present conjuncture much more.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman goes on to tell you. <hi>The other day you were
Sons of Belial, now you are Angels of Light.</hi> And he asserts, <hi>that
to come so quick, from one extream to another, is such unnatural a
motion,</hi> that you are to look to your self. Pray do so, and
in doing it, remember, that <hi>in the word of a King there is
Power;</hi> and that <hi>the Church of England,</hi> which now hath
none, to hurt or save <hi>(till</hi> her present exigence extorted a
Complement) stiled you <hi>a Child of Darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place <hi>the Men of Taunton and Tiverton</hi> (for
sound or Jingle sake, no doubt) are hook'd in, and their <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
ridiculed: notwithstanding in this our <hi>Church-Mans</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that renders them vile, it would not offend a good Subject,
to see others imitate them, and tho <hi>H.</hi> (at this day) <hi>non est
litera;</hi> methinks <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Hallifax</hi> o a Northern-man, should
chime every whit as well as <hi>T.</hi> and <hi>T.</hi> of the <hi>West;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
pray prevail with your new Friend (who will not
break with you in trifles) to write a second Letter North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and if your Intrigue with him continues till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the general Post, (<hi>for we are admonished to have a very
tender regard to Horses</hi>) I doubt not but he will be obliged to
tell you that the worthy Inhabitants of those Places, have the
courage to <hi>vre Loraliy</hi> with any of his Majesties Subjects. If
I mistake them, <hi>Libera me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now our <hi>Valiant</hi> Author (<hi>the West being vanquished</hi>) points
<hi>Southward,</hi> and picks a Quarrel with the <hi>poor Quakers.</hi> This
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63375:4"/>
may well surprise you, I'm sure it did me at first sight; for
you and I believe they will not draw the <hi>Sword,</hi> much less
encounter a <hi>Goliah;</hi> therefore you may say, certainly no fear of
them to <hi>a fearless Man;</hi> ay, but the <hi>Gentleman</hi> now handling
them, resolves to spoil an <hi>English Proverb,</hi> and to his <hi>courage</hi>
would monopolize <hi>Wit,</hi> and the <hi>Quaker</hi> he says has learn'd to
speak <hi>sence,</hi> and which is worse, he becomes <hi>mannerly,</hi> to such
a degree, that this your new Friend (<hi>who grumbles for a place at
Court</hi>) begins to suspect himself in some danger of being
post-posed; for the <hi>Quaker</hi> having given the King <hi>decent thanks</hi>
for his <hi>Protection,</hi> may, for ought he knows, become <hi>Courtier.
(Sir</hi>) you are now to believe the Gentleman has spit his
Poyson, for he tells you, that <hi>no sharpness is to be mingled
where healing only is intended;</hi> and he promises hereafter <hi>to say
nothing to expose particular M<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n, how strong soever the temptation
may be, or how clear the proofs to make it out;</hi> he might as well have
said, Now <hi>Gentlemen Dissenters</hi> look to your hits, we have
been <hi>Complicens,</hi> provoke me not to detect our <hi>Rogueries;
please me or all shall out,</hi> (but begging his Pardon) he shall speak
for himself, and see what follows; 'tis in friendship this;
<hi>for Arguments sake,</hi> and to promote the proposed <hi>healing,</hi> the
honest well-meaning Man, (<hi>not willing to tell tales</hi>) bearly
whispers you, <hi>poor deluded Dissenter,</hi> in the Ear; that to his
knowledg there is Death in the Pot, <hi>your Minister is a Knave,
you are Sold, the Money is Paid, and you are most certainly
Betrayed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this said like a <hi>Church of England Worthy, not tied or
confined to this or that subdivision of Protestants,</hi> like one estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from <hi>sharpness,</hi> and who affects and intends <hi>healing?</hi> Can
Hell it self furnish a more inveterate and malicious Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?</p>
            <p>We remember the time, when some Men talk'd of <hi>Pensio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in Parliament;</hi> they obliged the World with <hi>a List</hi> of those
who were reputed such, and if I mistake not, with the Name
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63375:4"/>
               <hi>of him,</hi> who they said, <hi>hired and paid them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dissenter</hi> now addressed to, for his own safety, ought
to challeng this his <hi>new Suiter,</hi> for the Names of such <hi>Ministers</hi>
as have made <hi>the bargain and sale</hi> suggested, and methinks his
<hi>Charity, and the warmth of his Affection,</hi> should dispose him to
gratifie such a modest and necessary Request; if it be refused
I must conclude my Friend <hi>so far gone in his Passion,</hi> that he has
wholly lost his Understanding, should this <hi>Gentlemans Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
any longer <hi>impress, or influence him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now our <hi>Author</hi> falls with down right Blows upon the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressers,</hi>
and bestows bitter <hi>Invectives</hi> upon them, and upon
the <hi>Government</hi> to boot; that part of his <hi>Libel</hi> deserves and
probably will be reckoned for in <hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> therefore I
shall shun the danger of becoming his <hi>Accessary</hi> by transcribing
him.</p>
            <p>Then he betakes himself to <hi>Flattery,</hi> and tells you, that <hi>if
you had to do with those riged Prelates who made it a matter of
Conscience to give you the least Indulgence, but kept you at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
distance, and even to your more reasonable scruples continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
stiffe an inexorable, the argument might be fairer on your side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conclude then, that <hi>your Argument</hi> to accept of <hi>Liberty</hi> from
the King, is no way <hi>enervated:</hi> Is here any sort of proof, that
<hi>Prelacy</hi> has changed its thoughts, and put on tenderness to you;
you may not trust this <hi>undertaker</hi> in a thing so valuable as is
that, now discussed, <hi>the Church of England</hi> cannot intend
well, or use you so, (<hi>without incurring the guilt of Perjury as I
have heard her say</hi>) till she gives up her <hi>Laws of force,</hi> and you
see that her <hi>Zeal</hi> to uphold them occasions this <hi>great concussion
in the Kingdom,</hi> wherefore, I doubt she is not right; and your
only sure way of dealing with her, seems to me to be, to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
her</hi> by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> of every Weapon which the
<hi>Gospel</hi> did not put into her hand, then I'm sure <hi>She</hi> can do no
Mischief.</p>
            <p>Reverend Mr <hi>Baxter's</hi> expectation was raised about twenty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63375:5"/>
six years since, by the same pretence, as now yours is to be, but
after the then <hi>Prelacy (which I am confident the present will not
disown</hi>) had long <hi>triffled</hi> with him and his worthy <hi>Brethren, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
healing,</hi> in the <hi>Savoy Conferences;</hi> they found themselves
<hi>disappointed and shamd:</hi> If the <hi>Church</hi> be as skilful in <hi>Chirurgery</hi>
as our Author would perswade, she was the more to blame
to hold the <hi>Patient</hi> so long in hand, as then she did, and in fine
to leave or make the <hi>Wound</hi> worse then she found it. (<hi>honesty
I do find is absolutely necessary to a good Chirurgion</hi>) The same
<hi>Spirit</hi> still lives in our <hi>Church-Men,</hi> or it may in time to come re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again, and possess them; you have then no other way to
<hi>conjure</hi> down the <hi>evil Spirit of Persecution,</hi> but by a Repeal of
the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> that only can assure you, that <hi>a rigid Prelacy</hi>
shall not hereafter <hi>destroy you;</hi> and you have reason to take the
Alarum at your Woers next harangue, (<hi>Nescit nox missa rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti).
She or He</hi> (no matter which) <hi>has enchantment in her Face,
and can instantly put your Nose out of joynt with your new Friend,
nay look you Dead;</hi> for you are told, that <hi>at this very hour and
in the heat and glare of your present Sun-shine, the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
can in a moment bring Clouds again, and turn the royal Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
upon your Heads, blow you off the Stage with a breath; if she
would give but a smile or a kind word, the least glimpse of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
would throw you back into the state of Suffering and draw
upon you all the arrears of Severity which have accrued during the
time of this kindness to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is in truth (<hi>my good Friend</hi>) plain dealing, look to your
self therefore, and make your peace with her, or you perish, (<hi>if
you believe her</hi>) for <hi>Clouds, Thunder and Tempests</hi> a wait, (and <hi>as
she saith</hi>) are at her command; <hi>She</hi> can at pleasure take you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Power, add to your Yoke, and chastice you with <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,</hi>
and that's not all; <hi>She</hi> can bring you to an <hi>Aster-Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
lash you for playing <hi>Truant,</hi> and exact what you have run
<hi>in Arrear (this last discovery will undoubtedly porcure the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
an Address of Thanks from</hi> Doctors Commons, <hi>for the City
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63375:5"/>
Dissenters are near two years Reut run, there</hi>) Nay, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
your misery (<hi>after all the Reckonings paid</hi>) She can by her
Excommunication, throw you, <hi>with a quick hand</hi> to Satan.</p>
            <p>You may demand, what shall <hi>poor I</hi> do in this my great
Strait? <hi>Why,</hi> as you love your Life keep out of her <hi>Clutches,
defy her,</hi> and attone our English <hi>Iupiter,</hi> That he may not
entrust his <hi>Thunderbolts</hi> in this mad Hand.</p>
            <p>Be true, <hi>I beseech you,</hi> to your Interest, and deport your
self so to the <hi>King,</hi> that your <hi>new conciliated Friendship,</hi> which
she upbraids, and envies, may not be endangered.</p>
            <p>I shall now give you a Reason or two, why you may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suspect this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> now making Love to you in the
Name of the <hi>Church.</hi> I find his Letter stuffed with <hi>malitious
and false Infinuations</hi> against dissenting Ministers (amongst
whom I never found a Knave) I will therefore hope that my
telling <hi>you</hi> Truth, tho' to his Disparagement, will not be taken
as a Breach of the Rules of good Manners.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Church of England's Commissioners</hi> in the present
Treaty with you, have been tampering with those of the
<hi>Roman Communion,</hi> and offering Terms for the Life of their
dearly beloved <hi>Penal Laws:</hi> If they, to come a little closer,
have proposed, That if the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> will not joyn
with you, for the Repeal of those <hi>Laws,</hi> they shall be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
against any imaginary Danger from the <hi>Test-Penalties,</hi>
in a succeeding <hi>Reign,</hi> by a <hi>Mortgage</hi> of the <hi>Honours</hi> and
<hi>Estates</hi> also, of som <hi>great Men</hi> driving that Bargain. I say,
should this be true, there's certainly Mischief in her Heart,
and she will reveng your runing her into this <hi>Incumbrance,</hi> by
<hi>teaching you</hi> hereafter, (as <hi>Gideon</hi> did the Men of <hi>Succoth</hi>) with
<hi>Briers and Thorns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>She</hi> hath her <hi>Ambassadors at this very Hour,</hi> treating an
<hi>Alliance</hi> with the <hi>Papists,</hi> and proposing to yield them Liberty
by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> with Exception of the <hi>Fanatick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If these, or any others, should at this time, <hi>prate and bu<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63375:6"/>
Fears and Iealousies in your Ears,</hi> you are obliged to be deaf;
upon pain of all the Mischief they intend you. The Church
seems to t<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>emble the bloody <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and seeing her Power
reduced, she would be content for a time, to turn <hi>Pedagogue,</hi>
and <hi>whip-Boys,</hi> to keep her Hand in<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ure.</p>
            <p>The Church <hi>Plenipotentiary,</hi> towards the close of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>points his Wrath</hi> towards the <hi>King and his Government:</hi>
And with <hi>you,</hi> he seems to descend to <hi>calm</hi> (but very <hi>wickedly</hi>
intended) <hi>Reasoning. It is with Regret that he beholds you
disposed to quarrel the Church of</hi> England <hi>now she is upon the
Brink of Suffering: 'Tis very unkind in you, for she never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
the Dissenters, but by Direction, and as she was set on:</hi>
A bad Excuse, you know, is better than none. The <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
further insinuates (<hi>and you are to believe him if you will</hi>)
That the taking away the <hi>Penal Laws and Tests (the Bane of
Religion, and of Liberty</hi>) will put you under a Tyranny, and
absolutely destroy you. In truth (<hi>Sir</hi>) were I in the <hi>East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
the sight of this lamentable Complaint would greatly
move me, for I should doubt the Case of the <hi>Church of
England</hi> to be very deplorable, but 'tis a great <hi>Blessing</hi> that
all this is <hi>Misrepresentation,</hi> and <hi>soul Slander.</hi> The <hi>King's</hi>
Promise secures her of <hi>Peace and Plenty,</hi> and that <hi>Act of
Parliament</hi> which shall secure you out of her <hi>Paws,</hi> may give
her further <hi>Security</hi> if she wants it. This her <hi>grim faced
Representative,</hi> seems to take his short and angry <hi>Turns,</hi> like
the <hi>Tower-Lyon,</hi> and ever and anon <hi>roares;</hi> but 'tis not want,
but a ravenous Appetite to <hi>rend and tear,</hi> that occasions all
this <hi>Wrath and Rage:</hi> Nature will be Nature. Therefore you
may tell the Church in your Excuse (for a reason of your
Doings ought something to appease her toward you) in the
language of the <hi>Lepers:</hi> (My <hi>Distress</hi> is great.) <hi>If I still sit
here, I dye, if the</hi> Syrians <hi>save me alive I shall live; if they kill
me I shall but dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>cokes</hi> and work you off, from getting <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:63375:6"/>
from the only Hand which can dispense it: You are
told that <hi>some of the Church of</hi> England <hi>were Trimmers for
enduring you, and the Maxim was, It is impossible for a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter,
not to be a Rebel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Gentleman</hi> certainly thinks that you have forgot, who
gave those <hi>moderate Men</hi> that Name of Reproach, therefore
you may tell him, That to your Knowledg the <hi>Church</hi> esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them but <hi>spurious Sons,</hi> and could not endure them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caufe
they gave you a good Look; you need not go to <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>
to make this out; but if you should let me engage you
to take <hi>Salisbury</hi> in your way, and enquire there how the
Church treated a <hi>Protestant Reconciler.</hi> If you do so, pray use
your Interest with her, and try whether in this <hi>height of her
Caresses, she</hi> will demonstrate the sincerity of her Affection to
you, by recomending it to that <hi>Doctor</hi> to <hi>recant</hi> his <hi>Recantation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Maxim</hi> cited, <hi>It is impossible for a Dissenter not to
be a Rebel.</hi> I am certain it was delivered from a Pulpit, nearer
to <hi>Ludgate</hi> then that of <hi>Limestreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>Gentleman's angry and whedling</hi> part; Now
I bring you to his <hi>Politicks:</hi> and the <hi>Dissenters</hi> are meer <hi>Fools,</hi>
if they trust not to his most wise <hi>Conduct,</hi> for he saith <hi>you</hi> (silly
soul) <hi>act very unskilfully against your visible Interest;</hi> this were
to purpose indeed, if made out, but the Mischief of it is, the
powerful <hi>Argument of Interest</hi> turns against him; The <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Liberty</hi> may nowbe certainly <hi>established,</hi> but, saith the <hi>Church,</hi>
I see my <hi>halcyon Days</hi> at hand, put on a little Patience, and then
<hi>you and I will treat about the Matter.</hi> Were you in the Extremity
of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and sure of receiving present Ease by an <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Chirurgion,</hi> your next <hi>Neighbour,</hi> who tells you his <hi>Price,</hi>
and ever <hi>made good his Word;</hi> how would you entertain that
<hi>Friend's Counsel,</hi> who should say, let me advise you to wait
a little, for I hear that <hi>Germans</hi> excell all others in this Case,
and about Six Months hence I may bring you one from <hi>Vienna</hi>
to try his <hi>Skill:</hi> But to be plain with you, when he comes, <hi>he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63375:7"/>
will leave you as he finds you,</hi> if you break with him for <hi>Terms;</hi>
but I do think he will not be <hi>unreasonable,</hi> for he hath a very
good <hi>Character:</hi> I know you have an Answer at Hand, therefore
(without leading you) I pray transmit it to this your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor.</p>
            <p>A Word or two more, and I have done; He passes his
Word, That <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>is convinced of its Error,
in being Severe to you.</hi> I know not how this will pass with
you, but being too much a <hi>Stranger</hi> to this <hi>Author,</hi> and to the
nature of his <hi>Commission,</hi> I should be glad to see <hi>her</hi> put out her
own <hi>Declaration of Repentance;</hi> for should this <hi>Person</hi> have
<hi>Authority</hi> to speak for her (<hi>tho of old, true Penitents spoke for
themselves) he</hi> doth it so <hi>ukwardly</hi> in this Paper; that, to be
plain, I suspect 'tis <hi>insincere;</hi> for he <hi>contends,</hi> and that with
the height of Passion, to uphold her <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and I have no
other Quarrel with her, but about <hi>Thunderbolts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He proceeds, <hi>The Parliament, when ever it meeteth, is sure to be
gentle to you:</hi> 'tis the first thing we agree in, and it grieves me
that we could not hit upon it sooner; <hi>I do</hi> hope and <hi>believe,</hi> he is
at length in the right, but that I may not be cheated; if you
find him in good humor, when you see him; let him know from
me, (<hi>with my service</hi>) that my <hi>suffrage</hi> shall never help <hi>him,</hi> or
any of his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> into the House of <hi>Commons;</hi> He
admonishes you not to <hi>misapply your anger,</hi> allow another Friend
to exhort you, not to <hi>misplace</hi> your <hi>Voice,</hi> when the King shall
please to call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and you will oblige your self and
me.</p>
