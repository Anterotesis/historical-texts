            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They muſt build of theſe Hot-houſes, at both the ends of the houſe, if it bee great and ſpacious; but if the houſe be little, one will bee enough. And it muſt bee built in this forme following. Firſt, a hole muſt be made in the houſe wall, wherein you will build your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9600:7"/>
Hot-houſe or Ouen, and therein build vp, as it were an Ouen, after the manner of the Countrey Ouens. The Ouens mouth muſt be at the outſide of the houſe, with a little Chimney to it, and the backe of the Ouen, within the inſide of the houſe. Then muſt you haue earthen pots, like Flower pots, without holes in the bottomes, and ſcarce ſo big as they, which muſt be made pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, ſo as they may be able to abide the fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe pots muſt be placed with a diſtant propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpace, betweene pot and pot, and ſo build them in, within the vault of the ſaid Ouen, with bricke and clay; the mouth of the ſaid pots muſt ſtand out at the backe of the Ouen, and looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inſide of the houſe, but the bottomes of the pots muſt ſtand and looke towards the fire, within the inſide of the Ouen: and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt the pots be incorporate within the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. After this done, you may make fire in the Ouen when neede ſhall bee; for the pots being hot, will thereby caſt a heate out, and warme all the houſe, and the ſmoke gets out at the chimney of the Ouens mouth, at the outſide of the houſe. Item, it will be good to put into theſe pots, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine branches of Roſemary, or Tyme, Roſes, or other ſweet ſmels, for that is a meane to keepe the houſe in a temperate and reaſonable heate, as need and occaſion requireth.

               <p>In theſe wooddy places alſo, you ſhall do well to cut downe all other trees that grow neere to the Mulbery trees, and ouer-ſhade them, and alſo to prune off the boughs of the Mulbery trees that grow too thicke, that ſo the Sun may come fairely to the trees and leaues, for the bettering of the food for the Silkewormes.</p>

It is to be noted, that the bords or ſhelues that are to be put in ſuch frames, are to be of Firre, or of other wood that hath no ſtrong and ill ſmell, or elſe let them bee made of Reeds, or beſt of all of Indian Mats, to ſerue in ſtead of ſhelues of wood: for theſe are the fitteſt of all other, becauſe they keepe the Wormes more dry and freſh in hot weather, by reaſon of the wind that blowes thorow them. Theſe Mats may haue croſſe Ioices of boord to ſupport them, or elſe Cord put thorow the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red holes of the ſides of the frame, as bedcords in a bedſted; but if the Tables or Stages be made of boords, then they are to be very thinne, to the end they may not receiue too much moyſtneſſe from the Wormes.

               <p>Then are you to prepare and ſet vp your boughs and branches, and ſet them in rancks, vpon the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſhelues or tables, vpright ſtanding, the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger end reſting vpon the loweſt ſhelfe, and the ſmall end of the ſaid boughes, reſting againſt the next vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhelfe or boord to that, and ſpread them about, arching at large what you can, to the end the Wormes may haue more roome and ſcope, to make their balls or bottoms of Silke, leauing a foot and a quarter diſtance, betweene the ſaid boughes one from another, at the bigger, and lower end of them. And between the two ſides or arches of theſe ſaid boughes, vpon the ſhelfe you are to ſet your Wormes, and giue them freſh, greene, and tender leaues, as much as they will eate.

you ſee any of them not to get vp, but wander heere and there from the ſaid branches, not finding them, you muſt take him, or them with your fingers, cleanely, and nicely, and ſet it at the foot of the bough: for then, if he be ready to ſpin, hee will get vpon it.</p>
               <p>At that time, you muſt clenſe them very often, becauſe they dung much; and then you may handle them with the hand, for that reioyces them, ſo you haue a care not to cruſh or preſſe them.

               <p>TEn dayes after, or thereabouts, that the Silkewormes haue made their ſilke balls, or bottoms vpon the boughes; then are you to take away the branches with the balls, and to take the cods off from the ſaid boughes or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Then alſo muſt you chuſe out the very beſt Silke balls, to make as much ſeed, as you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue for the next yeere. There goes two hundred Silke cods, or bottoms, to make one ounce of ſeed: But if they bee double, that is to ſay, if there bee found two or three Wormes in one Silke ball or bottome, as it often falleth out, we are to iudge and eſtimate then, that one hundred couple of Wormes will make one ounce of ſeed, or thereabouts. And one ounce of ſeed bringeth foorth ſixe, eight, and ten pounds of Silke by the yeere, more or leſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the ſeaſon is fitting. In <hi>Valencia,</hi> in <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> and in ſundry other places, they keepe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily for ſeed, thoſe bottoms of Silke, wherein are two or three Wormes a piece: becauſe their Silke is neither ſo fine, nor ſo eaſie to bee ſpun, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They may bee knowne by the handling of them, for they are ſtronger, rounder, and bigger then the reſt: But ſometimes it falleth out, that the Wormes cannot breake thorow their Silke bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; in ſuch caſe, they muſt be clipped at the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler end with the point of a paire of Siſers, without
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9600:16"/>
cutting the piece cleane off from the bottome, in which you muſt haue a care not to offend the Wormes: Then with a needle and a thred, muſt you thred them together, not thruſting the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thorow the body of the bottome, but at one ſide; onely paſſing the needle thorow the firſt coorſe downe or ſleaue.</p>
               <p>Note alſo, that ſuch ſilke bottomes as haue but one Worme, you need not to cut them. Then hang them vpon nailes, or woodden pinnes, where Vermine cannot come. And when the Wormes ſhall come forth and be Butterflies, you are to take them by the wings, and ſet them vpon certaine ſhelues; to the end that the male and the female may couple together. Alſo then muſt you be prouided of ſome ſtuffe, old or new, that hath no wooll vpon it (but vſe no linnen or paper) and hang vp the ſaid ſtuffe in ſome part of the houſe; then take the Butterflies all coupled together as they are, by their wings, and ſet them vpon the ſaid ſtuffe, be it Say, Piropus, the backſide of old Veluet, or ſuch like ſtuffe as hath no wooll on it, ſo hang'd vp againſt the walles, as we haue ſaid; but in any caſe, ſet not them thereon, till they be coupled and ioyned together; for otherwiſe the ſeed would prooue worth nothing. And if any be ſo poore, that they cannot get ſuch ſtuffe, let them take Walnut-tree leaues, one handfull, or more, and tye them together by doozens, the backe of the leaues on the backſide, and hang them at a naile, or pinne, and ſet the coupled But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflies vpon them, as we haue ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:9600:17"/>Note that the Butterflies come not out of the Cod commonly but in the morning, about eight a clocke.</p>
               <p>You ſhall know the ſeed by the colour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the good from the bad, to wit, that of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Wormes which is good, becommeth black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh within eight or ten dayes after; the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yellowiſh, and that is worth nothing.</p>
               <p>When you ſee that all the Butterflies be dead, and the ſeed become grayiſh, you ſhall take it vp with a knife, very gingerly, and that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth vpon the leaues, you may take vp eaſily with your fingers. And if by chance ſome ſeed ſhould be laid vpon paper or linnen, it cleaueth ſo faſt, that you cannot get it off, without ſpoyling it; in ſuch caſe you muſt keepe it, paper and all, to the next yeere; and in the due ſeaſon, the Wormes will come foorth thereout of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But the other ſeed gathered from the ſtuffe or leaues aforeſaid, you muſt put in a boxe, very cleane, the ſides cloſe paſted with paper, that no aire nor duſt get in, and keepe it in a cheſt, in a dry temperate place, till the next yeere: but take heed you keepe it neither in too cold, nor in too warme a place; for then the heate would hatch the Wormes, though it were in Winter; and then being no leaues to feed them, they ſtarue and dye, and ſo all your labour is loſt.</p>

               <p>NOw to know the male Worme from the female, (which cannot be well diſcerned till the Wormes bee growne great) you ſhall diſtinguiſh them by their heads, becauſe the male Worme hath his head more wrinkled, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing eyes, as a man would thinke: whereas the female hath her head round, with ſmall appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of eyes.

               <p>AS ſoone as you haue taken the bottomes of ſilke from the branches abouenamed, before they turne to bee Butterflies, it is beſt to ſpinne the ſilke from off the bottomes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9600:18"/>
after the bottomes haue bin once pearced, they cannot yeeld ſo fine ſilke, but onely a coorſe ſilk or ſleaue. And he that ſhall not be able to get his ſilke to be ſpunne, before the bottome may be pierced, which will be about a fortnight, or three weekes, after the Wormes haue ſpun, then afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand you may kill the Wormes thus with the heate of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>To this end then, you muſt ſpread the ſilke bottomes in the Sun, at noone-day, when it is in the greateſt heate, vpon plankes, or ſuch like, for the ſpace of one houre, turning them often. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, gather them all into a heape, in a linnen cloth, and therewith couer them, to ſmother the Wormes within their bottomes, and continue in ſo doing two or three dayes. And in caſe the Sun ſhould bee wanting in light and heate, to kill the Wormes; then after you haue drawn your bread from out the Ouen, or elſe hauing heated it, to the ſame meaſure and proportion of heate, all the embers of the fire firſt taken out, you may put the bottomes into the Ouen, vpon woodden boords, or ſome ſuch like thing, and ſtirre them often, as wee haue already ſaid: But remember that you leaue not the bottoms aboue an houre in the Ouen, leſt the ſilke burne, or being too much dryed vp, become vnfit to be ſpunne afterwards. Beware alſo the Ouen be not too hot. And if the Wormes be not dead at the firſt time, put them in againe till they bee dead. After that, you muſt keepe the ſilke bottomes in a place where they may not be preſſed together too hard, and where
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9600:18"/>
Vermine cannot come. And ſo you may keepe them till you haue time conuenient to ſpinne the ſilke. Yet if you can ſpinne the ſilke before you kill the Wormes, the ſilke will prooue much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more eaſie to be ſpunne.</p>
               <p>There is another way, and better, to kill the Wormes within their bottomes, for ſuch as can doe it; and this they practiſe at <hi>Meſsina.</hi> They haue furnaces, and great Cauldrons or Coppers, ſuch as Diers vſe, thoſe they fill halfe full with water; then they make a fire in the furnace, to heate the water. Then they lay a round lid or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of planke or boord within the Cauldron or Copper, but ſo borne vp by the Copper, that it touch not the water, though it lye neere to it, within three or foure fingers bredth of it, which round lid or couer muſt be bored as full of holes as a Siue: vpon this couer they lay a thin Carpet of Darnix, or the like, and vpon the Carpet, the ſilke bottomes are laid, which muſt be ſtirred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the Cauldron or Copper muſt bee coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aboue the lid, that the heate may ſmother the Wormes within the bottomes. When the Wormes be dead, take vp the bottomes, and lay them in ſome roome where there is ayre, to draw out and dry their moyſtneſſe.

But in ſuch places where they grow naturally, where the nature of the ſoyle is ſuch, that it bringeth them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9600:20"/>
foorth without ſo much handy labour, there their fruit is better. And thoſe men that will haue ſome trees planted vpon their land, they are to make good choice of them in Summer, and marke them ſo, as they may know them in Winter, to remooue them in the due ſeaſon fit to plant them in. And to chuſe the very beſt of them, you are to cull out ſuch as haue round leaues, and not forked, for both the fruit, and the leaues of them are better then thoſe of the other Trees. Theſe fiue and twenty yeeres I haue ſeene diuers Countreys, where they began (and afterwards found it very profitable) to plant Mulbery trees about their grounds, in ſtead of hedges, where they grow ſo ſpeedily, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeere they may begin to gather ſome leaues, during the time that the Wormes are ſmall: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the leaues of little trees grow ſooner, then they of big Trees. To plant Mulbery trees in forme of a thicke hedge, for to haue the firſt yong leaues, for the Wormes new hatched, you muſt make a ditch of a foote and a halfe deepe, and as broad, and therein plant your yong trees, then fill the ditch with earth almoſt full: then cut off the branches of the trees that you haue ſet; for that will make them grow the better; and place them two foot neere one another. And whoſoeuer will haue a double hedge of them, let him make another ditch three or foure foote neere that, and plant it as in the other: Their Wood, when they are plaſhed, is as good to burne, as any other; and their Aſhes better.</p>

               <p>WHoſoeuer will make a Nurcery of the ſeed of Mulbery trees, when the fruit is ripe, let him obſerue that Tree, that beares the faireſt and roundeſt leafe; and of that tree let him gather ſo many Mulberies, as will fit him for his ſeed, which muſt be thus vſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, waſh the Mulberyes in two or three wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, preſſing them with your hands, and then take vp the ſeed that remaineth in the bottome of the water. After that, dry your ſeed in the houſe, and keepe it till the moneth of March next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Such men as will gaine one yeere, ſow it aſſoone as they haue gathered it, without dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; And other men ſow the Mulberies whole as they are, in that manner that we will ſay.</p>

               <p>FIrſt, you muſt dig, husband, and make beds of fat earth, the mold being made ſmall, and wel dunged with good old dung, thorowly rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and you muſt make your beds foure foot, or foure and a halfe broad: And within the ſaid beds, you muſt make foure or fiue ſtraight lines of rayes or furrowes, all halfe a foot equally diſtant one from another, and euery furrow muſt bee two inches deepe, and foure broad; And betweene euery bed you muſt leaue little Allies, or ſpaces halfe a foot
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9600:21"/>

               <p>The firſt yeere you muſt take care to water it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, if the weather bee dry, and the earth muſt bee kept cleane from weeds.

                  <hi>1.</hi> Another Diſcourſe how to plant the Vine, how to dreſſe and husband it ſundry wayes, how to chuſe the ground and the ſeate to that effect.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, ſuch as will plant Vines, they are to chuſe a ſoyle proper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for that vſe. If you plant it in a low ground, and moyſt, there the Vine growes well, and beares ſtore of fruit, but the Grapes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ripen well, and therefore the wine is not good, nor can it be kept long. You muſt then make choice of a dry ſoyle, whoſe aſpect is toward the full South Sunne, and couered or ſheltered from the Noth wind, if it bee poſſible. And if you meete with riſing ground, as the ſides of hills hanging downe, they are moſt proper, and though they bee full of little ſtones, and grauell, they are alſo the better for them, and not the worſe; the wine of ſuch places being better able to be kept long, and fitter alſo to be carried farre.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you muſt open the earth, and dig it one foot and a halfe deepe, or thereabouts. And after you haue digged as much earth as you haue plants to ſet, you muſt make ditches in the ſaid ground looking towards the full South, one foot and a halfe deepe, and as broad, and of the length that the place is of.</p>
               <p>The ditches muſt bee three or foure foot diſtant one from another: ſo after you haue ſelected your
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9600:22"/>
plants, whether with roots, or without, as of ſlips or cuttings (for the Vine growes aſwell without root, as with, and that which is ſet without root, is of the longer indurance and laſting; though true it is, that the firſt yere it will not grow ſo much as that which hath rootes) Theſe plants I ſay, muſt bee planted three or foure foot one from another, in as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as the ditches are one from another. And the Vine plants muſt be planted in a ſtraight line, in forme of a Checker, quadrangle-wiſe.</p>
               <p>Heere obſerue, that if the plants bee without rootes, you muſt cauſe them to ſoke in freſh water, twelue or fifteene dayes ere you plant them, putting the big end of the plant in the water a foot deepe. But if they haue roots, you muſt cut them off (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they were pluckt vp one day or two at moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you plant them) and put them in water two or three dayes. He that ſhall plant the Vine, muſt haue one to helpe him, who ſhall lay the Vine in the ditch, all along the ſaid ditch, of what diſtance he will, one from the other. And in planting, he ſhall tread in the ditch, letting ſome of the digged earth fall into the place where hee is to plant or ſet his Vine; then ſhall hee take his plant, and bow it one foot in the earth of the ditch, or thereabouts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the length of the plant, putting the biggeſt end within the ditch, towards the plumpe, South of the Sunne-riſing, and with the hand, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp the point, end, or top of it, ſetting his foot on the root, and caſting ſome mould on it, halfe a foot deepe or more, and treading on it, that it may bee firme. And hee muſt doe ſo, all along the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9600:23"/>
ditch, vſing a line, to plant them with an equall diſtance, doing the like in, and thorow all the ditches.</p>
               <p>When your Vine ſhall bee thus planted, then let fall more mould within the ditch all along, yet you muſt not fill it vp the firſt yeere. Alſo bee ſure that you make that earth that is betweene two ditches, ſlaunt on both ſides. And husbanding the ſaid Vine from time to time, the earth of it ſelfe will fall into the ditches, and fill them. The Vine is no ſooner planted, but it muſt bee cut, not leauing vpon each branch aboue three knobs or knots, which wee call eyes: But the old Vine that is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about houſes, to make long Vines, that muſt not bee cut as yet; for you muſt leaue it all the old wood or branches, and one part of the laſt yeeres branches; both muſt bee cut the firſt yeere, in the beginning of the new Moone: The ſecond yeere it muſt bee cut at the full Moone, and then leaue it but one branch, the loweſt and ſtrongeſt, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vpon the ſaid branch, but foure knobs or knots, or thereabouts, according as the Vine ſhall bee waxed.</p>
               <p>Alſo you are to note, that in cutting the Vine, you muſt haue a good knife, or rather a ſharpe hooke, as in <hi>France,</hi> in ſuch a forme as the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers knife, wherewith you muſt cut the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches very euen, and very neere the old wood, to the end that the Vine growing, may couer the cut.</p>
               <p>When you ſee in the moneth of May or Iune, that there grow vpon your Vine many ſprigs ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9600:23"/>
from tho foote of the old Wood, you muſt plucke them off with your hand, and let none grow, but ſuch as grow vpon the laſt yeeres bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, vnles the Vine be very ſtrong; in ſuch caſe you may leaue her ſome of ſuch twigs to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply her.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that will haue their Vines grow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtakes or props, as they doe in <hi>Languedock</hi> and <hi>Prouence,</hi> ſuch you are to cut ſo ſhort euery yeere, that you leaue them but two or three knobs, to the end the Vine may grow big and be ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at the foote.</p>
               <p>The third yeere, the Vine begins to pay and recompence or reward her Maſter for his labors; then muſt you cut her a little longer, and leaue her more branches, (<hi>viz.</hi>) two or three in euery one, and euer the loweſt. Obſerue alſo, that if the Vine breed much Wood, then you muſt cut it when the Moone wayneth; but if it bring forth little Wood or branches, cut it in the firſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Moone, toward the full thereof: all muſt be cut in December, Ianuary, and February.</p>

               <p>THe greateſt part of the Vines of thoſe Countries are planted in the open fields, and grow vp vpon trees, that are planted there to that end; they plant one or two Vines at one Tree, namely, of the longeſt Vines they can get, to the end they may grow, and bee the ſooner vpon the top of each tree; and they cut the branches of the Trees off, that bee too long, that the Trees may grow round, as much as may be.</p>
               <p>Touching the Vine, it muſt be cut euery yeere, as we ſaid already, yet they muſt leaue this many more branches then are vſually left vpon other Vines. And where there are no Trees planted, there cut off ſome long and big boughes of trees, or get euen whole Trees, of the bignes of a mans thigh or thereabouts, leauing onely vpon them

               <p>Obſerue alſo, that they plant the ſaid Trees or boughes ten or twelue foote diſtance one from another or thereabouts. You muſt bee carefull when they be rotten, to ſet others in their rooms.

               <p>And for as much as in <hi>Virginia</hi> there are found old Vines in the lands, that the Inhabitants doe cleere for their vſe, they might ſpare the ſaid Vines, and plant by them ſuch Trees or boughes, as we ſaid, and tye the Vines vpon them, to prop them vp, as is ſaid; for they would bring forth much fruite the very firſt yeere, which would be as much time gayned, and labour ſpared.

               <p>THere they plant the Vine as followeth. Firſt, hauing prepared the ſoyle, they make ditches, as we haue told you before; then plant they the Vine two foote, one from the other: and the firſt yeere they cut it very ſhort, leauing but three knobs or knots out of the earth. The ſecond yeere they cut it at the firſt quarter of the Moone, and leaue to euery one but one branch, as long as they can leaue it, and ſet a ſtake at euery one of the Vines. Two yeeres after, they prouide them certaine woodden forkes, of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9600:25"/>
the bignes of a mans legge, and woodden poles as big as his arme, alſo ſmaller poles: then they ſticke the forkes in the earth, from ſixe to ſixe foote diſtance, all along the ditch where the Vine is planted, and as much in height, or leſſe if they thinke it fit, and ſo they doe alike in each ditch: then they lay the bigger poles from one forke to another, tying them together with Oſier or Willow; and then they tye the leſſer poles, being ſixe or ſeuen foote length, athwart ouer the bigger poles, binding them together with Oſier, in diſtance one from another of one foote and a halfe, much in the forme of the nets that men lay to take Deere to tranſport from one Parke into another.</p>
               <p>They cut the Vine the ſecond yeere, as long as they can leaue it, and they leaue it but one branch, to wit, the ſtrongeſt, to the end the Vine may mount vp the ſooner vpon the ſaid frame of Poles, which we now deſcribed, and they binde it thereupon. Now when the Vine is vpon it, which is the yeere following, then muſt you leaue more branches to the ſaid Vine, when you cut it, according as you ſhall ſee that her ſtocke is ſtrong and able enough to feede her. And you muſt leaue in euery branch, fiue or ſixe knots or eyes, and euery yeere binde vp the ends of all the new branches which are left vncut; vpon the pole, frame with Oſier, or with greene Ruſhes, or what you can get. They plant ſuch Vines vpon the arable Lands about houſes, and vpon or ouer the high wayes, terming them Treillies or plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9600:26"/>
high Vines, which they plant as followeth. Firſt, they digge a ditch in the place, where they meane to ſet the Vine, in that ſort we deſcribed afore: And they plant the Vine within the ditch, as alſo wee haue ſhewed: then prouide they woodden forkes, and bigger and ſmaller poles, as is afore ſet downe.</p>
               <p>Such forkes as are ſet in the ditch, muſt be but two or three foote high: plant a row of them, ſixe or ſeuen foote from the ſaid ditch or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, right againſt the South, and lay on them great and ſmall poles, and tye them as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>WHen you ſhall ſee the Grapes very blacke, and that there are no grayiſh graines among them, and that the ſtalke of the branch is become reddiſh, and the white Grapes draw to be of a yellowiſh colour, and the graynes tender; theſe be tokens that they are ripe, which thing you ſhall yet better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in taſting them; If they be ſweete in taſte, and the liquor be gluiſh betweene your fingers, then is it time to gather them. Yet in euery place they cannot ripen alike, ſo wel as in ſome, though it be vnder the ſame Climate.</p>
               <p>In low places, and moiſt wet grounds, they are neuer ſo good, nor ſo ſoone ripe, as they are in the dry grounds, and the hilly or ſides of hills, and as in the ſtony and grauelly grounds; and that is the cauſe, why they are not to be gathered ſo ſoone in moiſt grounds.</p>
               <p>Note alſo, when you gather your Grapes, that you may haue the Wine to be good and fit to keepe long; doe it in dry weather, not in rayny, for that ſpoyles the Wine, and takes away his ſtrength, and hurteth the Vine.</p>
               <p>When you gather your Grapes, chuſe the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and carry them home; but afore-hand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide a Vat, or ſuch a Tub as Brewers vſe in Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9600:27"/>
to let the Wine purge it ſelfe in. The Grapes muſt be trodden in the veſſell, with bare legs and feet; firſt of all in a leſſer veſſell or tub, and then after that, remoue the trodden Grapes, into a bigger Vat, by degrees as they are trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, huske and all together: And you may fill the Vat or Tub, within halfe a foot of the brim therof. Such veſſels muſt ſtand vpon the one end, vpon their bottome, but all open vpward: they muſt be well bound; for otherwiſe the force of the new Wine will breake them all in pieces.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer will haue his Wine all Claret, let him gather all his Grapes all at once, the white and the blacke, and put them all together in the veſſell, and let them worke together.</p>
               <p>Before you put them into the Vat or Tub, make a little bundle of ſhort Vine-branches; then make a hole in the low end of the Vat or Tub in the forepart, to draw the Wine out, when it is purged: put the ſaid bundle of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches within the ſaid veſſell, iuſt before the tap-hole, and lay a cleane ſtone or Bricke vpon it, to keepe it from heauing vp with the Wine; this will hinder, when you draw the Wine, that the skins or huskes of the Grapes come not out at the tap-hole with it. You muſt let the Wine worke, and purge it ſelfe, fiue or ſixe dayes, or more, if you will haue it looke very red. After that, draw it below, and put it in Barrels or Hogſheads. By this time, you hauing gathered your greener Grapes, after you haue trodden the ſame, as we haue ſaid, put them into the Vat or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9600:28"/>
Tub, with the huskes or skinnes of the former preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Grapes, out of which you haue drawne the Wine, and mingle them well together, either with the foot or with a ſtaffe, and let the Wine worke together as before, and it will bee a meane ſmall Wine for the houſhold: After, when it hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it ſelfe ſeuen or eight dayes, draw it out and barrell it. Beware you ſtop not the large vpper hole of the veſſell, vntill the Wine hath loſt and ſpent all his great heate.</p>
               <p>There are ſome, who after this, preſſe the huskes in the preſſe, drawing out all that can come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, putting that liquor into a Barrell by it ſelfe. Others goe further, and put water to the huskes and latter Wine, at diuers times, not all at once, but by little and little, putting one Tenth part of water, in proportion of the quantity of the Wine, which they haue ſo drawne, and they let it worke and purge it ſelfe in the Vat, or leſſer veſſell, fiue or ſixe dayes, and then draw it and barrell it: This will be prettie ſmal Wine for the ſeruants or houſhold. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer will make Wine meerely white, let him ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all his white Grapes by themſelues, and let the Wine worke and purge it ſelfe in the Vat but two or three dayes; for if you let it ſtand longer, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour will be yellow; this is the manner practiſed in <hi>Languedoc, Prouence,</hi> and elſewhere: but in <hi>Poictou</hi> and in ſome other parts of <hi>France,</hi> they doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that it may be the whiter.</p>
               <p>After it hath been trodden, draw out the Wine, and put it in Barrels, and there let it purge, without his huskes or skinnes. You muſt be carefull to fill
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9600:28"/>
vp the Barrels euery day, according as it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth with working, otherwiſe the Lees and other corruptions will goe downe into the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and when hot weather commeth, will ſpoile the Wine. You may do ſo with the Claret, when you will not haue it too red, but cleere, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hot countries.</p>

               <p>I Haue been informed by ſuch as haue bin in <hi>Virginia,</hi> that there grow infinite number of wilde Vines there, and of ſeuerall ſorts; ſome climbe vp to the top of trees in the woods, and they bring forth great quantities of ſmall blacke Grapes, which are the plainer to be ſeene, when the leaues are falne off from the trees. Another ſort of Grapes there is, that runne vpon the ground, almoſt as big as a Damſon, very ſweet, and maketh deepe red Wine, which they call a Fox-Grape. A third ſort there is, which is a white Grape, but that is but rare, which are all deuoured by the birds and beaſts.</p>
               <p>Now if ſuch men as dwell there, would take the paines to gather ſome of them, when they be ripe, and tread them as aforeſaid, and make the Wine worke with water, putting it in Vats or Tubs, as we ſaid, it would purge it ſelfe as well as good Wine doth; and if the Grapes bee too hard, they may boyle them with ſome water;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9600:29"/>
and if the Cauldron be too little to boyle them all together, boyle them one after another, till all be boyled, and then put them all into the Vat or Tub, to wit, the Wine, the water, and the huskes of the Grapes, and then let them worke thus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fiue or ſixe dayes, or elſe ſo long till you thinke it fit and good to bee drunke. After that, you may draw it, and barrell it, as wee haue ſaid, and vſe it when you need. I haue oftentimes ſeen ſuch Wine made reaſonable good for the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.

Yet whoſoeuer would be curious to trie concluſions, may ſow of it, as they ſowe other ſeeds. For to draw out and get the ſeedes of them, the Grapes being very ripe, you muſt gather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them and wring them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene your hands, and ſo take out the ſeeds or kernels, and then ſowe the ſame preſently, or elſe dry them in the ſhaddow, not in the Sunne, and keepe them till February or March next comming, and then ſoke them in freſh water two or three dayes before you ſowe them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For the ſeed of the Fig tree, draw it alſo out of his Figs, being freſh, and ſowe it, as that of the Mulbery tree, whereof wee haue treated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>

And thoſe that will keepe them till March next, muſt dry them in the ſhaddow, not in the Sun. And before you plant them, put them foure or fiue dayes in water or wine, then put them foure inches deepe in the earth. Otherwiſe, without

               <p n="13">13. The Cheſt-nut is to be planted greene and freſh, elſe it will neuer proſper, if you let it be dried.

               <p n="15">15. For the ſeeds of Apples and Peares, the fruit being very ripe, you are then to take out the ſeed, and dry them in the ſhade, and you may keepe them till February following or March, to ſow them. Then muſt you haue prepared for them good ground, and you muſt make in it ſmall rayes or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, of two or three inches in breadth, and of like depth, each furrow being three quarters of a foot diſtant one from the other, and you muſt ſow the ſeed within the ſaid furrowes, couering them with earth.

               <p>All Authors of Agriculture will tell you, that neither Arable, Paſture, Meddowes, nor any other grounds, are ſo proper to plant the Vine in, as thoſe cleered grounds are, wherein not ſhrubs, but tall Trees grew. And what Countrey in the world ſo full as this, of tall and goodly Timber trees? ſo as when you cleere your grounds, you ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily may remooue your Vines into them, and the remoouing giues them alſo a perfection. Likewiſe may you leaue your Mulberies ſtill growing, euen where you plant your Vines: for ſuch loue and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity there is betweene theſe two, (as good things alwayes goe together) That the ſoyle and Clime which fits the one, fits the other; and what the one loues or hates, the other doeth the like.

And as for the other commodities that <hi>Virginia</hi> hath not at all as yet, as Rice and Sugars, likewiſe none may doubt, ſeeing the ſoyle and Clime heere are indued with no contrarieties, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, or diſtemperatures to hinder the growth of them, but hath all conueniences alike fitting for theſe purpoſes; there is no doubt then (I ſay) but that when they are once tranſported hither from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, and planted heere, but that it muſt needs prooue capeable of them, being ſo naturally fitted already for them. Neither yet is it to bee thought, that any cultiuated Country in the world, though neuer ſo fruitfull, had all things at firſt there naturally growing in it, as now it hath, but that many of them were brought afterwards thither from other places. And ſo in like ſort, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards haue tranſported out of Europe and the Eaſt-Indies, diuers plants of fruits, drugs and dies, and many rich commodities, which they haue proſperouſly planted in the Weſt Indies, to their great gaine, as may eaſily bee ſhewne.

                  <hi>Virginia,</hi> that at <hi>Roanoak</hi> they reap three Harueſts in fiue moneths ſpace: they ſowe in May, and in Iune, and in Iuly; and reape againe, in Iuly, Auguſt, and September.

Whereupon is to be inferred, that <hi>Virginia</hi> hauing ſtore of Ploughes and good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, need not onely neuer feare dearth and ſcarcity, but may by the many ſeedings and many Harueſts, bee made a Countrey as plentifull of all graine, as <hi>China,</hi> or any other whatſoeuer in the world. Beſides, ſome knowne commodities you haue, which <hi>China</hi> wants: to omit others, that which is called <hi>Terra-Lemnia,</hi> formerly a peculiar treaſure of the great Turkes onely, <note n="⋆" place="margin">Mendoſa, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of China.</note> and Wine of Grapes, whereof they haue none: for all theirs are made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Palme tree called Cocos, or of the Palme that beares Dates, which being exceeding

Onely let euery man doe what he can commodiouſly, to his power and ability, and aſſure himſelfe, though he keepe not all ſtrict rules in euery thing, that yet he may make a great gaine, notwithſtanding ſtill the greater, the more curious he be in obſeruing and practiſing all the approued experiments, Rules,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9600:41"/>
and precepts hereunto belonging.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rules are chiefly to ſhew the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Art, and that alſo a man may learne thereby, that if the Silkewormes miſcarrie or proſper not ſo well one yeere, what might be the cauſe of it, and where the fault lay, and how next yeere that may be remedied which was amiſſe afore, without deſpayring or being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. Beſides you muſt know, that all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Rules euer admit ſome exceptions, and varie according to ſome particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And therefore to make the Rules the ſurer for you, the nature of the Clymate muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, how and in what one Clymate differs from another, as alſo the ſeaſon of one yeere, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering from another, in cold, heat, drought, or moyſture, the manner of the lodgings, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the windes, to be let in, and kept out vpon occaſion fitting, and ſo according to all the different qualities, to gouerne this worke diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently with diſcretion. As if it be a cold ſeaſon, to vſe more artificiall heat, for the cheriſhing the Wormes; if it be a verie hot ſeaſon, to let in the coole ayre and the windes, as much as may be to refreſh them, eſpecially when they ſpin their Silke, for feare of ſtifling them with too much heat. If it be a moiſt time (the worſt ſeaſon of all other euer for the Silkewormes) to vſe dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heats and perfumes ſo much the more, to qualifie the moiſt and the ill ſeaſon, and to be carefull, that the Mulbery leafe be wel dried, and kept the longer after it be gathered, afore it be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9600:41"/>
giuen. But if the ſeaſon be dry, then conſider, that the leafe, after it hath lyen and cooled a while, may be giuen the freſher, and the Mulbery tree roots may be watered in theſe droughts, to refreſh the leaues, as they doe ſometimes in <hi>Spaine,</hi> eſpecially if it be in a drie and hot ground, which otherwiſe without theſe cautions were not ſo good. Then muſt you conſider alſo, if the Mulbery tree grow in a ſhady place, or in a ſowre, foule or wet ſoile, what inconuenience that food may bring vnto the worm, &amp; thereafter either to auoid it wholy, if it be poſſible, or elſe to qualifie it as well as may be: Neuertheleſſe noting that in a hot and dry yeere, a man may be more bold to feed with thoſe leaues, that grow in a ſhady or moiſt ground, by reaſon the temper of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath the better corrected the ill quality of them. Thus regard with reaſon alwaies, what kinde of ground the leafe grew in, and in what qualified ſeaſon you gather it in, and conſider the kinde, and nature of the tree, and the nature and kinde of the Silke-ſeed you vſe, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all particular circumſtances, well ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo to make your exceptions, and to order euerie thing with iudgement, and diſcretion thereafter. Time and obſeruation will teach you many experiments, out of which perhaps ſome more rules of art may be made, as beſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſome particularities, the Countrie and Clymate of <hi>Virginia,</hi> which finding, after good triall made, you ſhall doe well to ſet them downe in writing, that in time they may be publiſhed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9600:42"/>
alſo, for the better directing, and profiting of others. And becauſe in <hi>Perſia</hi> (where ſuch infinite ſtore of Silke is made) it is not likely, that they tie themſelues to all the ſtrict rule, and niceties, which for the moſt part are neceſſary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in many Countries, but doe what is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting otherwiſe, for that Clymate, moſt proper for this worke; (with which <hi>Virginia</hi> ſo neerely agrees, and naturally conſorts as is aforeſaid) for this eſpeciall purpoſe therefore, meanes are made (I heare) to certifie you from the Engliſh Factory in <hi>Perſia,</hi> of the art and order that they vſe, in all particulars, for the Silke-workes there; which may guide you, happily, to a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious and ready way, for the better ſpeeding of this rich buſineſſe. And yet where all theſe rules are curiouſly followed, they make not onely <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but in the worſer parts of <hi>France,</hi> and other-where, a farre greater gaine (ſo much for ſo much) by feeding the Silke-wormes, then by any other commodity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. Inſomuch as ſome Gentlemen in <hi>Italy,</hi> which keepe no Silke-wormes themſelues (and which are therefore of the worſt ſort of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands) yet by letting out their Mulbery trees to others, for the leafe onely, make a great part of their reuenues, ſome 500. li. ſome 1000. li. a yeere; ſome more, ſome leſſe, according to the number, greatneſſe, and goodneſſe of their Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery trees. <note n="⋆" place="margin">Ol. Serres <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> So likewiſe in <hi>Auignon, Dauphiné, Lauguedoc, Prouence,</hi> and other parts of <hi>France,</hi> ſome let out their Mulbery trees to others, from
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9600:42"/>
two ſhillings, to twelue ſhillings apiece and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, accordingly as they are. <note n="⋆" place="margin">Auguſtino Gallo, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> But ſome other Gentlemen in <hi>Italy</hi> let out their Mulberie trees, after another maner, namely, they are at the charge onely, to giue the leafe of their Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery trees, to ſome poore folkes, for which they are to finde at their coſt, the Silke-ſeed, and are to feed and tend the Wormes, till they haue made their Silke: which done, they deuide the Silke bottomes, by halues betweene them. Thus you ſee, what a rich reuenue I haue prouided for you, in Mulbery trees alone, which are halfe the charge, and yet coſt you nothing. And I hope I need not tell you, how it is a matter, no leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable then eaſie, for the better aduancing this Commodity, to build for this purpoſe farre from your houſes (if need be) in the moſt conuenient places, of the beſt Mulbery woods, ſome ſlight Silke-worme lodgings, ſoone ſet vp, and with Stoues in them, after that excellent manner of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> formerly deſcribed; which by this Art may correct the ill ſite and temper, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the Ayre well, in the cold, moyſt and ſhady woods, leſt otherwiſe that might be a hindrance to this worke. And here alſo in theſe lodgings, you may make good ſhift (eſpecially for ſo great a gaine) with neceſſary prouiſions to lodge your ſelues, from the beginning, to the end of your Silke-harueſt time, about ſome ſixe weekes only: where you ſhall need but one third part of your companie, the firſt foure weekes, and two third parts more, the laſt fortnight onely, for the often
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9600:43"/>
then and plentifull feeding of the Wormes. To inuite you to this enterpriſe, you haue aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of choyce Materials, to erect theſe Silke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodgings with, which will coſt you nothing, but a little labour, to cut out ſome poſts, and to fit them and ſet them vp; or to ſawe out ſmall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and rafters, and plankes, and boords, to fence the ſides in ſtead of walles, and to couer the roofe in ſtead of tiles; all which muſt be ſo cloſe layd in all places, one within another, that no raine, winde, nor weather get in at any riftes or creuiſes to hurt the Wormes. Which the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to preuent, the chinkes (if any be) may be all ſtopped, euery where about, with ſome loame or clay. And thus for their better profit, may many Families (eſpecially of the poorer ſort) ioyne hands together, for the ſpeedy ſetting vp of theſe Silke-lodgings, and for the gathering and ſorting of the Mulbery leaues, and for the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and teaching one another to feed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Wormes, and ſo worke, and liue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all the Silke-harueſt time, and at the end of it, to deuide all the Silke bottomes made amongſt them, by number, weight, or meaſure, after the number and proportion of euerie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and perſon; as to ſome one, ſome two, ſome three, ſome foure ſhares, and ſo more or leſſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, and according to their firſt agreements ſet downe in writing. Here alſo in the meane time, for their better ſuſtenance, may they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly keepe neere about them, their Poultry, Swine, and Milch cattell, for milke and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9600:43"/>
butter, and ſpare their owne paſtures neere home the while.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, what rich benefits I affoord you, for your ſmall labour onely. And if I ſhould giue you all things perfect, without your paines at all, I ſhould breed but mine owne contempt, and nurſe your ſloth. For theſe my great commodities, and all other then, I aske ſome little attendance of you (iuſtly due vnto me) to bring them to perfection. Giue me but two hand-maids onely, Art and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, to waite vpon me, and I will moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and richly then endow both them and you. And for this purpoſe now (not to ſpeake of Husbandry at large) I will chiefly commend the skill of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening, to you all and euery one. Let none be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant to ſow, to ſet, to plant, to graft, to manure, to dreſſe, and order all plants, according to their kinds, and that in proper grounds and ſeaſons fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them. This is part of that skill, which Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Kings, and Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> haue both writ of and practiſed. Let no man then diſdaine it, but get and peruſe their and ſuch like Bookes of this, and other Husbandry. I know not whether the profit of it, or delight be greater. Wherefore all and euery one in <hi>Virginia,</hi> men and women too, from the higheſt to the loweſt in ſome proportion, muſt know and practiſe it, if they minde to thriue, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, and haue true delight. By Gardening alone (eſpecially in theſe rich grounds and temperate Clime) may all haue delicate variety, and good ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of ſuſtenance, were there nothing elſe, for Summer and for Winter. Beſides the Caſſaui, for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9600:44"/>
good bread, I might particularize the wholeſome and great variety of many other nouriſhing roots and herbs, and of other Garden and Orchard fruits, in theſe hotter Countreys eſpecially, moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for food. And this was the chiefe ſuſtenance of the wiſe and ſober Ancients in the golden times. <hi>Panis</hi> and <hi>Holus</hi> (<note n="⋆" place="margin">Julius Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger.</note> by a moſt learned and iudicious Writer) are deriued from two Greeke words, that ſignifie all, and the whole: for the Ancients eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (ſaith he) that if they had but bread and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, they had all and the whole, and euery whit that was neceſſary for their food. Neither is this all for as you may be fed, ſo may you bee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed alſo, by this skill alone, as by the expert plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Cotten, Silke graſſe, Flaxe, Hempe, and ſome ſuch other like. Beſides, the Art of planting well followed, as it can, ſo will it bring you to the greateſt wealth aboue all things whatſoeuer elſe. I need not tel you beſides of the Mulbery plants for Silkes, the infinite treaſure by planting Vines, Oliue trees, and Sugar canes, for Wines, Oyles, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, nor of many other rich Plants, for Phyſicall Drugs, Dies, Paints, and many other vſes. And as for your Wine and Oyles to be made heere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other profits, you ſhall therein bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantaged, aboue the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> alſo, which haue neither of theſe two Commodities; the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in policie forbidding the planting of them there, notwithſtanding the Countrey is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for them. For they two being the great Staple Commodities of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and other his Dominions, with which they abound, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9600:44"/>
knowing that trade of Merchandize conſiſts in bringing in of wares from one Countrey into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, maintaines mutuall trafficke therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> and his other Dominions, by the taking of the Commodities of one another, which cannot be done, vnleſſe one Countrey haue ſtore of thoſe Commodities, which the other wants; For ſtore of the ſame Merchandize in all parts, would but glut &amp; hinder all. Wherfore to ballance the Commodities well of all his Dominions, for the good of all, the planting for Wines and Oiles in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> vpon good reaſons were inhibited. The like he doth in <hi>Braſilia,</hi> who though they haue ſtore of Ginger there, yet may it not bee carried from thence into <hi>Spaine,</hi> for feare of impoueriſhing them of S. <hi>Domingo,</hi> whoſe chiefeſt Trade it is to get their liuings by. And the like doth Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> for you heere, which ſuffer no Sheepe to be carried thither, that Cloth might not be made there, but ſo orders it for the good of both, that you heere ſhall haue from thence, her natiue Commodities, and her Manufactures onely, and vſe no forraine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, but ſuch as is for health or like neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for which you returne the proper Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of <hi>Virginia</hi> thither. Moreouer, by the Arte of skilfull planting, grafting, tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and remoouing, the bad wilde plants are wonderfully bettered: Inſomuch, as one of the beſt Authors of Husbandry ſaith, <note n="⋆" place="margin">Ol. Serres Book. <hi>6.</hi> Cha. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> that euery replan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or remooing of wilde plants (hauing regard to the fitneſſe of the ſoile and ſeaſon) is worth halfe a grafting: ſo as two remooues then, are worth a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:9600:45"/>
whole grafting. One that hath writ a Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſme, ſayes well and wittily, <note n="⋆" place="margin">Plin. natural. Hiſt. lib. <hi>17.</hi> c. <hi>10</hi>
                  </note> that this remoouing and tranſplanting of wild plants, doeth wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mitigate and a ingentle them, whether it bee (ſaith he) becauſe that the nature of plants, as of men, is deſirous of nouelty and peregrination, or becauſe that at their parting (from the former grounds) they leaue there that ranke wildneſſe, virulence, and ill quality that is in them, and as wild beaſts, ſo they become gentle by handling, whilſt the Plant is pluckt vp by the roote.</p>
               <p>Since then the tranſplanting and remoouing wild plants, doe ſo much domeſticate and inable them, I need not tell you then, how by grafting, or remoouing only, the Mulbery trees and wild Vines may infinitely be bettered; To ſhew this, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one Plant for all. In the printed Booke of the valuations of the commodities of <hi>Virginia,</hi> Sarſaparillia wilde, is fiue pound the hundred, and Sarſaparillia domeſticke, is ten pound the hundred: ſo as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hauing no other but the wilde Sarſaparillia at firſt, yet by replanting and cultiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, that he made it domeſticke, and ſo much thereby innobled it in worth and goodneſſe, as raiſed it to a double price you ſee. And the like is to be done with other wild plants, by the often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing or grafting of them. As he then that was asked, what was the firſt, and chiefeſt thing in Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſaid, Pronunciation: and being demanded what was the ſecond thing in it, and afterwards, what was the third, ſtill anſwered, Pronunciation: ſo if I were asked what were the beſt Art, chiefly to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9600:45"/>
aduance the Plantation and Planters; I ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere as oft, or oftner, the Garden Art of planting, planting ſtill. I could wiſh therefore, that euery Free-holder, beſides his proper profeſſion, ſhould be inioyned to haue a Garden, and practiſe ſometimes Gardening and planting: And that according to the cuſtome and wiſe inſtitution of the Romane Cenſors, thoſe ſhould bee ſeuerely puniſhed, that did not husband well their fields and Gardens, and well culture their Vineyards, Trees, and Plants. Let euery one then in <hi>Virginia</hi> and the <hi>Summer Ilands,</hi> that mindes to haue plenty of healthfull food, and of good raiment, and of great wealth, let him begin to addict and delight himſelfe, in this moſt profitable and pleaſing Art of Gradening and grafting.</p>
               <p>Now whereas the labor of cleering the woodded grounds heere in <hi>Virginia,</hi> is ſuppoſed by ſome to be a hindrance to your profit; it is nothing ſo; for the many great commodities that to good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands may ariſe, by the wood ſtill cleered off the grounds, will with large intereſt, meane while, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay the coſt and labour, eſpecially after that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and rare inuention of Saw-Mills (an incredible aduancement to the Colonie) bee once put in practice. What ſhould I ſpeake of the ſtore of Timber, ſo neceſſary for your buildings, and other vſes? for Clapbord, Pipe-ſtaues, and other rich wood for noble ſeruices? or of the abundant ſtore of wood, neuer to be ſpent, for your Iron workes? and for your Glaſſe Furnaces now ſet vp? for Pot-aſhes, and Sope-aſhes? for boyling of Sugars? and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9600:46"/>
of Pitch and Tarre? and for all Furnace works? (the great deuourers of fewell and deſtroyers of woods) beſides, of the great vſe &amp; profit of propping your Vines, by whole Trees or by ſtalkes? &amp; for poles for the Hops which grow here wild? But aboue all, what endleſſe ſtore of excellent Timber haue you for the moſt excellent vſe of building Ships? And heerein I cannot, I confeſſe, conceale the pride I take in my <hi>Virginia.</hi> For what Countrey in the world againe, abounds ſo plentifully as this, with all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer for making Ships? no one thing is wanting; for beſides Timber of all ſorts, for all vſes in this kind, and ſtore of Maſts, no where taller and larger; you haue tried Iron alſo of perfect goodneſſe, and Silke graſſe, Flaxe, and Hempe, as well for Sayles and Cordage, as for richer vſes, and Forreſts of Trees for Pitch and Tarre, ſo as nothing for this purpoſe was lacking heere but onely Shipwrights, which now alſo with great wiſdome are lately ſent, to build you Boats and Pinnaces for Trade, and Buſſes, for the richeſt fiſhing here that all the world affords. Of Cod and Sturgeon, of great skulls of Herring, as big againe as thoſe in other places, and ſuch plenty alſo of other excellent fiſh vnknowne to theſe parts, that by credible report, <note n="⋆" place="margin">M. Purchas in his Pilgrimage.</note> there haue beene 5000. taken at a draught, the leaſt, of two foot in length, whereof likewiſe there might bee a great gaine made, by skilfull ſalting, pickling, or drying of them. Moreouer, beſides the increaſe of ſhipping and of Mariners, and the ſtore of ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that this fiſhing may yeeld vnto the Colony (for which purpoſe therefore, no houſholder that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9600:46"/>
is a good husband, will be without his Fiſherboats and nets for his owne prouiſions) there be yet other great aduantages and profits alſo that it brings with it, namely, the fiſhing vpon the coaſts of <hi>Virginia,</hi> being much more timely then in other places, your Marchants haue made their prime Markets, and are ready to returne, before others come that bring their fiſh from other places. To this, Salt being made now in <hi>Virginia,</hi> you ſhall with ſmall charge tranſport great multitudes of people hither: for ſince there may well bee many hundred Saile im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in fiſhing here, people will be brought moſt part for the Salt, that they lade heere for their fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which will coſt you but little. And by this meanes alſo, may a double profit be raiſed vnto the Planters, by bringing their people hither euery fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, and as occaſion ſerues, taking ſome of his men here with him to helpe him fiſh; which done, he ſends them backe againe vnto the Colony, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Commodities and other buſineſſes heere. But to goe on now, though this be granted by ſome, that the ſtore of wood in <hi>Virginia</hi> well vſed, is no impediment but a matter of ſingular benefit to the Plantation, yet others obiect ſome other hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the natiue Sauages. But as for the many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages that ariſe, rather by the iuſt warring with them, and vanquiſhing of them (a matter ſo eaſie to bee done) I referre you to the laſt declaration of the State and Colony of <hi>Virginia,</hi> where the reaſons are well and fully handled. As for my ſelfe I vtterly diſclaime them, they haue done againſt all my Lawes, they are moſt vnnaturall, and ſo none of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9600:47"/>
mine. And therefore they that know no induſtry, no Arts, no culture, nor no good vſe of this bleſſed Country heere, but are meere ignorance, ſloth, and brutiſhneſſe, and an vnprofitable burthen onely of the earth: Such as theſe (I ſay) like the <hi>Dai</hi> and <hi>Syri,</hi> and ſuch other people, are naturally borne ſlaues, as my chiefeſt <note place="margin">Ariſt. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Goe on then, and cheerfully proceed, eſpecially in thoſe my two fore-praiſed great Commodities, which if you doe, as you know not yet the twentieth part of them that this rich Country yeelds, ſo thoſe then alſo, I will ſhew heereafter to you.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all which, the moſt honourable and the chiefeſt is, that by the induſtry of ſome noble and heroicke ſpirits (borne to immortalize their names and nation) a paſſage to the South Sea, will, beyond our Falls and Mountaines, through the Continent of <hi>Virginia,</hi> aſſuredly bee found. All the Indians from <hi>Canada</hi> to <hi>Florida,</hi> relate, that there is beyond the Mountaines here, to the Weſt, and Northweſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a great Sea, and men and Ships, in ſhape and faſhion like to yours that Trade there: So as this can be no fiction nor no falſhood: theſe diuers nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

being ſo farre aſunder, all conſtantly agreeing in the ſame report. By this diſcouery and paſſage to the South Sea found, being from our Falls (by the Natiues relation hereabouts, and by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and computation of moſt learned Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians) about a fortnights iourney onely, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, part to be made by land, and part by water, by ſome riuers leading to that Sea: what an infinite rich trade may there bee made from hence then, to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> to <hi>Cathay,</hi> and other places in the South Sea? For this paſſage, as it wil be ſhort, ſafe, and eaſie, ſo will it not only ſaue the liues of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men now daily loſt, and ſpare much ſhipping of neceſſity waſted, by the great long voyages that now are taken, but will alſo bring great wealth and treaſure, trebling the gaine now got, by your quick returne that will be heereby made. Moreouer alſo, what a great rich Staple? what a mighty Magazine of Commodities for all Chriſtendome, will bee thereby erected in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and make the ſpeedy peopling, aduancing, ſtrengthening, and inriching of it, to the great and endleſſe honour of his Sacred Maieſty, in whoſe auſpicious Raigne, and by whoſe wiſedome, fauour, and gracious furtherance, this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Worke is brought to paſſe, to the vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit of his flouriſhing Kingdomes, and to the euerlaſting glory, and immortal name of them, by whom this happy diſcouery muſt bee perfected?

            <head>THE TREASVROVR COVNCELL AND COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PANY OF VIRGINIA, TO THE Gouernour and Councell of State in <hi>Virginia</hi> reſiding.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter our very hearty commendations: His Sacred Maieſty, out of his high wiſedome and care of the noble Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Virginia,</hi> hath been graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to direct his Letters to vs heere in <hi>England,</hi> thereby commanding vs to aduance the ſetting vp of <hi>Silke workes,</hi> and planting of <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards</hi>; as by the Copy herewith ſent, you may perceiue.</p>
            <p>The intimation of his Maieſties pleaſure, wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue to be a motiue ſufficient, to induce you to imploy all your indeuours to the ſetting forward thoſe two Staple Commodities of <hi>Silke,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>; which brought to their perfection, will infinitely redound to the honour, benefit and comfort of the Colony, and of this whole Kingdome: yet we, in diſcharge of our duties, doe againe renew our often and iterated Inſtructions, and inuite you cheerfully, to fall vpon theſe two ſo rich, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commodities. And if you ſhall finde any perſon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through negligence or wilfulneſſe, to omit the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:9600:49"/>
of <hi>Vines,</hi> and <hi>Mulbery trees,</hi> in orderly and husbandly manner, as by the Booke is preſcribed, or the prouiding of conuenient roomes for the breeding of <hi>Wormes;</hi> we deſire they may by ſeuere cenſures and puniſhment, be compelled thereunto. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that all fauour and poſsible aſsiſtance bee giuen to ſuch, as yeeld willing obedience to his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands therein. The breach or performance whereof, as we are bound to giue a ſtrict account, ſo will it alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of you the <hi>Gouernour</hi> and <hi>Councell</hi> eſpecially. Herein there can be no Plea, either of difficulty or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibility; but all the contrary appeares, by the naturall abundance of thoſe two excellent Plants afore-named e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where in <hi>Virginia:</hi> neither will ſuch excuſes be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, nor any other pretences ſerue, whereby the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be at all delayed: and as we formerly ſent at our great charge the French <hi>Vignerons</hi> to you, to teach you their Art; ſo for the ſame purpoſe we now commend this Booke vnto you, to ſerue as an Inſtructour to euery one, and ſend you ſtore of them to bee diſperſed ouer the whole Colony, to euery Maſter of a Family one. Silk-ſeed you ſhall receiue alſo by this Ship, ſufficient to ſtore euery man: ſo that there wants nothing, but induſtry in the Planter, ſuddenly to bring the making of <hi>Silke</hi> to its perfection: which either for their owne benefit (we hope) they will willingly indeuour, or by a wholeſome and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſeuerity they muſt be inforced.</p>
            <p>This particular aduice we thought neceſſary to giue you, leſt that if it ſhould haue come to you mingled with others, you would haue interpreted it as a common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or a buſineſſe that was not taken ſo to heart, as this is by vs, and we hope will be by you in humble obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb facs="tcp:9600:49"/>
to his Sacred Maieſties Royall Inſtructions. The paines and induſtry of the Authour, for the benefit of the Plantations (being a member of our Company) are ſufficient arguments of his good affection to the Action, and they both deſerue your beſt acceptance and ours, that others may thereby be inuited to impart their knowledge in buſineſſe of this and the like nature; whereby the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony may not onely bee ſupported for the preſent, but brought to that perfection, that may redound to the glory of God, the honour of his Maieſty, and the ineſtimable benefit of his noble Kingdomes; which as they are the true aime and end the Aduenturers and Planters haue propoſed vnto themſelues; ſo ought they to bee ſtill the honorable ſeeds to put others alſo forward in this action: we commend this buſineſſe againe to your ſpeciall care. And ſo we commit you all, and your waighty affaires, to the protection of the Almighty.</p>
