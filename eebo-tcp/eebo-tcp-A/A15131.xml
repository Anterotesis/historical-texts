            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ansvvered them and sayde: vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
verely I say vnto you, yee seeke
me, not bicause ye saw the miracles,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former part of
this chapter, the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist
declareth that the people
followed Christe into the
wildernesse, where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fed with fiue loues and
two fishes,<note place="margin">Iohn</note> did not only acknowledge him
to be that Prophete that should come into
the world, but also would haue taken him
and made him a King. He sheweth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that the nexte day the people by ship
passed ouer to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where they fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:28252:3"/>
Iesus, and maruelling at his strange
kinde of comming thither (for they knewe
that he came not in the same ship with his
Disciples, and that there was no other
shippe there for him to passe in) demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of him when he came thither, saying:
<hi>Master, when camest thou hither?</hi> to whom
Iesus answering sayde, <hi>verelye verely I
say vnto you, yee seeke me, not bycause you
sawe the myracles, but bicause yee eate of the
loaues and were filled. &amp;c.</hi> In which wordes
two things are generally to be considered:
the one is, the question of the people: the
other, the answer of Chryst. In the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the people, there are thrée things especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to be noted: theyr inconstancie: their
flatterie: &amp; their curiositie. In the answere
of Chryst, there is a reprehension, and an
exhortation: the reprehension is this:
<hi>Verelye verelye I say vnto you, yee seeke me,
not bycause yee sawe the myracles. &amp;c.</hi> the
exhortation is this: <hi>Laboure not for the
meate which perisheth. &amp;c.</hi> of these poyntes
I will speake (by the grace of GOD) as
bréefly as I can.</p>
            <p>The first thing therefore that I note in
<pb facs="tcp:28252:3"/>
this question of the people, is their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,
the whiche that aunciente and
learned Father Chrysostome gathereth
of this,<note place="margin">Chryso 6. Ioan</note> that when as the day before, after
they had béene filled with bread and meat,
they esteemed Chryste as a Prophete, and
woulde haue taken him and made him a
Kyng: now hauing him in theyr presence,
they neyther so greatly magnifye him,
neyther offer vnto him anye kingdome
at all, but rather beginne to doubte of hys
omnipotencie and power, as thoughe
they had vtterly forgotten hys former
myracles.</p>
            <p>Auncient and learned interpreters doe
ascribe this inconstancie of the people to
two chiefe and principall causes: The
one is, bycause the people (for the moste
part) respecte onely those things that are
present, and are moste commonly allured
wyth presente commoditie or pleasure.
An other is, bycause the people are oftener
moued wyth affection than reason, and
ledde wyth fansie rather, and opinion,
than with sounde proofes and certayne
knowledge: and such motions as spring of
<pb facs="tcp:28252:4"/>
present commoditie, and are grounded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon opinion, be but momentane and
sone passe away. Therefore sayth the wise
man in the .27.<note place="margin">c. 27.</note> of Eccle. <hi>Homo sapiens in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia
sua permanet sicut Sol, stultus autem v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
luna mutatur. <hi>A wise man continueth in his
wisedome constant as the Sunne: but a foole
is altered and chaunged euen as the Moone.</hi>
               </hi>
By a wise man he meaneth suche as are
guyded with reason and knowledge: by a
foole he vnderstandeth, not those that lacke
the vse of reason, and be voyde of wit, but
those that folow affection rather than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and are caried away with opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and
fansie, not with sure proofes and certaine
knowledge: the whiche thing bicause the
people (for the most part) do, therfore are
they called the <hi>vnlearned and vnstable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi>
And these be the causes why they
are so greatly delighted with noueltie, so
readie to embrace euery strange and new
kynd of doctrine: these (I say) be the causes
why one and the selfe same thing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
can not long please them: but whom
to day by praising they extoll vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
to morowe by dispraysing they caste
<pb facs="tcp:28252:4"/>
downe into hell.</p>
            <p>Of this so great inconstancie, we haue
a notable example, and a manyfest patern
in this people that we haue now in hand:
For the selfesame people that followed
Chryst into the wildernesse, &amp; from thence
ouer the sea into <hi>Capernaum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn.</note> as it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in this Chapter, shortly after (as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in the same Chapter) vtterly forsooke
him, saying. <hi>Durus est bic sermo: quis potest
eum audire? <hi>This is a hard saying: who can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
to heare it?</hi>
               </hi> only bicause he taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not suche things as pleased their fansie,
and serued their fonde affection. And the
same people which immediatly after their
eating with him did acknowledge him to
be a Prophet, and had a reuerent opinion
of him: shortly after (as it is also to be seen
in this Chapter) spake contemptuously of
him, saying: <hi>Is not this Iesus the sonne of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,
whose father and mother wee knowe?</hi>
as though they shuld say, is not this Iesus
the Carpenters sonne? what do we make
so great account of him? Againe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that spake here so louingly vnto him,
and salute him by an honorable title, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:28252:5"/>
him <hi>Rabbi:</hi> in the .8.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 8.</note> Chap. of his gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
speake most slaunderously and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briously
of him, calling him Samaritane,
and saying that he had a Deuill. And who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they in this sixt Chapter, woulde haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and made a Kyng if he had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
himselfe from them: in that eyght
Chapter they would haue stoned to death,
if he had not withdrawne himselfe out of
their company. To be short, the same peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that in his iorney from the Mount to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
Hierusalem so ioyfully receiued
him, with spreading their garmentes and
boughes of trées in the ways, and saluting
him with a moste honorable salutation,
crying <hi>Hosanna to the Sonne of Dauid. &amp;c.</hi>
not long after,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h. 21.</note> preferred a murtherer and a
seditious person before him, &amp; with might
and mayn cryed out, that he might be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.
And this is the inconstancie euen of
that same people, among whome Christe
himselfe was conuersant: whome he so
diligently taught, and in whose presence
he had wrought so many and notable
myracles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28252:5"/>
Of the like inconstancie the Apostle
S. Paule had experience: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
who were so greatly affected towardes
him when he first preached the Gospell
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst them,<note place="margin">Gal. 4</note> that if <hi>it had bin possible</hi> (as
he himselfe doth testifie) <hi>they woulde haue
plucked out their eyes and giuen them vnto
him,</hi> within a whyle after (being seduced
by false prophets &amp; contentious teachers)
contemned and despised him. Hereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
it came to passe, that the Corinthians
were deuided into so many factions, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
some sayd,<note place="margin">1. Cor.</note> 
               <hi>they helde of Paule, some of
Apollo, some of Cephas, and some of Christ.</hi>
The like inconstancie appeareth to haue
bin in the people at all times, and in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Let the ecclesiastical histories be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used,
and it wyll easely be proued, that
there was neuer Heretike so horrible, nor
Schismatike so pernicious, but that they
had numbers of the people to follow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
euen of the selfesame people that before
embraced the true and sincere doctrine o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the Gospell. Therfore the Apostle Sainct
Paule doth forewarne his scholer Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
hereof, and as it were, arme him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:28252:6"/>
this temptation, saying: <hi>Erit tempus
cum sanam doctrinam non sustinebunt.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 4.</note> &amp;c. <hi>The
tyme shall come when they wyll not abide
wholesome doctrine, but they whose eares
doth itche</hi>
               </hi> (that is, whiche are delighted
with nouelties and newe inuented opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
<hi>shall heape vp to themselues teachers
according to their owne desires,</hi> euen suche
as will satisfie their fansies, and applie
themselues to their humor.</p>
            <p>My meaning is not to condemne al the
people of this crime, I know there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
both constant and godly: but I speake
of the most part, and I declare that, which
most commonly commeth to passe. It is
reported of one <hi>Polycletus</hi> a cunning I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
maker, that he framed two Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the one according to arte, the other
according to the opinion of the people:
and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had finished them, he brought
them foorth to bee séene of the passers by,
that he might heare their iudgements of
them: it came to passe (contrarie to hys
expectation) that the Image made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to arte, was praysed euen of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the other dispraysed. Whereat

The seconde thyng that I note in
thys people, is their adulation and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
the whiche the most and best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
do hereof gather, that the
people by asking Christe this question,
doe insinuate, that they maruayle at this
straunge manner of comming thither:
the whiche they doe to this ende, that
they might seme to be commenders and
praysers of hys vertues and miracles,
and maruelters at hys doings, and yet
their ende was nothing lesse. In thys
manner dyd the Disciples of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies
assault him, when they came vnto
him with the Herodians to demaunde
whether it were lawfull to giue tribute
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> or no: they called him <hi>Master,</hi>
they sayd that he was <hi>true,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math</note> 
               <hi>and taught the
way of God truely, and had no respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:</hi>
in words they pretended that whych
they thought not in hart, and that is the
nature and propertie of all flatterers.
For it is truly sayd that <hi>Adulator omnis est
virtutis inimicus, &amp; quasielauum figit in oculo
eius cum quo sermones confert. &amp;c. <hi>A flatterer
is an enimie to vertue, and dothe as it were

and stoppeth his eares with waxe, least
he shoulde eyther see, or heare the truth.</hi>
               </hi> It
is most certaine that flatterie hathe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
these companions wayting on it:
Subtiltie and deceit: the blinding of him
that is flattered: a note of seruitude: and
the banishment of all honestie. S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
sayth that <hi>Adulator est crudelis &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax:
<hi>a flatterer is cruell and deceitful:</hi>

            <p>The thirde vice that I note in thys

appeareth in that they propounde so
vayne and friuolous a question vnto

it but vnprofitable and childishe: neither

and vnprofitable a question of him,<note place="margin">Clrill in Ioan.</note> whose
diuine power and vertue they had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of: and what profite could come vnto
them by asking this question? Therefore wise
men are to be asked wise questions, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is better than vnskilfull talke. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

contrary to al those places of scripture that

called into controuersie, <hi>VVhether the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Papists and excommunicated persons
(notwithstanding their parents be Christians,
and cannot <hi>amittere baptismum,</hi> lose their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi>
as it is determined by S. Augustine
against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Donatists) ought to be baptised.
And <hi>whether the minister be of the essence &amp;
being of baptisme, &amp; none to be counted mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
but such as be preachers, so that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hath not bin baptised of a minister, of a pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cher,

such like, spring out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scholes of the
<pb facs="tcp:28252:13"/>
Anabaptises, and tend to the rebaptizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all, or the most parte of those that at
this day are liuing. With these and such
like questions, partly impious, partly
vaine and friuolous, is the Churche of
Christe at this day maruellously trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:
and men so occupie themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, that they neglect those thinges
that perteine to their saluation, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
due obedience. Yea, it is come to suche
extremitie, that if any doe withstande
them in these questions (as they must be
withstanded, for the wise man sayth, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

least he seeme to himselfe wise:</hi> and <hi>Basill</hi>

a Papist: neither shal any thing be
omitted, that may sound to his reproche.
But on the other side, if any man consent
vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in such opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, though he be an
vsurer, an whoremo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, an extorcioner, a

zelous, &amp; godly. I haue therfore to exhort
all that be godly in deede, to take héede
<pb facs="tcp:28252:13"/>
of thys curiositie, knowing that it hath
alwayes bene counted of all learned men
a manyfest note and token of a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
nature, to make such stirres, and to
moue suche controuersie about externall
things, in that Church where the gospel is
truly preached, and the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts rightly
administred. And thus much of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first part
of this text, that is, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people.</p>
            <p>The seconde parte is the answere of
Christ, wherein (as I sayd) is contained a
reprehension, and an exhortation. In the
reprehension there are two things to be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, the maner, and the matter. The
manner of reprehending is noted of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
in these words:<note place="margin">Chrysos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </note> 
               <hi>Modestiùs coargu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it.
&amp;c. <hi>He doth modestly reprehend them, for
he doth not cal them bellie Gods, or epicures,
he doth not vpbrayde them with so many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
which they neither followed nor mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled
at: but only he sayth,</hi> Amen Amen dico
vobis, <hi>verely verely I say vnto you. &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> This
modest kynde of reprehending the Apostle
teacheth his scholer Timothie, when he
sayth, <hi>Argue, increpa, exhortare cum omni leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>improue, rebuke, exhort with
<pb facs="tcp:28252:14"/>
al lenitie and doctrine.</hi>
               </hi> And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy
the .5.<note place="margin">Tim. 5.</note> chap. teaching him how to vse
himselfe in reprouing all sortes of men, he
saith, <hi>Seniore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ne asperèd obiurges, <hi>do not bitterly
rebuke an elder. &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> and yet there is a time &amp;
place, where and when the preacher of the
word of God may vse sharp and seuere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sions:
but this is no place to speak of
this thing: we haue rather now to consider
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter, than the maner, the matter that
is reproued, than the maner of reprouing.</p>
            <p>First therefore he doth couertly reproue
their flatterie (whereof I spake before) as
it is noted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best learned interpreters,
for he answereth not directly to their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:
they asked him when he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and he answered them, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sought his meat than himself: so that
he reprehendeth their adulation and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
kind of questioning with him, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
he declared that he nothing at all estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the commendation of the people, or
regarded their opinion of him: A worthy &amp;
necessarie lesson for al men to learne, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
such as be in authoritie (to wit) y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
they open not their ears to flatterers, nor
<pb facs="tcp:28252:14"/>
hunt after popular fame &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation.
Well saith Ambrose: <hi>Prospiciendum est ne
adulantibus aperiamus aurem,<note place="margin">Amb. De. offic. lib. 1</note> emolliri enim adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,
non solùm fortitudinis non est, sed etiam ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauiae
esse videtur: <hi>VVe must take heede that
we giue no eare to flatterers, for to be moued
with flatterie is not only no pointe of valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but an euident signe of a cowardly and
dastardly minde.</hi>
               </hi> Chrysostome speaking of
this sinister affection, saith that it is an <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
drunkennesse, and that whomsoeuer
it hathe subdued, it maketh him almost incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
In the same place he compareth it to
certaine Images, which are gorgeous and
beautifull without, but emptie and vayne
within, and therfore he saith that such flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
commendation may aptly be called
vayne glory, <hi>quia nihil in se habet aut clarum
aut gloriosum: <hi>bicause it hath in it no substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
nor pith.</hi>
               </hi> In the same placè he earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
both ecclesiastical and secular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from this vice: ecclesiatical persons,
bicause it driueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the truth, &amp; cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into errour, it ingendreth in them
pryde and arrogancie, the roote and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all sectes, schismes, contentions,
<pb facs="tcp:28252:15"/>
and heresies. For while the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
their life and doctrine: whilest
they call hypocrisie, holynesse: arrogancie,
simplicitie: wrath, zeale: disobedience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
schisme, vnitie: wordes, matter:
ignorance, learning: darkenesse, lyght:
it so puffeth vp the myndes of their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
with an opinion of themselues, that
they dare be bolde to propound any thing,
so that it tast of noueltie, &amp; please the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
though it tende to the disturbance of
the Church, the contempt of Magistrates,
and the breache of good lawes and orders.
Therefore by the olde Canons it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créed
that those Clearks, which either flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
themselues, or gaue eare vnto flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
should be deposed without hope of
restitution.</p>
            <p>And as it worketh this effect in men of
the clergie in matters Ecclesiasticall, so
doth it worke the like effecte in ciuill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in matters ciuill. For it breedeth in
them Ambition, the roote of rebellion and
treason. It moueth them, not to be content
with their state and calling, but to aspire
to greter dignitie, and to take those things
<pb facs="tcp:28252:15"/>
in hande which commonly turne to theyr
ruine and destruction. And in whome hath
not popularitie wrought these effectes? or
who euer fell into these inconueniences,
but such as first were prouoked ther vnto
by the flattering of the people? But my
meaning was not to speake much of this
matter: this only I thought good to note,
and to admonishe all (but especially those
that be in authoritie) by the example of
Christe, not to giue eare to flatterers, nor
to be delighted with the commendation of
the multitude.</p>
            <p>An other thing that he reroueth in the
people (which is in déed the chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal)
is, that they sought him not with that
mynde, nor to that end, that they ought to
haue done: and therefore he sayth, <hi>verely
verely I say vnto you, ye séeke me, not bicause
you haue seene the miracles, but bicause you
haue eaten of the breade and are filled:</hi> as
though he shoulde say, ye séeke me not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
ye seeke me not to learn of me those
things that pertaine to eternall life: but
you seeke me to haue your bellies filled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
an euident argument hereof is this, that
<pb facs="tcp:28252:16"/>
you are more moued with yesterdayes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie,
with yesterdayes bread and meat,
than with all the miracles that I haue
wrought among you, and all the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that I haue made vnto you: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you séeke not me but your selues. In
the person of this people, Christ reproueth
all those that séeke him not aright, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> séeke
him not with a sincere affection, but for
some worldly respect and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie. Such
was Simon Magus, who ioyned himselfe
to the Apostles, was baptized and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
great zeale, onely that he might gaine
something therby, as it is euident in the .8<note place="margin">ct. 8.</note>
of the Actes. Suche was Demas also, of
whom the Apostle speaketh .2, Tim. 4.<note place="margin">Tim. 4.</note> 
               <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
hath forsaken me, imbracing this present
world.</hi> Such are they whose religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in words, not in workes: in conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not in peace: in contempt, not in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
who vnder the pretence of zeale,
séeke their own libertie: vnder the colour
of religion, séeke confusion: and with the
shadowe of reformation, cloake and couer
their vsurie, their ambition, theyr myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
desirous to spoyle the Churche. All
<pb facs="tcp:28252:16"/>
which Chryst in the .xiij. of Mathew,<note place="margin">Math. 1.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
to the stonie grounde, wherein the
séede being sowne prospereth for a time, so
long as there is any moisture, but when
the Sun waxeth hote, and the moysture is
dryed vp, then doth the séede wither away,
and becommeth vnprofitable: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so they
(while there is any moisture left, that is,
as long as they can hope for any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
to come vnto them by the professing

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moisture is dried vp, so that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suck

Suche there haue bene in this Church of
England euen within our memorie, who
whilest there was some commoditie to be
looked for by the dissolution of Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and such like places, were bitter eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Pope, and pretended to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
professors of the Gospel: but the same
men afterward (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this hope was past,
and the time nowe come when they must
suffer for the Gospell, and leaue that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
before they had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) did not only not
professe it,, but persecuted those that were
professors. And may there not be suche
(thinke you) at this time, who woulde not
séeme only to fauour the Gospell, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
earnestly to séeke reformation, onely
bicause they sée the newe platforme tende
to the spoyle of Colledges, Churches, By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprickes.
&amp;c. whereby they suppose that
they might procure vnto themselues no

that if they were once frustrate of this
<pb facs="tcp:28252:17"/>
hope, the waywarde and contentious zeale
of many would soon decrease. And how shuld

Euen so may we say to suche like kinde of
men: O ye couetous persons, and desirous
of the spoyle, we haue taught you more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
pointes of doctrine, than these that
are now preached vnto you: we haue exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you to repentance, and to amendment
of life: we haue taught you the true doctrin
of iustification, the true and right vse of the
sacraments: we haue confuted the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and damnable pointes of Papisticall
doctrine, as transubstantiation, the sacrifice
of the Masse, Purgatorie, worshipping of

Images, praying to Saincts, the Popes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie,
and such like: and you haue not
beleued vs, nor harkned vnto vs. But now
that we begin to teach you these things that
tende to your own commoditie, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion,
you magnifie vs, you commend vs,
you make vs Gods, nay, you make vs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
for you so puffe vs vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vaine glorie,
that we know not our selues. <hi>O gulae incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem

O couetousnesse: <hi>non quaeritis Iesum propter

seeke him for the fleshe and not for the spirite:</hi>
non quaeritis iustitiam propter iustitiam, sed prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               </hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
séeke Christ, not for any temporal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
but for himself: least it be as truly
said of vs as it was of the Iewes, <hi>yee seeke
me, not bicause ye haue seene the miracles, but
bicause ye haue eaten of the bread and are filled</hi>
And thus much concerning the reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Christ héere vseth.</p>
            <p>Now foloweth his exhortation: <hi>Labor not
for the meat that perisheth, but that remaineth
to eternall life.</hi> By the <hi>meat that perisheth,</hi> our

<pb facs="tcp:28252:19"/>

all those things that be spirituall, &amp;
wherwith the soule is nourished to eternall
life. He doth not here forbid men to labour
for these things that pertaine to this life te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral,
but he admonisheth them to preferre
those things that belong to the life eternall.
It is a negatiue by comparison, which doth

to labour for external things: and in the

Christ in this place is nothing else but this,
that we prefer heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things before earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, according to that which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Math. 6. <hi>Firste seeke the kingdome of heauen
and the rightuousnesse therof,<note place="margin">Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Many reasons may be alledged, why we
should prefer heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things before world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things. First worldy things are but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie,
they haue no continuance, <hi>Magna
momento ruunt, <hi>though they be neuer so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb facs="tcp:28252:20"/>
yet are they soone decayed:</hi>
               </hi> to daye, as a
beawtiful floure, to morrow, as the withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
grasse: now, as the burning fire, and by
and by, as the dead and quenched ashes. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptas
&amp; bonor finem habebunt:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ost.</note> 
                  <hi>pleasure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
haue their end: but heauenly thinges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
and continue for euer.</hi>
               </hi> Therefore saith
Sainct Paule, Gal. 6. <hi>Qui seminat in carnem,
de carne metet corruptionem. &amp;c. <hi>he that soweth in
the flesh, shall reape corruption of the flesh: but
he that soweth in the spirit, shall reape eternall
life of the spirit.</hi>
               </hi> That is, those that laboure
for such things as perteine to the flesh, shall
reape only that which is mortall and tari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not: but those that labor for things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
to the spirit, reape that, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
for euer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, worldly things how pleasant
soeuer they are and delectable, yet in the end
they ware lothsome: <hi>Omnia mundana quantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis
dulcia, amarescant: <hi>All worldly things howe
pleasant soeuer they be, in the end waxe bitter.</hi>
               </hi>
Yea the perfectest pleasure that can be in
worldly thinges, is mixed with sorow. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with labour, kept with care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
&amp; lost with griefe. Therefore saith
S. Augustine. <hi>Si vana seculi huius inexperta co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupisti,<note place="margin">epist.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:28252:20"/>
&amp; infructuosus labor, &amp; perpetuus timor,
&amp; periculosa sublimitas: initium sine prudentia, &amp;
finiscu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paenitentia. Ita se habent omnia quae in ista
mortalitatis aerumna cupidius quam prudentius ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuntur:
<hi>If thou hast desired the vaine things of
this world before thou hadst experience of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
nowe hauing experience, contemne them: for
there is in them deceitfull pleasure, vnprofitable
labour, perpetuall feare, daungerous dignitie, or
promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the beginning is without wisedome,
and the end with repentance. This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of all these thinges that in this miserable
mortalitie are more greedily, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wisely desired.</hi>
               </hi>
But heauenly things are void of all suche
gréefe and sorow.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>what will it profite a man to win
the whole world,<note place="margin">Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </note> and to lose his owne soule?</hi> or what shall he gaine, if he féeede and pamper
his body with delicates, and suffer his soule
to perish for hunger?</p>
            <p>To conclude, we are but straungers in
this world, and therfore we must so behaue
our selues as those that are in a straunge
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, who though they prouide for things
necessary for a time, yet their desire &amp; inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
is to retourne home to their owne naturall
countrie againe: euen so we, though we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
those things that are néedefull for thys
<pb facs="tcp:28252:21"/>
presente life, yet must we not so fixe oure
minds vpon them, that we be withdrawen
from that earnest desire that we haue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to our own countrie. These &amp; a great
number reasons moe may be giuen, why
we shoulde prefer heauenly thinges before
earthly things. But how few are there that
consider them? It is reported of <hi>Pambo,</hi> that
when he sawe a woman decking hir selfe
with costly aray, he wept bitterly: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demaunded the cause of his wéeping, he
said that one cause was, for that he himselfe
was not so desirous to please Christ his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior,
as this woman was to please mortall
men: nor he so careful for eternal things, as
she was for earthly and corruptible things.
But what would he say if he liued in these
dayes, when not one or two women, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all mankind do only labour for thys,
that they may please men, and prouide for
those things that perteine to the bellie? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
therfore is this exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ
<hi>laboure not for the meate that perisheth, but
that remaineth to eternall life, the whiche the
sonne of man will giue vnto you:</hi> to whome
with the father &amp; the holy Ghost, three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and one God, be all honor and glorie,
now and for euer. Amen.</p>
