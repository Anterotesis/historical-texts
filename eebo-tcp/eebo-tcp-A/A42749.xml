         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

when I mention your <hi>Uirtues,</hi> I take <hi>Virtue</hi> in its
genuine, and primitive Sense, in the Sense the
<hi>Old Romans</hi> took it in, before 'twas erroneously
translated to signifie <hi>Grimace, Affectation, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,</hi>
and <hi>Ill-nature;</hi> I take it for <hi>Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,

                  </gap>ability,</hi> and all
the other Noble Qualifications that go to the
making up of the compleat Character of a
<hi>Gentleman;</hi> and there is none of these but
has receiv'd the Denomination of <hi>Virtue</hi> from
the best of the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors; nor is there
any Man that has the Honour to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with you Sir, but knows there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
said of the just Accomplishments of a
Gentleman, but what is your due.</p>
            <p>Were I therefore as sure of not offending
your Modesty, by a Praise which e'ry body
but your self thinks you deserve, as I am se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from the Censure of the World in it,
<hi>Desire</hi> would supply my want of Ability, and
make me attempt that which I know upon
<pb facs="tcp:47413:3"/>
cooler thoughts I am not able to perform so
as to make the Copy come near the Original;
for Praise is nothing but a solemn Repetition of
those Excellencies any one is really endow'd with,
and as long as we attribute nothing else,
we can't fall into the Vice of Flattery, which
is but a Transgression of the Bounds of Truth,
and giving a Man more than his due.</p>
            <p>Praise being therefore nothing else, I can see
no reason (excepting the false Opinion a blind
Custom has impos'd upon us) why any Man
should be displeas'd to see a public Relation of
those <hi>Virtues</hi> he justly thinks the Glory of both
his private, and public Actions.</p>
            <p>I must confess, I esteem it one of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Tribe of vulgar Errors of the Age, to
think a Man ought not to take pleasure in,
and value himself on his confess'd <hi>Parts,</hi> and
<hi>Virtues.</hi> For 'tis certain that things are <hi>Good,</hi> or
<hi>Evil</hi> only in reference to <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi>
by which the Mind judges of whatsoever it
chooses or avoids. And no Man can make choice
of any particular Virtues without being pleas'd
with them above the rest. And by appla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ding
that <hi>Choice</hi> as good, by his <hi>Practice;</hi> he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the Value he sets upon, his own <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
without which he could not to have made
that <hi>Choice,</hi> which is a tacit or implicit Esteem
of himself, at least of the best part of him,
his <hi>Mind,</hi> and its <hi>most weighty Operations.</hi> To
seem therefore to the World not to value himself,
is only a Dissimulation, the Tyranny of a mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dern
Custom imposes on him. Modern Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
I say, for <hi>Pliny, Cicero, Ovid, Horace,</hi> &amp;c.

of old, proclaim'd their Opinion of their own
worth without a blush, or incurring the least
disesteem of the Age they liv'd in; it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unaccountable to them that a Man should
be either afraid, or asham'd to assert himself
Master of those <hi>Virtues,</hi> without which he would
be a shame to his Generation, and no better than
one of the meanest of the Vulgar. Modest <hi>Uirgil</hi>
himself seems to express his Sensibility of what
he could perform, as well as the praise of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loninus,</hi>
and <hi>Pollio</hi> in his fourth Ecclogue,

               <hi>Uirtue</hi> then, with a Noble assurance shew'd
its Face wherever it was, and <hi>Uice</hi> crept into

<hi>Virtue</hi> shall lie behind the mistaken Veil of
<hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>Modesty,</hi> whilst <hi>Vice</hi> struts about
with its bare-face, and naked Deformity, and yet
like the Sister of <hi>Calibun</hi> is caress'd by the
<hi>Trincalo</hi>'s, and <hi>Stephano</hi>'s of the Age.</p>
            <p>But I must have a care of touching upon the

it should lead me into such a Scene of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
that I should forget the glorious Subject
<pb facs="tcp:47413:4"/>
of your Vertues, and imagin, spight of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to the contrary, that there were not any
True <hi>Honour,</hi> or <hi>Courage</hi> yet in being. And
for this reason methinks I ought to offer a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to your Modesty, (if what I have said be
insufficient to satisfie it) that late Posterity, when
it reads the fatal Chain, and perpetual Series of
<hi>Villanies</hi> we have seen transacted (if there be
found any more of so much Honour, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
to convey 'em impartially to it) may
know, that we have not been without some
brave Men, who have preserv'd their Honour
un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ully'd, as the Springs in the <hi>Chalcedonian</hi>
Seas do their freshness in the midst of those
<hi>brackish Vasts of Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must at least, Sir, be particular in this;
That though all the little double dealing Tricks
of <hi>Cornuted Mechanics</hi> spread their Contagion
among those that pretend very much to the
<hi>Name</hi> of Gentlemen, you retain that noble
Candour, that Freedom, and Openess, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity,
in your Actions, that first dignified
some men with that Title above the rest; that
tho' you know <hi>men,</hi> yet that, even that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
is not of force enough to pervert your
stedfast Principles of <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Generosity,</hi> you
directing your self not by their Villanies, but by
the Dictates of those Vertues you have propos'd
as the Model of all your Life; That <hi>Honour</hi> is
still the same with you, and varies not its Form,
or Essence, as with other men, according as
their Interest, or Passions perswade; no, you'll
<pb facs="tcp:47413:5"/>
perish with him that has even oppos'd your
Safety, if vicissitudes of things, and concurring
Circumstances engage your <hi>Honour</hi> in it. <hi>Few
such Examples, I can say, has any Age produc'd,
much less Ours.</hi> I'll only add, That tho' like
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> (who had a good Master in Nature,
and Philosophy) you have a true Relish of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
and offer at her Shrine, being justly of
opinion, that <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> are not at such
mortal odds, as some bigotted men would fain
perswade us in Words, not Practice, yet you
are not so devoted to it, as at all to neglect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the more serious, and weighty Affairs of
Life, or the Summons of <hi>Honour,</hi> whenever
that calls. What I have here said, is no more,
than what all know of you; and therefore I
need not apprehend any Censure for it. But
should I touch upon all your other Excellencies,
I fear I should be thought a Flatterer, tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deserving it in the least. Besides, you have
Virtues 'tis not safe in this profligate Age to
name.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Book,</hi> Sir, I secure under the shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of your Patronage; I shall only say, 'twill
discover the difference betwixt <hi>these Letters,</hi>
prompted by the several <hi>immediate Occurrences,</hi>
that occasion'd the writing of them, and those
which some <hi>Epistle-Writers</hi> have publish'd for
Examples for the World to Copy after: <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and <hi>Easiness</hi> appear in the first; and <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
and <hi>awkward Pains</hi> in the latter. 'Tis not
to be expected there should be the same Wit,
<pb facs="tcp:47413:5"/>
and Language in e'ery Letter, since the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and Writers are different: And they are
generally more remarkable for their Import,
than Words, and Phrase: But this, I hope, I
may say for the Comments, that you'l seldom
find an Observation wholly impertinent, or any
of them without something <hi>Moral, if not Witty.</hi>
'Tis true, they can't be suppos'd so fine, either
in their moral, or witty part, as the Reflections
of Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> in his incomparable <hi>Aesop,</hi> those
being the effect of mature, and deliberate Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but these the Result of <hi>extempore Thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis possible a very critical Reader may find
some seeming Contradictions betwixt our <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations</hi>
on one Letter, and those of another;
but he ought to consider, that things, as they
are differently plac'd, and dress'd, present us
with different <hi>Idea</hi>'s, as one Example may
evince. <hi>Vandike</hi> (if I mistake not) or some
other eminent Painter, had a Daughter, whose
Mouth render'd her whole Face extream home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but drawing her Picture, he so plac'd her
Hand, that it cover'd her Mouth, by which she
made a very beautiful Figure. Thus in one
Posture the same Woman was beautiful, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
really ugly: And so 'tis with <hi>Virtue, Vice,</hi>
and all other things, their several Positions,
Dresses, and Forms give 'em a several turn, and
so present us with several Reflections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47413:6"/>As for the <hi>Second Book</hi> of this Volume, I shall
only observe, that as the Letters are most of
them, if not all, written by <hi>Foreigners,</hi> so we
are not answerable for them, nor for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on them neither, since the performance
only of a part of our Company, and they pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>well enter'd in good Liquor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall say no more of the <hi>Book,</hi> but let it take
its Chance with the rest of the World, if it meet
but with a favourable Reception from you, Sir,
to whom I dedicate not only that, but my Self

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving for the Benefit and Pleasure of the Publick, thought
fit to publish these following <hi>Letters,</hi> which I had from
the Hands of one of the Gentlemen concern'd in the <hi>Frolick,</hi>
I thought proper to advertise these few things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>Post</hi> has too often here in <hi>England</hi> (as is
evident from the <hi>Gazette</hi>) been robb'd, and 'tis to be wish'd
with no worse design than these Gentlemen did it. There
have Accidents of this nature happ'ned in other Countries;
as in <hi>Italy,</hi> as the Letters of <hi>Palavicino</hi> demonstrate;
so that there can be no doubt of the Truth of the Matter
of Fact, or at least of a <hi>Probability</hi> of that Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> It may be wonder'd that in all these <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be robb'd, there should in such a <hi>time of Action</hi> be no
Letters of <hi>News,</hi> or any account of the late <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>agues.</hi>
But I desire these Gentlemen to have patience till they see
the <hi>Second Uolume</hi> (which if this find that Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Ingenious as is expected, shall be published
with all convenient speed) by which they'll find 'twas out of
<hi>choice,</hi> not necessity that they have none in <hi>this Volume;</hi>
But in the following Volumes, the Company resolve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
nothing they discover'd in any of the <hi>Pacquets</hi> that
may afford either <hi>Pleasure, Profit, or Instruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If any Lady or Gentleman have any Letters sent
them either from their <hi>Lovers or ingenious Friends,</hi> a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of which with the <hi>Observations</hi> of this Company will
either satisfie them or gratifie the Town if they please to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
'em to my <hi>Shop, at the Raven in the Poultrey,</hi> I'll take
care to convey them to this <hi>Club,</hi> and engage them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with his or her desires. And I believe there are very
few Men or Ladies who in there Lives have not met with some
<hi>Intreagues or Occurrences</hi> which may contribute to the Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of others as well as themselves, whatever Letters are
sent as above directed, the Company will be very impartial
in there Judgments upon them, and those Letters that are
sent in according to this <hi>Advertisement</hi> shall be markt with
an <hi>Ast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rism,</hi> to distinguish 'em from those taken from the
<hi>Post.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the next Volume will be an Explanation of
the <hi>Letter</hi> in <hi>Figures</hi> that is in this, one of the Company
having found a <hi>Key</hi> for it, but too late to have it inserted,
<pb facs="tcp:47413:7"/>
the whole being printed off. In the said Volume will also
be added some Letters of a very <hi>surprizing nature,</hi> and many
that discover abundance of secret Intrigues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When you find any ini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ial Letters of Names, be
not too forward of saying <hi>such a one is meant;</hi> for, does not
the same Letter stand for many other Names<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as that
you suspect? Nay, where you see an initial Letter, and the
<hi>Sir-name</hi> at length, you cannot positively conclude it to
be the person you suppose 'twas directed to; for, may there
not be hundreds both of the same Christian and Sir-name, in
<hi>England,</hi> that may sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w your mistake? But if any one by
<hi>winching shews that he is pinch'd,</hi> he must thank himself, and
not this Club, who thought it lay in their power to give more
particular <hi>Characters of persons,</hi> yet were as <hi>tender</hi> as could
consist with their Design.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If any object these Letters were not really sent
to the persons to whom <hi>directed,</hi> because there is so few
<hi>Letters of Business</hi> amongst 'em, 'tis answer'd, those were not
thought so <hi>diverting</hi> as others, and therefore this Club took
Copies chiefly of those that they thought were proper to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the Age; but if it were either safe or convenient,
they could send such <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eubters</hi> to many of the persons that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
these <hi>Letters</hi> by the Post since they copied them, for all
the Letters which they found, which had an <hi>honest end in the
speed,</hi> they took care to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d as directe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> As it must not be imputed to the Company, as
a Fault, that there are several <hi>Letters</hi> that may seem to the
more solid Readers a little too gay and airy, because 'twas
their business to expose <hi>Matters</hi> as they found them, and not
to model 'em according to their own Rules; so I, for the
same reason, ought to undergo no Censure for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> printing
them as they came to my H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ads, both regarding the <hi>Truth of
Matter of Fact,</hi> and the exposing the (secret) <hi>Villanies</hi> of
Mankind as they were, than to change them to what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
they should be: And upon this <hi>Condition only</hi> was the
Copy deliver'd to me, <hi>that</hi> I should leave out none of those
<hi>Letters that the Company thought fit to publish.</hi> This (Reader)
is enough to satisfie ev'ry Unprejudic'd person; and as for
others, he neither values nor fears their Censures; who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
himself</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>I Know very well that you have often advis'd
me against the Hurry, and Extravagance of
the Town, and I know that your Advice
was the result of not only your Friendship
for me, but also of your real Sentiments, that
is, of <hi>Reason:</hi> Nay, I am extreamly sensible how
often you have silenc'd me, when I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
to engage with you on this Subject, and
that you prov'd beyond Controversy, That the
preference ought to be given to a <hi>sedate</hi> and
<hi>thoughtful</hi> Life: Yet, when I am absent from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47413:9"/>
you, I know not how it comes to pass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by my forgetfulness of your Arguments,
or my inclinations to converse, and company,
the force and vigour of your Reasons vanish (for
The words in which they were couch'd, I'm
sure I still retain) which makes me flatter my
desires, that it was rather the <hi>Awe</hi> of him that
spoke, than the matter of the Discourse that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
(for so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ow I call it) my Opinion. Back'd
with these Considerations, methinks I may own
that I am relaps'd from those Resolutions you
left me, and that I fancy I have some Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in Dispute, which you have not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided;
this makes me begin to imagine, that
you are in the wrong to despise Conversation
so much, since without doubt it polishes that
imperfect Model of a fine Gentleman; which
Books but begin, and generally leave very rough,
and unfinished. <hi>Conversation</hi> does not only give
us a better taste in Reading, but also improves
our <hi>Thoughts</hi> to a good <hi>Practicable Habit,</hi> and
our Words, and Discourse to a greater Elegance
than all the stiff and laborious Trifles of the
plodding <hi>Academics;</hi> and I must tell you, Friend,
that you your self wou'd never have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of all that fineness of Sense, if you had
not in your Youth been much conversant with
the better part of <hi>Mankind.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nay, I must proceed farther, and own, that
the lighter <hi>Sallys</hi> of <hi>Youth</hi> appear not so crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to me, as your <hi>nicer Reason</hi> represents them;
'tis true, I have not forgot what you us'd to
urge against them, <hi>viz. That however diverting
they might seem to those engag'd in a fond Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to 'em, yet that their apparent Folly render'd
them not only ridiculous, but odious to the more
considering part of the World, and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47413:9"/>
they cou'd give real Satisfaction and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to a</hi> reasonable <hi>Man, being commonly the effect
of a hot-headed Rashness, begot by the prevailing
Fumes of the Bottle, when <hi>Reason</hi> has bid 'em
good night, and</hi> thought less Accident <hi>assum'd the
direction of all their Actions.</hi> Yet my Friend, you
must pardon me, if I tell you, That as Fables of
<hi>Cocks</hi> and <hi>Bulls,</hi> &amp;c. seem but an odd sort of
Divinity, or Philosophy, to employ the Thoughts
of a man of sense, which yet have always had
such a valuation with the Learned for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
that it has given a Life to <hi>Aesop,</hi> almost
thrice as long as that of <hi>Methusaleh;</hi> so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>tho
the Extravagances of <hi>Witty</hi> Youth may seem
but odd Lessons of Wisdom, yet I am sure there
is not one without its excellent Moral, if that
be but improved by a judicious <hi>Reflection;</hi> by
this you'll find, I include not the Adventures of
e'ry noisy Fop, or Bully, but of the <hi>Youths</hi> of
<hi>true Witt,</hi> of which Sir, I can say with some as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
my conversation is composed, whose
worst Extravagancies come not short of the
practical Precepts of your old Friends the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi>
in making their Slaves drunk for
the instruction of their Youth, who by that sight
cou'd gain but one half of the Knowledge that
was requir'd to make them understand all the
inconveniences of Drunkenness; they saw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
what a ridiculous Figure the poor intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
Wretches made, but they knew not but
that it gave them a sufficient pleasure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
that appearance of Folly which was
often put upon the Noblest of Actions of the
Wisest of Men, they might have heard that
the <hi>Abderites</hi> thought <hi>Democritus</hi> mad, when
he was imployed in the search of Nature in the

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47413:10"/>
them, by the Authority of his Word, of the
contrary; besides many a man wou'd run the
risque of looking like a Fool, for an hour or
two, to enjoy a Pleasure for twice the time;
especially an unexperienc'd pleasure, which is
always magnify'd by Imagination. But if they
had been permitted to be drunk themselves, the
Pain and Sickness that attended it, would have
instructed them, that it was none of the most
desirable of Pleasures; the other punishments
that are the consequences of this Vice, which
wou'd have deter'd them from it, were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that is, the spending of Estate, which brings
the boon Companion to contempt and Infamy;
for the Slaves of <hi>Sparta</hi> were made drunk at
the publick Charge.</p>
                        <p>But not to dwell too much upon the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the worst of our Crimes, and which
we our selves condemn, and are very seldom
guilty of, I will by sending you a <hi>Relation of
one of our Frolicks,</hi> convince you, that we make
a better use of our extravagances, than you do
imagine; and that they proceed from choice,
not accident: For while your <hi>Virtuos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </hi> are poring
over the unaccountable Secrets of <hi>Dame Nature,</hi>
we are busy in searching into full as intricate
a Subject; The Humours, and Nature of Men,
while they are conversing with Labour and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
with the <hi>Mineral, Vegetable,</hi> and <hi>Animal</hi>
Kingdoms, our pleasure leads us in chase of
the Secrets of the <hi>Rational World:</hi> Their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
may have the Face of more <hi>harmless Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence;</hi>
but I'm sure, our Delights are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and more to the <hi>purpose of Living.</hi> They
are like our Travellers who ramble abroad to
see Foreign Countries, before they know any
thing of their own; for your great <hi>Naturalist</hi>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47413:10"/>
will seldom arrive to any knowledge in
Man, and in Conversation, and in the Affairs of
the World wou'd merit that Name in its worst
sense. Mankind walks in a mist, and cannot be
seen at a little distance; you must keep close to
it, or you loose sight on't, at least till you have
got a competent Knowledge to secure your self
from the Assaults which are continually offer'd
to the <hi>Innocent,</hi> that is, the <hi>Ignorant</hi> part. No
man almost is what he appears to be; we are
all <hi>Ianus</hi>'s and have two or more Faces in all
our Actions, as well as Designs, as you'l find
by what I send you, which is part of <hi>those
Letters which our Club in a frolick made
bold to borrow of the Post.</hi> Perhaps you'll
condemn our Frolick of a fault in prying into
the <hi>Secrets</hi> of our Neighbour, and in doing
them some damage in detaining those Letters
from them, which perhaps requir'd a speedy
dispatch, a minute being many times critical
and irreparable; as to the first, my Friend, I
must answer you, 'tis but a Vulgar Error<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>that
makes that a Crime; for e'ry man ought to
live so as not to be ashamed of his most <hi>secret
Actions,</hi> and deserves to be exposed when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
that Justice or Wisdom which he stickles so
much for in the Actions of others, without regard
to them in his own. As to the second, I must
inform you, that what Letters we found of
that nature that had an <hi>honest End</hi> in the speed
they requir'd, we took care to send as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
the others I now by common consent make
publick, to save them the trouble of writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
on the same subject, if they have not by
their <hi>impatien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>But before I present you with the <hi>Letters,</hi> it
will not be altogether undiverting to give you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47413:11"/>

said he had just receiv'd by a mistake, as the

the same Name, who often frequenting the

of the Porter. This other Gentleman to whom
the better belong'd of right, was known to all
our company, and had in the esteem of the

discover'd him to be a <hi>Secret Sinner</hi> against
both. It was from a <hi>Young Girle of a small For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
who being committed to his charge by Will,
he had not only cheated her of the greatest
part of it, but very earnestly sollicited her to
yield her <hi>tender budding Beauties to his shrivel'd
Embraces,</hi> building his assurance of success on
her Necessities, which he had brought upon
her, by depriving her of the means of redress

Friends, or Justice against him. Her Parents
had given her a Vertuous Education in their lives
time, or at least so well instilled good Principles
into her, that they were not easily corrupted
by the importunities of this Old Man, whose
<hi>seeming Piety</hi> had gain'd the Tutelage of her from
her deluded Parents, who it seems were too
<hi>simply</hi> good to examine farther than the outward
appearance, which sometimes in <hi>Religious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders</hi>
ought to be understood, like <hi>Dreams,</hi> by
contraries. The Letter I'll defer till we come
to the rest, where you shall be sure to meet

<hi>what use might be made of this Discovery</hi> for

Letters were the pulling off the Mask in

for we are apt to write that in a Letter to
a Friend, which we would not have all the

Thus, said Mr. <hi>River,</hi> we find <hi>Cicero,</hi>

phras'd it) wou'd not be of half a years
continuance. We need not go so far as Old <hi>Rome</hi>
for a proof of this (pursu'd Mr. <hi>Brook</hi>) for 'tis
obvious enough to any man that has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
in the world, and given himself the

my Friend here—Hold—(interrupted Mr. <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>)

I had got my load by four in the Afternoon,

a sudden Revenge inspir'd me; I cap'd
hold of as many as I cou'd, whipt into the
next Coach, and made him drive away as if
the Devil were in him, to <hi>Iack Brooks</hi> Lodging,
whom I found in his Study reading of <hi>Voiture</hi>
of the second Edition, I mean the Gentleman
of <hi>six Foot high,</hi> as he ingeniously intimates to
a glorious Vizor-mask. Prythee <hi>Iack,</hi> said I,
cast aside this new <hi>Paradoxical Dogmatist,</hi> and here
let us peruse <hi>Nature;</hi> and having here in its
proper place I inform'd him of this Adventure,
then in comes <hi>Ned Winter,</hi> and puts me to the
fatigue of repeating it again, which done, we
apply'd our selves to our business, and upon
occular demonstration found five of the six
Letters to be of some of our Acquaintance:
But such a Discovery we made, that it surpriz'd
us with several <hi>effects of Passion,</hi> one laugh'd, the
nother swore, and the third preach'd. There
were <hi>she Saints</hi> that had the Word of God in
their mouths mornings, and evenings, most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
frequenters of Pews, and wearers out of
Hassocks, found to be back-sliding Sisters, and
that they had the Devil in their Tails. There
was this protesting Friend, found a <hi>damn'd Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
that sought nothing but his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
with the Wife of him he hug'd in his
Arms, only caressing <hi>him</hi> that he might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<hi>her.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For my part, Gentlemen (said I) 'tis not fair,
you shou'd only enjoy the Pleasure your selves,
you ought either to produce your Letters for

'faith (return'd <hi>Winter</hi>) I made the Rogues have
that Justice to write a Line of Advice under
each Letter, and sealing 'em up, send 'em by
the <hi>Penny Post</hi> to the place directed.</p>
                        <p>I know not (pursu'd <hi>Temple</hi>) whether you'l
approve of my Thought or no; but I think we
cannot have a more agreeable Entertainment,
than such another <hi>Frolick, the Posts are now on
the Road,</hi> let each man to his Horse; and two
in a company go upon the Adventure, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

and divert our selves with the Scene of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy
uncas'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, for my part (said <hi>Winter</hi>) I am
not extreamly fond of the <hi>Pillory, Gallows,</hi> or
a swinging <hi>Fine:</hi> Nor do I think the pleasure
this Adventure may afford us, will recompense
the hazard we run to obtain it, especially since
we are not us'd to the <hi>Pad.</hi> I am of your
side, (pursu'd <hi>Grave</hi>) for tho I shou'd not
be much displeas'd with the perusal of them,
yet I am not for giving more for pleasure than
'tis worth, or for laughing for an hour, at the
expence of an Age of Sorrow.</p>
                        <p>But these two Opposers were fain to acquiesce
in the Judgment of the Company; and tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

perhaps I might encline to the Opinion of the
few, yet having a great <hi>Veneration for the Clergy,</hi>
I chose to imitate them in siding with the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
side. Things being thus concluded in the
Affirmative, we immediately adjourn'd, and in
the order above-mentioned, took Horse, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
our work,</hi> and met at the place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<hi>River</hi> and my self were the first that ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and had not toss'd off our sober Pint,
but <hi>Brook</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> came in all over-bespat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

and <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Chappel</hi> stay'd some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to be immediately rub'd down, and cloath'd,
and thought it wou'd be safer to retreat to
our several Lodgings, and new dress, before we
proceeded to our Examination, or an account
of our Adventure, all the <hi>Pacquets</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
to my Chamber, and there to be put

                        <p>By that time we were all ready, his Barge

we row'd for <hi>Putney</hi> against Tide, which
however turn'd for us by that time we got to
<hi>Chelsey.</hi> And now we began to have time to

taking notice of, having done our work as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,

<hi>(persued Mr. Winter)</hi> if he had been a Man of true
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47413:18"/>
Reason that had writ it, he would not have inclined
to the weaker side, ev'n according to the stress of his
own Argument; for all his Letter seems to aim at
the establishing the uncertainty of Religious affairs,
but takes it for granted, there is a greater certainty
in the course he Follows, tho' without Proof, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for all he has said what he prefers is fully as
uncertain as the other, and Reason obliges her follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in things equally uncertain to lean to the safer
side, now 'tis agree'd even by them, that if this
which Religion commands and teaches, should be
true, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that is, the loss of such Pleasures, which
have generally a pain, Repentance and Punishment that
attends them. An Atheist, I mean such as pass for
such <hi>(said Fountain)</hi> is so far from being a
Man of Sense, that he is a meer Idiot, for either
he believes a God, or he does not, if he do, he
must be something more than foolish to imagin that
God has no Worship, and if he have a Worship, it
may be that which he Ridicules for all that he knows,
and therefore not to be ridiculed by him, without
the highest madness in the World, for if running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Mouth of a Cannon when 'tis let off,
merit that Name, much more does that of giving
fire to the wrath of God, which must be pointed
against his own Bosom with greater certainty of
Death, and less probability of Escape than the
other.</p>
                     <p>But if he believe there is no God, he is still
more out of his Wits, for by what means does he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
this World he loves and enjoys, came to be
made? If by another Being, that must be God, if
from it self it must be Eternal, which is impossible;

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47413:24"/>
Mr. <hi>Langbain</hi> very well observes, I have the
extream vanity to boast my self the greatest.
You present us every Month with so much
variety of Wit, that as the design was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
so the performance appears not at all to
come short of it. Not that I think my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in your favour will make you vain, for a
Man of so much sense can never be infected
with so signal an oversight. tho' without Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
I can say my opinion is not despised by
the most topping Witts, not only of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<hi>but also</hi> of the whole University; the
trifles I have attempted, have pleas'd here
much beyond their desert, which makes me
presume to offer some of the best of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to you, and shall be extravagantly
proud, if they receive so favourable a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from you, as to be admitted into your
Journal. My modesty has made me defer send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them till now, but some particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
prevailing over that Virtue (which indeed
is my fault) I have, after a severe perusal sent
them to you, and tho' I cannot see any great
Errors in them, yet since 'tis possible I may
be thought too fond, and indulgent a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of my own Off-spring, I entirely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to your Judgment, and Correction, which
I have some hopes will do me justice; I have
therefore inclos'd in this Letter, two Riddles,
(which sort of Enigmatick writing as it pleases
the witty part of this Age, so I admire it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all but Love Verses) and a copy of love
Verses which I have compos'd according to the
Rules and Examples of that extraordinary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
commended so much by an unknown
hand in one of your Journals. And I must
be bold to testify the good effects of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47413:25"/>
in me; for often reading <hi>Waller</hi> and
<hi>Cowley,</hi> and still attempting an imitation of
them, I prov'd continually successless; I'm
sure I was really in Love, and yet I could not
think as they did, which made me conclude
(especially when I had seen this incomparable
Book, which I think the finest thing that has
been published in our Language, as a great Judge
and Critic observ'd at the Booksellers Shop)
that these thoughts cou'd not be really the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Love, since the same cause must have
the same effect; and if I durst say it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the imputation of vanity. I should think
this discovery made by this Author, was in

                        <hi rend="margQuotes">Had I receiv'd this in private, I shou'd have
communicated it to you (said <hi>River</hi>) for 'tis from
a pretty ingenuous Youth I value, and esteem, as
he indeed deserves, and whom I desire shou'd
have as tender a value as he ought for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
without a ridiculous Niceness, and (as
he says) I wou'd have him avoid the Extreams of
Cowardize, and Bullying. But I'll first have
your opinions before I write an Answer. To
me (said <hi>Temple</hi>) upon a serious Reflection, the
whole business seems very ridiculous to put
ones self upon an equal (nay, perhaps a much
greater) hazard with the man, that has injur'd
me; whereas in reason, I ought to punish his
Offence with hazard to him alone, that was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
else I only add an Injury to my self, to
that I have receiv'd from another; and in this
I think the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> more rational,
for a rascally Offence (and such is e'ry design'd
Affront, as much below a man of honour to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47413:30"/>
give as to take) ought to be punisht by a Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
not a Gentleman, that pretends to any thing
above a Hang man. For this Custom, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Honour sets up a private Tribunal of Life
and Death in ev'ry man's Bosom, who, when
he's satisfy'd of anothers Offence, as he has
been the judge, will be the Executioner, and
that, as if fond of Ignominy, with the risque
of his own Life. But how can that (said I)
be the Arbitration of Courage (for so is Tilting
esteem'd) where a Coward that is perfect in his
Sword, shall, ten to one, kill the stoutest Hero;
or an arbitration of the Justice of a Cause,
where the decision lyes upon the skill of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
Engag'd; and where the Injur'd may fall,
and the Injurer triumph in a second Offence
of a far higher nature than the first, and that
with the consent of the party wrong'd. If your
Friend (said <hi>Winter</hi>) be not expert at his Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
(a Colledge improving a man in Books, not
Swords) 'tis not courage, but madness, tho' he
receiv'd the Affront, to venture a Tilt with
him, whose Trade it has been; that being to
run upon certain Death without any prospect
of Advantage, contributing more to his enemies
than his own satisfaction. In such a case (said
<hi>Chappel</hi>) I think a man had better imitate a
Doctor of Physick of my Acquaintance, who
meeting one that had a Pique against him on
the Back-stairs at <hi>White-hall,</hi> with a great deal
of patience let him give him the Lye; a Lord
that follow'd him, ask'd him why he took the
Lye: No, my Lord, said he, he wou'd indeed
have fasten'd it upon me, but I wou'd not take
it. The Doctor (said <hi>Summer</hi>) was in the right
on't, I think, being better skill'd doubtless, in
<hi>Recipes,</hi> than <hi>Ters</hi> and <hi>Quart;</hi> for a man in those
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47413:31"/>
Circumstances may with as much Honour (if Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
be not repugnant to Reason, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sense) refuse the Combate, as avoid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
with half a dozen men at a time, the
odds in this being greater. If I have a right
Notion of Honour (said <hi>Church</hi>) it consists as
much in not offering, as not suffering a base
Action: But drawing upon a naked man is
the meanest and basest of Actions, and to draw
on him that is not skill'd in a Sword, which
then can be no defence to him, is to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one unarm'd. Nay, more than that, (said
<hi>Brook</hi>) a man of Honour ought not only to
be free <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rom Villany, but also from the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, which he can never be, if he takes
those measures for the satisfaction of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
by which in reality, he may deserve
rather the name of a Bravo, than that of a
Hero, for engaging with a man less skill'd
than my self, is not a jot better than assassin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
him, which I take to be the Office of
a Coward, and a Ruffian, not of a man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Courage: And yet this is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in Duelling; so that I think 'tis far from
being a proper Umpire of Honour or Courage.
Come, come (said <hi>Fountain</hi>) you may talk as
you please of the Reason of the thing, but I'm
sure custom will over-weigh all your Reasons,
and decide the business against you. 'Tis true,
faith (said <hi>Grave) Custom,</hi> that senseless Refuge
of non-plus'd Fools, will carry it, and the men
of Reason must either be born down the Tide
of that, or be piss'd on by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(said <hi>Chappel</hi>) the epidemic distemper of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
most of whose happiness consists in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a good esteem of their own performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
from the Laureat to Penny Chronicler.
I know the hand and the Author too (pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued

always agrees with this Letter, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since some success he has met with in
a Dialogue of his Writing, hath nothing but
Affectation and Vanity. I must say this (said
<hi>Winter</hi>) in his Vindication (for his hand and
stile must discover him to all this company
I'm sure) that his Vanity is excusable, since
he meets with so many Flatterers, that it is
hard for him to think he has not a great deal
of desert. True (said <hi>Church</hi>) the modestest
man in the World cannot be so good proof

who tho he will never speak in commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of himself, shall yet with no little ardour
and disturbance undertake a Defence of what
he writes, if any one in his company chance
to cavil at it. Vanity (said <hi>Brook</hi>) is so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
a failing, that I am of opinion, 'tis es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to our nature; every man being infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it as well as Authors, only some have
the advantage of hiding it better than others.
I confess (said I) we seem ev'n in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of this Author, to discover our
selves tainted with the same we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
in him, and that without the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the deference the Town, shews to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47413:33"/>
his Parts. We discover no more (pursued
<hi>Summer</hi>) than the Conversation of the World
does tolerate, which always makes bold with
the absent; the Follies of all men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
those of the present company, afford
wonder, and laughter, but those are plac'd too
nigh to be distinguish'd. They that can only
see their own Defects (said <hi>River</hi>) I fancy not
unlike the pur-blind, that can only read when
the Book almost touches the Eye. I'm very
confident (concluded <hi>Grave</hi>) we shew no great
Arrogance, or Self-esteem in venturing to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
what is obvious to common sense, as the
intollerable vanity of this Letter is, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
such gross Follies, in my opinion, gives
a greater proof of our ignorance, than good
Nature, or Wisdom.</hi>

think ignorance the mother of Honesty any
more than of Devotion, yet the Country by
the fine Idea's the Poets have given of it
carries the Bell of Innocence and Integrity

of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where 'twas decreed the Bishops

their Tables, and gain themselves Authority by their
Faith and Integrity; nor of the mind of the Council of

decreed, no Priests should have two Benefices. There
are two great Oversights methinks in that Author,
<hi>(said</hi> Summer) one where he says, That because there
are a greater number of Inhabitants in a <hi>London</hi>-Parish,
than in four, or five in the Country, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Country Incumbent might have more Benefices
than one: Whereas he should have shewn, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were alike, which are very different, these Numbers
being together, and near the Church, where the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is present to teach 'em all together, but those in the
Country so divided, that it can't be, so I don't think
one quarter in the year sufficient to apply himself to
their Instruction. And next he should have shew'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
that Five hundred Souls were not enough to employ
the time of one man, to conduct them well to Heaven.
The other Oversight is, That he will not allow Sixscor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

You counsel me against the danger of losing my
Reputation by those Freedoms I grant, but you are

is to be too sollicitous about it: Scandals in the

Cloaths, as without an Intrigue; I have half a score

to attempt the same Freedom again. Ah, my Dear,

that way as yet; besides, he may have Quirks
enough in Law to chouse me out of my Jointure.
I have also a young Doctor of Divinity, that seems
to have a months mind to me, and tells me, he
thinks me fairer, than a new System, or a good Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
but I had rather have the whole Bible Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal,

wants another Qualification, of keeping a Mistriss

I have a Courtier, fully as finical, but he's mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously

he's damn'd a thousand fathom, if there be any one
of the Maids of Honour comparable to me. Among
the rest, I have an ingenious younger Brother to a
certain Knight of your acquaintance, that dresses
neatly, but free from Foppery, that has a genteel
Air, but not affected; with a Face that's handsom,
and yet manly, a Voice soft, and melting, and a
Tongue that would deceive a Vestal Virgin, that was
sure to dye for yielding. This man, I must confess,
my Dear, has such an ascendant over me, that I wish
he were not so wild; and I fear I have heard him,

renders its Passions, and Vertues less perfect, Wit,
Courage, and Love being all more languid in them

very seldom witty, and ingenious. I confine these
Observations, Madam, to the Men, since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,

more delicate Mould, nearer a-kin to the Essence
of her Soul; and I venerate that quality in your

your Slave. Oh that your Compassion, and
Justice would let me sacrifice my person on the fair
Altar of your lovely Bosom, as I have already my
Heart on those of your Eyes. If Love be Merit,
none deserves you more; and sure whatever we
may the other, the heav'n of Woman is gain'd by
Merit. Your Rigour makes me bold, and vain, it

more favourable Ear, and said enough, I thought,
to make you understand whom I meant, if my
Eyes had not been sufficient to have betray'd the
Secret to you. I am unwilling to think my Age,
or Fortune so contemptible, as to be slighted by
you; and therefore I hope this confession of my
Love will be look'd upon as a modest assurance in
my own Deserts, and not an overfondness of you;
tho ingranting I love you, I grant you worthy of that
Fondness. I hope you are a man of Honor, to
make no use of this to my Prejudice. Remember

of Beauty, it has also the less care, as well as
skill to please. And I think, without vanity, my

                           <p>I Received your kind Letter, in which indeed
you discover a great deal of Zeal for my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
I must grant I was once of your mind, tho
I have at present far other Sentiments. I know
your Observation to be true, that these second
Matches have very often ill luck, but yet there's no
general Rule without an Exception; and I have
known some to this, and seen second Husbands
kinder than the first. Besides, the ill success of
these Matches proceeds commonly from the Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the Lady, who understands not to chuse
well. Fluttering <hi>Beaux,</hi> and impudent Rakehells
generally take with our Sex, who have no Merit,
but what's due to their own Braggs. But I have
made choice of one whose Modesty is his only fault,
which secures me of that, which you urge with a
great deal of ardour, <hi>viz.</hi> that I shou'd remember how
long I have been my own Mistriss, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how pleasant it must be to submit to the Will
of another. But the modest man is seldom an
Usurper, and if he claim no more than his due, I
shall never think my Liberty infring'd: that's only
to be fear'd from an assuming conceited Coxcomb,
that thinks nothing a Fault but Modesty. You

there's no great fear of a Storm. For my part, I
never set up for the superstitious Niceties of the
<hi>Ephesian Matron,</hi> and therefore need not fear a
Punishment like hers, of shame, and infamy: if I
continued a Widow thus long, 'twas but to meet
with a choice agreeable to my Reason, her violent
Resolutions were not Proof against the Assaults of
the most inferior, and commonly the worst quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

no Woman ought to pretend to that, which their
after-frailty would discover to be so ill grounded.

their Father, and I know no reason why I should
not also provide for my self, and gratifie my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,

ill fortune to have 'em found out by the Tyde-Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but less than half the value into their own
Pockets, secured them from the public; so that
their Oath, and Trust were not Proof against
Gold. Next, coming to quarter at a Merchants

I found he had a Wife, beautiful, young, and chas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as she was generally thought, but by Gold I gained
admittance to her Bed, where being caught by the
Husband, Gold soften'd his Indignation, and gave
me a more secure, and free access to her: But wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of that, I posted to some neighbouring Courts,
upon the Negotiation you wrot of, and there I found
Gold open the Secrets of Princes, debauch the
Honour of Ladies, the Religion of Devotes, and
the Integrity of Servants, oblig'd to their Masters
for their very Life, and Bread. Meeting with
some Controversies in my Dealings, I found always
the Judge on my side, as well as the Advocate,

better that none should be admitted to the Clergy

observe all the effects of Conversation, Government,
and Policy; <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> report, that the Cranes
observe a regular, and successive Order in their flight,

you, so it the more surpriz'd me, when I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
how much you had oppos'd my Interest

                     <p>This Gentleman's Wisdom, <hi>(said Temple)</hi> like that
of most young men, is bought at his own expence.
Young, or old, <hi>(return'd Winter)</hi> we often, by our

And pour our Favours on those <hi>(added Church)</hi> who
on the first opportunity to serve their own separate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
turn the Benefit against the Benefactor. This

make Favourites rather by Fancy, than the Merits of
the Person. Or <hi>(added I)</hi> the Dictates of their own
Reason. We ought certainly <hi>(said Summer)</hi> if we
would not repent of our Actions to no purpose, never to
let it be in any man's power to betray our Interest.
At least <hi>(assum'd Chappel)</hi> by our over-confidence in
him. Then you would <hi>(said Fountain)</hi> destroy all
Friendship. No <hi>(reply'd River)</hi> the Practise of the
World now renders, that you call Friendship a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for Interest is the Cement of Friendship; and since 'tis
possible that may divide the dearest, 'tis Prudence to
secure ones self, by a cautious distrust.</p>

                           <p>The mistaken World condemns your Sex for

in it. The cause of Inconstancy in <hi>Common Love,</hi> is
the <hi>Body,</hi> which being of so changeable a nature,
'tis impossible it should retain any thing long, which
has the least dependance upon it: But the <hi>Soul,</hi> that
is still the same, must still persevere in the affection
it has once made choice of. Wonder not at the
Expression, Madam, for our Loves are the effects

                           <p>SInce my last, I have not much Variety to send
you, my Master keeping on in the old course,
the Evening he spends at the Park, in pursuit of
one Whore, or another; or at the <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi>
after Citizens Wives: All night he spends in
Drinking, at the Tavern. The other day we took
a walk into <hi>Red-Lion-Fields,</hi> and he order'd me to
stay at the end of <hi>Kingstreet,</hi> or to go home to his
Lodgings, for he should have no occasion for me.
I staid till he was gone a little way, and keeping
him in sight, I saw him meet a Woman, and with
her turn'd toward <hi>Maribone;</hi> I follow'd at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
till they were hous'd, whither I also went,
and finding the Room they were in, I peep'd thro'
the Key-hole, and there discover'd him very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
with one of the prettiest young Creatures that
ever my Eyes beheld. I could not blame my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
methought. But just as I was peeping, the
Drawer came up, and caught me, gave me a Box
o'th' Ear, and if I had not run for't, had discover'd
me to my Master, by making me his Prisoner, and
as he swore ducknig me in the Horse-pond; but
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47413:107"/>
trusting to my heels, I got safe away, tho my Master

tell you, Sir, you may thank your self for it. You
are for Plain-dealing; you love not to say one
thing, and think another; and you reap the Fruit
of what you love, that is Ruin, and Contempt in
the end. All that I can do, is only to advise you
to alter your methods, and live as other men do;
that is, never be what you seem to be. If you
would injure a man, profess a great deal of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for him, and so he'l not be upon his Guard,
and you may strike home. If you'd seem honest,
talk much of Religion, but observe but little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality:
And so in all your actions put on another
Face, than what they tend to, and by that means
you may chance to rub through the sharping
World. As my Advice is the best Service I can
do you, so is this the best Advice I can give you,

                              <salute>My Friend,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>I Received your Letter last night, in which indeed
you discover the <hi>Zeal</hi> of a Friend, but little
<hi>Consideration</hi> for the Frailties of a <hi>Lover.</hi> Hast
thou never been in Love thy self, that thou shouldst
think <hi>Advice</hi> of any force with those that are so?
I confess, indeed, the Arguments you have us'd car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
enough of Truth to prevail with my <hi>Reason,</hi> to
banish this fatal Passion from my Heart, if it was in
the power of <hi>Reason</hi> to do so, but alas, it has taken
Reason captive, and domineers o'er e'ery Faculty
of my Soul; and therefore to little purpose you
tell me, there are three Obstacles that obstruct my
Happiness in the Embraces of the divine <hi>BELVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERA,
Marriage, Modesty,</hi> and <hi>Poverty.</hi> You
urge, that being marry'd, I can't make her my
Wife; that being <hi>modest,</hi> and <hi>diffident in my self,</hi>
I can't suppose I can prevail on any other Terms,
since 'tis <hi>Assurance,</hi> and <hi>Impudence</hi> that gain the
Sex in that way; and lastly, that being <hi>Poor,</hi> I
ought never to think of <hi>Hope,</hi> since no Advantage
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47413:110"/>
can be reap'd from an Intrigue with me. Mony
(you add) may gain the fairest, noblest, most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and most chast of all the Sex, but that <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
seldom commits a Crime without some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of <hi>Interest.</hi> Ah, my Friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wish you had
in these enumerated all the Difficulties, I find I
should then have hopes of success: For I might
presume, she being a Lady of incomparable Sence,
and Judgment, and no Bigott, would be perswaded
of this Truth, That one Wife was no more than
Custom, and national Law, and not of force
enough to make the Embraces of a married man
criminal in the face of Heaven, whose Laws are
not subservient to those of Men; besides a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Arguments more to that purpose. As for my
Modesty, I confess 'tis a great fault in <hi>Love;</hi> but
<hi>BELVIDERA</hi> strikes such an Awe into me,
that I love her with such a profound Venera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ion,
that I fear it approaches too near Idolatry: But yet
I have often heard the charming Angel condemn
the forward confidence of one that admir'd her,
(for, ah! there's none that sees her, but must do so,
wheree'er she passes the dazled Throng, stand still,
and gaze, as if she were something more than mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal)
and when I have told her, <hi>Impudence</hi> was the
way to gain the Pair she has, my Friend, she has
<hi>declar'd</hi> that ne'r should take with her. Lastly,
<hi>Poverty</hi> would never harm my dear Pretence, for
she's not made of vulgar Mould, her Soul is charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as her Body. <hi>BELVIDERA</hi> has <hi>Wit,</hi> my
<hi>Friend,</hi> but not the <hi>flashy noise, tattling</hi> Wit of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,</hi>
which dwells on Sounds, and Words, no, she
has solid Parts, knows <hi>Nature,</hi> knows <hi>Reason,</hi> and
builds not her Judgment of things on vulgar Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or common Practices, like the rest of the Sex;
<hi>her</hi> Soul's above the contagion of a <hi>mercenary</hi>
Thought, so that if a poor Lover had but <hi>Merit,</hi>
                              <pb n="204" facs="tcp:47413:111"/>
she would ne'r oppose the guilt of Fortune to his
Happiness. Had I therefore <hi>Merit</hi> to plead, I should
not despair, but alas, I have none—but <hi>Love,</hi>—and,
ah! <hi>that</hi> every one that sees her may
plead without a Lye. My Friend, you are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in calling her <hi>Yielding</hi> a Crime, (kind Heaven
makes her yield, to convince the erring World,
that 'tis not so, for she can do no <hi>ill,</hi> and her Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would be the strongest Argument). Prithee, if
thou wouldst leave <hi>Bigottry,</hi> leave it for good, and
all, and rail not at it in this, or that, and caress it
in another thing. It was no Crime, when <hi>natural
Religion</hi> rul'd the World, till <hi>State-Politics,</hi> and
<hi>Priest-Craft</hi> made it so. Thus you see <hi>Love</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
all the Difficulties your Friendship rais'd.
You ask me, whether I have ever told her of my
Passion? I answer, No;—unless my tell-tale
Eyes, or Sighs, have betray'd the Secret; for
when I've sate wrap'd up in contemplation of her,
she has ask'd me what was the cause of my Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly;

awakes me. Her Voice is Harmony, fair <hi>BEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDERA,</hi>
speaks soft as the melting Sighs of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
But I am lost in the ravishing Thoughts of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47413:111"/>
her, till my Paper denies me to tell thee the greater
Obstacle, which yet remains; and I am glad, my
Friend, I cannot do it, lest if my Love should cast
my Honour, thou shouldst be able to upbraid me,
I had once done a thing I should not. But I will

I have not seen her these many Ages, called

presently after the Door burst open of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and there came in with Flambeaux in their
Hands, three, or four Boys in a green Livery; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them follow'd a Huntsman with his Horn, and
his Pack of Hounds, and after them a Gentleman
on Horseback, who seem'd to pass over his Study,
out of the Window, as he supposes, for he sunk

not come to himself again above two minutes, when
thinking to run into the next Chamber, he was
stopt at the Door by a lusty Fellow, that had Horns,
and Hair much like the Description we have of the
Furies; struggling to get from him, he beat hard
against the Door, which rouz'd two of his next
Neighbors, who calling to him, and he answering
but very faintly, they both came out to him, and
found him in a Swoon, but saw nothing; being
brought to himself, he gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But the account that <hi>Pliny</hi> gives of the Apparitions he
mentions <hi>(concluded Grave)</hi> is so very circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47413:120"/>
that it could not be the effect of melancholy
Thoughts, form'd out of our Fear. To omit therefore
the business of <hi>Curtius Rufus,</hi> which might be a boast
of his own, like the <hi>Egerla</hi> of <hi>Numa,</hi> I'll proceed to
the two more remarkable.</p>
                     <p>There was <hi>(says he)</hi> in <hi>Athens</hi> a noble, and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
House, which was haunted, for in the dead
of Night there was the noise of Iron, and if you
hearkened a little, you might perceive it to be the
rattling of Chains, first at a distance, but approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
nearer, and nearer; after which appeared an
old man, worn out with Grief, and Sadness, with a
long Beard hanging down, and Hair all staring, his
Legs, and Arms were bound with Chains, which he
shook: This made the House be deserted. But the
Philosopher <hi>Athenodorus</hi> coming to <hi>Athens,</hi> and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Bill on the Door, demands the Rent, which
being very small, gave him some suspicion, and
there he enquir'd into the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter, and had it all
related to him, which made him the more earnest
to take the House. As soon as Evening came, he
order'd his Bed to be made in the fore part of the
House, and his Books, and Pen, and Ink, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to be placed there, and sends the rest of his
Family to their Rest in the inner part, and taking
his Pen in his Hand, he set himself to write with all
the Intention imaginable, lest the Account he had
heard should, by the help of Fear, form those Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in his Mind, if not employ'd. The noise first
began at a distance, then approach'd nearer; the
rattling of Chains was heard, but he kept still to
his writing, but the noise approaching by degrees,
and now seeming within the Chamber, he turn'd
about, and saw the <hi>Spectre</hi> he had heard describ'd;
it seem'd to beckon him, but he making a sign
with his Hand, bid him stay a little, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to his Writing, but the <hi>Spectre</hi> upon that came
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47413:120"/>
and shook his Chains over his Head, upon which
he look'd back once more and observing it beckon
again, he took up his Light, and follow'd it; it
went slowly before him, as if oppress'd by Chains,
but in the Garden it suddenly disappeared: <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodorus</hi>
with some Herbs, and Grass, mark'd the
place; next day, having inform'd the Magistrates
of it, desires them to order that place to be dug,
where was found the Bones of a Man in Chains, his
Flesh being eat off by the Worms; which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up, and buried according to custom, the House
was never troubled afterward.</p>

Courtship. You tell me you want me, to instruct
you how you should complement, and entertain your
Mistriss, when you wait on her; but I can give you
choice Instructions, at this distance, in the matter,
which if you follow, you will gain the Reputation
with the Lady, of a very accomplish'd Spark; 'tis
the newest Mode of Wooing. You must be sure
to carry a piece of Crape in your Pocket, to wipe
the Dust from your Shoes before you approach her,
and to have your Comb ready to adjust your Wig.
If you sit, be sure place your self where you may
look in the Glass, and be very-diligent in giving
the genteel turn to the Curles of your Perruque, or
the Ribbons of your Cravat-string, and seem not to
take much notice of your Mistriss; admire your
own Dress, your own Person, and Parts; for to tell
her she's pretty, is to make her proud, and so stand
off the longer. If you don't sit, and indeed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

a longing for thy company, which can't but afford a
great deal of Delight, when your very Letters yield
so much Sweetness, and Content. Write therefore

you have had a great loss in losing a good Wife,
that being so rare a Jewel in this Age: You say
you have liv'd with her these nine and thirty
Years, without any falling out, she always paying
you that deference, and respect due to a Husband,
and that her you love, and indulgence due to a
Wife; but methinks it ought to be a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

this so many Years, when so many Accidents, and
Distempers threatens our Lives e'ry moment. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
I confess are the Joys of Love if they could

Memory of the deceas'd is a Balm for that Sore,
and keeps her Image still a live. Besides you have
Children the more lively Pictures of her; he fond

yet marry'd within a Year or two, and forgot them so

These Poets <hi>(said River)</hi> drew their Picture from
Nature; since 'tis evident Love triumphs over our other
passions, Ambition it self being forc'd to submit, when
once Love opposes it. Our modern <hi>Volture (conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Glass, for he makes it the meanest, and most indifferent
of passions, (and by consequence Absence no great pain)

the fittest for the expression of Love.</p>

asham'd of the Testimony you can bring, but can,

all men know that doing a Kindness one minute, and
cutting ones Throat the next, is not very <hi>cordial,</hi>
and any one that knows the least in the Laws of

cancel the highest Obligations. You accuse me of

all this heat? If I could do this, I would, but it
is not in my power; had you been troubled for

you have. I can say no more, but that if you can

can, if you write till Dooms-day, and I'll do what
I'm able, if you write never a word. If you persist

                           <p>SO Copious is the Information which you give
me of the great Liberty which the Vicious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
at <hi>Rome,</hi> that I have a great desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
thither. Particularly I understand what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
Lust is allow'd under the Purple Habit, as
being honour'd with the Protection of a Nephew
of his Holinesses. I have recanted my erroneous
Conceit that was infus'd into me by those that ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
in my Ears their daily Practice of most
execrable Uncleannesses, and their Contempt of
Women in Comparison of <hi>Baby-fac'd Boys.</hi> But
conformable to what you have suggested to me,
I know the Falshood of this Calumny, and find
that they give a hearty Entertainment to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Debauchery. The Women also have their
dispatches, and to speak the Truth to a Man that
understands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lady's Hole. And 'tis a great Advantage to falsifie
a Card; now that Men are so singularly desirous
to be pleas'd with Delusions and Appearances.
What greater pleasure can there be to a Man that
loves to enjoy a brutish Sin, then that he can be
sure to make a Change of the Hand, and when he
has a Woman in his Arms to be able to turn her
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47413:150"/>
into a Male, as his Sensuality inspires him. Peace
be to <hi>Venice,</hi> where delicacy of Appetite, with less
Scandal, practises this form of Satisfaction. By
which means, neither are Women depriv'd of their
Advantages, nor Men of their Pleasures. In short,
I am singularly pleas'd to understand that there is a
free stage at <hi>Rome</hi> for all manner of Lasciviousness;
which makes me resolve to breath the Air of that
City in my Old age. I hope to set up for a Baud,
and live well by my Trade: For where the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
disposes Men to Lasciviousness, there is the
less Trouble in our Calling. I hope in a short time
to obtain the Favour of all the Cardinals, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
I shall be sure to have always at hand what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they shall desire. I hope to add to the List
of Harlots, those few that preserve their Honesty to
stuff Tenis-balls: And I should wish to die, when

                           <p>I Am inform'd by your last Letter, that there is
no Body that offers to relieve our Tottering
Congregation, unless the Almighty Hand of God
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:47413:151"/>

prevalent, and the Threatning Ship-wrack can
hardly be repaid with the pleasure of the Harbour.
Behold <hi>Neb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

golden Head in the Emulation of Superior

Progresses of our Vertue less set forth in Silver Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
then in the Strength of Brass and Iron. But
at length our sublimity declining to the Feet, meets
with the frail and brittle Substance; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the occasion of our Ruine, from which we
expected our Establishment. Behold our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Affections, which wallowing in the Mud
of worldly Affairs, not plac'd in Heaven as they
ought to be, bring forth those Plants, which being
eradicated together with our Vertue, our whole Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity

over-greedy Desire of Gain, which makes us so
sedulous to creep into the Courts of Princes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates

always muttering Scraps of Prayers, still
shows our Hands fast grasping Crowns, while our
works abolish Holiness, but advance Affections quite
contrary to Vertue. Hence it is, my dear Brother;
that we are become contemptible in general, not by
Apostolic Will, but by compulsion of our own
Vices. This is not the way of the Saints; nor did
they who left us our Precepts, leave us these Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
to follow. And how can we expect a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to last for many Ages, if wandring from the
Truth before one Age be at an end, we hasten to
the Brinks of Precipices? In <hi>Spain</hi> where we were
first brought forth, took root and blossom'd first,
our Vigour is dry'd up, and all our Glories wasted
in the Womb whence we first deriv'd our first Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
threaten us with the Sepulcher, where we
must lie wrapt up in the Shrouds of Oblivion. The
<hi>Dominican</hi> Order is there preferr'd before ours, and
deservedly we who contemn all other Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,

The Comedies are lovely to the sight, but
the Acts are defective, because there is no getting
into the Theater, and the Eyes are only satisfy'd

There was a necessity also for me to comply with
her Avarice, extreamly greedy after Presents: So
that while she ply'd me with Gifts of no value, I

I affirm, there is more of Interest in these Amours,
than Charges in the Lusts of Harlots, while repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

great Advantages of Usury. Besides that, a man
can no more dispose of himself, than of his Mony;
which being ravish'd from him by their Delusions,
is presently consecrated to a Deity, that never thinks
her self sufficiently gratify'd. By means of their
study'd Alurements, they deceive so covertly, that it
is so much the more difficult to avoid their Snares,
because their Nets are so much the more accurately
spread. In this their Retirement, as they supply

to abuse their Admirers: But let all Trouble, and
Expence give way to the necessity of standing all

entertains me, and the Devils that torment me. I am
within those narrow Enclosures, where the most
doleful Vexations triumph, protected by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

the cost of those unfortunate Persons that serve 'em.
<hi>Good God!</hi> when I reflect upon my being in a place
where Gold hanging down from the magnificent
Ceilings, threatens death with the Fall of it, I well
perceive after what manner more splendid Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs
are the Landmarks of miserable Precipices.
That Splendor, of which another fond, believes he
has found a Sun, is a Lamp that terrifies, denoting
the nearness of approaching Thunder. In short, all
that, which otherwise contributes to the pomp of an
extraordinary Felicity, being enchanted within the
circle of <hi>Figur'd Majesty,</hi> is transform'd into the
essential cause of all Misfortunes. Unhappy he

others to beware of those Mischiefs which
I my self could not avoid. May Heaven deliver all
men from such a condition, which the Pains and

be outdone by the exchange of a perpetual Hell.
Compassionate my condition, dear Friend, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give

of this my last Misfortune, but greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

our Friendship, though you are not in a condition

                           <p>I Have chang'd my station, but not my condition
of Servitude, which remains constant in the
desire I have to obey your Commands. I fell in
love at <hi>Luca,</hi> where I resided for some time, as
you well know, with a married Woman, who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responded
with my Amours, and gratified the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
of my Affection with the <hi>Reward of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment.</hi>
Her Husband was a <hi>poor-spirited Fellow,</hi>
which gave us the more leisure to make him a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold.
One day he observ'd his Wife walking at
her Country House in my Cloaths, which sometimes
in a fantastic humor she would put on; he conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur'd
that I had let her know where I laid my
Cloaths, and that I had given admission to the
person that wore my Habit; and thence he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to conceive in his mind the Spoils that I
had won by triumphing over his Honour: Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad
therefore, to be thought what he could not
be denied to be, he departed for <hi>Rome,</hi> though

to so much Infamy, nor yet having the Courage to race
out his Infamy with his Sword.</hi> This gave me the
liberty to pursue my Pleasures with a full career,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47413:160"/>
and like a River in its Channel, I met with no
Banks that oppos'd my rapid course into the deep
Ocean of my Delights. But Fortune betray'd me in
the sight of my Felicities, while a Brother of my
Mistriss began to take upon him to uphold the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of his Family. However, being a Native
of the same Country with the Husband, he had not
a Resolution sufficient for an honourable Revenge.
He accused me therefore to the Secretaries, with a
Protestation never to forsake his own Interests,
and therefore desired 'em to take some course to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
his Brothers Honour, for fear he should be
necessitated to commit some extravagant Act. To
please him therefore, I had orders to unkennel,
and depart <hi>Luca.</hi> Upon which I went to the
Ladies Country House, where in pursuance of my
public chastisement, I many times made choice of
a voluntary Death, but as frequently rose again,
according to the custom of Lovers, and confin'd
my self a Prisoner to her Bosom, that I might the
more patiently pay my subjection to the cruel
Sentence. And now I enjoy my self in this place,
where the Honour of your Injunctions is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Felicity I can wish my self.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Lucchesi</hi> Gentlemen <hi>(said Chappel)</hi> are pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and couragious; but their Prudence makes
them take the safest way to facilitate their Revenge.
An Accident of the same nature <hi>(quoth River)</hi>
happen'd to my self, while I enjoy'd a Widow that
was my Neighbour, once at <hi>Luca,</hi> at what time the
Catchpoles of the City were sent by her Parents to
remove me out of the City, but I forc'd 'em to keep
a looff off, and made Horns at 'em with my Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47413:161"/>
Alas a-day! <hi>(replied I)</hi> such a place as
that has but few Heads, and consequently few
Hearts, and therefore for their own preservation it
behoves them to be careful of their Lives. There
is a necessity they should have good Head-pieces, for
the Government <hi>(quoth Grave)</hi> which require a
weighty Iudgment, and well-pois'd Resolutions,
and therefore they never refuse the ponderosity of a
good pair of Horns. Let us not trouble our selves
with these Gentlemen, <hi>(replied I)</hi> for they now
stand excommunicated, and quite out of <hi>His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's
Favour:</hi> Besides that, the public Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they have acquired by the management
of this Affair, is sufficient to bury any other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Ignominy that can disgrace their City.</p>

purpose to compound a Mishmash of Extravagancies:
and perhaps may be one of those who having a high

a Master of Art if he can but scrible over a peice of

                           <p>THE Reproaches which I left behind instead
of Complements at my last parting, are not
sufficient: For a just Anger is not so easily to be
appeas'd. My Tongue, the Harbinger of my
wrong'd Affections that denounce the Resentments
of my perplexed Heart, must now display it self
against thee. I was unquiet in my self, that
my Revenge would not permit me also the use of
my hands. But in regard it is an unbecoming base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to strike or hurt a Woman, I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to comply with my self, and wound thee
only with my Pen. If thou art capable of such a
Wound, as being all compos'd of Rags of Infamy,
and the shatter'd Reliques of Reproaches and
Shame. I know thou laugh'st at my deserved
Wrath: as being a Woman that never grieves,
but when she weeps drops of Blood; whose usual
Tears are the Distillations of Fraud, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
of Dissimulation. Nevertheless, I
shall rejoyce to publish the Occasion, which having
render'd thy Sex abominable to me, has enforc'd
me to proclaim a Palinode of Reproaches, such as
thou wouldst see in the ensuing Lines, wer't thou
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:47413:163"/>
not as mad, as thou art void of Reason. From thy
Ingratitude, the utmost Limit of wicked Habits, I
have understood, that Woman has nothing of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
about her but her Countenance, to lye tho'
she never speaks, and to let us find by experience
that nothing but Fraud and Deceit is to be expected
from one whose face is deceit itself. She has this
in common with Man, that she is of the same kind,
with all appropriating to herself all manner of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiality
that can be said to be in a living Creature.
But as to that which differences Man from other
Creatures, she has not a jot of Reason, for that
without Wit or Sence she <hi>acts like a Beast,</hi> that
never could pretend to Reason. In short she has no
agreement with Man, but only in the Declining of
<hi>Hic</hi> and <hi>Haec;</hi> to shew that you Women are only
joyn'd with us, to debase our Grandeur, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
our Felicity.</p>
                           <p>Then again, if we look upon <hi>Sphynx</hi>'s, <hi>Panthers,

sufficient to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

most bestial Natures living all at once in one Body.
In thy Sex there is to be found no other prevailing
Power but that of the Will, and that too so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd

                              </gap>m'd as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Maxim, that Woman is altogether void of
Judgment. <hi>Hence, how unbridl'd in their Lust!</hi>
How irregular in their Fury! there is no <hi>Medium,</hi>
by Vertue of which we may infer a Conclusion of
their being Humane. Or if their mute Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
their <hi>tender Dalliances,</hi> their glozing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
may give us to believe they have pilfer'd from
us some <hi>seeming Signs of Humanity,</hi> their Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ravish'd from the <hi>Siren,</hi> their frauds which
they practise in imitation of other Beasts; furnish
'em with Tricks and Wiles to accomplish their
Treacheries. The Pourcontrel, that changes itself
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:47413:163"/>
into the Colour of a Rock, the more easily to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare
his Prey, is not so witty as a Woman, that
under the Appearance of humane Shape lays
her Ginns and Traps to catch poor credulous
Man.</p>
                           <p>And what is the reason that Lovers, in their
actions, are necessitated to circumscribe their own
Being within certain Limits which denote a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Understanding? Whence comes it
to pass that they live without Law, because they
are without reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deserving nevertheless, the
more to be pardon'd their Miscarriages, as being
mad and void of understanding. Certainly from
no other cause, but for that they have the Hearts
of their beloved Mistresses, by the force of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Translation, fix'd in their own Breasts.
And how indeed can it be, that having Hearts no
way concern'd with intellectual Life, they should
live performing acts of Reason? Miserable is that
Man, who having a Woman to be his Soul, makes
his own Substance obnoxious to the Qualities of
Bestiality, and the Effects of Folly. 'Tis to be
believ'd that she who is always practising from her
Birth her natural Property of applying her self to
Evil, would be sure to take the worst of the
two Urns that were plac'd by the Throne of <hi>Iove,</hi>
and empty it all into her Bosom. Whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to vary the Dependence of the Intellect and
Will according to the many Changes of Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
while the Woman sway'd by her own disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Customs betakes her self to the worse, of
necessity, the Man must approve that only which is
contrary to reason.</p>
                           <p>The Seeds of Prudence which are sow'd in
humane Minds, when they are scatter'd in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
are invested with a contrary Nature so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
that they produce Fruits quite different
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:47413:164"/>
from the Original. But if the truly wise Person
sits enthron'd upon a Four-square Stone, to shew
the Reward of unshaken Constancy, which is the
immoveable Basis of Eternity due to his Merit;
the Female Sex can have no Seat among such Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as these, a Sex so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ickle and inconstant, that
Fortune, which causes such Convulsions in the
World, is clad in Female habit, to denote the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
between that Sex and her.</p>
                           <p>But the granting in Women that Understanding,
which makes it not to be deny'd, but that they
have a Soul individual from our Species, obliges
us to believe according to the Doctrine of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi>
that the Understanding is our Genius, so
that Woman may be call'd the Evil <hi>Genius,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the <hi>Good Genius.</hi> And if the Title of
Evil Genius be appropriated to Devils, ordain'd to
disturb our Felicity, and direct us to precipices,
the same may well be appropriated to Women, by
whose Misguidance all Men running headlong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
their Glory and their Grandeur scatter'd in
the deep Abysses, where they miserably fall. And
that I may not suffer my Discourse to totter upon
a weak Foundation, tell me, when it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
known, but that Women were a Moving-Hell,
but too stable a Jurisdiction of Miseries and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
to continue the Pains and Torments of
Men.</p>
                           <p>In their Youth, if they are amiable, they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
us; if they are deformed, they annoy us;
if they love, they tyrannize; if they do not love,
they kill us. If they live at a distance, they pinch
up and strengthen our desires; if Neighbours, they
make us sensible of many Sorrows. That which
renders 'em acceptable, makes 'em proud: If they
have not where-withal to make 'em proud, they
prove contemptible. When they are fair, they
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:47413:164"/>
are cruel; when ugly, lascivious: Whence it
comes to pass, that he who courts 'em, languishes:
He that desires 'em, weeps, plagu'd with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of their Persecutions. If they are not
inhumane, yet they are both haughty and covetous;
and if they do not suck your Veins, they drain
your Purses: And tho' they hate to be seen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
like Carkasses lying at your feet, they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to have Men their prostrate Suppliants.</p>
                           <p>In their Old age, with a greater prejudice to
Reason, they proportion the Perverseness of their
Humours to the swift Progressions of Time, which
hastens on restraining in the Wrinkles of their
Faces, those alluring Garnishments, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the unwary that they were the Theat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

As they grow farther in years, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
the Infamies of their Profession, or else
defaming more and more the Infamy of their own
desires, they shew the Deformity of their Faces,
only wrumpl'd up within their narrow Furrows,
to reinforce and strengthen the wicked Qualities
of their aged Wantonness. Being made the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of amorous Intreague, they presently
display the Profoundness of their Judgments, which
being matur'd by time, gave them that honourable
Imployment in the Kingdom of Debauchery. They
discover by what inveterated Customs they came
to purchase the Silver of their hoary Locks, to
spend it in the Tribute of Dishonesty, as before
they scatter'd profusely the Gold of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Curles. Then for their jugling Tricks, their
Illusions and Superstitions, being become Cabinet
Ministers in the Kingdom of the Devils, they
make appear that extraordinary Merit, which
readily advances them as they grow in years to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47413:165"/>
the particular Favour of such a Prince as governs
those Dominions.</p>
                           <p>When together with their youthful Years they
have lost those Beauties that give 'em Authority to
rend and tear the Hearts of Men, they become ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
to the Furies, that they may be enabled
with greater force to procure the Detriment to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And true it is, that those <hi>Circe</hi>'s, <hi>Medea</hi>'s,
<hi>Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were the true Images of those Resemblances which
Women wear about 'em. This the Prudence of
the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> well knew; who seeing a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
appear in the public <hi>Piazza</hi>'s before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals,
were affrighted as at the sight of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
Prodigy, and presently had recourse to the
Oracle for the Remedy against so great a Terror.
For that Women, being the worst of Creatures,
beyond all the unhappy Auguries of Crows por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
no other to Men but Misery and Disaster.</p>
                           <p>I have always commended the Comparison of a
Woman with a Vine: Which is only to be valu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>d
for its Fertility, not having any other priviledge
in the World, but only to be reserv'd for the
Flames; From hence it is, that a Woman while
she lives, is so given to weep; perhaps, out of
those Waters preparing Deluges to extinguish those
Ardors, which she knows how to merit. And all
this while, this aptness of your Sex to weep, is
only to find a Ford of Dissimulation, where the
Hardness of others may Shipwrack, or else to
bring themselves to the Haven of their Desires.
And I believe in Allusion to this Similitude it was,
that the <hi>Romans</hi> punish'd their Citizens with Rods
of Vine-Twigs, following perchance the Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Heaven, which to Men, the Citizens of
this World, is never represented in the Act of
Punishment with more cruel Scourges, then those
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:47413:165"/>
of these living Vines; there being no greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to us than our being joyn'd to a Woman.
Nor can she be deny'd to be a Vine, while clasping
and embracing us, as the Vine does Neighbouring-Trees,
she becomes all Nets and Ropes, which
only serve to bind and hamper Mankind. And
therefore being a Fellow-sufferer in these Chains,
she is enforc'd by necessity to procure her self a
Support, that she may not remain depriv'd of all
value and esteem. Unfortunate Women, who if
they were not sustain'd by Man, would have no
support of their own weakness, but would every
moment be stumbling like blind People, into a
thousand Precipices. This the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Women
understood, who lookt upon the most precious
Ornament which they could wear upon their Heads,
to be <hi>a Dressing in the Shape of a Man's Foot,</hi>
to signifie that a Woman being without Brains and
void of Wit, has no greater thing to glory in,
then her Subjection to Man. With the Ensigns
and Marks of this Subjection, as if they had been
trampl'd under feet, they honour'd the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Part of themselves; not such Fools as others,
that trick up their empty Sculls with the Treasures
of a robb'd Sepulcher, laid out in Commodes and
Top-knots; or else load 'em with Chains of Pearl;
all sparkling with Diamonds and Rubies.</p>
                           <p>But notwithstanding all this, Ingrateful and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannesses
as they are, if they cannot obtain the
Government over Man by any other means, they

                           <p>Can there be any Lady so simple to resign her

And you, dear Friend, will you destroy your own
Heart, to make a Sacrifice of it to a man that shall
feign a superlative love of your Person, till he comes
to enjoy ye? Undeceive your self, dear Friend,
by reflecting upon those Epithetes with which those
Imps are wont to abuse the Dignity of our Sex.
Consider that they are only a reassumption of those
Attributes, which punctually describe their own
Customs. Consider whether it be convenient to

Harpye. Lay aside that amorous Heart, observing
by the Rule of these considerations, how much it
behoves us to be perfect Rocks, that we may be
proof against the painful bitings of those wild
Beasts. Avoid their Snares by the flight of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
considering the nature of those Nets, wherein
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:47413:174"/>
when once we are taken, we fall into a fellow-suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

by which the Customs of Men will be represented
to your mind, ready to court, obsequious in their
veneration, affectionate in wantonizing and dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but so much the more impious to betray us.
I should take it for a singular good Fortune, if your
mind, being infertiliz'd with such good Documents

                           <p>I Was lately at <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Curiosity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Particulars of a City so much exalted by public
Fame, and celebrated with so many singular Titles
over all the World. The great Plenty of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
entangles every Heart; so that you must of

streightness of these T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>amels. I was a Novice in
the Knowledge of these Delights, but soon grew
old, adhering to the Experience of him that in a
few days accustoms himself to a well-grounded
Practise. And this is a Point of great Felicity,
that your Amours are begun and ended at the same
time without any long Cares, embitter'd with the
Hardships of a tedious Servitude. The great number
of Curtesans is the reason that Women, as they
deserve, are treated like Beasts, while among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
she is only made choice of that most pleases.
'Tis a Content not a little to be valu'd, that a
Man may find of a suddain, when his Appetite
serves, a Bank to stop the Fury of his Desires. The
Price has its bounds; a Condition which greatly
facilitates the putting forward the Key of the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47413:175"/>
Work. There are Wares of all Prizes, and every
one may proportion his expences as he pleases
himself; then only greatest, when a Man lays out
for a piece of Cloth, that is a like on both sides,
and may be turn'd every way without any prejudice
to the Nap. The Graces, the Dalliances, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses
of these Women are not imitated in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place. They are Mistresses of the true Art of
framing amorous Sweetnesses, having all the Rules
of Motion, as well streight as oblique, enough to
make their Lovers believe themselves in Heaven,
where Motion occasions the delightful Harmony of
the Spheres. They suffer no part of their Bodies
to lie idle, roiling all their principal Members to
multiply Pleasures. You never meet here with the
least Hair of the Beard, it being their care to take
away all roughness that may offend the Delicacy of
such a Pleasure. And their curiosity is admirable
in cleansing the Streets, to the end they may not

                              </gap>oul'd and worn out by frequent Concourse. In
a word, he that loves sport, let him study to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
his desires where his lascivious Itch may
transport him, and never complain of his want
of Satisfaction, which exceeds as much as can be
desir'd.</p>

the Frauds, Treacheries, Diseases, which in great
abundance overload with continual Vexation those
that suffer themselves to be too far hamper'd in
their Intreagues. The Pestilence is Health in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their Blains and Bubo's, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
as the Tokens of their Love, and for Fairings
to those that enjoy 'em. They have a Custom to

appearances they are when they willingly
transform themselves into Pictures. Take notice
also how like rotten Sepulchers within side they
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:47413:175"/>
whiten and varnish over the outside, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
appear like <hi>Mausoleums;</hi> to the end that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betray'd by the outward appearance, you may
not behold the Terror of that Horridness within.</p>
                           <p>There is no voraciousness comparable to their
rav'nous Avarice; and they pick your Bones with
such a Softness of Caresses, that fools, after they
have nothing left 'em but their Bones, resign their
Marrow to 'em also. They have the true Touchstone
to know at first sight a credulous Gull, or a Giddy-headed
Fool; and they lose no opportunity to get
the Coxcombs into the Cage, whom become the
sport of any that will riot at their cost. Presently
they empty their Chests, pull down the Hangings,
hide their Money, bury their fine Cloaths, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
the Face of a Counterfeit Poverty, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to move Widgions to Compassion. This is
the Custom of the fairest or most fantastical, who
knowing their power to bind a Man, believe they
can make a good prize of him when they have him
in their Nets Others quite of another humour,
make a general Sack of the <hi>Iews</hi> Trippery, to
cloath themselves and furnish their Houses, for
which they pay the Interest of greater Miseries.
By that means they set a value upon the defect of
those Talents, which make a Woman to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd,
in hopes to exact a greater price, upon the
Advantages of their Gaudery. Nor do they fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

to make use of Liberality by way of Traffic for
greater gain, casting a golden Hook to catch a
more considerable Prey; tho' many times they are
deceiv'd like the Country-man who let his Spade
fall in the Water, that so it might be turn'd into
Gold. Then, let the Tribute of Praise be given to
them that deserve it; since it cannot be deny'd,
but that there is an excess of graceful Manners,
genteel Carriage, and noble Converse, in such as
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:47413:176"/>
maintain a principal Post in this Science. They
have those Qualities which may be desirable in a
Lady of far greater worth, and a fit March for a
Prince. Their Pride is Majestic, but not Superior,
their genteel Demeanor ravishes, and obliges to
give, tho many times they have no intention to
receive. In short, Love may be said to have been
born at <hi>Venice,</hi> strengthen'd by the Multitude of
most beautiful <hi>Venus</hi>'s that nourish him in that
City. For my part I know not where a Man can
better fix his Scepter to take possession of pleasing
Contentments. He may extend the Dominion of
his amorous Joys, for that the Vassalage of Love
is there very great; where, tho' not in many yet
in one successively, good Qualities may be enjoy'd
in heaps, such as may give our Appetites sufficient
cause of Triumph. Excuse the Vehemence of my
Affection which has permitted my Pen perhaps to
take too long a flight. This Information may serve
you to make choice of any pleasure, when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to visit that delicious Paradise, where the
Darts of Love make a Nest of Tenderness, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

of Gold, is a remedy for every wound, with which
those Coelestial Beauties can afflict the Heart. If
you want any other Advertisements to direct ye
to your pleasures, as I am covetous of your Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
I shall not fail in my Duty to serve ye, in
Conformity to which I most earnestly wait for the

Pormanteau full of Shadows and Chimera's, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
usually sent to him, who having an empty
Scull, builds Castles of imaginary Grandeur in the
Air. He had a Box full of smoaky Thoughts,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:47413:177"/>
which drew tears from the Eyes of him that held
his Nose over 'em. And this was said to be part
of the Mind of some Grandee, who was always
forming of Engines, to the prejudice of those
that liv'd nere him. He had in a Girdle certain
Drams, which were those, for want of which to
make good weight, the Goldsmiths and Pothecaries
accomplish their Thieveries. The Courier said,
there was a great Chest of Ounces and Pounds, in
reference to other Merchants; but that it was left
behind, through the great Concourse of those who
were ambitious to usurp the greatest part. No other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as he inform'd us, it had befallen a great
Load of Violences, Rapines and Cruelty put in
practise by Tyrannic Princes; Wares which
he had put off in his Journey, being impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
on ever side by Tyrants or their Ministers.
He reserv'd to himself a bag of Cucumbers for the
principal Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> where are a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ignorant Dunces that are extreamly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>e, and therefore have 'em serv'd
to their Tables for Salates. There, he also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be a great gainer by certain Pills made
of Wind, as there are many who from Ambition
seek both their Nourishment and Physic, pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>t up
with nothing else but the pleasing Gales of Pride
and Ostentation. He had a good Trade among
some of our People for salted Eagles, very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to those that exercise their Taloons in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
Gammeds. Of no less advantage to him
was a Bag of Wolves Teeth pickled in Vinegar,
good against the Corruptions of our Age, being of
great use to soften the Cruelty of those that with a
spightful Voraciousness devour all before 'em. He
was also very sorry that he had not kept some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Horns for our Countries, excusing himself
through the necessity that constrain'd him to leave
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47413:177"/>
'em in <hi>Germany.</hi> He had not as yet unty'd a Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of Voices that were bound up very hard with
Sin and Cords, which were the Bowels of some
that under distress and oppression, suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be disbowell'd rather then break out into
loud Complaints of their Torments; as being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd
by great Personages, and therefore choosing to
die in silence. He had some Yards of Linnen-Cloth
made of the Fibers of Parrots Tongues,
which was to make Collar-Bands for some that
with the Ostentation of their Prittle-prattle appear
Fortunate; especially in Courts, where Parasites,
Comedians, Musicians and others of the same Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naglia,
meet with most lucky Hits. He had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a piece of Cloth both sides alike, that was
wov'n with the Hair of a <hi>Bufalo</hi>'s Nostrils; It was
to make Habits of great value for Flatterers, to
wear either side outermost, and to be always ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the Humour of the Prince. Above all,
he was in hopes to vend a great number of Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisks
Kye-brows, since he was sure all the Ladies
would buy 'em up to make Vails for their own
Eyes. In like manner he thought some Ribs of
Grashoppers would be acceptable to many, whose
Brains are full of those skipping Animals, to cause
a Spring in their own Meadows. Four Teeth of a
Flea, were reserv'd for a malicious Inhabitant
somewhere, who delighted to bite undiscover'd.
They would have had 'em to have been kept in
this City, where there was no want of Persons of
the same Humour. But he excus'd his refusal,
for that they were sent to a particular Person, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that he could have sold 'em in several
places, and could hardly preserve 'em from the
greedy Clutches of the Grandees, whose Custom it
is privately to suck the Blood of others. He was
very sorry he had not made a good Provision of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:47413:178"/>
Eels Marrow, for some that have a Humour to
fetch Water out of Stones, and to extract Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
out of nothing. I would not have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Bounds of Conciseness necessary in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but I was willing to give your Worship a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Accompt of what the Snail brought with him.
Upon your arrival in this place, which will be sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly,
when you go to the common Post-Office
you will be better inform'd of the Wonders I have
related. In some little Boxes of most accurate
Frauds, superfine Knaveries, cloak'd Treacheries,
painted Fictions, wicked Hypocrisies, vilanous Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
he has bundles of great value which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to open in this City, where such Gallantries
are in great Esteem. I wish you may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated
with certain Capriccio's and cursed
Plagues so neatly interwoven, that their Attractive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
render's 'em desirable. Those are the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs
of Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which while we outwardly put our trust the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of our Sins and Estates, we plunge our selves
into Misfortunes, and procure our own Deaths.
Nor be inamour'd of some little Stations, built in
the Air, at the request of him that with a haughty
Ostentation vaunts himself in a high Post. Since
both the Habitation and the Inhabitant, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
become the Sport of the Wind, and
the Game will end in an utter downfal. Your
prudence has no need of farther warning; and I
am oblig'd at length to put an end to this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

                              <pb n="333" facs="tcp:47413:178"/>The greatest Extravagance that I find in this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>(said Grave)</hi> is that the Writer made choice of
a <hi>Snail for the Post,</hi> at a time, when the wisest Men
set their Extravagancies a flying as swift as Pigeons.
In regard he was to make manifest certain Truths,
tho' under disguise <hi>(reply'd the Marquiss)</hi> he could
not will make use of any other <hi>Courier</hi> then a Snail,

For this reason <hi>(reply'd Chappel)</hi> it behov'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diter
of this Letter to fain himself a Fool, that not
being fit that others should discover the Truth; and
for Men of Iudgment, they lie under an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to conceal it, for fear of precipitating themselves
into the Indignation of Tyrant Princes. In confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to this, 'tis convenient that all honest Men

                           <p>I Am confounded when I consider the Sinister
Fame, which has acquired to our Sex the
Frauds of many Women, who with their Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
discredit the Sincerity of others. I am afraid,
that by comparing me with other Women, you
judge me a Dissembler in my Affection toward ye,
which denies me the Felicity of that mutual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
from your self which the Ardor of my
Love requires. Good God! Preserve me Heav'n,
from so great Misfortune. I will sooner not only
to be a Woman, but to be at all then prejudice my
desire of being belov'd. If I cannot separate from
the Degree of Woman the Imagination of Frauds
and Treachery, I will deprive my self Life, for
ever to abandon those Conditions, by which being
made an unfortunate Lover, I shall become more
miserable then the Damned. Beware, my only
Joy, of giving way to Ingratitude or Cruelty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of such a Belief, otherwise unjust,
while in the Purity of a faithful Mind common
Failings may easily be discover'd to be quite abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd.
Your Countenance may convince you, that
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:47413:179"/>
Treacheries are far remote from her that adores
ye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to sacrilegious, when they shall offend the
Divinity of that fair Person, for whose sake that
Woman must be without a Soul, that presumes to
live and yet despise you. By how much the less
frequent, by so much the more valuable is the Love
of a Woman, proportionable to the Objects that
enhaunce the Price, for want of Number. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
loves, can never fancy a Beauty which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be belov'd. I deem you unapt to conceive
the Vehemency of my Passions, which by labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Contemplation of your Countenance,
turn about my Soul to admire the Perfection of all
substantial Beings. Assure your self this Love
cannot be Female, that is to say inconstant, which
has for the Basis of it a Firmament of Stars;
such as are your Coelestial Beauties. The Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cannot be corrupted or consum'd, which has
for the Seat of it, the Heaven of your Face, and
for the Sphere wherein it moves, the Light of
your Vertue. Resolve then not to make me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of my Contentments, while you have reason
to hope for all the Satisfaction you can desire for
imploying the Ornaments of your Mind in loving
me. To which I would oblige ye under the pretence
of a Debt, with which the Fervency of my Soul
engages ye to a mutual Correspondence, while it
destroys itself in adoring ye. But I know a divine
Object cannot be obliged, nor the greatness of your
Merit be bound but with a Duty of Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to my Torments. From that it is, that I
beg the Cure of my Wounds, which as they were
inflicted by the Rays of your Beauty, so must they
be heal'd by the Excess of your Generosity.</p>

of their Bargaining with you, nor so prodigal
as to traffic to your loss. A moderate Post will be
more successful for you, it not being convenient for
you to be defective in that rigorous strictness, with
which you would have encounter'd a Man upon
your first setting up. The making good measure
is no Precept for your Trade; wherein the more
pinching you are, the more you will encrease your
Gains. Be sure to lay open always two Bundles;
the one of which being publickly laid upon the
Stall, may serve for ordinary Persons that have but
little Money to spend. The other you are not to
produce, but after many Intreaties, which assuring
you of a covetous and imperuous desire, may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
you your own price. To great Persons who
know the value of the Ware, and have where-withal
to pay, present your Bundle freely; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>
the profit will be greater, and the Risco less. To
vulgar People, or such as have no Judgment, and
know not the Price of such Counterband Goods,
offer such Cloth as uses to lie upon the Stall for
shew. However let both the one and the other be
well kept, so that whoever Trafficks with you may
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:47413:182"/>
not be offended with the sight of nothing but Moths
and Worms. And therefore you must always
keep your Shop clean and neat, not so much as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
a Spider's Web in the Room to accuse ye of
Slut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> corners. Let no Fools or Simpletons scape
ye, if you find they have Money in their Pockets,
for they are easily drawn in, and coax'd with good
words, so that you may squeeze 'em at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Use 'em tenderly, and have a particular piece
of Dalliance for them, being a sort of Fish, that
deserve a golden Hook. Banish all your Swash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucklers
in fine Cloaths, who carrying all they have
about 'em in spruce Habit, a lascivious Countenance,
and a lofty Behaviour, display their whole Riches
at once, within their Plumes of Feathers are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Wing together with their Brains; and their
Purses so light, that they may ride upon the Wind.
They are very expensive in Prittle-prattle, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
into Air, but affords nourishment to those
that hear it. That's no Coin for you, Daughter,
who are not to be so foolish in keeping your Fist
close, as if ye had lit upon a good Prey, when you
have nothing in your hand. There follows also
another prejudice, that they taking up so much room
in your Shop, hinder others that would be more
profitable, and perhaps would be trading with you
in private. Only you may endure such a piece of
impertinent Opportunity in a Person of Quality
who tho' he spends nothing, yet brings Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to your Shop. Many Widgeons run to the Net,
when they find Persons of Quality fallen into the
same Snares. When you meet such Persons, cry
up your good Fortune, for Ambition joyn'd with
Lasciviousness is a greater provocative to Expence.
As to what remains, dismiss every body with a

Expressions, but always the Rules of Interest are
to be preferr'd. Humble your self according to the
humour of all your Customers, with amorous and
winning Behaviour, but not so as to fall with a
slight push. Let your Friendship persist, as they
say, <hi>Vsque adaras.</hi> This Altar is to be your Bed;
to which when you come to conclude your Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
then laying aside all Courtesie, stand upon
the Rigor of your Contract. Let no body stir out
of your Shop till he has paid his Money. For that
your Trade will not permit ye to trust. You may
do well to keep some body in your Shop to carry
on your Trade in your absence, that so you may
not lose that sort of Pride, which is in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
requisite to keep up your Calling, by stooping
to some abject forms of dealing that betray the
Poverty of the Shopkeeper. To which purpose
you may keep a brisk Journey-woman, the sight of
whose Looks, will be as good as a Hook to catch
several Chance-customers. But let her not Trade
upon her own accompt by no means: For that
were the way to break in such a City as this. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one would be offering her his Stock to trade
withal, so that in a short time she would be able
to set up for herself, and get away all your Custom. I
remember no more at present that I can add to
help forward the good Success of your Trade. The
Experience of the Country, and Knowledge of
those that trade are two Points from whence you
may draw Instructions to carry on your own Trade,
by treading the Steps of common Custom. In
your Shop are bought and sold delightful Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities;
and the variety of Pleasures varies also the
Price. The Hook ought to be thrown with much
Artifice, and tho' it sometim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you are not therefore to drown your self by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Angling-Rod too long in your Hand, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

stronger than your self, through the Power of Love.
Avoid this Rock, the only cause of Shipwrack to
those that scowre the Seas of Lasciviousness to find

ye to the Light of the Gold, and the North-Star

                              <salute>Honour'd Sir,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>I Deem it a Debt of mine to impart to your
Worship every thing that concerns my Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
assuring my self that it will be very accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
news to your Worship to hear of the fortunate
Progresses of your Servant. The Wife of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rich Merchant in this City, having buried her
Husband some Months since, sent to me t'other day
some of her Friends to treat with me about joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Stock with hers. She is not willing to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
again, but desires only that our Interests may
go hand in hand. I accepted of the Offer, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:47413:187"/>
the advantageous Conditions that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.
I surrender'd to her all my Stock, with a
Covenant however that it was only barely lent,
and that I might call it in again at my pleasure,
without any loss or diminution: On the other side
she allow'd me the use of her Ware-house, of which
I was to keep the Keys my self; nevertheless with
Condition that I was to lock it and unlock it, when<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ever
she requir'd me. In the business and trouble
of Trade we have both an equal share, and they
that best manage it, enjoy the Fruits of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
without being oblig'd to complain that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
took pains in vain. She keeps the Money in
the Shop, that is paid to and fro in driving the
Trade, very careful in keeping it and giving me
my proportion from time to time. There arose a
difference between us, because I pretended by my
Contracts to the keeping the Key of a Press, that
stood behind the Shop, and where lay the Wares
of greatest value. Hitherto she has refus'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with me. Nevertheless I hope that in time
and by fair means and good words I shall obtain
the good Fortune which I so earnestly thirst after.
I assure you, Sir, I never tasted so much Felicity as
now I enjoy, being rais'd from my low Condition
to the unexpected Possession of so fair a Shop, and
no less wealthy; since Widows, after the Death
of their Husbands, growing more reserv'd in their
Expences, and abstaining from their wonted
Feasting and Jollity, lay up Money apace; and
therefore well fare the Man that is so lucky as to
share in their frugality.</p>
                           <p>I protest that I never penetrated the Rules of
driving a good Trade, before I came to practise
with this Partner of mine. I have learnt the way
of true Commerce, which must be carry'd on
with strict Covenants at first, to procure the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:47413:188"/>
to your self. Ceremonies are convenient
at the beginning, with some limits of Civility
which I know not how to express. Then again
the Merchandize requires, that when the Contract
is in a good Posture, that the Trade be pusht for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with all the Sedulity imaginable, never mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whither the other Party complain or no, as not
being content with the Bargain. Let the Trader
have always good Witnesses, to the end there may
be no failure in the Covenants. It behoves him
always to know the Disposition of the Person with
whom he Trades, and whither she be slow or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
he must be conformable. For then the
Business is likely to have a good Issue, when it comes
to be concluded by both Parties at the same time.
Otherwise their Interests languish, when the one
growing cool, refuses to encourage the Resolutions
of the other, with the Fomentations of recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Heat. There is no need of trading by dumb
Signs, nor to exceed in idle Twittle-twattle. Both
Words and Deeds are requir'd in this sort of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
and indeed 'tis a great Point gain'd to be
able to make use of the Lips and the Tongue. The
Advantage of a Trader, chiefly consists in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contented with a small gain, by stopping and
dealing only in one particular Commodity. Let
him always be turning and winding, and winding
and turning his Stock, for that great profit arises
by keeping his Cash in such perpetual Motion. I have
chiefly learnt, that 'tis the part of a good Trader,
not to be squeamish or nice in any manner of way,
for the defiling a Man's Hands is no detriment, when
the gain that comes of it is worth the while. Let
him that will trade lay aside all Scruples; since
they frequently become Bankrupt, that make not
the best of their Opportunities. Sometimes it
would not be amiss to make his Correspondent in
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:47413:188"/>
Trade a little drunk; for that in point of Trade a
Man is to turn and transform himself into every
shape: And then a little Wine turns to a great
profit, if you can get the Party to Seal new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
at the same time. When the Contract is
made let the Knot of Co-partnership be maintain'd
entire and firm. As to what remains, there is a
way to preserve your Friendship for Profit, by
Dissimulation, Caresses and several other laudable
Artifices and Deceits. Above all things let a
Trader beware, that he never leave in any other
Trade except his own, any more then the Money
which is usually expended in the Management of
such Affairs. These Documents I have learnt from
this Woman, who has sworn to me, that she will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
admit any Trader to enter her Shop, who trades
after any other manner: For which reason they
stoop their heads under the door it self, and the
more Money they offer the more she refuses to sell
'em her Wares, prosessing to prize the true Rules
of Commerce, above the Dictates of a greedy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice.
Others must of necessity count their gains
upon their Fingers; for that not knowing how to
trade, they are excluded out of her Shop. I am
endeavouring to meet her Genius, that I may be
able to deliver my self as well from the one as the
other inconvenience, that I may be Master of the
Shop at my own pleasure. If this same change of
my Condition may empowre me to serve your
Worship, I shall acknowledge a greater Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that good Fortune which enables me: And
so concluding most affectionately I kiss your
hands.</p>

                              <pb n="352" facs="tcp:47413:189"/>In good faith, <hi>(said Chappel)</hi> this same Spark, by
his trading with women, may chance at length to be
stript to his Skin: I know he shall have Wares in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
but not much to his satisfaction. You say
very true, <hi>(reply'd River)</hi> for Womens Shops are a
sort of Traps, into which he that enters, comes out
again with little advantage. They are so wide <hi>(re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
I)</hi> that there is a way for a man to come off
without a wound, if he make a good defence. Oh,
<hi>(said Grave)</hi> there is that Fire and Fury within, so
that there is no 'scaping some scurvy Impression or other.
You understand the Trade I see, <hi>(reply'd Chappel)</hi>
and therefore of necessity you must have more than once
have been a dealer in this sort of Merchandice. But
no more of this, lest we have the Women and their
Merchants about our Ears. Vpon which they fell a
reading the following Epistle.</p>

                           <p>I Understand by your last, the Resolution you have

and satisfie your Appetite without scandal. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
your design, as being proper for a man that

in his own House by his Industry. Add to this
the Necessities of your Brother, who as you write

                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

and infirm condition; or if he rise, 'tis with
an Appetite that must be fed with choice and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Viands, no way satisfied with ordinary Dyet.
These young Boys that you will have in your
House, with the Money they will offer ye to your
content, will afford ye the means to satisfie his De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sires,
as Brotherly Affection commands, especially
considering his condition. Nay, perhaps by their
diligent Service, and the Pastime of their Sports,
they will raise him from his Bed, and restore him
to a good state of Health. Now, because I know

                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

I thought it the Duty of my Affection
to lay ye down some Instructions drawn from the
Foundations of Experience, that you may not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
in the Road of your Employment.</p>
                           <p>In the first place, be sure not to take Children
that have hardly digested their Mothers Milk, as
the Saying is; for though they seem more fit to
suck from the Breasts of your sound Documents
every thing that is good and proper for their Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
yet their want of Capacity will not bend and
bow with that readiness, as a universal conformity
to every thing requires. They are more for kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
Tricks, than any thing of solidity, so that
you would receive into your House a Garboile of
Noise, a Confusion of Bawling, rather than the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Entertainments of Repose. And in regard you are
to feed 'em, it behoves ye to make choice of 'em
at those Years that they may have good Teeth to
chew a piece of Sinew-flesh, and gnaw a Bone,
otherwise being oblig'd to feed commonly with
Capons, Jellies, and such other Delicacies, they
will be rather a Loss than any Advantage to your
Purse. If it should happen sometimes, that you
must be forc'd to put their Meat i'their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> Mouths,
make you best of this <hi>Simplicity</hi> of theirs, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
trouble your self to teach them better, to the
end they may learn the particulars of all good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                           <p>Let 'em be of good Age, that they may be able
to dress and undress themselves, that you may not
be forc'd to keep a Servant to wait upon ev'ry one.
Let 'em be at Years of Discretion, that they may
know how to eat their Bread and their Meat asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And as for your part, be not wanting in <hi>your
Duty;</hi> take notice, in the first place, not to look
any one in the Face, but to keep alwaies behind
their Backs, taking care at the same instant that
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:47413:190"/>
they may receive your Commands. Order it so,
that first of all <hi>they</hi> may feel with their Hands the
point of the Doctrine which <hi>you</hi> desire to teach 'em,
that <hi>they</hi> may not be scar'd with the first Proposal
of a difficult Subject, hard to be understood; nor
obstinately persist on a resolution to make 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all of a sudden whatever <hi>you</hi> propound,
otherwise you will expose 'em to a necessity of
weeping and whining, as if <hi>they</hi> were quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.
Let 'em not therefore accustom themselves to
cry, and take on at the first sight of the Rod or
Cudgel, for this same over-timerousness is a Fault
that will never suffer <hi>ye</hi> to attain <hi>your</hi> ends. Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
Mildness and Discretion with him that has
not a Capacity answerable to the Talent which <hi>you</hi>
expend, insinuating at leisure, and by degrees,
what one would think they would never be able to
learn. Allow 'em Play and Pastime, that in the
greater heat of study <hi>they</hi> may be allur'd themselves
with some Delight; by which means <hi>they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi>
more ardently with <hi>your</hi> Desires, and will learn
from Custom to run and embrace <hi>your</hi> Doctrine.
Practice in publick the same usage with all: Let
<hi>your Partiality</hi> towards some be private, whom you
shall find to be more genteel in their Manners, and
more tractable to your Satisfaction. Exercise all
in general, or at least the better part, in regard
that by fixing alwaies behind one, it will be a great
trouble and vexation to <hi>him,</hi> and little profit to
<hi>your self.</hi> Endeavour to make 'em lively and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious,
to the end <hi>they</hi> may not receive what
<hi>you</hi> imprint into 'em, like Statues. Let 'em be of a
brisk airy Temper, that by managing 'em with a
tenderness, which is very delightful, <hi>they</hi> may be
willing to repeat to their Companions the Lessons
which <hi>you</hi> teach 'em. Your Brother also, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
the Kindnesses which <hi>they</hi> do him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:47413:191"/>
coaxing and flatt'ring 'em, may be very
useful in taming 'em by gentle means, if <hi>you</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

for Fools, and for him that never thinks to do

I was no sooner beheld, but many such-like Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or rather Fowlers, began to level their Arms

to serve me, so long as I staid in the City.
I retaliated these expressions of a Gentility, that
offer'd so much Kindness with Returns of affected
Thanks, protesting probable Excuses for the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
so much Honour, the more to be valu'd, by
how much the less deserv'd. On the other side
be continued his Importunities, resolv'd to fetter
me in a compliance with the person that sent him,
but I was as obstinate altogether, in denying to
correspond with his Indiscretion, so that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
with his Tail between his Legs, being fairly
given to understand, that he must find some other
Nest for his Master to lay his Eggs in than mine.
Heaven had no sooner deliver'd me from this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
but I was assail'd by a Pretender, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> in person to prey upon me, believing his
Servant not well grounded in the Curiosities that
belong'd to the Science. He spent a great deal of
time in many Ceremonies, wriggling himself in by
vertue of these, to feel my Hand, to squeeze it,
and to give me fair notice of what he would be
at. After several Enquiries to fish out my Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
my Country, and several other Particulars, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he enlarged his Discourse, to encrease
his familiarity, he endeavour'd to get me home to
his House, assuring me of all the kind Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I could expect. In a word, he pusht forward
his Complements, and his Protestations, as far as
they would go, but I repulsed him with a majestick
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>igor, which gave him to understand, that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of Reputation had spoil'd his Market, and
hinder'd his subduing me to his will. In short, I
left him with a Wen upon his Nose, to be clipp'd
off by other Sizzars than mine. I then found,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:47413:193"/>
that the Oh—Oh's—so frequently repeated
by the Inhabitants of this City, in their Discourse,
is a Tribute which, in speaking, they offer to the
itch of their <hi>Genius.</hi> I departed the next day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

made way to feel my Hands, and fastening me in
their Gripes, endeavour'd to fix me the mark of
their looser Imaginations.</p>
                           <p>I continu'd my Journey without any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Accident that befel me, but only the
want of <hi>Mony;</hi> and now I began to repent of my

to recant, whatever Inconveniencies I endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
I was two days Journey from <hi>Rome,</hi> unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
to go on, and in a worse condition to return.
One Evening, as I lay quite over-burthen'd with
the thoughts of this my deplorable condition,
through which I found my self necessitated to
pawn my self in the House where I was, a Company
of strowling Mendicants arriv'd there, to take up a
Lodging, for such I found 'em afterwards to be,
and thought my self a thousand times beholden to
Fortune for meeting with 'em. Some of these
compassionating my Sorrows, which appear'd in
my outward Behaviour, presently div'd into the
cause of my Grievances, and offer'd to ease me of
my Pains; I discover'd to 'em the bottom of my
Adversity, making the same use of my Tongue as
Dogs do, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ick all their Sores whole: They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
me civilly, assuring me Plenty of all
things, provided I would run the same Fortune
with them. Do you guess, Sir, now whether this
Offer of Bread were to be refus'd by one that was
like to starve: I subscribed to any Condition which
my Necessity demanded: Besides that, the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:47413:193"/>
of a luxurious Life, such as that <hi>Canaille</hi> leads,
was sufficient to entice me forward. So I leagu'd
my self to them, and in their company got to
<hi>Rome,</hi> still more and more contented that I had
hapned into the Society of a jolly sort of People,
who liv'd a happy and a merry Life, though
their Profession were ignominous. I was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the first Evening into their Convocation-house,
where the Miracles of the Lame that were cur'd,
the Blind that recover'd their Sight, maim'd Limbs
that were set streight, were so numerous that they
amaz'd me. When every one had offer'd me a
part of his Gain, there was a new Scene, while
laying aside their palled Countenances, and strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
off their Rags, they made up a whole Act of a
Comedy, divided into Periods of Musick and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and the Epilogue of a delicious Supper.</p>
                           <p>They propos'd to me several Employments to
make me an idle Minister of their Profession; and
finding I was not cut out for Stealing, and as little
given to Lying, besides that, I was but little skill'd
in their canting Gibbrish, they set me to an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
whererin a dumb man might have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to promote their Interests. For my first
initiation therefore, I was to be one of those who
counterfeiting themselves lame, were to pick the
Pockets of the compassionate. Early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Elders of the Society adorn'd me with the
Ensigns of their Calling, honouring me with a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
which was a tatter'd Standard, in ostentation of
their Trophies, then bending my right Arm, they
bound it to my Shoulders, and with I know not
what mishmash of Paste, which they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they laid such a Plaister upon my Elbow, as
made People believe the rest of my Arm had been
newly wounded; and after they had bedaub'd my
left Leg after the same manner, they made it look
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:47413:194"/>
like a Pedestal of Sores and Ulcers; afterwards with
Swaths and ragged Clouts they made up a Figu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e,
where Beggary was compassionated, if the Disease
it se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>f were not pittied; and lastly, perfuming my
Cheeks with Brimstone Smoak, they made me look
as if I had escaped out of a Sepulchre; you would
have thought, at least, that Death had pursu'd me,
as a Prey that had fled from his clutches, while I
look'd more like one that lay expiring, than like a
living Creature. Lastly, my Hair towz'd, and
staring as if it had never been comb'd time out of
mind, they turn'd under a nasty Linnen Bag, as
black as a piece of smoak'd Bacon. And thus they
drest me up in the shape of Horror, a Spectacle ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to fright Folks, than move their Pity. After
all this, I had my Post assigned me at the Door of a
Church, whither I went, but fail'd the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of my Companions, while I met with an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that drew me into utter despair: The Blushes
of my Shame, to see my self become so desp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>cable
out of a Humour, surpassed the Artifices of my
counterfeit paleness, so that there was something
of Gentility to be discover'd through the dreadful
disguise of my Cheeks: In my Countenance also
there was something of a lively aire and a juvenile
briskness in my Eyes, which accus'd the Falshood
of those resemblances of Mortality: Presently a
great man, as he went to hear Mass with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Train at his Heels, cast an Eye upon me, and
by and by, as it were in contemplation of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
fixing his Looks more seriously upon me,
survey'd all the parts of my Countenance, where
his Appetite found the desirable Conditions which
his Satisfaction sought for; which done, with half
a glance and a smile, he mark'd me out to one of
his Attendants, one, without question, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the nature of those Delights, which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:47413:194"/>
used to put in practise; and with that, with a
majestick seriousness on his Face, as if it had been
an effect of his Compassion and Charity, he gave
order to have me carried to his own Palace,
commanding his Servants to be very careful of
me, and seeming extreamly desirous to restore me
to my Health. I saw my self now caught in a
Trap, where I could not avoid the surprize of an
Act of Charity, that came too quick upon me. The
Commands of the Grandee were performed, who
designed me to digest a hardness that lay upon his
Stomach, which was not to be concocted without
a fomentation of young Flesh. I was laid upon
soft Feathers, the more to assure me, that the
Master would not have disdain'd the softness of the
same Bed. I knew not how to brazen out these
Dangers, but by heightning Pains with Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that would have brought the Damned about
me, while I made People believe my Torments
were worse than theirs. Every time they touch'd
me, though never so slightly, I cry'd out, <hi>Oh my
Arm! Oh my Leg!</hi>—as if I had been stark wild.
By that means I was in hopes of getting off, by
being troublesome, to the end the impertinence of
my Crys and Exclamations might have delivered
me from that Entanglement. And I was in a fair
way to have enjoy'd the good Success of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
for that the Servants, quite tyred out with
my bellowing and yawling, endeavour'd to have
been rid of me, saying, that I was a Disturbance
to the Family, and an Annoyance to all the
House.</p>
                           <p>But the Affection of the Grand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>e prevented this
good luck of mine, who at his return <hi>honour'd</hi> me
with a Visit in his own person. He reinforc'd his
Commands, which were to redouble their diligence,
in supplying whatever I wanted. And he had a
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:47413:195"/>
fresh Argument to invite him to be more amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
fond of me, while the opportunity of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
naked in Bed, presented to him, in some parts
of my Body, such a whiteness, as made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he should have a good Meal, when he came

Remedies. Then was the chief point of
all my Distresses, which I knew would reduce me
to a necessity of discovering the Fraud that confin'd

to the Hospital, where my Infirmity being attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to Nature or Chance, I might have got off
upon less-troublesom Conditions. I affirm'd, that my
Sores not being accustomed to lenitive Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
would but grow angry, and be the more
festered by unwonted Applications. On the other

a bit to swallow at the request of his greedy Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite:
He went with the state and train of a <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liero,</hi>
and in a garb that shew'd him to be newly
come to Town. He spoke with the Master of the
House, and gave him an account of my flight, and
the infamous Crew with which I had leagu'd my self,
that is to say, as far as he could understand, with
a Herd of strowling Mendicants, who had drest
him up in that habit of Sickness and Infirmity, to
delude the Affections of devout Compassion. He
gave him to understand the nobility of my Birth,
adding withal great importunities to have me back
along with him, to rechear my Father, who had
been almost overwhelmed with Sorrow ever since
my flight. The Grandee was all in an amaze, and with
courteous Replys conducted the Knight to the
Lodging where I lay tormented even to despair:

with what he said, and blushing not a little to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
my Miscarriage, I endeavour'd to walk along
the Room; I recover'd my Arm, let loose my Leg,
and dishevell'd my confused Locks, entangling so
much the more the Affections of the Grandee, who
repented he had not bestowed his Charity sooner
upon me, as lame as I was, that he might have
boasted the satisfaction of his Desires; for when I
came to discover my self, lovely as I was, in a full
vivacity of Youth, disguised under false appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he felt the stings of an extraordinary compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
for having neglected an opportunity so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
offer'd to tast upon my Table the Pleasures
which he so earnestly thirsted after. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to have detained me, but my feigned Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was importunate for my departure the same
day, urging it for a main Argument, that he would
not prolong my Father's Sorrows. On the other
side, the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

obtain'd me one advantage more, which
was the change of a noble Suit of Clothes for my
Tatters, which the Grandee presented me, under
pretence, that it was not fit for me to appear before
my Father in Rags, and Mony in both Pockets, to
carry me home. And thus the poor silly Gull was
meerly trapann'd, as indeed he truly deserv'd, since
his self-ended Charity tended meerly to the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his own forbidden Pleasures. Being thus
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:47413:196"/>
got loose from the Grandee, I slipp'd my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and hastened out of <hi>Rome</hi> with all the hast I
could, and am now at home once more under my
Father's Wings. I hope you will not be offended
with the prolixity of this relation, since you may
boast to have recover'd a Servant, of whose conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

then where I am, 'tis but sending your Commands

Acts of Charity which are us'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by

                           <p>THis is no longer any Country for us. The
Thieves, who in <hi>Paris</hi> have too many Rivals,
and Spriggs of our Profession, <hi>sprout</hi> forth there in
great abundance, that it behoves us to stand upon
our defence, for <hi>fear of being rob'd our selves,</hi> rather
than to be watching opportunities to despoll others.
We must observe the common Precept, to give way
to our Superiors, or else we must certainly depart,
since we are much inferiour in this Art to the
<hi>French</hi> Citizens themselves; <hi>Experienc'd Locusts</hi> of
the Country, that cease not to devour Forreigners
in those Fields, where formerly I know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Spring or we were most merry,</hi> and rejoyced
most at our Purchases. I assure ye, I cannot keep
this Post assigned me by my Companions, for that
the Besiegers multiply, and being more ready at
Surprizes than my self, frustrate all my Designs. I
am resolv'd to depart, being afraid they will <hi>rob
me of my Halter,</hi> which however I shall willingly
resign among 'em, to the end I may freely leave
'em that Reward, which they so earnestly labour
to gain, by the <hi>multiplication of their Thefts.</hi> I

exercise themselves in <hi>robbing others,</hi> to repair their
Losses, or at least to preserve themselves from sinking

that in the Cities under the Dominion of this French
King, the Profession of Thieves flourishes in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and the exercise of Rapines; so that he may
well boast that his Vassals are as good as himself.
They have before 'em <hi>(said Grave)</hi> the Examples of
their Lord, or at least of his Ministers; so that they
would be much to be blamed, if they did not conform
as Subjects to the grand Exemplar of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>

was not perceiv'd, I made the Post of my Ambush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where I was to lye in wait to fulfil the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of my desires. After Supper, during which
I had administer'd a <hi>Somniferous Drink,</hi> which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
me I should not be molested by the vigilancy
of my Rival, they retir'd to the Entertainments of
that night, which I was to employ in my Pleasures.
Silently I convey'd my self to my own Post, not
with any thoughts of taking rest: I listen'd to all
their Discourse, which made me but so much the
more eager after the forbidden Fruit, while she
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:47413:199"/>
                              <hi>wanting the Fidelity of her Chastity,</hi> and he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the <hi>Iealousie of his Affection,</hi> my mind
suggested to me so much the greater Glory from
my Enterprize, to triumph over both. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
began to work its effects, tho' but slowly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Husband, so that preventing his Wife in
undressing himself, he also fell asleep before her.
Then lifting up the Curtain of the Tapestry, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
upon the Stage where I desir'd no Spectators.
I put my self in the middle between the Husband
and the Wife, and deem'd it an Undertaking sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
Glorious to enjoy a Lady in the same Bed
with her Husband, in derision of the <hi>jealous Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>
of the one, and in scorn of the <hi>profess'd
Chastity</hi> of the other.</p>
                           <p>The next Morning I went a Hunting with the
Husband, whom I had order'd to be wak'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
and when I return'd I try'd my Fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the City, laughing at the Jealousie of her
Husband, which was such that I could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
my self to succeed in my undertaking by any
other then <hi>delusive means.</hi> One day discoursing
with him, and protesting to be the most cordial
Servant he had in the World, I gave him a most
devilish false Testimony of my faithful Friendship,
by discovering to him a Design, as I pretended, of
some Gentlemen to enter his House by Night, and
violently to ravish from his Bosom his dear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

Wife, so much the more enamour'd of her
Beauty, by how much they saw him so chary of her.
The next night said I to this, is appointed for the
Execution of this Design; which put the good
Man into such a <hi>Confusion of Mind,</hi> that he stood
still as if he had been Thunder-strock. Nor could
ye blame him; for indeed, 'twas no less then the
loss of a Treasure that was his <hi>very Heart</hi> which
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:47413:200"/>
made him lead a careful Life, for fear least
any other should share in his Happiness.</p>
                           <p>To me therefore as his <hi>Oracle,</hi> he betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and begs me that I would be the <hi>propitious Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
who as I had made known the threatning
Mischief, would also prevent the danger. I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him exact secresie, so that no body in the
House, no not his Wife should know of the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But least the Lady might have any suspicion
I order'd him to undress himself as he was wont
to do, and go to Bed to her, but after <hi>she was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep,</hi>
to slip out of the Bed, and to come where
I would stay for him, with a remedy proper to
prevent the danger. Now you must know there are
<hi>two Doors to the House,</hi> one to the Street, the other
at a good distance from it leading into a Garden
encompass'd with a Wall. Thither in the Dusk of
the Evening I conveigh'd certain Fellows well
arm'd, with one part of which I set the <hi>Husband</hi>
there to watch, remaining with the rest to secure
the <hi>Street door,</hi> so that we might he certain to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
both Entrances; and they that were assign'd
to the Garden Post, had orders not to stir till. I
gave 'em the Sign. All things being dispos'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

went I, with a <hi>dark Lanthorn</hi> in my hand, enter'd

his Lady was, and robb'd him of all that could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich

was soon sensible of the difference of my Voice,
which I conceal'd before, either by my silence, or
falsifying the Tone of it in short Accents. Which
now being let loose to their <hi>natural Tone</hi> discover'd
that I was not her Husband; at first she began to
cry out, as if she had been betray'd, making a
<hi>heavy Stir,</hi> according to the <hi>Custom of her Sex,</hi>
not able to satisfy their Anger or Revenge by
force.</p>
                           <p>I leapt out of the Bed, and putting my self full
in the Light, I offer'd my Life to attone her fury.
I held the Lanthorn in one hand, and my Dagger
in the other, with the point turn'd upon my
breast, showing my resolution to strike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if she
<hi>refus'd me her Compassion.</hi> For certain, said I, this

                           <p>Our further Discourses were interrupted by a
Noise occasion'd by the Motion of armed Men.
For that certain Persons coming to the <hi>little Door

Guard in an uproar. And this gave credit to all
my Fictims, while the Husband thought them, to
have been the <hi>Thieves</hi> that were come to rob him
of his <hi>Perian Wealth.</hi> And I forsook my Beatitude,
to hasten to his assistance, of which there was no

                           <p>I Have unplum'd the Bird: I send it your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
together with another of my own, tho' of
mother sort, to the end you may pull off the Skin.
The Suit so tediously by me prolong'd as it was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
to the end I might squeeze it as long as there
was any thing coming, is now at last sent back by
the Gentleman you know of to yonder place. I
consign the Handling of it to you, as well for the
sake of our ancient Friendship, as also, to the end
that lighting upon an Advocate more discreet then
I, he may have no Cause to complain of my Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Be mindful also of my Interests, and when
you have <hi>flead off the Skin,</hi> send it me back again
if possible, that I may try my Wits to pick the
Bones of it: And so concluding, I must affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
kiss your hands.</p>
                           <p>See <hi>(said Summer)</hi> how some of these Beasts of
Advocates use their Clients, like Tennis-balls, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'em from Post to Pillar, and tossing them back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and forward, till they are quite out of breath.</p>
                           <p>Rather <hi>(said River)</hi> till they see their very Skins
hang in Rags about their Bodies. And therefore
'twas well said of one, that <hi>suits were the Hell of
this World;</hi> since there cannot be found more spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:47413:204"/>
Devils then some Advocates, who with a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Cruelty squeeze their Clients till they press out
the Blood. In short <hi>(said I)</hi> He that made Mercury
the God of Sciences, and the God of Thieves both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
had an eye only upon those Men, whose knowledge
only serves 'em to ravish and steal. This is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Truth <hi>(replied Grave)</hi> and therefore needs no
other Comments. And so a new Letter was open'd
to be read.</p>

                              <hi>At a little Table apart behind these, stood a</hi> High
German, <hi>who had dish'd up a great number of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sorts of Pottage, upon which</hi> Apollo, <hi>in a kind
of chase cried out,</hi> Surely this fellow thinks we are
in a Convent of <hi>Franciscans.</hi> With submission to your
Majesty, <hi>said the Assistant,</hi> this is a Nation that
knows not how to make any thing that is good, and
therefore their sole profession is to be drunk. Let him
herd with the <hi>Scullions</hi> in the Kitchin, <hi>replied his
Majesty,</hi> he'l make a Cook good enough for them.</p>
                           <p>So saying, he passed on to view a great Table
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

notice, that he wonder'd at the number; <hi>These</hi>
(said he) <hi>are Romances of the learned Italians;</hi>
which under the Covert of simple Paste included
the solid Substance of <hi>hidden wisdom in fabulous
Dress;</hi> and this sort of Writing has acquired so

every <hi>Tuscan Writer. Apollo,</hi> curious to penetrate
into the nature of these Pies, and to measure their
Encomiums and Condemnations by the Rule of
Reason, caus'd some to be cut up, but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
one, which outwardly made a shew, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the <hi>principal Credit</hi> which it h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Person that presented it, and assigning it for a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Dainty, exalted it above all the rest; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
thought to have found some most delicate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient,
not knowing the Person to be no less vain-glorious
than ignorant; but the Meat within it was
only Beef, which felt so hard at first, that it might
have been easily taken for a piece of an old Bull.
The Arrogance of the Person provok'd <hi>Apollo</hi> to that
degree, that he caus'd the Pye, Pye-plate and all, to
be thrown away, and the Cook to be punish'd, for
his Presumption. <hi>Here is another piece of Beef of the
same sort,</hi> quoth the Assistant. <hi>Let 'em both,</hi> replied
his Majesty, <hi>be given to the Hoggs.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <pb n="386" facs="tcp:47413:206"/>His Majesty was curious to see the <hi>Intrails</hi> of
another, which shewing withoutside the Head, Tail,
and Wings of a Partridge, made him believe that
the Fowl within was a precious Bit; but he was
much deceiv'd, for the inside contain'd no more
than Fish. <hi>How!</hi> cry'd <hi>Apollo, what means this
fellow, to promise us a Bird, and give us Fish? These,</hi>
said the Assistant, <hi>are a sort of people that promise in
their Romances</hi> Historical Truth, <hi>and good Sence, to

discover'd to be full of Fables and Parabolical Mish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mashes,
wherein if there be any one particular
Truth, it changes both its Substance and its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                           <p>There was another which made a great shew, but
with several Lidds one above another, of <hi>Episodis</hi>
and fiddle-faddles, so that there was hardly any
coming to see what was in it: But at last they made
a shift to cut it up, and found it so full of <hi>Abstrus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>From hence he went to visit the Preparations of
the <hi>Butchers Meat,</hi> where he found little satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the boil'd Meats were altogether insipid,
and so black, as if they had been in <hi>Mourning</hi> for
the deceased Merits of the persons that cook'd 'em.
They were so <hi>homely and slovenly</hi> order'd, as if they

said his Majesty, <hi>publishers of new Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they must not think to introduce such Disorders

otherwise it had been impossible to find him, tho'
he lay before their Noses. Such are the <hi>Writings</hi>
of those that multiply <hi>Digressions</hi> and <hi>Repetitions,</hi>
and frequently use obscure Sentences, by which
means they build up <hi>a heap of Confusions</hi> rather
than <hi>Periods:</hi> So that whatever is good in 'em, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of which the greatest part was <hi>blood-raw,</hi> and the
reason of it was, because they had laid down too
much at a time; and moreover, by reason of the
disproportion of the Joynts: So that some were
parched up to that degree, that a Hatchet would not
enter 'em. There were several <hi>Sawces</hi> prepar'd
for these Dishes, two sorts of which would have
been very well approv'd, if the stink of the Steam
had not render'd it nauseous at a distance, and that
the other at first sight had not appear'd too <hi>full of
Salt,</hi> so that his Majesty was constrained to say,
That <hi>surely that same fellow had the</hi> Palate of a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold,
<hi>and had season'd it to his Appetite; he can
have no Salt in his Brains that has put it all in his

                           </p>
                           <p>While he was continuing his visitation, he saw a
great steam, which rising from a Platter, hinder'd
him from seeing what was in it. <hi>Ne'er trouble your
self, an't please your Majesty,</hi> said the Assistant, <hi>to
satisfie your Curiosity, for this Dish is the Composition
of a good Wit, but so full of Ambition, that no body
can endure to see him, not so much as in his Works.</hi>
So that with the Steam of that Pride he darken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

those Lusters which otherwise would be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
his Merit; his Majesty therefore would have
this Dish exterminated from his Table, abhorring
such a Pride that made a man stand in his own
light.</p>
                           <p>At the same time there was presented to <hi>Apollo</hi>
a certain <hi>Cook,</hi> who by his being in his Drawers,
and by his sweating, shew'd himself to have been
hard at work. He had once been happy in making
some Fritters, which got him great Applause.
'Twas thought tho, that he had stoln 'em from some
body else, because he never could produce the like
in other Works of his of the same nature. When
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:47413:207"/>
his Majesty beheld him low of stature, deformed in

he, <hi>this is some Bum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

along with him, just ready to go to the Oven, for
that having heard but late of <hi>Apollo's Commands,</hi> he
he had not time to bake it, but only to make it up.
He farther told his Majesty, that he came to shew it
his Majesty, that he might be assur'd of one <hi>substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Dish.</hi> Then he began a <hi>Series of Encomiums,</hi> which
begot a greater Scorn of his Presumption than
Admirations of his Parts. But the Pye being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd

                           <p>I Know that my Family has always acknowledg'd
all the Avancement it has enjoy'd to have been
<hi>founded</hi> upon the Favours receiv'd from your self.
And therefore, that the Obligations of my <hi>Posterity</hi>
may continue in the <hi>same Channel,</hi> I have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to address my self to your Worship upon
this <hi>lucky Opportunity</hi> that presents it self for the
t'other Advancement of my Fortunes. By a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of my acquaintance, I understand that the
<hi>Employment of publick Hangman</hi> is like to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
by the Death of the present Incumbent, who
I hear lies very sick. I desire to succeed in that
<hi>Important Preferment:</hi> Nor could I promise my self
the hopes of obtaining my desires by the Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of any other Person then your Worship,
whose Power and Authority I know to be more
then sufficient to Honour me with this Promotion,
and the <hi>wonted Effects of whose Generosity</hi> are still
the same as ever. I shall expect this Honour as
great as it is, as one that will be always most
ready to <hi>exchange Favour for Favour,</hi> with this

reserve, that it be within the reach of my Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;

                           <p>Had he written <hi>(said Church)</hi> with this reserve,
that it be within the Verge of my Profession, it had
been a genteel Promise to hang his Friend upon the
first Opportunity. What a happy Conclusion is this!
<hi>(quoth they, laughing altogether)</hi> for they were now
at last to discover the Trafficquing of such a noble
Ambition. Never wonder at it <hi>(said I)</hi> for such
Dignities as these, find many Competitors in every
Country. Some years ago I was in <hi>Milan,</hi> when a
Vacancy of this nature fell, I understood that there
were presented to the Senate no less then eighteen
Petitions of Pretenders to the Place.</p>

                           <p>I Send you the Picture of the Lady, who gain'd
that Authority over ye, as to be the absolute
Mistress of your Affections, while you staid in
<hi>London:</hi> Thus you see the performance of your
Commands which you laid upon me at your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I know not whither you will be so faithfully
serv'd by the Limner, as I have endeavour'd to
serve you my self. The Art deserves to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
if it mistook in drawing into a small Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
a Face, wherein Nature her self had epitomiz'd
all Perfection. Those Beauties cannot be contain'd
in a small piece of Brass, for which the whole
Compass of the Sun's Sphere is too narrow.
That Heaven can never be describ'd without a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of adding the Motto of Heaven it self,
<hi>Pulchriora Latent;</hi> since no Pencil can express that
Beauty by which the possibility of any greater
Beauty is quite extinguish'd. In Pictures the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
give Life to the Colours, but how can Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
here appear in the Face of the Sun. There
can be no proper Air provided for this Likeness,
for that being Angelical, it enjoys no other Sun,
but that of Paradise. Let your Worship but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

the transcendent Value of her Heart, and your
Will she could not be drawn more artfully, since a
divine Object ill suits with the Workmanship of a
terrestrial Hand. Pity the Painter, who could not
outdo himself, muchless surpass Nature and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
