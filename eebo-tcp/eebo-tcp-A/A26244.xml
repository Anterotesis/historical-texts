         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Early beloved not to make any long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, or to uſe many circumlocutions but to fall aboard with my text, theſ words are not litterally to be vnderſtood but typically for this is a prophetique ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Mr. that their ſhall be many in the latter dayes that ſhall have no eares but looſe them for the teſtimony of a good conſcience, and for the Goſpels ſake, of which ſort I and my other brethren which ſuffered with me are three, diſtempred and diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred members. Yet beloved ſiſter miſtake me not I doe not mean diſmembred in my principall member, the virge of generation, no this might well have gotten a loathing in you toward me, but is the loſſe of the tips of my eares.</p>
            <p>There are many have eares to heare beaſtly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaine tailes, ſongs, and ballads with a great deale of contentation, and think not this time long or ill ſpent, but they have no eares to heare of piety and godlineſſe, they thinkean houre a day, and a day 7 yeares yea they lock vp the dores of their eares, you may ſee their long locke hang over them, they have no eares to heare of the foure Cardinall virtues.
<pb facs="tcp:64634:3"/>
And here I cry the Lord hearty mercy, and it would have made my eares to tingle (if I had them) that I ſhould ſo farre over-ſhoot my ſelf, to approve vertues to be Cardinalls, when I will by no meanes allow men to be Biſhops, as Fortitude, Temperance, &amp;c. And heere again I cry the Lord hearty mercy, that I ſhould once name or mention that brand of the Beaſt on the neere Buttock, that &amp;c. which wee ſo ſolemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and damned with their new Synodokical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons by the Common hang-man; but here wee ſee, though the ſpirit is willing, the fleſh is weake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare,</hi> is meant by the eares of the new man, for there are many walke altogether after the fleſh, the new man is hardly yet in the Embrio, it hath neither forme nor eares, to theſe as yet it is not given to heare or underſtand the hid my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, &amp;c. and here alſo Idolatry is utterly aboliſhed; Thoſe muſt be prayed unto, that have eares to heare our prayers, but Idolls have no eares to heare, <hi>ergo</hi> they muſt not be prayed unto, the Minor is proved by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infallible and undeniable text, they have eares, and heare not, eyes and ſee not, and theſe Gloſſes I take to be the true and genuine ſence of the text.</p>

            <p n="4">4 <hi>Vſe.</hi> Of comfort, dearely beloved, that I make, is this, from the not making away, or burying of my eares (and indeed I had intreted them, but that the wicked ſhould not thinke I did mourne and make a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall for the loſſe of my eares) and therefore I ſay, I have preſerved them, and have made open reioycing for the loſſe thereof, and ſince God hath endowed them with great vertue, that I have miraculouſly done many
