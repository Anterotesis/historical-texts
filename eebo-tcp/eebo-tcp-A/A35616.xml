            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The CASE of</hi> John Burke, <hi>Second Son to</hi> William, <hi>late Earl of</hi> Clanricard, <hi>and of his Six Sons; Humbly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Conſideration of the Honourable the</hi> Houſe of Commons.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>WIlliam,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Clanricard,</hi> long before the late Troubles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> did ſettle and limit part of his Eſtate to the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> for Life, Remainder Intail Male to his eldeſt and every other Son ſucceſſively.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> was a Collonel in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, and taken Priſoner at the Battel of <hi>Aghrim,</hi> yet, on the Treaty for the Surrender of <hi>Gallway,</hi> on Application made by the now Earl of <hi>Clanricard,</hi> (the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi>'s Brother) then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and Commander in chief in the ſaid Town, (and by the reſt of the Garriſon) the Earl of <hi>Athlone,</hi> then His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's General there, did promiſe, that the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> ſhould have the Benefit of the Capitulations then to be made for the ſaid Town, and ſhould enjoy his Eſtate; and the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi>'s Regiment being then Garriſon'd in the ſaid Town, in his Favor an expreſs Article was incerted in the ſaid Capitulations, That all abſent Officers belonging to any Regiment then in <hi>Gallway</hi> ſhould enjoy the Benefit of the ſaid Capitulations, in caſe they ſubmitted to his Majeſty's Government; and Aſſurances were given by the Earl of <hi>Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> that notwithſtanding the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> was then a Priſoner of War, yet he ſhould have the Benefit promiſed to abſent Officers; on Notice whereof the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Enlargement, took the Oath of Allegiance, and ever ſince continued very Dutiful to his Majeſty's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>This notwithſtanding, the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> could obtain no Adjudication, by Virtue of the ſaid Articles, for that the Commiſſioners for hearing of Claims were by their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and by an Act of Parliament paſſed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the very Letter of the ſaid Articles, that they could not allow him the Benefit of the Earl of <hi>Athlone</hi>'s Promiſe.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> being informed that his Eſtate was to be granted to one <hi>Neale,</hi> in Truſt for the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> he came for <hi>England,</hi> apply'd himſelf to the ſaid Earl; and as an Inducement for his waving to paſs a Grant of the ſaid Eſtate, and for recommending the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> to His Majeſty for a Grant of the ſame, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Educate his Sons in the Proteſtant Religion, to ſell his Eſtate to Proteſtants, and to give all further Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ſhould be required of his Willingneſs to contribute to the Eſtabliſhment of a Proteſtant Intereſt in that part of the Country he lived in, and likewiſe propoſed to pay 7500 <hi>l.</hi> to be received out of the Profits of the ſaid Eſtate, as a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the ſaid Earl's waving to paſs his ſaid Grant as aforeſaid; to which, the ſaid Earl having agreed on the aforeſaid Terms, and His Majeſty being informed how much the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi>'s Compliance in the Education of his Children would conduce to the Eſtabliſhment of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Intereſt, and to the Peace and Safety of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and being ſatisfied of the Promiſe given by the Earl of <hi>Athlone,</hi> and having conſidered the many and great Services perform'd by the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi>'s Anceſtors to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> ſince the firſt Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that this was the firſt time that any of the Family was guilty of any Treaſon againſt the Kings or Queens of <hi>England,</hi> was graciouſly pleaſed to conſent that the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> ſhould be reſtored to his Eſtate, and for that end has ſent his Royal Warrants into <hi>Ireland</hi> for pardoning the ſaid <hi>John Burke,</hi> and for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Eſtate to ſome one in Truſt for the Support of him and his Proteſtant Children; but no Grant or Pardon is yet paſſed, in regard that this Honourable Houſe, before any Grant could paſs, appointed Commiſſioners for Inſpecting into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forfeitures, and out of reſpect to the Proceedings of this Honourable Houſe, the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> waved paſſing any Grant.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> has a Wife, Six Sons, and Two Daughters; the two eldeſt of his Sons are bred in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and are now at School in <hi>Eaton-Colledge,</hi> and the reſt of his Sons, as ſoon as of Years to be ſent abroad, he intends to educate after the ſame manner; and for his and their Support, has nothing, if his Eſtate be now Diſpoſed of, and he Deprived of His Majeſty's intended Mercy and Favor.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi>'s Forfeiture is found by Inquiſitions in the ſeveral Counties where the Eſtate lies, to be only for his Life, and that his Sons are in Remainder to the ſame.</p>
            <p>In Pity therefore for the ſaid Infants, who are the next Males to the Eſtate and Earldom of <hi>Clanricard,</hi> and who are to enjoy this Eſtate after their Father's Deceaſe, and who in the mean time muſt want Bread and Education if the Eſtate be now Diſpoſed of, and in regard to the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi>'s Right of being reſtored as aforeſaid, 'tis hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hoped that this Honourable Houſe will exempt the ſaid Eſtate from the Diſpoſitions intended by the Bill relating to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forfeitures, and will either reſtore the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> to the ſame, or leave him to paſs a Grant purſuant to the ſaid Warrant, as to this Honourable Houſe ſhall ſeem moſt proper; and this the rather, for that in former Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, Grants to the Parties forfeiting were taken to be in the Nature of Reſtitutions, and therefore always exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and tho' the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi>'s Grant is not actually paſſed, yet ſince the paſſing was waved out of reſpect to this Honourable Houſe, 'tis humbly hoped the ſame will not turn to his Prejudice.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Honourable the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commiſſioners have reported, That it would be much for the Proteſtant Intereſt, if the ſaid Eſtate were Leaſed to Proteſtants, the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> is willing to Leaſe the ſame accordingly.</p>
            <p>And leſt the Diſappointments the ſaid <hi>John Burke</hi> met in the Ways propoſed for his Reſtitution to his ſaid Eſtate, as the Honourable the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commiſſioners have reported, ſhould blemiſh his preſent Application, he humbly craves Leave to inform this Honourable Houſe, That the ſaid Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did not happen out of any Prejudice to the ſaid <hi>John Burke,</hi> (whoſe Caſe and Condition all People allow to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Compaſſion,) but by Reaſon of Objections ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt the manner propoſed for his Relief.</p>
