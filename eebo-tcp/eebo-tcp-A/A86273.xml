            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe mighty Hand of the great God hath been ſtretched out againſt your Enemies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending you and your Forces, whileſt you have been proſecuting the Peoples Liberty, Publique Good and Intereſt of his People; amongſt whom he hath, he doth, he will manifeſt his Preſence: And as all your Forces hath abundance of Experience therein, ſo thoſe in <hi>Ireland</hi> wants not large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Teſtimonies thereof. The ſeveral Accompts you have received, giveth your Servants cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in, and depending upon our Lord for his Mercies exerciſed with and amongſt them: And as in other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of our God, this day, and his Preſence with the preſent motion of your Servants here, doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proclaim his Goodneſs. The Counties of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meath, Cavan</hi> and <hi>Longford</hi> perſiſting in Rebellion, and the Enemy raiſing Forces in thoſe parts, and endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to form a conſiderable Army there; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting thereof, and to reduce the ſaid Counties, I marched from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the parts adjacent, with 1600 Foot and 700 Horſe the 24 of <hi>February</hi> laſt: when I was about <hi>Tecroghan,</hi> I had notice the Enemy in the Kings County, with Three thouſand Horſe and Foot, was diſtreſſing one of the Gariſons, I marched imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to <hi>Terrels</hi> Paſs for its Relief; but Commiſſary General <hi>Reynolds</hi> had removed that Enemy with a party
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165825:3"/>
from about <hi>Kilkenny.</hi> I upon notice thereof marched towards <hi>Mullingar,</hi> where we found reſiſtance by a Caſtle called <hi>Kilbridge,</hi> which was preſently reduced; wherein Two hundred Barrels of Corn was found, and kept for your Service. When I came to <hi>Mullingar,</hi> the Enemy did quite deſert and leave <hi>Erleſtown,</hi> and burned the former, both of which I have now Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd for you, as alſo <hi>Mullingar.</hi> Whileſt I was there, I heard from Commiſſary General <hi>Reynolds,</hi> who had taken by Storm <hi>Donmore</hi> in <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> wherein was near One thouſand Barrels of Corn: I preſently rid over unto him, where we both adviſed to Fortifie and Gariſon <hi>Ballemore,</hi> a very conſiderable place, which the Enemy had ſlighted. I ſent thither Colonel <hi>Fouck</hi> with his Regiment, and Commiſſary General came thither with his Foot, and they have made up the Works, and made it tenable, and ſecured it for you. I march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Sir <hi>Thomas Nugents</hi> Houſe, which was kept againſt you, and reduced it; and then to <hi>Ballinalack,</hi> and reduced it, a conſiderable Paſs out of <hi>Weſtmeath</hi> unto <hi>Longford.</hi> The Commiſſary General and I agreed to march to <hi>Finagh,</hi> where we heard was great ſtore of Forces to entertain us. I came with my Party laſt night unto a Caſtle upon the Tower, and I ſaw a conſiderable Enemy march upon the other ſide of the Water towards us from the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> who coming to the other ſide of the Paſs at the <hi>Lougher,</hi> where we did Camp twice, Musket ſhot one from another, but the Caſtle was upon the Paſs between us: that night Commiſſary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Reynolds</hi> quartered within three Miles of us; I raiſed a Battery, and planted the Guns that night, and this morning betimes began to play; the third ſhot that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165825:3"/>
we made, the Enemy did quit the Caſtle, and run away unto the Bog: we purſued them, took ſome, drowned others, and ſome few eſcaped. I drew down the Horſe and Foot preſently over the River up to <hi>Finagh,</hi> where we beheld the Enemy that came towards us yeſterday, march faſter back from us. We found a Paſs about Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ſhot of the Caſtle, over which I ſent Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones</hi> with 400 Horſe, and my Regiment of Foot, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Enemy, and with the reſt of the Foot ſtormed <hi>Finagh,</hi> but could not enter. I preſently did ſummon it, they deſired to treat, but in the time of Parley Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary General coming up, we did joyntly treat with them; and as we were treating, Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones</hi> came back, who had overtaken the Enemy, killed about four hundred on the place, and brought with him the priſoners in the incloſed Liſt mentioned. The Soldiers in the Caſtle finding all hopes failing, yielded the Caſtle upon the Articles herewith tendered unto you. The taking of this place is of great advantage unto you, and giveth you the poſſeſſion of <hi>Longford</hi> and <hi>Cavan;</hi> and this days ſucceſſes doth in good meaſure prevent the forming of ſuch great Armies as they intended. Whileſt you purſue thoſe Intereſt God will own, you will finde his hand againſt your Enemies, his power with your forces, and ſucceſs in your great undertakings, the hands of your faithful ſervants ſtrengthned, and all good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple comforted, and the Government you have eſtabliſhed, ſecured: Which that the Lord of Hoſts may ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve uncorrupted, ſhall be the prayers of</p>
