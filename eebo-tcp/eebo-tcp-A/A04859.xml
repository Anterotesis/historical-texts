            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Christ and asked him of purpose, whether few should be saued.

            <p>Reuerend regarded in Christ Iesus: this is a sufficient motiue whereby our Sauiour Christ forewarneth vs, that if we doe not in time repent, forsake our sinnes and seeke after God: both the ancient Christian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (whose eyes saw not that we see, nor their eares heard not that we heare) yea the very Heathen also shall rise vp in iudgement against vs. For it is good counsell which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> giueth. <hi>Quid prodest si omnia habes, eam tamen qui omnia dedit non habere?</hi> What is a man the better though he haue all things, and bee without him which is the Author of all things.</p>
            <p>Let none therefore stumble at it: but if any do, let them remember the charge that we haue also from God. <hi>Oh</hi> (saith one) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideret periculum meum.</hi> Hee that is displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Note the Parable of the séed: the séed of the word of God when it was sowed: some fell by the high way side, some vpon stony ground, some vpon thornes, and some in good ground, &amp;c.

               </note> Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith <hi>Certe labor irritus est, et nullus effectus offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, lumen caeco, sermonem surdo, sapientiam bruto: cum nec sentire brutus possit, nec cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus lumen admittere, nec surdus audire</hi>· Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is lost labour and to no purpose, to offer light to a blind man, spéech to a deafe man, wisedome to a grosse head: seeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a grosse head cannot perceiue, a blinde man cannot see, &amp; a deafe man cannot heare. The aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Father <hi>Origin</hi> saith: <hi>Quanto melius esset nonnullis omnino non audire verbum Dei, quam audire cum malitia, vel audire cum hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisi: melius autem dicimus ad comparatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem malorum.</hi> How much better were it for some not to heare the word of God at all, then to heare with mallice, or to heare it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hippocrisie, we say, better in respect of euills.</p>
            <p>Therefore my deare brethren and fellow Prisoners, your friendly censure I humbly desire, to gather with your diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a due regard of the matter ensuing: In the opening and explication of these words of our Sauiour Christ: wherein, I doe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7381:5"/>
you, I meddle not at all with any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies in the Church, or any thing in the state Ecclesiasticall, but onely enter into a controuersie with <hi>Sathan</hi> and sinne. It is contriued into thrée principall heads: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Sauiour Christ declareth how hard a thing it is to enter into life, and how few shall enter. In the first our Lord Iesus bids vs striue earnestly.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.23.</note> In the second hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the gate is very straight. In the third he saith many which séeke to enter in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall not be able.</p>
            <p>The particulers that occurre (as many there are) they shall be touched rather then handled in their place.</p>
            <p>As touching the first head, where he bids vs striue earnestly,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cap.</hi>
               </note> noting thereby that it is a matter of great strife against the World, the Flesh, and the Diuell: And therfore we may rather wonder that any shall be saued, then so few shall be saued. For wee haue all the lets and hinderances that may be, both within vs and without vs: we haue (as they say) the Sun, Moone, &amp; seauen starres against vs: we haue all the Diuells in hell against vs, with all their hornes, heads, maruelous strength, infinite wiles, cunning deuises, déepe flights, and methodicall temptations.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7381:5"/>
Heere raues a sore streame against vs: then haue we this present euill world against vs with his innumerable baites, snares, nets, ginnes grins, &amp;c. to catch vs, fetter vs, and intangle vs. Here haue we both profits and pleasures, riches and honor, wealth and preferment, ambition &amp; couetousnes. Here comes a campe royall of spirituall and inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible enemies. Lastly, wee haue our flesh, that is our corrupted nature against vs: we haue our selues against our selues: For we our selues are as great enemies to our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation as either the world or the Diuell: For our vnderstanding, reason, will and affections are altogether against vs. Our natural wisedome is an enemy vnto vs: our concupiscences &amp; lusts doe minister strength to <hi>Sathans</hi> temptations, they are all in league with <hi>Sathan</hi> against vs, They take part with him in euery thing against vs and our saluation, they fight all vnder his standerd and receiue their pay of him: This then goeth hard on our side, that the Diuell hath an inward party against vs, and wee carry alwayes within vs our greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which is euer ready night and day to betray vs into the hands of <hi>Sathan</hi>: yea to vnboult the doore to let him in to cut our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7381:6"/>
throats. Here then wee sée an huge army of dreadfull enemies, and a very legion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels lying in ambush against our soules: are not we therefore, poore wretches, in a most pittifull case, which are thus bessedged and betrayed on euery side? All thinges then du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, may not wee iustly maruaile that any shall be saued? For who séeth not, who knoweth not, that thousand thousands are carried headlong to destruction (without the great mercy of God?) either with the temptations of the world, the flesh, or the Diuell. But yet further I wil shew you, by other apparant and euident reasons, that the number of Gods Elect vpon the face of the earth are very few in comparison, which may thus be considered. First let there bee taken away from amongst vs the Papists, Atheists, and Heretiques. Secondly, let there be shouelled out all vitious and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious euill liuers as swearers, drunkards, whoremongers, carnall worldlings, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, cosoners, proud men, riotors, game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the prophane multitude. Thirdly, let there be refused and sorted out all hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, carnall Protestants, vaine professors backe-sliders, decliners and cold Christians. Let all these (I say) be seperated and then

I suppose we should not néede the Art of Arithmeticke to number them, for I think there would be very few in euery village, towne &amp; Citty, I doubt they would walke very thinly in the street, so as a man might easily tell them as they go.

            <p>The first which is infidelity is proued out of the fourth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> where it is thus written:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>Vnto vs was the Gospell preached as vnto them: but the word which they heard profited them not, because it was not mixed with faith in those that heard it.</hi> And againe they could not enter in because of vnbeleefe. Héere we sée that vnbeliefe did barre out the old people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entring into the land of promise: which was a figure of Gods eternall Kingdome. And sure it is that the same vnbeliefe doth barre out thousands of vs. For many will beléeue nothing but their owne fantasies: they will not beléeue the word of God; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when it is contrary to their lust &amp; likings, profits and pleasures. Though things be manifestly proued to their faces, and the Chapter and verse shewed them: yet will they not beléeue: or though they say they will belieue, yet will they neuer goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the practise of any thing, but reply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God in all their actions. And for the most part when God saith one thing, they will either say or doe another: when God saith yea, they will say no, and so giue God
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7381:12"/>
the lye. Some againe will say, if all be true that the Preachers say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then God helpe vs. Thus you sée how infidelitie doth bar men out of Heauen and cast them into hell.</p>
            <p>The second gate, which is the presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods mercy: for if men be sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for their sinnes, and exhorted vnto repentance by and by they take couert say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is mercifull, as though God were made all of mercy and that there were no iustice in him at all: and thus the wicked make Gods mercy an occasion, which though the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> in the first Chapter of his prophesie doth sharpely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue: <hi>The Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>is slow to anger, but he is great in power, and will not sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleare the wicked.</hi> Here we see that God will not surely spare such as goe on in their sinnes presuming of his mercy, and saying in their hearts, If I may but haue a Lord of mercy vpon me thrée howres before my death, I care not. But it is iust with God when those three howers come to shut them vp in blindnes, and hardnes of heart as a iust plague for their presumption. Therfore the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> seeing the greeuousnes of this sinne, prayeth to be deliuered from it. <hi>Keep me O Lord from presuptuous sinnes,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7381:13"/>
let them not raigne ouer mee.</hi> Let all men therefore take héed of presumptious sinnes, which is the onely cause that sinne doth so mightily abound in our age: and let vs not continue in sin presume of Gods mercy, but let vs come vnto God for mercy, while the gates of mercy are opened vnto vs: For though God be full of mercy, yet will hée shew no mercy to them that presume of his mercy, but they shal once know to their cost, that Iustice goeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him as well as mercy. And therfore it may wel be called the strait gate to heauen and the wide gate to Hell.</p>
            <p>Let vs come to the third gate, which is the example of the multitude, for that doth harden &amp; imbolden men vnto sin: As when many birds do flicker &amp; flock together, they fall vpon the net without any feare, but one or two alone wil be affraid. Euen so the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of many sin companions do imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den men to run through the snares of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> without any mistrust. This is proued in the 23. of <hi>Ex.</hi> where the Lord saith flatly, <hi>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to doe euill.</hi> This is a thing that hindreth a great number from God, for they neuer looke vp vnto God, or to his word, but stare vpon the common multitude and doings of most
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7381:13"/>
men, and examples of the world, thinking that if they do as the most men doe, as their forefathers haue done before them, they are cockesure and of an euen ground. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon riseth their diuellish Prouerbe, Doe as the most men doe, and the fewest will speake of you, which is a very wicked spéech But they haue forgotten S. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule: <hi>Ne configuremini seculo isto, &amp;c.</hi> Fashion not your selues like vnto this world. These fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that stand vpon the multitude will reason thus, we sée none of these great ones of the world, none of the noble, none of the rich, none of the wise and prudent receiue this doctrine, but onely a few Shackragges and beggerly rascalls, and therefore it is a token that it is nothing worth and that it is doubtfull, and not for vs to meddle withall.

Let vs therfore take heed, of these pitfalls which <hi>Satan</hi> layeth in the way and not be caried away with these thoughts &amp; reasons. The wicked beare themselues in hand that they shall win the game, and that the goale
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7381:14"/>
goeth on their side, and there is nothing but crowing long before it be day, and great triumphing among them before any stroke be stricken: and that because we bee but a handfull of people, and they a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: and that in a manner the whole world agréeeth with them to practise our death. Thus the Diuell doth cast a mist before their eyes, and leades them away from the straight Gate to heauen, and brings them into the broad way, which leadeth them to the bottomlesse pit of hell. Therefore my deare Bretheren, let vs stand fast in the word of the Lord, and take héed of bending with the way that we be not carried away, or bowed quite downe with the raging streame of the multitude for the sway of the world doth way downe all thinges that can be spoken out of the word of God, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a very wide passage into Hell.</p>
            <p>Now let vs procéed to the fourth Gate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, which is the long custome of sinne, for that taketh away all sence and féeling of sinne, and making it as it were an other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vnto vs,, so that wee may as well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nature as shake it off, when it is thus soldered vnto vs through long custome, this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7381:14"/>
is noted by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> to be a very dangerous thing. For hee saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.23.</note> 
               <hi>Can the blacke Moore change his skin, or the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard his spots? then may ye also doe good, which are accustomed to doe euill.</hi> Héere the Prophet affirmeth that it is as hard to cure an old disease that is bred in the bone, or to remedie a sin that hath béene hatched and brought vp with vs, as to wash a blacke Moore white, or to change the spots of a Leopard, which cannot be without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of nature. And surely, trye it who will, hee shall finde it as hard a matter to leaue an old custome, whether it be of swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, gaming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lying, whoring, euill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or any other sinne, as to wash an <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian.</hi> Therefore it is written, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27. <hi>Though thou shouldest bray a foole in a morter among wheate brayed with a pestle yet will not his foolishnes depart from him</hi>:<note place="margin">

            <p>Now let vs heare of the fift gate, which is the long escaping of punishment this is auouched by the wise man in these wordes. <hi>Because sentence against an euill worke is not executed speedily,</hi>

of the children of men, haue set them to do euil.</hi> Where he sheweth that one cause why men are so hardened in their sins is because God wincketh at them and letteth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, not punishing them immediately after they haue sinned: For if God should forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with strike downe one, and raigne downe fire and brimstone vpon another &amp; cause the earth to swallow vp the third, then men would feare indéed. But God taketh not that course, for though he méeteth with som in this life, yet he lets thousands escape, and that makes them more bold, thinking they shall neuer come to their answer Euen as an old Theefe, which hath a long time es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped both prison and gallowes, thinkes he shall alwayes escape, and therfore goeth bouldly on in his thefts. But let men take héed for as the prouerbe saith, though the pitcher goeth long to the well, yet at last it commeth broken home: so though men es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape long vnpunished for sin, yet shall they not alwayes be freed: for there will come a day of reuenge, a day that will pay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home for all. Thus you sée that impunity leadeth numbers to destruction: that is, when men are let alone, &amp; not smitten by the hand of God, nor punisht by law of the Magistrate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:7381:15"/>The sixt Gate is the beholding of other mens déeds: for when some men, that haue a wicked and vngratious life, &amp; haue béene notorious sinners euen to the world ward, so that euery man could poynt at them, if vpon their death-bed, they say a few good wordes, and cry God mercy, and say their prayers, and forgiue all the world, and so dye quietly, it is maruellous to heare how the foolish people of the world will exalt them, and iustifie them saying, He made a very good end as any man could make, and dyed as quietly as a lambe, &amp; set all things in good order before he dyed. Héerevpon an other wicked &amp; monstrous varlet is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to sin: for thinketh he, such a man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as wickedly and loosely as I, or any man else, and yet he made a very good end and why may not I doe so too? But alasse, these mens eyes are bleared: for to dye qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, is not to dye godly, to crye God mercy for fashion sake, is not to haue God merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to say a few praiers with téeth outward is not to dye in the faith of Christ, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do this and yet dye miserably.</p>
            <p>The last gate is hope of long life: this is affirmed by our Lord concerning the rich worldling, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he felt the world come

in vppon him, with full streame; said hee would pull downe his Barnes and build greater, and say to his soule: <hi>Soule habes multa bona reposita in annos multos:</hi>

Note I pray you how Iesus Christ the fountaine of all wisedome calleth this man a foole, and yéeldeth a reason thereof, to wit, because he gathered ritches to himselfe, and was not rich in God hee had great care for this life and none at all for that which is to come.

            <p>Lastly our Sauiour Christ saith, that many that séeke to enter in shall not be able: noting thereby, that euen of them that séeke many shall steppe short, because they séeke him not aright. <hi>Esaias</hi> also saith: Except the Lord of hostes had left vs a séed,<note place="margin">

            <p>The reason why many which séeke to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into eternall life shall not be able.

            </list>
            <p>If these things be in you in some measure of truth, then your hope is currant, sound, and good, otherwise it is nothing worth. For in vaine do men say they hope to be saued by Christ, when as they walke wickedly and dissolutely: The reason hereof is, because the members must be sutable to the head: But Christ our head is holy, therefore we his members must be holy also: as it as written,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16.</note> 
               <hi>Be yee holy, for I am holy.</hi> Otherwise if we will ioyne prophane &amp; vnholy members to our holy head Christ, then we make Christ a monster: As if we should ioyn swearers, drunkards whoremongers and such like to be the members of Christ, and to haue life &amp; saluation by him. But the case is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: For first of all before a Christian can come to haue an inward féeling and true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of these things, there are fiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther especiall things to be required of euery true Christian which liueth in the Church.</p>
            <p>First, the acknowledgment of sinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against the law of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the acknowledgment of Gods angry countenance to be most iustly bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him for his sinnes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, an inward sorrow and paine of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7381:19"/>
the heart and soule for sinne.</p>
            <p>But here we are most warily to take héed that we content not our selues with these thrée former points, for if we doe, the vilest firebrands in hell, <hi>Iudas, Phatao, Saul, Herod Achitophell,</hi> &amp; such like, shall go before vs, or be our equals in the professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of repentance.</p>
            <p>There are two manner of repentances, the one a true repentance to life, the other a false repentance to death: as we may sée by <hi>Iudas,</hi> who is said to haue repented, &amp; which is more, to haue confessed his fault, &amp; which is most of all, to haue made restitution: and yet it was a false repentance, &amp; why? because it sprang not of a true faith, but as afore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> repented and wept bitterly, &amp; was saued thereby, though he neuer made confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion nor satisfaction: And why? because it sprang of a true and liuely faith in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quid ergo est?</hi> What is it then that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at our hands? these two things sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent most chiefely and principally, which may be well called, <hi>Vltima est summa,</hi> the last and highest of all: that is, a perfect hatred, loathing and detesting of sinne. For such onely begin to cease from sinne.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the acknowledgment of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God offered in that one redéemer, and onely mediator betwéene God and man,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5</note>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:7381:19"/>
the man Christ Iesus, with a full perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hart, a sure confidence of an assured rest of conscience grounded vpon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Gods mercy, that we shall be fréely accepted with God in Christ: for that.</p>
            <p>First our sinnes are purged in his blood. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Esa.</hi> 53.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his righteousnes is imputed vnto vs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
            <p>The fathers looked for none other righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this righteousnes of Christ: as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> proueth sufficiently by that one example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is said to rest himselfe vpon that righteounesse of faith, which is the righteousnes which God giueth vs in Christ, apprehended by faith onely.</p>
            <p>The Apostle S. <hi>Peter</hi> which fel most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 18.19.</note> comforted himselfe with this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, &amp; all men that will beleeue his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, affirming y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we <hi>cannot be saued with siluer or gold, but with the precious blood of Iesus Christ, as of a Lambe vndefiled:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then we sée what is required of all that shall be saued by Christ: which things, if we doe belieue with a liuely faith, planted and grounded vpon the sure promises of Gods mercy offered vnto vs in Christ, and not doubting thereof, but with all diligence kéepe and performe the premises aforesaid,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7381:20"/>
then we shall bee assured to enter in at the straight gate, and narrow way leading vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal life. Saluation is he gift of God, which he fréely bestoweth vpon all that séek him aright.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.3</note> This is eternall life to know the Father, and him whom hee hath sent, Iesus Christ. We must seeke God aright. But some perhaps will say, how shall wee seeke him aright? I answer, <hi>Dilige Deum &amp; mandata eius obserua:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14 15</note> Loue God &amp; kéep his commandements. Héerby shall all men know that you seeke him as you ought.

            <p>And this is the cause why Christ, talking of the kéeping his commandements, repeateth so often this word loue, as the surest cause of keeping the same: for want whereof in the world, the world kéepeth them not, as there he sheweth. <hi>If you loue me keepe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi>

            <p>Now because you see that there be many strong barres and stops out of heauen, &amp; a very wide passage into hel: the best counsel therefore I can giue you, if it were for my life, is to be much exercised in the word of God, both in the hearing reading &amp; medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: and also to purchase vnto your selues the sincere ministry of the Gospell, &amp; to make conscience to liue vnder it, estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming your selues happy if you haue it, though you want all other things: &amp; vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py if you haue it not, though you haue all other things. For it is a péerelesse pearle, &amp; an incomparable Iewell:<note place="margin">

               </note> for the purchasing whereof we are aduised by our Lord Iesus to sell all that wee haue rather then to goe without it. Againe our Sauiour Christ gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the same counsell to the Church of Laodicea in these words. I counsell thée to buy of me gold tryed by the fire,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apo.</hi> 3.18</note> that thou maist be ritch, and white rayment that thou
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7381:23"/>
maist be clothed, and that thy filthy naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doe not appeare: &amp; anoynt thine eyes with eye-salue, that thou maist sée: where you see the word of God is compared to most pretious gold, whereby wee are made spiritually ritch: and to glittering attire, wherewith our naked soules are cloathed, and to an eye-salue, wherewith our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all blindnes is cured. Wée are aduertised also by Iesus Christ, whose counsell is euer the best, that wee should buy these thinges whatsoeuer they cost vs. The same counsel also giueth wise <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>pro.</hi> 23.23.</note> saying buy the truth but sell it not. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we sée the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell which héerein I giue thée is not mine owne, but the counsell of Iesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and <hi>Salomon</hi> the wise. <hi>Ego fidenter dico</hi> I speake boldly: and who can or who dare speake against their counsell.</p>
            <p>Now as I haue aduised you to be much exercised in the hearing, reading &amp; medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word of God, which is indéed good, profitable &amp; necessary: yet you must of necessity frequent preaching of the word, the sound preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: which is the cheefest and most princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall meanes which God hath ordained and sanctified and for the sauing of mens soules: as it is plainly set down. When the world (by wisedome) knew not God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.</note> in the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7381:23"/>
of God, it pleased God by the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of preaching to saue them that beleeue. For the word preached is the ordinary meanes to work faith, which indeed is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by hearinng, reading, meditation in the word, prayer, &amp;c. As it is written.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ro.</hi> 10.14.</note> How shall they call on him, on whom they haue not beléeued? and how shall they beleeue in him whom they haue not heard? &amp; how shall they heare without a Preacher.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Héere then you sée, that the chiefest and most principall meanes which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained &amp; sanctified for the sauing of soules, is the word of God preached<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; faith is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by increased and wrought in the hearts of the hearers: As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith:<note place="margin">

               <hi>Faith is wrought by the word of God preached.</hi>
            </p>
