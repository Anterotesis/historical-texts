            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Knowledge</hi> is undoubtedly an Allusion to that known Custom among the <hi>Jews</hi> in the admission of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. For to whomsoever they gave Authority to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Law and the Prophets, they were solemnly admitted into that Office by delivering to them a <hi>Key</hi> and a <hi>Table-book.</hi> So that by the <hi>key of knowledge</hi> is here meant the Interpretation and understanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and by <hi>taking away the key of Knowledge,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they arrogated to themselves alone the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Scriptures, but likewise that they had Conveyed away this key of Knowledge, and as it were hid it out of the way, neither using it themselves as they ought, nor suffering Others to make use of it.</p>
            <p>And thus they <hi>Shut the Kingdom of Heaven against Men:</hi> which is very fitly said of those who have lock-the Door against them that were going in, and have taken away the key. By all which it appears that the Plain meaning of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in these Metaphorical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions is, that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and Teachers of the Law, under a Pretence of Interpreting the Scriptures, had perverted them and kept the true Knowledge of them from the People: Especially those Old Prophecies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>I shall speak briefly to these two <hi>Observations</hi>; and then apply them to those who are principally concerned in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>First, I observe hence the Necessity of the</hi> knowledge of the holy Scriptures in order to our Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is by our <hi>Saviour</hi> called <hi>the key of knowledge,</hi> that which lets Men into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Knowledge is necessary to Religion: It is necessary to the being of it; and necessary to the life and practice of it. <hi>Without Faith</hi> (says the <hi>Apostle) it is impossible to please God:</hi> Because Faith is an act of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and does necessarily suppose some knowledge and apprehension of what we believe. To all acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion there is necessarily req<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ired some act of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; so that without Knowledge there can be no Devotion in the Service of God, no Obedience to his Laws. Religion begins in the Understanding, and from thence descends upon the heart and life, <hi>If ye know these things,</hi> (says our <hi>Saviour) happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> We must first know God before we can worship him; and understand what is his Will, before we can do it.</p>
            <p>This is so very evident, that one would think there needed no Discourse about it: And yet there are some in the World that cry up Ignorance as the Mother of Devotion. And to shew that we do not wrong them in this matter, Mr. <hi>Rushworth</hi> in his <hi>Dialogues</hi> (a Book in great vogue among the <hi>Papists</hi> here in <hi>England</hi>) does expresly reckon up <hi>Ignorance</hi> among <hi>the Parents of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> And can any thing be said more absurdly and more to the Disparagement of Religion, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the Pedigree of the most excellent thing in the World; from so obscure and ignoble an Original; and to make that which the Scripture calls <hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>the Excellency of Knowledge,</hi> to be the Off-spring of Ignorance, and a Child of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Ignorance indeed may be the cause of Wonder and Admiration, and the Mother of Folly and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58782:4"/>
But surely Religion is of a nobler Extraction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is the Issue and Result of the best Wisdom and Knowledge; and descends from above, from the giver of every good and perfect Gift, even the Father of Lights.</p>
            <p>And as Knowledge in general is necessary to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, so more particularly, the knowledge of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> is necessary to our Eternal Salvation. Because these are the great and standing Revelations of God to Mankind; wherein the Nature of God and his Will concerning our Duty, and the Terms and Conditions of our Eternal Happiness in another World, are fully and plainly declared to us.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures are the Word of God; and from whence can we learn the Will of God so well as from his own Mouth? They are the great Instruments of our Salvation; and should not every Man be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that, which alone can perfectly instruct him what he must believe, and what he must do that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I observe the great and inexcusable fault of those who keep Men in Ignorance of Religion, and take away from them so excellent and necessary a means of Divine Knowledge, as the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls <hi>taking away the Key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and shutting the Kingdom of Heav'n against Men</hi>

               </gap> Knowledge and Understanding of them. This alone i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58782:4"/>
at the very fountain head; and not only to lead Men into Errour, but to take away from them all possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of rectifying their mistakes. And can there be a greater Sacriledge, than to rob Men of the Word of God, the best means in the World of acquainting them with the Will of God and their Duty, and the way to Eternal Happiness? To keep the People in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of that which is necessary to save them, <hi>is to judge them unworthy of Eternal Life,</hi> and to declare it does not belong to them, and maliciously to contrive the Eternal ruine and destruction of their Souls.</p>
            <p>To lock up the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>Service of God</hi> from the People in an Unknown Tongue, what is this but in effect to forbid Men to know God, and to serve him; to render them incapable of knowing what <hi>is the good and acceptable Will of God</hi>; of joyning in his Worship, or performing any Part of it, or receiving any Benefit or Edification from it? And what is, if this be not, <hi>to shut the Kingdom of Heaven against Men?</hi> This is so outragious a Cruelty to the Souls of Men, that it is not to be excused upon any Pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever: This is to take the surest and most effectual way in the World <hi>to destroy those for whom</hi> Christ <hi>dyed,</hi> and directly to thwart the Great Design of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Who would have all Men to be Saved, and to come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> Men may miscarry with their Knowledge, but they are sure to perish for the want of it.</p>
            <p>The best things in the World have their inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences attending them, and are liable to be abused; but surely Men are not to be ruined and damned for fear of abusing their Knowledge, or for the Prevention of any other inconvenience whatsoever. Besides, this is to cross the very end of the Scriptures, and the design of God in inspiring Men to write them. Can any Man think that God should send this great Light of his Word, into the World, for the Priests <hi>to hide it under a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shel</hi>; and not rather that it should be set up to the greatest advantage for the Enlightning of the World? St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. That <hi>whatsoever things
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58782:5"/>
were written; were Written for our Learning, that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> And 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>That all Scripture is given by the Inspiration of God; and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness.</hi> And if the Scriptures were Written for these Ends, can any Man have the face to pretend that they do not concern the People, as well as their Teachers. Nay St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly tells the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they were Written for their Learning, however it happens, that they are not now permitted to make use of them. Are the <hi>Scriptures</hi> so useful and profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Instruction in Righteousness? And why may they not be used by the People for those Ends for which they were given? 'Tis true indeed they are fit for the mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

much less forbid them so to do. So that they who do it now have no cloak for their Sin: And they who pretend so confidently to <hi>Antiquity</hi> in other cases, are by the Evidence of Truth forced to acknowledge, that it is against them in this. Though they have Ten Thousand <hi>Schoolmen</hi> on their side, yet have they not one <hi>Father,</hi> not the least pretence of Scripture, or rag of <hi>Antiquity</hi> to cover their nakedness in this Point.</p>
            <p>With great reason then does our <hi>Saviour</hi> denounce so heavy a <hi>Woe</hi> against such Teachers; of old in the like case God by his <hi>Prophets</hi> severely threatens the Priests of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, for not instructing the People in the Knowledge of God, Hosea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.6. <hi>My People are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed for lack of Knowledge; because thou hast rejected Knowledge, I will also reject thee; thou shalt be no more a Priest to me: Seeing thou hast forgotten the Law of thy God, I will also forget thy Children.</hi> God, you see, lays the ruine of so many Souls at their Doors, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their Blood at their hands. So many as perish for want of Knowledge, and Eternally miscarry by being deprived of the necessary means of Salvation, their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction shall be charged upon those who <hi>have taken away the Key of Knowledge, and shut the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is just with God to punish such Persons not only as the Occasion, but as the Authors of this Ruine. For who can judge otherwise, but that they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Men of the necessary means to any End, do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely design to hinder them of attaining that End. And whatever may be pretended in this Case; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Men of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and to keep them ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the service of God, and yet while they do so, to make a shew of an earnest desire of their Salvation, is just such a mockery, as if one of you that is a Master, should tell his Apprentice how much you desire he should thrive in the World, and be a Rich Man; but all the while keeps him ignorant of his Trade in order to his being Rich; and with the strictest care imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, conceals from him the best means of Learning, that whereby alone he is likely to thrive and get an
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58782:6"/>
Estate. <hi>Woe unto you</hi> Scribes, Pharisees, <hi>and</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
            <p>By what hath been discoursed upon this Argument, you will easily perceive where the Application is like to fall. For the <hi>Woe</hi> denounced by our <hi>Saviour</hi> here in the <hi>Text</hi> against the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> falls every whit as heavy upon the <hi>Pastours</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church. They have taken away the Key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with a Witness; not only depriving the People of the right Understanding of the Scriptures, but of the very use of them: As if they were afraid they should understand them, that they dare not suffer them so much, as to be acquainted with them.</p>
            <p>This Tyranny <hi>that</hi> Church hath Exercised over those of her Communion for several Hundreds of Years. It grew upon them indeed by degrees, for as by the Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the <hi>Romans</hi> bought their Language by degrees, so the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of that Church still kept up the Scriptures and the Service of God in the <hi>Latin Tongue,</hi> which at last was wholly unknown to the Common People. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Ninth</hi> and <hi>Tenth Centuries,</hi> when by the general Consent of all their own <hi>Historians,</hi> gross Darkness and Ignorance covered this part of the World, the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Priests</hi> took away <hi>the Key of Knowledge,</hi> and did (as I may so say) put it under the Door for several Ages; till the <hi>Reformation</hi> fetcht it out again, and rubbed off the Rust of it.</p>
            <p>And I profess seriously, that hardly any thing in the World was ever to me more astonishing, than this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and Cruel usage of the People in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And I cannot tell which to wonder at most, the Insolence of their Governours in imposing upon Men this sensless way of serving God, or the patience shall I call it, or rather stupidity of the People in enduring to be so intollerably abused. Why should reasonable Creatures be treated at this rude and barbarous rate? As if they were Unworthy to be acquainted with the Will of God; and as if that which every Man ought to do, were not fit for every Man to know: As if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58782:6"/>
People had only Bodies to be present at the service of God, but no Souls; or as if they were all distracted and out of their Wits, and it were a dangerous thing to let in the Lights upon them.</p>
            <p>But to speak more distinctly. There are <hi>two</hi> things we charge them withal, and which they are not able to deny. Their performing <hi>the Publick Service of God</hi> in an Unknown Tongue; and depriving the People of the use of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And I shall first tell you what we have to say against these things, and then consider what they pretend for them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for their performing the service of God in a Tongue Unknown to the People. And I begin with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in his first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> hath a whole Chapter on purpose to shew the unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this thing, and how contrary it is to the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Christians.</hi> His Discourse is so plain and so well known, that I shall not particularly insist upon it. <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his Annotations upon this <hi>Chapter,</hi> breaks out (as well he might) into admiration at the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in his time. <hi>Hâc in re mirum quam mutata sit Ecclesiae consuetudo: It is Wonderful,</hi> (says he) <hi>how the Custom of the Church is altered in this matter. St.</hi> Paul <hi>had rather speak five Words with Vnderstanding, and so as to teach others, than Ten Thousand in an Vnknown Tongue.</hi> Why does the Church doubt to follow so great an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or rather how dares she to dissent from it?</p>
            <p>As for the practice of the Ancient Church, let <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> bear Witness, <hi>The</hi> Grecians <hi>(saith he) in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers use the</hi> Greek, <hi>and the</hi> Romans <hi>the</hi> Latin <hi>Tongue; and so every one according to his Language prayeth unto God, and praiseth him as he is able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not only in <hi>Origen</hi>'s time, but for more than Six Hundred Years, the Service of God was always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a known Tongue. And this the Learned Men of their own Church do not deny. And Cardinal <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> (as <hi>Cassander</hi> tells us) said it was much better this custom were restored; and being reproved for saying so, he said, he Learned it from St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himself confesseth that the <hi>Armenians, Aegyptians,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58782:7"/>
Aethiopians, Russians,</hi> and others do use their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in their Liturgies at this day.</p>
            <p>But it is otherwise now in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath been for several Ages. And it seems they lay great stress upon it, not only as a thing of great use, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. For Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, forbids the Prince of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to permit to the People the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Offices in the <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Tongue; and commands him to oppose them herein with all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It seems he thought it a Cause worthy the fighting for; and that it were much better the People should be Killed, than suffered to understand their Prayers.</p>
            <p>But let us reason this matter a little calmly with them. Is it necessary for Men to understand any thing they do in Religion? And is not Prayer one of the most solemn Parts of Religion: And why then should not Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayers as well as any thing else they do in Religion? Is it good that People should understand their private Prayers? that (we thank them) they allow, and why not the publick as well? Is there less of Religion in publick Prayers? Is God less honoured by them? Or are we not as capable of being Edified and of having our hearts and affections moved and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by them? Where then lies the Difference? The more I consider it, the more I am at a loss what toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reason any Man can give why People should not understand their publick Devotions as well as their private. If Men cannot heartily and devoutly pray alone, without understanding what they ask of God, no more (say I) can they heartily and devoutly join in the publick Prayers which are made by the Priest wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out understanding what they are. If it be enough for the Priest to understand them, why should not the Priest only be present at them? Unless the People do not meet to worship God, but only to wait upon the Priest. But by saying that the Priest understands 'em, it seems it is better that some body should understand them than not; and why is not that which is good for the Priest good for the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ople.</p>
            <p>So that the true state of the <hi>Controversy</hi> is, whether it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58782:7"/>
be fit that the People should be Edified in the Service of God; and whether it be fit that the Church should or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things contrary to Edification? For it is plain that the Service of God in an unknown Tongue, is useless and unprofitable to the People: Nay, it is evidently no publick Service of God when the Priest only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands it. For how can they be said to be publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers if the People do not join in them? and how can they join in that they do not understand? and to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose are <hi>Lessons</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> read, if People are to learn nothing by them? and how should they learn when they do not understand? This is as if one should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to teach a Man <hi>Greek</hi> by reading him Lectures every day out of an <hi>Arabick</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Book, of which he understands not one syllable.</p>
            <p>As to their depriving the People of the use of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>; our Blessed Saviour exhorts the Jews <hi>to search the Scriptures:</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth the <hi>Christians</hi> that <hi>the Word of God should dwell richly in them.</hi> And the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church do most frequently and earnestly recommend to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the reading and study of the Scriptures. How comes the Case now to be so altered? Sure the Word of God is not changed, that certainly abides and continues the same for ever.</p>
            <p>I shall by and by examine what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends in excuse of this Sacriledge. In the mean time, I do not see what considerable Objections can be made against the reading of the Scriptures, which would not have held as well against the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and publishing them in a Language understood by the People; as the <hi>Old Testament</hi> was by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the Apostles by the <hi>Churches</hi> to whom they were written; and the <hi>Gospel</hi> both by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks.</hi> Were there no difficulties and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurities then in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> capable of being wrested by the Unstable and unlearned? Were not People then liable to Errour, and was there no danger of <hi>Heresy</hi> in those Times? And yet these are their great Objections against putting the Scriptures into the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58782:8"/>
hands of the People; which is just like their arguing against giuing the Cup to the <hi>Laity</hi> from the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of their <hi>Beards,</hi> least some of the Consecrated Wine should be spilt upon them: As if <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Beards</hi> were Inconveniences lately sprung up in the World, and which Mankind were not liable to in the first Ages of <hi>Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if there were the same dangers and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in all Ages, this Reason makes against the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of the Scriptures to the People at first, as much as against permitting them the use of them now. And in truth, all these Objections are against the Scripture it self: and that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would find fault with if they durst, is, that there should be any such Book in the World, and that it should be in any bodies hands, learned or unlearned; for if it be dangerous to any, none are so capable of doing mischief with it as Men of Wit and Learning. So that at the bottom, if they would speak out, the Quarrel is against the Scriptures themselves. This is too evident by the Counsel given to Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Third by the Bishops met at <hi>Bononia</hi> to consult about the Establishment of the <hi>Roman See</hi>; where, among other things, they give this as their last advice, and as the greatest and weightiest of all, <hi>That by all means, as little of the Gospel as might be, especially in the vulgar Tongue, should be read to the People, and</hi> that little <hi>which was in the</hi> Mass <hi>ought to be sufficient; neither should it be permitted to any Mortal to read more. For so long</hi> (say they) <hi>as Men were contented with that little, all things went well with them, but quite otherwise since more was commonly read.</hi> And speaking of the Scripture, they give this remarkable testimony and commendation of it; <hi>This in short is that</hi> Book, <hi>which above all others, hath raised those Tempests and Whirlwinds which we were almost carried away with. And in truth, if any one dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently considers it, and compares it with what is done in our Church, he will find them very contrary to each other, and our Doctrine not only to be very different from it, but repugnant to it.</hi> If this be the Case, they do like the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58782:8"/>
rest of the Children of this World, prudently enough in their Generation: Can we blame them for being against the Scriptures, when the Scriptures are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be so clearly against them? But surely no body that considereth these things, would be of that <hi>Church,</hi> which is brought by the undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the things themselves to this shameful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that several of their Doctrines and Practices are very contrary to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Much more might have been said against the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in these two particulars, but this is sufficient.</p>
            <p>I shall in the second place consider what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for them: And indeed, what can be pretended in justification of so contumelious an affront to Mankind, so great a tyranny and cruelty to the Souls of Men? Hath God forbidden the People to look into the Scriptures? No, quite contrary: Was it the Practice of the Antient Church to lay this restraint upon Men, or to celebrate the Service of God in an unknown Tongue? Our Adversaries themselves have not the face to pretend this. I shall truly represent the substance of what they say in these two points.</p>
            <p>As to the Service of God in an unknown Tongue, they say these <hi>four</hi> things for themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the People do exercise a general Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and come with an intention to serve God, and that is accepted, though they do not particularly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Prayers that are made, and the Lessons that are read.</p>
            <p>But is this all that is intended in the Service of God? does not St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly require more? <hi>That the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the People should be Edified by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Service that is performed:</hi> And if what is done be not particularly understood, he tells us the People are not Edified, nor can say <hi>Amen</hi> to the Prayers and Thanksgivings that are put up to God: And that any Man that should come in and find People serving of God in this unprofitable and unreasonable manner, would conclude that they were mad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:58782:9"/>And if there be any general Devotion in the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is because they understand in general what they are about; and why may they not as well understand the particular Service that is performed, that so they might exercise a particular Devotion. So that they are devout no further than they understand; and consequently, as to what they do not understand, had every whit as good be absent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They say, the Prayers are to God, and he understands them, and that is enough.</p>
            <p>But what harm were it, if all they that pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it also: Or indeed, how can men pray to God without understanding what they ask of him? Is not Prayer a part of the <hi>Christian</hi> Worship? and is any Service reasonable that is not directed by our Understandings, and accompanied with our Hearts and Affections?</p>
            <p>But then what say they to the <hi>Lessons</hi> and <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Scripture, which are likewise read to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in an unknown Tongue? Are these directed to God, or to the People only? And are they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by God for their Instruction, and read either to that purpose, or to none? And is it possible to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct Men by what they do not understand? This is a new and wonderful way of Teaching, by concealing from the People the things which they should learn. Is it not all one, as to all purposes of Edification, as if the Scriptures were not read, or any thing else in the place of them? As they many times do their Legends, which the wiser sort among them do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve when they read them. For all things are alike to them that understand none, as all things are of a colour in the dark. Ignorance knows no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of things, it is only Knowledge that can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They say that some do, at least in some measure, understand the particular Prayers.</p>
            <p>If they do, that is no thanks to them: It is by accident if they are more knowing than the rest, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore than the Church either desires or intends. For,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58782:9"/>
if they desired it, they might order their Service so as every man might understand it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They say that 'tis convenient that God should be served and worshipped in the same Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage all the World over.</p>
            <p>Convenient for them, for God, or for the People? Not for God surely, for he understands all other Languages as well as <hi>Latin</hi>; and for any thing we know to the contrary, likes them as well. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it cannot be so convenient for the People, because they generally understand no Language but their own; and it is very inconvenient they should not understand what they do in the Service of God. But perhaps they mean, that it is convenient for the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to have it so; because this will look like an Argument that they are the <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church,</hi> when the Language which was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally theirs, shall be the universal Language in which all Nations shall serve God; and by this means also they may bring all Nations to be of their Religion, and yet make them never the wiser: And this is a very great Convenience, because Knowledge is a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome thing, and Ignorance very quier and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable, rendring Men fit to be governed, and unfit to dispute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to their depriving the People of the Scriptures, the summ of what they say may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to these <hi>three</hi> Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Church can give men leave to read the Scriptures; but this not without great trouble and difficulty, there must be a License for it under the hand of the Bishop or Inquisitor, by the advice of the Priest and Confessor concerning the fitness of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that desires this Priviledge. And we may be sure they will think none fit but those of whom they have the greatest confidence and security; and whoever presumes to do it otherwise, is to bt denied <hi>Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; which is as much as in them lies, to damn Men for presuming to read the Word of God without their leave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:58782:10"/>And whatever they may allow here in <hi>England,</hi> where they hold their People upon more slippery Terms, yet this Priviledge is very rarely granted where they are in full possession of their Power, and have the People perfectly under their Yoke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They tell us they instruct the People otherwise. This indeed were something if they did it to purpose, but generally they do it very sparingly and slightly. Their Sermons are commonly made up of feigned Stories and Miracles of Saints, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to the Worship of them (and especially of the Blessed <hi>Virgin</hi>) and of their Images and Relicks. And for the Truth of this I appeal to the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Volumes of their <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Postils</hi> in Print; which I suppose are none of their worst. I am sure <hi>Erasmus</hi> says, that in his time, in several Countries, the People did scarce once in half a Year hear a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Sermon to exhort them to true Piety. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they allow the People some <hi>Catechisms</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuals</hi> of Devotion; and yer in many of them they have the confidence and the conscience to <hi>steal away the Second Commandment</hi> in the face of the <hi>Eighth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to bring the matter to a point, if those helps of Instruction are agreeable to the Scriptures, why are they so afraid the People should read the Scriptures? If they are not, why do they deceive and delude them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They say, That People are apt to wrest the Scriptures to their own destruction, and that the promiscuous use of them hath been the great occasion of <hi>Heresies.</hi> It cannot be denied to be the condition of the very best things in the World, that they are liable to be abused; Health, Light, and Liberty, as well as Knowledge: But must all those be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken away? This very Inconvenience of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wresting the Scriptures to their own Ruine, St. <hi>Peter</hi> takes notice of in his days: But he does not therefore forbid Men the reading of them as his more prudent Successors have done since. Suppose the reading of the Scriptures hath been the occasion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58782:10"/>
of <hi>Heresies,</hi> were there ever more than in the first Ages of <hi>Christianity</hi>? And yet neither the <hi>Apostles</hi> nor their Successors ever prescribed this Remedy. But are they in earnest? Must not Men know the Truth for fear of falling into Errour? Because Men may possibly miss their way at Noon-day, must they never travel but in the Night when they are sure to lose it.</p>
            <p>And when all is done, this is not true, that Heresies have sprung from this Cause. They have generally been broached by the Learned, from whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures neither were nor could be concealed. And for this I appeal to the History and Experience of all Ages. I am well assured the ancient Fathers were of another mind. St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> says, <hi>if Men would be Conversant in the Scriptures, and attend to them, they would not only not fall into Errors themselves, but rescue those that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:</hi> And St. <hi>Hierome</hi> more expresly to our purpose. Thus <hi>infinite Evils arise from the Ignorance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and that from that Cause the most part of most part of Heresies have come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if what they say were true, is not this to lay the blame of all the ancient Heresies uyon the ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things by our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the Holy <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church for so many Ages, and their imprudent dispensing of the Scriptures to the People. This indeed is to charge the matter home; and yet this Consequence is unavoidable. For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot justify the Piety and Prudence of their present Practices, without accusing all these.</p>
            <p>But the thing which they mainly rely upon as to both these practices in this. That though these things were otherwise in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, and in the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> yet the Church hath power to alter them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Exigence and Circumstances of times. I have purposely reserved this for the last place, because it is their last refuge; and if this fail them they are gone.</p>
            <p>To shew the Weakness of this Pretence, we will, if they please, take it for granted, that the Governors of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58782:11"/>
the Church have in no Age more Power, than the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had in theirs. Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. that the Authority which the Apostles had given them from the Lord, was only <hi>for Edification, but not for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:</hi> And the same St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it the business of a whole <hi>Chapter</hi> to shew that the performing the Publick service of God and particularly praying in an unknown Tongue, are contrary to Edification; from which premises the Conclusion is plain, that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> themselves had no Authority to appoint the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God to be performed in an unknown Tongue; and surely it is Arrogance for the Church in any Age to pretend to greater Authority than the Apostles had.</p>
            <p>This is the Summ of what our <hi>Adversaries</hi> say in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of themselves in these Points. And there is no doubt, but that Men of Wit and Confidence will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make a shift to say something for any thing; and some way or other blanch over the blackest and most absurd things in the World. But I leave it to the Judgement of Mankind, whether any thing be more unreasonable than to tell Men in effect, that it is fit they should understand as little of Religion as is poshble; that God hath published a very dangerous Book, with which it is not safe for the People to be familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; that our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> and the ancient <hi>Christian</hi> Church, for more than Six hundred Years, were not wise Managers of Religion, nor pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Dispensers of the Scriptures, but like fond and foolish Fathers put a Knife and a Sword into the hands of their Children, with which they might have easily fore-seen what mischief they would do to themselves and others. And who would not chuse to be of such a Church which is provided of such excellent and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means of Ignorance, such wise and infallible Methods for the prevention of Knowledge in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and such variety of close Shutters to keep out the Light.</p>
            <p>I have chosen to insist upon this Argument, because it is so very plain, that the most ordinary Capacity may judge of this usage and dealing with the Souls of Men:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58782:11"/>
Which is so very gross that every Man must needs be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it; because it toucheth Men in the common Rights of humane Nature, which belong to them as much as the Light of Heaven, and the Air we breath in.</p>
            <p>It requires no subtilty of Wit, no skill in Antiquity, to understand these Controversies between us and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For there are no Fathers to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on both sides in these Questions: They yield we have Antiquity on ours: And we refer it to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense of Manking, which Church, that of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Ours,</hi> hath all the Right or Reason in the World on her side in these Debates? And, who they are that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over Christians, the Governours of <hi>their</hi> Church or <hi>ours</hi>; Who use the People like Sons and Freemen, and who like Slaves; Who feed the Flock of <hi>Christ</hi> committed to them, and who take the Childrens bread from them? Who they are, that when their Children ask bread, for Bread give them a Stone, and for an Egg a Serpent; I mean the <hi>Legends</hi> of their <hi>Saints</hi> instead of the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which are able to make Men wise unto Salvation: And who they are that lie most justly under the suspicion of Errors and Corruptions, they who bring their Doctrine and Practices into the open Light, and are willing to have them tried by the true Touchstone, the <hi>Word of God</hi>; or they who shun the Light, and decline all manner of Trial and Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? And who are most likely to carry on a World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Design, they who drive a Trade of such mighty gain, and advantage under pretence of Religion, and make such markets of the Ignorance and Sins of the People; or we whom Malice it self cannot charge with serving any Worldly Design by any allowed Doctrine or Practice of our Religion? For we make no Money of the mistakes of the People, nor do we fill their heads with vain fears of New Places of Torment to make them willing to empty their Purses in a vainer hope of being delivered out of them. We do not like them pretend a mighty banck of Treasure and Merits in the Church, which they sell to the People for ready
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58782:12"/>
money, giving them Bills of Exchange from the <hi>Pope</hi> to <hi>Purgatory</hi>; When they who grant them, have no reason to believe they will avail them, or be accepted in the other World.</p>
            <p>For our parts we have no fear that our People should understand Religion too well: We could wish, with <hi>Moses, that all the Lord's People were Prophets</hi>: We should be heartily glad the People would read the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more diligently, being sufficiently assured that it is their own fault if they learn any thing but what is good from thence: We have no Doctrines or Practices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture, and consequently no occasion to keep it close from the sight of the People, or to hide any of the Commandments of God from them: We leave these mean Arts to those who stand in need of them.</p>
            <p>In a word, there is nothing which God hath said to Men, which we desire should be concealed from them: Nay, we are willing the People should examine what we teach, and bring all our Doctrines <hi>to the Law and to the Testimony</hi>; that if they be not according to <hi>this Rule,</hi> they may neither believe them nor us. 'Tis only things false and adulterate which shun the Light and fear the Touchstone. We have that security of the Truth of our Religion, and of the agreeableness of it to the Word of God; that honest Confidence of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Cause, that we do not forbid the People to read the best Books our Adversaries can write against it.</p>
            <p>And now let any Impartial Man judge whether this be not a better Argument of a good Cause, to leave Men at liberty to try the Grounds of their Religion, than the Courses which are taken in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to awe Men with an Inquisition; and, as much as is possible, to keep the common People in Ignorance, not only of what their late Adversaries, the <hi>Protestants,</hi> but their chief and ancient Adversary, the Scriptures have to say against them.</p>
            <p>A Man had need of more than common Security of the Skill and Integrity of those to whom he perfectly resigns his Understanding; this is too great a Trust to be reposed in humane frailty, and too strong a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58782:12"/>
to others to impose upon us; to abuse our Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to make their own ends of our voluntary Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and easie Credulity. This is such a folly as if a Rich Man should make his Physician his Heir; which is to tempt him either to destroy him or to let him dye, for his own Interest. So he that trusts the care of his Soul with other Men, and at the same time by <hi>irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable Deed</hi> settles his Understanding upon them, lays too great a Temptation before them to seduce and damn him for their own ends.</p>
            <p>And now to reflect a little upon our selves. What cause have we to bless God who are so happily rescued from that more than <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Darkness and Bondage, wherein this Nation was detained for several Ages; Who are delivered out of the hands of those Cruel Task-masters, who required Brick without Straw; that Men should be Religious without competent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and work out their own Salvation while they denied them the means of all others the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to it. Who are so uncharitable as to allow us no Salvation out of their Church, and yet so unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as to deny us the very best means of Salvation when we are in it?</p>
            <p>Our Forefathers thought it a mighty Priviledge to have the Word of God restored to them, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers and Service of God celebrated in a known Tongue: Let us use this inestimable Priviledge with great modesty and humility; not to the nourishing of Pride and Self-conceit, of Division and Faction; but as the <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorts, <hi>Let the Word of God dwell richly in you, in all Wisdom; and let the Peace of God rule in your hearts, unto which ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It concerns us mightily (with which Admonition I conclude) both for the Honour and Support of our Religion, to be at better Union among our selves, and not to divide about lesser things: And so to demean our selves, as to take from our Adversaries all those Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences whereby they would justify themselves, or at least Extenuate the Guilt of that heavy Charge, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58782:13"/>
falls every whit as justly upon them as ever it did upon the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> of <hi>taking away the key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and shutting the Kingdom of Heaven against Men; neither going in themselves, nor suffering those that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring to go in.</hi>
