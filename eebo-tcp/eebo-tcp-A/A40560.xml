            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and True ACCOUNT OF THE Barbarous Rebellion AND Riſing of the Lord <hi>Dunbarton</hi>'s Regiment at <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk.</hi> With their Pretences of Declaring for the late King <hi>James.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Lord <hi>Dunbartons,</hi> ſometime called <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Regiment conſiſts of Six and Twenty Companies, and by their continual Exerciſe and Service at <hi>Tangier, Holland,</hi> and other places abroad, they have been ſo improved in Military Diſcipline, that they are looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as one of the Largeſt and Ableſt Regiments in the Kings Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; but as they have Courage, ſo they always and in all Quarters they have come to, have been known for the moſt Rapacious Villinous Fellows in the whole Army, leaving in all places marks of their Barbarity and Roguery, ſo that in <hi>England</hi> eſpecially, they have been looked upon by all People as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nuſance and Grievance of the Kingdom; and by their Pillaging Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Robberies, and Murders, they are uttterly Deteſted and Abominated by all that have had the Misfortune to know them.</p>
            <p>About two years agoe they raiſed a Diſturbance even the City of <hi>London,</hi> near their Quarters at <hi>White Chappell,</hi> a while after at <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> upon no reaſonable pretence but their own Ravenous and Tumultuous Humours, they were after the preſent Kings coming to Town ſent to <hi>Ipſwich</hi> again to Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and were deſigned by his Majeſty, and the Honourable Parliament for the Service of our great Friends the <hi>States,</hi> but they being for ſometime uſed to a Luxurious Idle Life in <hi>London,</hi> did not only ſeem to decline that Service but any other, under pretence of not having their Arrears paid them, whereupon his moſt Gracious Majeſty forthwith Orders their full Arrears and Pay, (but like true Villains) they now finding that Excuſe baulked, were reſolved to raiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and no ſooner had they received their Pay, but they immediately Seize their own Officers binding and ſecuring them, and drawing out they pretend to Declare for the late Abdicated <hi>King James,</hi> and offer great Violences to ſeveral of their Officers and others who endeavoured to perſwade them quietly to lay down, and be quiet; and fearing they ſhould be too weak to ſtand the Force of the Country, they endeavour to force ſome Ships to Tranſport them to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to raſe and foment Diviſions in that Kingdonm, but Notice being ſent to the Commanders of ſome of his Majeſties Ships in the Port, Eight men of War pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drew out to attend their Motion, and the News being brought Yeſterday to King and Parliament, Five Regiments were Ordered forthwith to March to reduce them, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord <hi>Devonſhires,</hi> two of <hi>Dutch Dragoons,</hi> and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to Day it was moved in Parliament that they might forthwith be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Rebels and expoſed to the will of the Country, who no doubt will be glad of ſo good an Opportunity of Puniſhing ſuch Rebellious Miſcreants, and making them Examples to the other baſe Corrupted part of the late Kings Army, who by a long Diſcontinuance from Martial Diſcipline are ſo diſſolved in Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Debauchery, that they may more juſtly be called a Neſt of Vagabonds and Cowards, than an Army of Valiant and truly honeſt <hi>Edgliſh-men.</hi>
