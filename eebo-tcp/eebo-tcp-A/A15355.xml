            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

While the King her father euermore requiring deliberation vpon whome rather than other to bestow this his so inestimable a Iewell, he beganne sodainely to haue an vnlawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence to growe in himselfe, which hée augmented with an outragious flame of cruelty sparkling in his hart, and accompted her so worthy in the world, that shée was too worthy for any, but himselfe. Thus being wrapped with this vnnaturall loue, he sustained such a conflict in his thoughts, wherein Madnesse puts Modesty to flight, giuing ouer his affections to the vnlawfulnesse of his will, rather then subdued them with the remembraunce of the euill hée had then in practise, so that not long after comming into his daughters Chamber, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that were néere at her attendance to depart, as if he had had some carefull and fatherly busines, the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of whose import desired some priuate conference with her, he beganne to make motion of that vniust loue to her, which euen Lust it selfe, had it not in a father béene so bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with impudencie, would haue blusht but euen to haue thought vpon. Much perswasion, though to little reason, he vsed, as, that he was her father, whome shée was bound to obey, he was a King that had power to commaund, he was in loue, and his loue was resistlesse, and if resistlesse, therefore pittilesse, either to youth, blood, or beauty: In briefe, he was a tyrant and would execute his will. These wordes thus vttered with that vehement passion which such sinnefull Louers fitte themselues vnto in such desires, and such immodest sillables were by him contracted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that my penne grubbes to recite them, and made the schoole of his daughters thoughts, (wherein were neuer taught such euills) to wonder at the strangenesse, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding them not, and at last, to demaund of her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly father, what hée meant by this, when he forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

It is beyond imagination to thinke whether her eyes had power to receiue her sorrowes brine so fast as her heart did send it to them. In briefe, they were nowe no more to be called eyes, for griefes water had blinded them: and for wordes, she had not one to vtter, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her hearts intent, and tongues vtterance, there lay such a pile of lamentable cogitations, that she had no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to make vp any of them into wordes, till at the last, a Nurse that attended her comming in, and finding her face blubbered with teares, which shée knew were strange guests to the table of her beauty, first standing in amaze thereat, at last, by the care shée had in charge of her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more inheartned; Deare childe and Madam (quoth shée) why sit you so sorrowfully? which question, getting way betwixt griefe and her vtteraunce, Oh my beloued Nurse, answered the Lady, euen now two noble names were lost within this Chamber, the name of both a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a Child. The meaning of which secret the Nurse vnderstanding not, shée intreated her to be more plaine, that by knowing the cause of her griefe, shée might vse meanes to redresse it, or else, that her selfe in her owne wisedome would alay the violence of that tempest which did wrong to so goodly a building. But shée loath to be the bellowes of her owne shame, and blushing more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse than her Father was to commit, sate sighing, and continued silent, vntill <hi>Antiochus,</hi> not satisfied with the fruite obtained by his former desire, returned, and like

When as if all the gods had giuen a plaudite to his wordes, the Fishermen, who before were sent out by their Maister to dragge out the other nettes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found somwhat in the botome too ponderous for their strength to pull vp, they beganne to lewre and hallow to their Maister for more helpe, crying that there was a fish hung in their net, like a poore mans case in the Laws, it would hardly come out, but Industry being a preuayling workeman, before helpe came, vp came the Fish expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but prooued indéede to be a rusty armour. At the name of which word Armour, <hi>Pericles</hi> being rowzed, he desired of the poore Fishermen, that he who better than they, was

acquainted with such furniture, might haue the view of it. In briefe, what hée could aske of them, was granted: the Armour is by <hi>Pericles</hi> viewed, and knowne to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which his father at his last will gaue him in charge to kéepe, that it might prooue to be a defender of the sonne, which he had knowne to be a preseruer of the father: so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compting all his other losses nothing, since he had that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, whereby his father could not challenge him of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: and thanking Fortune, that after all her cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, shée had yet giuen him somewhat to repayre his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, begging this Armour of the Fishermen, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that with it hée would shew the vertue hée had learned in Armes, and trie his chiualry for their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Thaysa,</hi> which they applauding, and one furnishing him with an old gowne to make Caparisons for his horse, which horse hée prouided with a Iewel, whom all the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the sea could not bereaue from his arme, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther furnishing him with the long side skirtes of their cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sockes, to make him bases, his Armour rusted: and thus disgracefully habilited, Prince <hi>Pericles</hi> with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is gone to the Court of <hi>Symonides,</hi> where the Fisher men had fore-tolde him was all the preparation, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Art or Industrie might attaine vnto, to solemnize the birth day of faire <hi>Thaysa</hi> the good King <hi>Symonides</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

The second, a Prince of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the Deuice hée bare vpon his shield was a wreathe of Chiualry, the word, <hi>Me pompae prouexet apex,</hi> the desire of renowne drew him to this enterprise.

The fift of <hi>Athens,</hi> and his Deuice was a flaming Torch turned downeward, the word, <hi>Qui me alit me extinguit,</hi> that which giues me life giues me death. The fixt and last was <hi>Pericles</hi> Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> who hauing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Page to deliuer his shield, nor shield to deliuer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Deuice according to his fortunes, which was a withered Braunch being onely gréene at the top, which prooued the abating of his body, decayed not the noblenesse of his minde, his word, <hi>In hac spe viuo,</hi> In that hope I liue. Himselfe with a most gracefull curtesie presented it vnto her, which shée as curteously receiued, whilest the Péeres attending on the King forbare not to scoffe, both at his presence, and the present hée brought, being himselfe in a rusty Armour, the Caparison of his horse of plaine country russet, and his owne Bases but the skirtes of a poore Fishermans coate, which the King mildely reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them for, hée tolde them, that as Uertue was not to be approoued by wordes, but by actions, so the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward habite was the least table of the inward minde, and counselling them not to condemne ere they had cause to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse:


<pb facs="tcp:4712:14"/>
They went forward to the triumph, in which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exercise they came almost all, as short of <hi>Pericles</hi> perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as a body dying, of a life flourishing. To be short, both of Court and Commons, the praises of none were spoken of, but of the meane Knights (for by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name he was yet vnknowne to any.) But the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes being ended, <hi>Pericles</hi> as chiefe, (for in this dayes honour hée was Champion) with all the other Princes, were by the Kings Marshall conducted into the Presence, where <hi>Symonides</hi> and his daughter <hi>Thaysa,</hi> with a most stately banquet stayed to giue them a thankefull intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At whose entraunce, the Lady first saluting <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> gaue him a wreathe of Chiualry, welcommed him as her knight and guest, and crowned him King of that dayes noble enterprise. In the end, all being seated by the Marshall at a table, placed directly ouer-against where the king and his daughter sate as it were by some diuine operation, both King and daughter, at one instant were so strucke in loue with the noblenesse of his woorth, that they could not spare so much time to satisfie themselues with the delicacie of their viands, for talking of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: while <hi>Pericles</hi> on the other side obseruing the dignity wherein the King sate, that so many Princes came to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, so many Péeres stoode ready to attend him, hée was strucke with present sorrow, by remembring the losse of his owne. Which the good <hi>Symonides</hi> taking note of, and accusing himselfe before there was cause, that <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> spirites were dumpt into their melancholy, through some dislike of the slackenesse hée found in his entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or neglect of his woorth, calling for a boule of wine, hée dranke to him, and so much further honoured him, that he made his daughter rise from her seate to beare it to him, and withall, willing her to demaund of him his name, Countrey, and fortunes, a message (gentle Lady) shée was as ready to obey vnto, as her Father was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, reioycing that shée had any occasion offered her


<pb facs="tcp:4712:15"/>
whereby shée might speake vnto him. <hi>Pericles</hi> by this time hath pledged the King, and by his daughter (according to his request) thus returneth what hée is, that hée was a Gentleman of <hi>Tyre,</hi> his name <hi>Pericles,</hi> his education béene in Artes and Armes, who looking for aduentures in the world, was by the rough and vnconstant Seas, most vnfortunately bereft both of shippes and men, and after shipwrecke, throwen vpon that shoare. Which mis-haps of his the king vnderstanding of, hée was strucke with present pitty to him, and rising from his state, he came foorth with and imbraced him, bade him be chéered, and tolde him, that whatsoeuer misfortune had impayred him of, Fortune, by his helpe, could repayre to him, for both himselfe and Countrey should be his friendes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently calling for a goodly milke white Stéede, and a payre of golden spurres, them first hée bestowed vppon him, telling him, they were the prises due to his merite, and ordained for that dayes enterprise: which kingly cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie <hi>Pericles</hi> as thankefully accepting.

First hée beganne to remember him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that he came vnto his Court but poore, and for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, quoth the good king, tis a woorkemanship, that Nature makes vppe euen for others to contemne, and, which in these times, is growne odious to kéepe companie withall, that to marrie her which was his onely childe, and the expectation of his subiectes, with one of so lowe blood and meane discent, would returne, rather a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour than a dignitie to his name, since Parents rather expect the aduauncement of Titles, and the raising of their houses, in the vniting of their issue, than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining: but in the end, when hée had put all the Interiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he could betwéen her loue and his liking, his vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse made him sée, that in vertue consisted mans onely perfection, and in him, as her be fitting Court, she thought it fittest to kéepe her royall residence, and in that opinion allowing of his daughters choice, hée thought himselfe happy to liue Father to such a vertuous sonne, and his daughter more happy to be coupled to so noble a husband. And as hée was now thus contracting them together in his reioycing thoughts, euen in the instant came in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,</hi> to giue his Grace that salutation which the morning required of him, when the king intending to dissemble that in shew, which hée had determined on in heart, hée first tolde him, that his daughter had that morning sent vnto

him that Letter, wherein shée intreated of him, that his Grace would be pleased, that himselfe (whom shée knew to call by no other name but the Stranger <hi>Pericles</hi>) might become her Schoolemaister, of whose rariety in musicke, excellencie in song, with comelinesse in dauncing, not onely shée had heard, but himselfe had borne testimonie to be the best, that euer their iudgements had had cause to iudge of. When <hi>Pericles,</hi> though willing to yéelde any courtesies to so gratious a Lady, and not disdaining to be commaunded any seruices by so good a Lord, yet replyed, Though all his abilities were at his Graces pleasure, yet he thought himselfe vnwoorthy to be his daughters schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister.

                  <hi>Pericles</hi> then, insteade of humblenesse séemed not to forget his auntient courage, but boldely replyed, That were it any in his Court, except himselfe, durst call him traytor, euen in his bosome he would write the lie: affirming, that he came into his Court in search of honour, and not to be a rebell to his State, his bloud was yet vntainted, but with the heate, got by the wrong the king had offered him, and that he boldly durst, and did defie, himselfe, his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, and the prowdest danger, that eyther tyranny or treason could inflict vpon him. Which noblenesse of his, the king inwardly commending, though otherwise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling, he answered, he should prooue it otherwise, since by his daughters hand, if there was euident, both his practise and her consent therein. Which wordes were no sooner vttered, but <hi>Thaysa</hi> (who euer since she sent her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Letter, could not containe her selfe in any quiet, till she heard of his answer) came now in, as it had beene her parte, to make aunswere to her Fathers last sillable, when prince <hi>Pericles</hi> yéelding his body toward her, in most curteous manner demaunded of her by the hope she had of heauen, or the desire she had to haue her best wishes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled héere in the worlde, that shée would now satisfie, her now displeased Father, if euer he, by motion, or by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by amorons glaunces, or by any meanes that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vse to compasse their disseignes, had sought to be a friend in the noblenesse of her thoughts, or a copartner in the worthinesse of her loue, when she as constant to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, as she was forward to attempt, againe required of him, that suppose he had, who durst take offence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, since that it was her pleasure to giue him to knowe that he had power to desire no more than she had willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to performe? How minion, quoth her Father (taking her off at the very word, who dare be displeased withall?) Is this a fit match for you? a stragling <hi>Theseus</hi> borne we knowe not where, one that hath neither bloud nor merite for thée to hope for, or himselfe to challenge euen the least


<pb facs="tcp:4712:19"/>
allowaunce of thy perfections, when she humbling her princely knées before her Father, besought him to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that suppose his birth were base (when his life she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him not to be so) yet hée had vertue, which is the very ground of all nobilitie, enough to make him noble: she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to remember that she was in loue, the power of which loue was not to be confined by the power of his will. And my most royall Father, quoth shée, what with my penne I haue in secret written vnto you, with my tongue now I openly confirme, which is, that I haue no life but in his loue, neither any being but in the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his worth. But daughter (quoth <hi>Symonides</hi>) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualles to equalls, good to good is ioyned, this not being so, the bauine of your minde in rashnesse kindled, must againe be quenched, or purchase our displeasure. And for you sir (speaking to prince <hi>Pericles</hi>) first learne to know, I banish you my Court, and yet scorning that our kingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement should stoope so lowe, for that your ambition sir, Ile haue your life. Be constant, quoth <hi>Thaysa,</hi> for euerie droppe of blood hée sheades of yours, he shall draw an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his onely childe. In briefe, the king continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed still his rage, the Lady her constancie. While <hi>Pericles</hi> stoode amazed at both, till at last the Father being no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger able to subdue that which he desired as much as shee, catching them both rashly by the handes, as if hée meant strait to haue inforced them to imprisonment heclapt them hand in hand, while they as louingly ioyned lip to lip, and with tears trickling from his aged eyes, adopted him his happy sonne, and bade them liue together as man and wife. What ioy there was at this coupling, those that are Louers and enioy their wishes, can better conceiue, than my pen can set downe; the one reioycing to be made happy by so good and gentle a Lord, the other as happy to be inriched by so vertuous a Lady. What preparation there was for their marriage, is sufficiently expressed in this, that she was the onely daughter to a king, and had

her fathers liking in her loue: what spéede there was to that marriage, let those iudge who haue the thoughtes of <hi>Thaysa</hi> at this instant, only conceiue the solempnities at the Temple are doone, the feast in most solempne order fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, the day spent in musicke, dauncing, singing, and all Courtly communication, halfe of the night in maskes and other courtly shewes, and the other halfe in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and lawfull imbracements of these most happy Louers.

               <p>The Chest then being nayled vp close, he commaunded it to be lifted ouer-boorde, and then naming his Childe <hi>Marina,</hi> for that she was borne vppon the Sea, he dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Maister to alter the course from <hi>Tyre,</hi> (being a shorter cutte to <hi>Tharsus</hi>) and for whose safety he thither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, where with his hoste <hi>Cleon</hi> and <hi>Dionysa</hi> his wife, he intended to leaue his little infant, to be fostered and brought vp.

<pb facs="tcp:4712:22"/>
apply his time in Letters, and in searching out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Simples, that he grew so excellent in the secret of Physicke, as if <hi>Apollo</hi> himselfe, or another <hi>Aesculapius</hi> had béene his Schoolemaister: nor was he of this plentie a niggard to the néedie, but so bountifull to the distressed, that his house and hand were accompted the hospitalls for the diseased. This Lord <hi>Cerimon</hi> had his residence built so neare the shoare, that in his windowes he ouer-looked the Sea: and being this morning in conference with some that came to him both for helpe for themselues, and reliefe for others; and some that were relating the crueltie of the last nights tempest on a sodayne casting his eye from foorth his casement towards the maine, he might espie the waters, as it were, playing with the Chest wherein the dead Quéene was incoffind, and which was vpon the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne, by a more eager billow, cast on his bankes, when presently thinking it to be the remnant of some shippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, caused in the last nights storme, calling for his seruants, hée foorthwith commaunded them to haue it brought vppe to him as forseited vnto him, being cast on his ground, which accordingly performed, hée as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently gaue charge it should be opened, when not without much wonder he straitway viewed the dead body of the Quéene, so crowned, so royally apparelled, so intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured as before, and taking vp the writing which he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise found placed vpon her breast, hée read it to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who at that time accompanied him, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it thereby to be the dead Quéene to Prince <hi>Pericles.</hi> Now surely, quoth <hi>Pericles,</hi> thou hast a bodie euen drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with woe for the losse of so goodly a creature: for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, sayde he, as you may perceiue, such was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of her beauty, that grimme Death himselfe hath not power to suffer any deformitie to accompany it. Then laying his hand gently vpon her chéeke, he bethought him that life had not lost all the workemanshippe that Nature had bestowed vppon her, for euen at the opening of the


<pb facs="tcp:4712:23"/>
Chest, &amp; as it were she then receiuing fresh aire, he might perceue, a new but calm glowing to recspire in her chéeks, with which being somewhat amazed. Now surely Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, quoth hée turning to them, who were gréedily set round about him, this Quéene hath not long béene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunced, and I haue read of some Egyptians, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter foure houres death, (if man may call it so) haue raised impouerished bodies, like to this, vnto their former health, nor can it be disparagement to me to vse my best practise on this Quéene, to which by the Gentlemen that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed him, hée was incouraged to attempt, since that the recouery of her could not but appeare to be a worke of wonder, and since that his fortune was so successefull in his ministring, that all <hi>Fphesus</hi> was repleate with his helpe, so calling for a seruant of his to attend him with certayne boxes which he named were in his studie, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with fire and necessary linnen, inuoking <hi>Apollo</hi> to be gratious to his empericke, and the worke in hand, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to apply to her, First pulling downe the clothes from off the Ladies bosome, he powred vppon her a most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oyntment, and bestowing it abroad with his hand, perceiued some warmth in her breast, and that there was life in the body, whereat somewhat astonished, he felt her pulses, layde his chéeke to her mouth, and examining all other tokens that he could deuise, he perceiued how death stroue with life within her, and that the conflict was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and doubtfull who should preuaile. Which bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, he chased the body against the fire, vntill the bloud which was congealed with colde was wholly dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when powring a precious liquor into her mouth, hée perceiued warmth more &amp; more to encrease in her, and the golden fringes of her eyes alitle to part: then calling softly to the Gentlemen who were witnesses about him, he bade them that they should commaund some still musicke to found. For certainely quoth he, I thinke this Quéene will liue, and suppose that she hath bin much abused, for


<pb facs="tcp:4712:23"/>
she hath not béene long intraunced, condemning them for rashnesse so hassily to throwe her ouer boorde. And when he had so said, he tooke the body reuerently into his armes, and bare it into his owne Chamber, and layed it vpon his bed groueling vpon the breast, then tooke hée certaine hote and comfortable oiles, and warming them vpon the coles, he dipped faire wooll therein, and fomented all the bodie ouer therewith, vntill such time as the congealed bloud and humours were thorowly resolued, and the spirites in due forme recouered their woonted course, the veines wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed warme, the arteries beganne to beate, and the lungs drew in the fresh ayre againe, and being perfectly come to her selfe, lifting vp those now againe pricelesse diamonds of her eyes, O Lord (quoth shée) where am I? for it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me that I haue béene in a strange Countrey. And wheres my Lord I pray you? I long to speake with him. But <hi>Cerimon,</hi> who best knew, that now with any thing to discomfort her, might bréede a relapse, which would be vnrecouerable, intreated her to be chéered, for her Lord was well, and that anone, when the time was more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and that her decayed spirites were repayred, hée would gladly speake with her: So, as it were, being but newly awaked from death, to the great amasement of the beholders, she presently tell into a most comfortable slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which Lord <hi>Cerimon</hi> giuing charge none should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe her of, he in the meane time, and against she should awake, prouided cherishing meates, and as her strength grew, gaue wholesome clothes to refresh her with.

Déere Friends and Cittizens of <hi>Tharsus,</hi> If you shall happly wonder, why we thus vnwoontedly wéep and mourne in your sight, it is because the ioy of our eyes and staffe of our olde age <hi>Marina</hi> is dead, whose absence hath left vnto vs nothing but salt teares, and sorrowfull harts, as if by her death we were diuided from all comfort, yet haue we here taken order for her funeralls, and buried her (as héere you sée) according to her degrée, which losse of hers was right grieuous to all the people, nor was there any that was capable of sorrowe, but spent it for her, so that with one boyce and willing handes, they attended <hi>Dyonysa</hi> to the Market place whereas her fathers Image stoode, made of brasse, and erected also another to her with this Inscription:</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4712:28"/>
what mischiefe am I wrapped in, what might I do or say héerein? The Father of that Uirgine deliuered this Citty from the perill of death, for this Citties sake hée suffered ship wracke, lost his goodes, and endured penury, and now he is requited with euill for good, his daughter which hée committed by my care to be brought vp, is now deuoured by the cruelty of my wife, so that I am depriued, as it were, of mine owne eyes, and forced to bewaile the death of that Innocent, she in whose presence, as in the fortune ef mine own posterity I should haue had delight. And then demaunding of <hi>Dyonysa</hi> how she could giue prince <hi>Pericles</hi> accompt of his childe, hauing robbed him of his childe, how she could appease the fury of his wrath, if her acte were knowne to him? or how alay the displeasure of the gods, from whome nothing can be hid. For <hi>Pericles</hi> quoth she, if such a pious innocent as your selfe do not reueale it vnto him, how should he come to the knowledge thereof, since that the whole Citty is satisfied by the monument I caused to be erected, and by our dissembling outside, that she died naturally, and for the gods, let them that list be of the minde to thinke they can make stones speake, and raise them vp in euidence, for my parte I haue my wish, I haue my safety, and feare no daunger till it fall vpon me. But <hi>Cleon</hi> rather cursing then commending this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duracy in her, he continued mourning vnfainedly, but she according to her sinful condition. By this time the pirats (who before rescued <hi>Marina,</hi> when she should haue béene slaine by trecherous <hi>Leonine</hi>) are now ariued at <hi>Meteline,</hi> and in the Market place of the Cittie, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, amongst other bondslaues, offered her to be solde, whither all sorts of people, comming to supply their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, <hi>Marina</hi> was net without much commendations gazed vpon of the buyers, some commending her beauty, others her sober countenaunce, all pittying her mishap, and praysing her perfections, which prayses of her, were so spread through the Citty, that from all parts they came

The she Bawd beganne to instruct her, with what complement she should enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her customers: she first asked her, if she were a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.


<pb facs="tcp:4712:29"/>
When <hi>Marina</hi> replyed, she thanked the Gods, shée neuer knew what it was to be otherwise. In so being quoth the she bawde, you haue béene well: but now in plaine tearmes I must teach you how to be worse. It is not goodnesse in you (quoth <hi>Marina</hi>) to teach me to be so: for goodnes answerd the bawd, it is a Lecture, such as we vse seldome, &amp; our consciences neuer reade one to another, &amp; therefore attend vnto me: you must now be like a stake for euery man to shoote at, you must be like a foord that must receiue all waters, you must haue the benefite of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and séeme to take delight in all men. I thanke my starres, answered <hi>Marina,</hi> I am displeased with none: for by this answere it appeared such was the puritie of her minde, that she vnderstoode not what this deuills sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor pleaded vnto her: but she quickely taking her off, told in more immodest phrase, that shée had payde for her, and that she and all her body was hers, that will ye nill ye she must now be what she her selfe had béene (and there is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome any bawde, but before time, hath béene a whoore) that to conclude, shée had bought her like a beast, and shée meant to hire her out.</p>
               <p>When she vnderstanding vnwillingly what all these wordes tended vnto, she fell prostrate at her féete, and with teares showred downe in aboundaunce, she intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, not to make hire of her bodie to so diseasefull a vse, which shée hoped the gods had ordained to a more happy purpose. When the bawde answered her, Come, come, these droppes auaile thée not, thou arte now mine, and I will make my best of thée: and I must now learne you to know, we whom the worlde calles Bawdes, but more properly are to be stiled Factors for men, are in this like the hangman, neither to regard prayers, nor teares, but our owne profite. So calling for her slaue, which was gouernour ouer her she-houshold, this was her appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto him, Goe quoth shée and take this Mayden, as shée is thus decked in costly apparrel (for it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,

that the former Pirates had no way dispoyled her of her ornaments, with purpose to prise her at the higher rate) and leading her along, this be the crie tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole Citty, That whosoeuer desireth the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of so wondrous a beauty, shall for his first enioying her, pay tenne péeces of golde, and that afterward shée shall be common vnto the people for one péece at a time. Which will of hers, <hi>Marina</hi> being no way able to resist, but with her sorrowe, onely desiring of the good gods, to be protectors of her chastitie: She with this her slaue was hurried along, and who with the tenour of his priapine proclamation, had so awaked the intemperaunce of the whole Cittie, that against her returne, of high and low there was a full corwding at the doore, euery man carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his money in his hand, and thinking him the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est man that might first haue accesse. But heauen who is still a protector of Uertue against Uice, ordayned this for <hi>Marina,</hi> that the sending her abroad, with purpose, first to shew her, and after, to make sale of her to the worlde, was the onely meanes to defend her in the state of her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie. For as she was (as before is saide) led along, and thousands of people wondring about her, and flocking as it had béene so many flies, to infect so delicate a preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, it happened that <hi>Lysimachus</hi> the chéefe gouernour of <hi>Meteline,</hi> looking out at his windowe, to obserue what strange occasion drew the giddy hauocke of people, to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster themselues into such throngs: he, not without great admiration obserued, that it was to make boote of so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious a beauty, whose inflaming colours which Nature had with her best Arte placed vppon her face, compelled him to censure, that she was rather a deseruing bedfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for a Prince, than a play-fellow for so rascally an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly: so pittying a while her misfortune, that it was so hard, to be throwne into the iaws of two such poisonous and deuouring serpents, a Pandar, and a Bawde, yet at last, being inflamed with alittle sinnefull concupiscence,


<pb facs="tcp:4712:30"/>
by the power of her face, he resolued himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that since shée must fall, it were farre more fitter, into his owne armes, whose authoritie could stretch to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her good, than into the hote imbracements of many, to her vtter ruine; so presently dismissing away a seruant of his, he gaue him charge, to giue in charge to the Bawd, that at the returne home, of this new péece of merchandise of hers, as shée respected, or in time of néede would be beholding to his sauour, (and Heauens forfend but Bawdes nowe and then should stand in néede of authoritie) she should keepe her priuate from the conference of any, for hee himselfe that night late in the euening, in secret, and in some disguise, would (for her guests sake) visite her house. There néeded no further incouragement to bid the Bawde stirre vp her damnable limbes to make all fit. It was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in this, that the Gouernour had sent worde, it was he that was to come. But hauing giuen the best gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish she could to her sinnefull habitation: and <hi>Marina</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned home againe by the Pandar, who had ledde her vp and downe as Beare heards leade beares, for shew first, and to be baited after: Shée tooke her vp with her into a priuate Chamber, when the fruite of her instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were, how she should now learne to behaue her selfe, for she had fortunes comming vppon her, she was nowe to be receiued, respected, and regarded of a man that was honourable. Heauen graunt that I may finde him so, quoth <hi>Marina.</hi> Thou needest not doubt it sweete heart, quoth the Bawde, for though I tell it thée in priuate, which for a million he would not haue to be knowne pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely: Hée is no woorse a man thou arte shortly to deale withall, than the Gouernour of this whole Citty, a Gentleman that is curteous, a fauourer of our calling, one that will as soone haue his hand in his pocket, as such a pretty dilling as thou shalt come in his eye, and not as most of our Gentlemen doe, drawe it out empty, but fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it full of golde, will most loue-like rayne it downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to


<pb facs="tcp:4712:31"/>
his <hi>Danaes</hi> lap. In briefe, he is a Nobleman, and, which is a thing which we respect more than his nobilitie, he is liberall: he is curteous, and thou mayest commaund him, he is vertuous and thou mayest learne of him. All these indéede, answered <hi>Marina,</hi> are properties, due vnto so worthy a Gentleman, whom you picture him to be: and if he be liberall in good, I shall be glad to taste of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: if curteous, I shall as willingly become his seruant: and if vertuous, it shal be in me no way to make him vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Well, well, well, sayes the Bawde, we must haue no more of this puling, and I must haue you learne to know, that vice is as hereditary to our house, as the olde barne to your countrey beggar. But as shée would haue proceeded with more of these her diuelish counsells, hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Chamber came the Pandar vnto them, who as hote as a toste, with his haste to bring the newes he told, them, that the Lorde <hi>Lysimachus</hi> was come, and as if the word Come had béene his kew, he entred the Chamber with the master bawde, when the whole frie of sinners cursying about him, he very largely, as the Prologue to his entertainment, distributed golde among them, and then as roundly demaunded, for that same fresh péece of stuffe, which by their proclamation they tolde, they had now to make sale of, and be of set purpose was come to haue a sight of.</p>
               <p>When they all poynting toward <hi>Marina,</hi> told him there shée was, and for our selues, quoth they, we hauing done the office of right Chamberlaines, brought you together, we will shut the doore after vs, and so leaue you. Who no sooner departed, but <hi>Lysimachus</hi> the Gouernour began to demaund of her the performaunce of that for which he came. When shée prostrating her selfe at his féete, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to take pitty of her, and from poynt to poynt (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting her birth, and death of her parents) discoursed vnto him the whole story of her misfortunes: as that by the practise of <hi>Dyonysa,</hi> and cruelty of <hi>Leonine,</hi> she should


<pb facs="tcp:4712:31"/>
haue béene murthered. And how it pleased the Gods to rescue her from that ruine by certaine Pyrates, who after solde her to this brothell, where, most vnhappy, he was witnesse she remayned. Then gentle Sir, quoth shée, since heauen hath béen so gratious, to restore me from death, let not their good to me, be a meanes for you, to be author of my more misfortune. But the Gouernour suspecting these teares, but to be some new cunning, which her matron the Bawde had instructed her in, to drawe him to a more large expence: He as fréely tolde her so, and now beganne to be more rough with her, vrging her, that he was the Gouernour, whose authoritie coulde wincke at those ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, her selfe, and that sinnefull house could cast vppon her, or his displeasure punish at his owne pleasure, which displeasure of mine, thy beauty shall not priuiledge thée from, nor my affection, which hath drawen me vnto this place abate, if thou with further lingering withstand me. By which wordes, she vnderstanding him to be as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in euill, as she was constant in good, she intreated him but to be heard, and thus she beganne.</p>
               <p>If as you say (my Lorde) you are the Gouernour, let not your authoritie, which should teach you to rule others, be the meanes to make you mis-gouerne your selfe: If the eminence of your place came vnto you by discent, and the royalty of your blood, let not your life prooue your birth a bastard: If it were throwne vpon you by opinion, make good, that opinion was the cause to make you great. What reason is there in your Iustice, who hath power ouer all, to vndoe any? If you take from mée mine honour, you are like him, that makes a gappe into forbidden ground, after whome too many enter, and you are guiltie of all their euilles: my life is yet vnspotted, my chastitie vnstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in thought. Then if your violence deface this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the workemanship of heauen, made vp for good, and not to be the exercise of sinnes intemperaunce, you do kill your owne honour, abuse your owne iustice, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerish

me. Why quoth <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> this house wherein thou liuest, is euen the receptacle of all mens sinn es, and nurse of wickednesse, and how canst thou then be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then naught, that liuest in it? It is not good, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Marina,</hi> when you that are the Gouernour, who should liue well, the better to be bolde to punish euill, doe knowe that there is such a roofe, and yet come vnder it. Is there a necessitie (my yet good Lord) if there be fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, that I must strait then thither flie and burne my selfe? Or if suppose this house, (which too too many féele such houses are) should be the Doctors patrimony, and Surgeons feeding; folowes it therefore, that I must néeds infect my self to giue them maintenance? O my good Lord, kill me, but not deflower me, punish me how you please, so you spare my chastitie, and since it is all the dowry that both the Gods haue giuen, and men haue left to me, do not you take it from me; make me your seruant, I will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obey you; make mée your bond woman, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it fréedome; let me be the worst that is called vile, so I may still liue honest, I am content: or if you thinke it is too blessed a happinesse to haue me so, let me euen now, now in this minute die, and Ile accompt my death more happy than my birth. With which wordes (being spoken vpon her knées) while her eyes were the glasses that carried the water of her mis-hap, the good Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being mooued, hee lift her vp with his hands, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then imbraced her in his hart, saying aside<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is Uirtues image, or rather, Uertues selfe, sent downe from heauen, a while to raigne on earth, to teach vs what we should be. So in steede of willing her to drie her eyes, he wiped the wet himselfe eff, and could haue found in his heart, with modest thoughts to haue kissed her, but that hée feared the offer would offend her. This onely hée sayde, Lady, for such your vertues are, a farre more worthy stile your beuty challenges, and no way lesse your beauty can promise me that you are, I hither came

It shall become you still to be euen as you are, a peece of goodnesse, the best wrought vppe, that euer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made, and if that any shall inforce you ill, if you but send to me, I am your friend. With which promise, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her presence, she most humbly thanked the Gods for the preseruation of her chastitie, and the reformation of his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lysimachus</hi> though departed, thus intended not to leaue her so, but with diligent eyes to attend, how shée beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her selfe to all other, who should haue admittance to her, and for that purpose, hauing power to commaund the Bawde, hée placed himselfe in the next Chamber, where he might heare, euen to a sillable, whatsoere passed, where he was no sooner setled with a former charge giuen to the bawd, that any man should haue accesse to her, but by turnes, he heard she had also won others, and preserued herselfe from them, as she had formerly done against him, gaining tenne times as much of profite by her prayers and teares, as she should haue doone by prostituting her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their willes: at last, all of them being departed, and the house vnfrequented, onely of their owne householde, and of the Gouernour, the bawde standing ready at the doore, as hée should goe out, making his obeysaunce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as hée should returne, in hope of his fée or rewarde, hée with an angry brow turned towards him, saying, Uil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, thou hast a house héere, the weight of whose sinne would sincke the foundation, euen vnto hell, did not the vertue of one that is lodged therein, kéepe it standing; and so, as it were inraged, giuing them nothing, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. By which displeasure of his, the whole swarme of bawdes (as truely it was) ghessed, that their new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt,


<pb facs="tcp:4712:33"/>
had not béene pliant to his will: and all rushing in hastily vppon her, first taking away the golde which the charitie (and not iniury of all who had beene there) had giuen her to reléeue her with, they cried against her, they should be all vndoone by her, their house would grow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed, and their trading would fall to decay, by her squeamishnesse, and want of familiaritie to their Clients, resoluing now, that there was no way to bring her vnto their bowe, but by hauing her rauished. For it is to be noted, not any that parted the house besides <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> but euen as he did, so they in like manner rayled against them, so forcibly had hir perswasions preuailed with them: whereupon, for that purpose they gaue her vp to the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, who first agréed for her, saying; That he that had bargained for the whole ioynt, it was fittest for him to cut a morsell from off the spit. So leauing them together, and telling him, they gaue her vp to his power, to doe euen what he would with her: the man and wife (though both bawdes) departed, when the pandar going to her, tolde her, that he, his master, nor their antient family would as thus long they had béene, be vndoone by ere a Puritane péece of them all. And therefore quoth he; Come on and resolue your selfe without more whining, for I am but the bawdes seruant. The bawde hath commaunded me, and euery seruant by the Indenture of his dnety, is bound to obey his master: So catching her rashly by the hand, as he would haue inforced her to his will; she first calling on <hi>Diana</hi> patronesse of Chastitie to defend her, fell likewise downe at his féete, and besought him but to heare her: which being graunted, she demaunded of him what thing he could wish himselfe to be, which was more vile than he was, or more hatefull than he would make himselfe to be? Why my master or my mistris (quoth the villaine) I thinke, who haue all the sinnes subiect to mankind raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, and are (indéede) as bad as the Diuell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: yet (quoth <hi>Marina</hi>) thou goest about to be worse then


<pb facs="tcp:4712:33"/>
they, and to doe an office at their setting on, which thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster himselfe hath more pitty then to attempt, to robbe me of mine honour, which in spite of them and thée, the Gods (who I hope will protect it still) haue till this breathing protected, to leprous my chast thoghts, with remembrance of so foule a déede, which thou then shalt haue doone, to damne thine owne soule, by vndooing of mine. At which word, the Uillaine being strucke into some remorce, and standing in a pawse, <hi>Marina</hi> went forward, and tolde him; If thou wantest golde, there is some for thée (part of that she had reserued which before was giuen hir, from the bawdes knowledge:) or if thou wantest maintenaunce, prouide mée but some residence in an honest house, and I haue experience in many things which shall labour for thee, as namely, I am skilfull in the seauen Liberall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, well exercised in all studies, and dare approoue this, that my skill in singing and playing on Instruments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeds any in the citty: therefore (quoth she) as thou before didst proclame my beuty in the market to the open world, whereby to haue made me a common prostitute, so now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne proclame my vertues vnto them, and I doubt not but this honorable citty will affoord schollers sufficient, the instructing of whome will returne profite enough, both to repay the Maister what hée payed out for me, prouide an honester course for thée then this thou liuest in, and giue a quiet content vnto my selfe. Sooth (quoth the Uillaine) being now mooued vnto much more compassion of her; If you haue (as you say) these qualities, I will labour with my Master, and doe my best for your release. If not (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Marina,</hi> I giue thée frée leaue to bring me backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and prostitute me to that course which was first pretended for me. In briefe, the Uillaine so laboured with the bawde his maister, that though hée woulde not giue her leaue to depart his house, yet in hope of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, which would come in by her other qualities, she should stay in his house, and none, with her former gréeuances

Which when <hi>Pericles</hi> heard, the very word Death séemed like an edge that cut his heart, his flesh trembled, and his strength failed: yet in that agony a long time standing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mased, with his eyes intentiuely fixed on the ground, and at length recouering himselfe, and taking breath, hée first cast his eyes vppe to heauen, saying; O you Gods! extreamity of passion dooth make mée almost ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse you of iniustice.

But woman, quoth hée, If (as thou sayest) my most déere <hi>Marina</hi> be dead, is the money and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which I also left with you for her, perished with her?

And being now agayne at sea, he vowed to himselfe neuer more to haue fellowshippe or conference with any man, charging all his folowers, of whome <hi>Helycanus</hi> was one, that none of them vpon the paine of his displeasure (and who is ignorant that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of kings is as daungerous as death) should dare to speake vnto him: no not so much as they who attended him with meate, and withall commaunded them, that they should not ordayne for him any more but so small a competence, as might euen scarcely maintaine nature, accompting now that life which he possessed, tedious to him, and wishing death in the most vnfriendly languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In which state while he consisted, pining of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and perplexed in minde, it happened, that at one selfe


<pb facs="tcp:4712:35"/>
same time Lord <hi>Helycanus</hi> going from the Princes shippe, and landing on the shoare, the Gouernour <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> who (as before is mentioned) tenderd <hi>Marina,</hi> was stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the hauen, and noting <hi>Pericles</hi> ships riding there at anker, he beganne with himselfe to commend the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of the vessells, and applaude the state they vphelde in their burthens, and in especially, that of the Admirall wherein the Prince himselfe was, who seeing <hi>Helycanus</hi> come on shoare, and his graue and reuerent countenaunce promising him, to be a father of experience, and worthy of his conference, hee in curteous manner saluted him, and demaunded of him, of whence those shippes were, for sir quoth he, by their armes and ensignes I perceiue they are strangers to our harbours, as also that it would please him to deliuer to him who was the owner of them, when <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycanus,</hi> as in the whole Storie, discoursed vnto him his misfortunes, as also of his former woorth, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent languishment, from which he could not be remooued, neither by his owne wisedome, nor by the counsell of his friends. When <hi>Lysimachus</hi> pittying his ruins, intreated <hi>Helycanus</hi> that he might speake with him, whereby to try if his perswasions had power to preuayle with him more then the will of himselfe, or power of his subiects. Which being by <hi>Helycanus</hi> graunted, he foorthwith conducted him downe where his Maister lay: whom when <hi>Lysima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> beheld, so attired from the ordinary habite of other men, as with a long ouer-growne beard, diffused hayre, vndecent nayles on his fingers, and himselfe lying vppon his cowch groueling on his face. He somewhat astonished at the strangenes thereof, caled vnto him with a soft voice, Prince <hi>Pericles,</hi> who hearing himselfe named, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to be some of his men, that called vpon him contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his cemmaundement, hée arose vp sodainely with a fierce countenaunce: but seeing him to be a stranger, verie comely and honourably attyred, hee shruncke himselfe downe vppon his pillow, and held his peace. When <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simachus</hi>


                  <pb facs="tcp:4712:36"/>
demaunded of <hi>Helycanus</hi> if it were his custome to be so silent to all men. Sir, it is quoth he, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued so for the space of this moneth, neither dare any of vs his subiects, though we suffer much sorrow for him, by our perswasions séeke to alter him. Now surely quoth <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simachus,</hi> though his misfortunes haue beene great, and by which he hath great cause for this sorrow, it is great pitty he should continue thus peruerse and obstinate, or so noble a gentleman come to so dishonorable a death: and thereuppon bethinking with himselfe what honourable meanes he might vse to recouer him. He sodainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the wisedom that he had known <hi>Marina</hi> had in perswasion: and hauing heard since of her excellent skill in musicke, singing and dauncing: he by the consent of <hi>Helycanus</hi> caused her to be sent for, resoluing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that if the excellencie of her ministry had no power to worke on him, all phisicke was in vaine, and he from thence would resigne him ouer to his graue. The messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger spéedily is returned, bringing <hi>Marina</hi> along with him: whome when <hi>Lysimachus</hi> beheld, <hi>Marina</hi> quoth he, let me request of thée, thy help and vttermost knowledge in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the owner of this shippe which lieth in darkenesse, and will receiue no comfort, nor come abroade into the light, for the sorrow that he conceiueth through the losse of a wife and a daughter. From which if thou recouer him, and to his former health restore him, I will, as I am a Gentleman, giue thée in recompence thirtie sistercies of golde, and as many of siluer, and though the bawd hath bought thée, according to the laws of our citty, from whom no authoritie can compell thée, yet for thirtie dayes will I redéeme thée. Which when <hi>Marina</hi> heard, shée went boldely downe into the cabine to him, and with a milde voyce saluted him, saying; God saue you sir, and be of good comfort, for an innocent Uirgin, whose life hath bin distressed by shipwrack, and her chastity by dishonesty, and hath yet bin preserued from both, thus curteously saluteth
