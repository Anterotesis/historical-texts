            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of the speciall motives of my resolution, to follow this work in parcells, was the apparent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, that if in this time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of my old age, I should have delayed to put forth some part of it, till all had been ready, the whole
<pb facs="tcp:50629:5"/>
might have been miscarried, or marred by some passage of providence, which might have befallen me. But seeing it hath pleased the Lord to spare my life, and my health, and my liberty in his service, as I wanted not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of grave Authors before me to divide the whole Book of the Psalmes into three fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and to dedicate every part to severall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: So I judged it good thrift to take occasion thereby, to testifie my bound duty and respect, to so many of the Noble friends of <hi>Sion,</hi> as I could overtake, and that with a minde to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour all the rest, who have put their shoulder to the work of setling Religion, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ among us: whose labours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they should have no other fruit in our time, then the right stateing of the question between us and all adversaries of the true doctrine, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and discipline of Christs house, as it is set down in the Confession of faith; in the directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for publick worship, and in the Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christs Church, drawn forth from Scripture warrant; yet even that much is worth all the expense of whatsoever is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, by any, or all the Lords worthies, upon Religion. And howsoever the Lord doth claime, and call for the whole glory of this work to himselfe alone, by staining the pride of the glory of all instruments whereof he hath
<pb facs="tcp:50629:5"/>
made use about it (as now appeareth) lest the glory due to himselfe in all and every one of the passages of promoting the same should be ecclipsed, yet will he never utterly reject this service, nor disallow the upright endeavours of his servants therein; but will in his own time, and way, both advance it, and bear witnesse to his faithfull servants in and about it, wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he hath a minde to keep house, or to Reigne as King in <hi>Sion.</hi> Yea, he will also make it known to the world, that as on the one hand, he will not want a visible Kingdome in the world, (though not of this world) so on the other hand, that his Kingdome shall be so farre from hindring the civill Government of Magistrates, where it hath place, that by the contrary it shall be a chiefe prop, and pillar of every Kingdome, where it is received.</p>
            <p>In this number of upright promoters of the Kingdome of Christ, Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath been alwayes looked upon all the time of our late troubles, as one very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: and I since my first admission into your Lordships acquaintance, have observed your constant care and endeavour, as to know what was the right indifficile questions, so also to hold it fast according to your power, after you had discovered it. Which as it may be your Lordships comfort, so is it your commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:50629:6"/>
and all mens duty to do the like, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this dangerous time, wherein sinnes pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, and not repented of, are so severely and justly punished, by Gods giving over the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent to the open professing and defending of their unrepented faults; for God in justice and wisdom, has suffered the hedges of his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to be broken down, and the holy disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of his house to be so set at nought by all sorts of persons, that every spirit of errour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving open way to come in at the breach, he might thereby try and exercise all his people, who stand in Covenant with him by Profession and reclaim or punish such as live in errour: And no wonder that he so should do, for when there is so little use made of the holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Religion, when the Scriptures are either not read, or not esteemed of, when the forme of godlinesse is separated from upright en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to feel and shew forth the life and power of it, when the grace of the Gospel is turned into wantonnesse, and men are become so much the more bold to sin, as they do heare much of the mercifulnesse of God, when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry divine truth is either not beleeved at all, or received only with humane and temporary faith: when Christ is looked upon by many only as a man, and not as God manifested in the flesh, not as the eternal Son of God, who
<pb facs="tcp:50629:6"/>
from everlasting was with God, and was God, Co-worker in the Creation, with the Father and the Spirit, when Christ is confessed to be Christ, but not employed as Mediatour; or (as if men had need of him) not made use of in his Offices; when many do cast open their soules unto, and seek after another spirit then the Spirit of truth, the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, who according to the Scriptures, both wounds and heales the consciences of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and sanctifieth the heart and conversation of all them that come to God through Christ. In this time (I say) when these and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ungodly practices of men, walking after the imagination of their own heart, do so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; what wonder ir it that the Lord hath let loose so many unclean spirits, as no history can shew more in so short a time in any age, or in any place of the world, by whose ranging up and down among us, God is about to make manifest the stability and sincerity of the faith of them, who are approved, and to take trial of others, (in whom such damnable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as by the doctrine of devils, are now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended, will be found unrepented) whether after they shall hear their ungodly pranks main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and patronized, by some Sect-master, Heretick or Schismatick, they will abhor such abominable doctrine, and repent their owne
<pb facs="tcp:50629:7"/>
former mis-deeds, which have spoken the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of some of those vile errours; Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will justifie their own faults, (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their Sect-masters do teach them to do,) either by despising all the Ordinances, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves above the same, or by rejecting the commands and cords of the moral Law, will loose themselves from the obedience thereof, as if Christ had freed the believer from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and authority of the Law, no lesse then from the Covenant and curse thereof; or by blaspheming the Scripture, will cry down the truth, and the use and power of it; or by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling every truth in question, will exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the bonds of all Religion; or will walk after the imagination of their own heart, and make their own conceits their Oracle, their fancie their faith, and their lusts their God; or will, by opposing one or other of the Persons of the Godhead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deny and separate the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Essence of one God in three Persons; or by receiving the doctrine of some of those many lesser antichrists which are in the world, will incorporate themselves in the great mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body of that one Antichrist, spoken of in Scripture; or in a word, will by rejecting the truth, and not receiving of it in love, when it is offered, bring in upon themselves strong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and give a powerful possession of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb facs="tcp:50629:7"/>
to the devil, whereby he may so rule in them, as to make them vent whatsoever hell can devise, to the dishonour of God and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, that all such may be damned, as for their not receiving the truth in love, so also for their taking pleasure in unrighteousnesse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Apostle did prophecie should come to passe, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
            <p>In such a time therefore as this is, wherein the Lord is manifesting, who are of God, and who not, who do know God, and who not; who do follow the Spirit of truth, and who are led by the spirit of errour, and is deciphering them by this infallible mark which the Apostle giveth, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.6. that the one giveth a beleeving and obediential eare to the Penmen of holy Scripture; the other doth not so; what a mercie, yea, what an honour and happinesse is it for the Lords children, to make such use of a setled Ministry (which is the great gift of Christ bestowed upon his Church,) as not to be carried about with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry winde of doctrine, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13, 14. not to be led away with the errour of the wicked, nor fall from their own sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse, but to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18. Which grace, and honour, and happinesse, that it may

            <head>A BRIEF EXPLICATION Upon the last Fifty Psalmes.</head>
            <head>PSALM CI.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Avid,</hi> not being as yet entered in possession of his Kingdome, doth by direction of the holy Spirit, fall upon a consideration of the duties of a righteous Prince, which he setteth down as a rule, to be followed by himself and all Magistrates, obliging himself, to endeavour to conforme his Government thereto: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is but a type and shadow of Christ, in whom alone the perfect performance of the duties here promised are to be found. The principal duties which <hi>David</hi> undertaketh to discharge, may be, for orders sake, reduced to the number of eight, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the verses.</p>
            </argument>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 1. I</hi> Will sing of mercy and judgement, unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.</q>
            <p>The first duty which he undertaketh, is, to delight himself in all royal vertues, required for the Government of good or bad subjects; and to make those duties his Song; and to approve
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50629:11"/>
himself to God for the sincerity of his intention in this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. All the duties of righteous Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be comprehended under these two heads, <hi>mercy and judgement</hi>; for, <hi>mercy</hi> taketh in the care of the poor, needy, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed or injured; and <hi>judgement</hi> taketh in the care of equity, and righteous dealing among the subjects, with the rewarding of the good, and punishing of evil doers: <hi>mercy</hi> provideth for all good things which the subject needeth, and <hi>judgement</hi> provideth for their security, and for removing whatsoever evill may trouble them; <hi>I will sing</hi> (saith he) <hi>of mercy and judgement.</hi> 2. Such as are designed unto any calling, especially any publick charge, should prepare themselves for it: partly, by laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themselves the duties belonging to the right discharge of such a calling: and partly, by bending of their hearts, and laying engagements on their spirits, for the faithful discharge thereof; for so much doth <hi>Davids</hi> example here teach us. 3 Duties of a mans calling, should both be studied unto, and discharged with some chearfulnesse and readinesse of minde; for, <hi>I will sing of mercy and judgement,</hi> importeth so much. 4. As it is expedient for the peoples better acceptance of a man to a publike charge, that his purpose to discharge his duty therein be published; so also it is expedient for the mans stirring up and fastening to his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he engage his heart unto God; for, so doth <hi>Davids</hi> example teach us: <hi>Unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 2.</hi> I will behave my self wisely in a perfect way: O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</q>
            <p>The second duty which he undertaketh, when God shall come unto him to performe his promise, and put him in possession of the Kingdome, is, that he will cast a copie to all the subjects, of godly and wise behaviour in his own person and family, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of Gods Word. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. He that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth to carry a publick charge well, must discharge the duty of a private man well in his own person, and make his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal carriage exemplary to all who shall hear of him: for so doth <hi>Davids</hi> undertaking here teach us. 2. It is necessary for our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal carriage, and conversing with others, that we make the Lords commands our Rule; for that is a <hi>perfect way</hi>; and that we studie to make application of general rules prudently, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50629:11"/>
to the circumstances of time, place and person: for, this is wisdome, as <hi>Davids</hi> example doth teach: <hi>I will behave my self wisely in a perfect way.</hi> 3. Such as beleeve Gods promises, do long to have the performance of them, as we see in <hi>David,</hi> who had a promise of the Kingdome, and looked long for it: <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me?</hi> 4. In the performance of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the Lord maketh his approaches nearer and nearer unto the beleever, and then shall be the nearest communion, when God shal perform all that he hath promised unto us: for <hi>David</hi> calleth the giving unto him the possession of the promised Kingdome, Gods <hi>coming unto him: O when wilt thou come unto me?</hi> 5. A mans holinesse, righteousnesse and wisdome, is put to proof by his behaviour to his domesticks, with whom he doth most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intirely converse: for herein doth <hi>David</hi> promise to give evidence of his walking wisely in a perfect way: <hi>I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</hi> 6. To compleat a mans sincerity, it is necessary not only that he have a perfect way, and a prudent carriage in it, but also that he be upright in his heart, intentions, ends and motives; therefore <hi>David</hi> addeth, <hi>I will walk with a perfect heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 3</hi> I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside, <hi>it</hi> shall not cleave to me.</q>
            <p>The third duty undertaken is, that he will be far from plotting of any wicked thing, and far from communion with any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in an evil course, which is a proof of the uprightnesse of his heart, undertaken in the former verses. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. A wicked designe is inconsistent with uprightnesse of heart, which hath an aime at pleasing of God, and at nothing else but what he will allow: <hi>I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes.</hi> 2 A man can hardly be free of an evil course, if he shal be tempted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, except he hate and abhor such courses in other mens pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; for he who is resolved to be upright, should say truly, <hi>I hate the work of them that turn aside.</hi> 3. Albeit an upright heart may be at unawares intangled in a sinful course; yet so soon as he doth perceive it to be such, he will quit it; therefore after <hi>David</hi> hath said, <hi>He hateth the work of them that turn aside,</hi> he addeth, <hi>It shall not cleave to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50629:12"/>
               <hi>Ver. 3.</hi> A froward heart shall depart from me, I will not know a wicked person.</q>
            <p>The fourth duty undertaken is, in relation to the Court and places of trust: he will not have in his company, nor will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance a perverse or wicked person; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 2. Among the vices of the heart, frowardnesse, perversenesse and wickednesse, are most of all to be eschewed and abhorred, because those evils do harden the heart against admonition, and do make it incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible in an evil course, albeit a better course be shewen; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> denounceth war against such a disposition; <hi>A frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard heart shall depart from me.</hi> 2. It is good for a King, and for his Court, and for his subjects, and for the standing of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that wicked, perverse, and impious men be out of credit in the Court, and not admitted to places or power of trust; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more acceptable to God in the point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor more amiable to the subjects then this; for which cause <hi>David</hi> promiseth to the subjects beforehand, <hi>I will not know a wicked person</hi>; much more will Christ not know, but disclaim such a person.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> Who so privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.</q>
            <p>The fifth duty undertaken, is the curbing of out-breaking wickednesse, especially of that which most hindereth the peace and welfare of the subjects, such as is privie slander, and open insolencie. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There is no sort of persons more pernicious to a King, or to his subjects, then is a privie slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, having credit in Court: for he is able to murther any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ruine his State, by secret and false reports of him, while the innocent is ignorant of it, and wanteth all place to defend himself; and therefore this evil is to be severely punished by the Magistrate: <hi>Who so privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off.</hi> 2 A Kingdom is not well ruled, except proud and insolent spirits, whose behaviour speaketh prodigality, strife, emulation and oppression, be taken order with and born down; <hi>Him that hath a high look and a proud heart, will not I suffer.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50629:12"/>
And such, if they escape mens judgements, will not be wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by Christ, in whom the truth of types is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 6.</hi> Mine eyes <hi>shall be</hi> upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a perfect way, he shall serve me.</q>
            <p>The sixth duty undertaken, is countenancing and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the godly in the land. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate should have a special care to countenance upright men, and such as fear God: <hi>Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful in the land.</hi> 2. It is good policy, for Kings to have in their Court and Councel such as are faithful; <hi>Mine eyes shall be upon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the land, that they may dwell with me.</hi> 3. He is to be held in our estimation for a faithful man, who walketh after the rule of Gods Commandments; for such, as he called <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> before, he expoundeth here to be such <hi>as walk in a perfect way</hi>; whether his heart be uprighr or not, doth belong to God to judge. 4. As it is good policy in a State, to have about the King or supreme Magistrate such as are Professors of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of an honest conversation: so it is good thrift and husbandrie, for every man to choose such for their servants in the family; <hi>He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 7.</hi> He that worketh deceit, shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies, shall not tarry in my sight.</q>
            <p>The seventh duty undertaken, is the purging out of discovered hypocrites, if they shall creep in into credit or trust. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Deceitful and false men, and counterfeit hypocrites, may escapemens observation, and creep into the fellowship of the godly, and climbe up to the Court, and get place in Kings houses; for so doth <hi>David</hi> presuppose here. 2. When men are discovered and found to be deceitful workers and liars, then such as have power should purge them out; <hi>He that worketh deceit, shall not dwell within my house; he that telleth lies, shall not tarry in my sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50629:13"/>
               <hi>Ver. 8.</hi> I will early destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all wicked doers from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the LORD.</q>
            <p>The eighth duty undertaken, is to suppresse all ungodlinesse in the land, and that for the good of religion, and furtherance of the welfare of the Church. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The duty of Magistrates is to suppresse all the wicked in their Kingdom, lest by indulgence shewen to them, they do multiplie, and so bear down the godly: <hi>I will destroy all the wicked of the land.</hi> 2. The more timously the Magistrate doth declare himself against all wickednesse, the more doth he what belongeth to his duty: <hi>I will early destroy all the wicked of the land.</hi> 3. Albeit it be not possible for any Magistrate, corporally to destroy all the wicked in the land, partly, because it is impossible to finde out every one; and partly, because the number of the righteous and sound heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is few, and their power weak; and partly, because none can determine who they are in particular: yet a godly Magistrate may civilly destroy them all, by causing to execute civil punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that Ecclesiastick Discipline be exercised against all them, who do not submit themselves to Gods lawes, till all men yield outward obedience: and unto this duty should every Magistrate set himself: <hi>I will early destroy all the wicked in the land.</hi> 4. The Magistrates duty is, by his power and by punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evil doers, to endeavour the welfare of Gods Church within his bounds, as the Minister of God appointed for that end: for <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I will early destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all the wicked doers from the City of the LORD.</hi> If the Magestrate shall punish open transgressions, the Church will be in better case: This was <hi>Davids</hi> resolution as a type of Christ, and howsoever in execution much was wanting in the type, yet Christ will performe all this exactly in his own appointed time, and in his own order, partly in this life, partly at mens death, and partly at the last day.</p>

            <head>PSALM. CII. A prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>THis Psalme agreeth well with the time of the Babylonish captivity of the Jewes, about the end whereof, the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years being now nigh expired, the weight of the misery of Gods people, and the mockerie of the heathen, and the peoples longing for delivery, did so afflict the Prophet, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards the scattered Church, he poureth out this prayer, and communicateth it at the Lords direction, to all other feeling members of the body to be made use of, for the waking up of their affections, and strengthening of their hope of delivery. The parts of it are three; In the first, he craveth audience to his prayer because of his sad condition, wherein he sympathizeth with the Church in affliction, to <hi>ver.</hi> 12. In the second, he encourageth himself in the hope of being heard in behalf of the Church, to <hi>ver.</hi> 23. In the third, he layeth forth the occasion of all this grief, which was the fear he had of the cutting off of the Church of the Jewes, before the coming of the Messiah; and sheweth how he strengthened his faith in prayer against this temptation.</p>
               <p>From the Inscription, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is no strange thing for the dear children of God, to be under heavy affliction; for, here it is presupposed that they may be afflicted, yea, and overwhelmed. 2. The consideration of the condition wherein the Church is, serveth to asswage and mitigate the private calamities of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person at any time: for this prayer giveth direction to the afflicted, whatsoever be his affliction, to look upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church in the mean time, that it may ease his private grief, if it be well with the Church; and again, that it may either ease his private grief, or turn it to run in the right channel, if the Church be in a hard condition, as here it is held forth: for the most kindly grief of a lively member of the Church, is that grief wherein he sympathizeth with the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the body, and this wisdom is propounded in this Psalm; and recommended to Gods people to be made use of. 3. The affliction of the Saints before us, may and should be the matter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50629:14"/>
of our comfort and song to God, and hope of help to us in our prayers: for this doth the Inscription and Psalme teach us. 4. The way for a man afflicted and overwhelmed, to have ease, comfort and deliverance, is, <hi>to poure out his soule before the Lord</hi>; for so much is here imported. 5. Albeit a person afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cannot fill up the words of this Psalme, in his own proper present feeling, yet may he make good use of this prayer, which teacheth him how to wrestle for a deliverance: for the general title prefixed to the Psalme teaeheth so much.</p>

            </q>
            <p>In the first part of the Psalme, he prayeth for ready accesse and audience to his prayer, because of his heavy affliction, which is set down more generally, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. and more particularly branehed fotth in the nine following verses. From his petition for audience; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. A soul afflicted, seeking relief and comfort in God, may both confidently pray for, and certainly expect audience and acceptance of its prayer; <hi>Hear my prayer, O God.</hi> 2. The earnest prayer of an humble Supplicant, cannot be kept out from God, by whatsoever objected impediment; for, <hi>Let my cry come unto thee,</hi> is thus much: <hi>Let nothing hold out my prayer.</hi> 3. Albeit it is not any strange thing to see a soul in trouble, and God to seem to be displeased with it also, yet the want of Gods consolation, and sense of his displeasure, is more heavy then the trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is that which the godly can least en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: <hi>Hide not thy face from me, in the day when I am in trouble.</hi> 4.

A soul perplexed and overwhelmed with trouble, cannot long endure the Lords withdrawing of his presence from it: <hi>In the day when I call, answer me speedily.</hi>

The condition of a visible Church, may seem, and really be in its own kinde, in such a weak, sorry and sick condition, as the comparisons here do hold forth. 3. As smoke is extracted by fire out of a moist body, and doth vanish when it is evaporated: so may the life and vigour of a Saints body be spent, and consumed by trouble, and sense of Gods withdrawing, or of his wrath; <hi>My dayes are consumed like smoke.</hi> 4. As fire heateth the hearth, and the hearth once hot with fire, is able to kindle and burn timber or coales, or any combustible matter cast on it: so is the sense of Gods wrath in long lasting trouble, able to spend the strength of the strongest man; <hi>My bones are burnt as an hearth.</hi> 5 As grasse withereth when it is cut: so is the courage of a man cast down, when he findeth Gods anger, pursuing his Church or himself; <hi>My heart is smitten, and withered as grasse.</hi> 6.

As in sad troubles familiars use to draw back from, and leave a man alone; so also a sad soul loveth to be alone, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to be a spectacle of misery to others: <hi>I am like a Peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can in the wildernesse, I am like an Owle in the desert.</hi> 10.

            <p>The causes of his grief are three; First, the reproach and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate cruelty of the enemy against the Church, <hi>ver</hi> 8. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the sense of Gods anger appearing in his dispensation, which drew him not only to frequent fasting and teares, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to an uncomfortable life. Thirdly, the comparison of times of the former prosperity of the Church with the present adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The men of this world use to meet with pity in their calamity, but the godly are subject to reproaches in their troubles, which mockerie and calamity doubleth their misery; <hi>Mine enemies reproach me all the day.</hi> 2. The enemies of Gods people are reasonlesse and implacable in their indignation against the godly: <hi>They are mad against me.</hi> 3. Albeit the miseries of Gods people may be such, as the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemie of Religion, when he would curse any person, shall wish no worse to them, then to say, Let him be like such a people, and such a godly person, yet will the wicked not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with this, except he bring more mischief upon the godly: <hi>They that are mad against me, do curse by me,</hi> or <hi>are sworne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>The second cause of his grief, was the signes of Gods indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation appearing in the Churches misery, which made him sit desolate many times in the dust, weeping when he should have taken some refreshment to his body. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The condition of the godly sometime may make them miserable, not only in the eyes of the world, but also in their own eyes for a time: <hi>I have eaten ashes like bread, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Not only may the godly be driven to frequenr fasting and prayer, but also to have gray dustie bread for their ordinary diet, and that joyned with such grief, as they can take no food with comfort; <hi>I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.</hi> 3. The sharpest ingredient in the trouble of the godly, is the sense of Gods indignation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>I mingled my drink with weeping, because of thy indignation.</hi> 4. The troubles which the Lord doth bring upon his own children, should lead them to the sense of their sin, and of Gods just displeasure against them for the same; <hi>I mingled my drink with weeping, because of thy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wrath.</hi> 5. As it is the Lord that maketh changes of condition, and giveth now prosperity in his indulgence, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non adversity for the abuse of prosperity; so should he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in his bounty and justice good and holy; <hi>For thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</hi> 6. Comparison of past pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity with present adversity, maketh the present afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the heavier, and Gods just indignation the more evident: for thus doth the Psalmist prove Gods wrath pursuing him and the Church; <hi>For thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</hi>

            <p>Here he repeateth the apparent sad consequence and effect of his own and the Churches affliction; he and the Church of the Jewes now in captivity, were like to be cut off without comfort or hope of deliverance. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Not only the visible face of a Church, but also the scattered parts thereof, may be near to disappearing, and to utter decaying under long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued trouble; <hi>My dayes are like a shadow that declineth, and I am withered like grasse.</hi> 2. The miseries of the godly, and the extreme danger of the Church, being laid forth before God,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50629:16"/>
are good arguments of hope that God shall shortly help; for therefore is it repeated, and laid down here for the last part of pouring out his soul; <hi>My dayes are like a shadow that declineth, and I am withered like grasse.</hi>

               <hi>Ver. 12.</hi> But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance unto all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>
            <p>In the second part of the Psalme he striveth to comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the hope of grace to be shewn to the Church, by seven arguments. The first is, because God hath purposed to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the memorial of himself unto all generations, and endureth for ever to see it done. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There is ground of hope to believers, in the saddest condition of the Church; for albeit beleevers be mortal, yet God in whom their life is hid, is eternal; <hi>But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God will have his Name known in all generations, and will have his Word and Ordinances of Religion made use of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, for preserving the memory of his attributes, works and will, therefore the Church must continue from age to age; <hi>Thou shalt endure for ever, and thy remembrance unto all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi>

            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 13.</hi> Thou shalt arise, <hi>and</hi> have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time is come.</q>
            <p>The second argument of his hope, that God will shortly have mercy on his Church is, because the time of the seventy years set for their captivity, was now almost expired. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is good reasoning from Gods unchangeablenesse, to conclude a change of the sad condition of the Church afflicted, from a worse unto a better: <hi>Thou shalt endure for ever,</hi> and therefore, <hi>thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion.</hi> 2. As the Lord hath set times for exercising his people with affliction, so also set times for comforting of them again, which time when it is come, God will have mercy on them whom he hath afflicted; <hi>Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Sion; for the set time to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour her, for the set time is come.</hi>

               <hi>Ver. 14.</hi> For thy servants take pleasure in her stones: and favour the dust thereof.</q>
            <p>The third argument is, because the Lords people had a great affection to re-edifie the Temple, lying now ruined. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is no new thing to see the outward face of Religion, and holy Ordinances defaced; for the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is here lying in the dust of a ruinous heap. 2. The Ordinances of Religion shall not be utterly abolished, but so much thereof shall be preserved, as may serve for the furtherance of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and re-edification of his Church, in Gods appointed time; as here the Temple is ruined, but there are <hi>stones</hi> reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a new building. 3. When the ordinances of God are at the lowest, and most deformed in the eyes of the world, they are and should be most lovely, and looked upon with most esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and affection of Gods people; <hi>Thy servants take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</hi> 4. It is a good ground of hope that God will shortly repaire the ruines of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when he provides builders, and doth put into their hearts a love to set upon the work of reformation, as the Psalmist reasoning here doth teach us.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 15.</hi> So the Heathen shall feare the Name of the LORD, and all the Kings of the earth thy glory.</q>
            <p>The fourth argument of hope is, from the promised Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Gentiles, to whom the true Religion was to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Gods own time, by the means of restoring of the Church of the Jewes unto their wonted priviledge. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The enlargement of the knowledge and fear of God among them that know him not, should be the aime and encouragement of zealous Reformers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to use all means which may conduce for Reformation; for so much we are taught in the Psalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, desiring the restauration of the Church of the Jewes, that the Gentiles might be brought in; and by hope of the Conversion of the Gentiles, giving hope of restauration unto the scattered Church of the Jewes; for, <hi>So the Heathen shall feare thy Name,</hi> is the reasoning of the Psalmist. 2. When the Lord is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50629:17"/>
pleased to arise, for restoring of his afflicted people unto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and of Religion unto its own beautie, he can work so as Kings shall feare and tremble, to see Gods care of his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised people; for so saith he, <hi>The Heathen shall feare thy Name, and all the Kings of the earth thy glory.</hi>

            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 16.</hi> When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</q>
            <p>The fifth argument of his hope is, from the glory which God should have in restoring of his Church. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever instruments the Lord useth in the gathering of his Church, he will have himself seen to be the builder thereof; for it is the Lord here, <hi>that shall build up Sion.</hi> 2. As the glory of the Lord is obscured when his Church is scattered; so when he sets up his own ordinances again, his glory doth appear, yea, and that more then if his Church had not been scattered; <hi>When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in glory.</hi> 3. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of Gods glory with the salvation of his Church, is a comfortable ground of hope, that howsoever the Church be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished, yet it shall be restored and repaired again: for, <hi>When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in glory,</hi> importeth so much.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 17.</hi> He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</q>
            <p>The sixth argument of hope is, from the Lords respect to the prayers of his people. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lords people do reckon themselves destitute and desolate, when they have not the face of a Church, and do want the publick Ordinances of Religion, which are the tokens of the Lords presence among them: for especially in relation to their scattering from <hi>Ieru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and the Temple, doth the Psalmist here call them <hi>destitute</hi> or desolate. 2. When the Lords people are scattered one from another, they can trust one another, and meet together at the throne of grace, by their prayer presented before God, as here the faithful scattered in captivity, do meet in a joynt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for the building up of <hi>Sion</hi>; the destitute have their prayer put up in Gods hearing; <hi>He will regard the prayer of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50629:17"/>
destitute.</hi> 3. Albeit the Lords people be desolate and destitute of all earthly comfort and help, and be despised by the world, yet their persons and prayer are in estimation with God; <hi>He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 18.</hi> This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created, shall praise the LORD.</p>

                  <hi>22.</hi> When the people are gathered together: and the Kingdoms to serve the LORD.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The seventh argument of hope to be heard is, from the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that as their calamity was foretold in Scripture; so their delivery promised should be recorded in Scripture also, to the praise of God, to the edification and consolation of the Church of God in their solemn meetings, in whatsoever Kingdoms they lived. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The more glory we foresee shall come to God by the granting of our prayers, the more confidence may we conceive to have our petition granted; as the Psalmists example doth teach us. 2. God hath so provided, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and experience of the Church in former times, should serve to manifest his glory, and edifie the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in after-times; <hi>This shall be written for the generation to come.</hi> 3. The Lord hath determined by holy Scripture to propagate true Religion, whereby he may be glorified, and his Church edified, from generation to generation; <hi>This shall be written for the generation to come.</hi> 4. The gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again of a scattered Church; the conversion of more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and drawing them into the Church; and the perpetuation of the Church from age to uge, is a Creation or work of the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Creator: <hi>The people wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch shall be created, shall praise the Lord.</hi> 5. The Lord should be praised, as for all his work
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50629:18"/>
so in special for the delivery of his Church; and praised not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them who do see his present work, and are partakers in their own persons of the gift, but also by all them that shall hear of the delivery in after times: <hi>The people which shall be created, shall praise the Lord.</hi> 6. The Lord doth so make manifest his particular and active providence about his people, as all ages shall acknowledge his care for them; for the posterity shall say, <hi>He hath looked down from the height of his Sanctuary, &amp;c.</hi> 7. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord speak of his dwelling in his Sanctuary, or in his Church here on earth, yet must we conceive no thoughts but heavenly of him as present at once both in heaven and earth, to hear and see the condition and carriage of every one; <hi>He looked down from the height of his Sanctuary, from heaven did the Lord behold the earth, to hear, &amp;c.</hi> 8. The Lords heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly majesty doth not hinder him to humble himself to behold even the most contemptible things on the earth, but rather he will thus raise his praise among men: <hi>From heaven did the Lord behold the earth, to heare the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oaning of the prisoner.</hi> 9. Albeit the Lords people may be prisoners, and put to silence among men, yet their sighes and groanes have a loud speech in the eares of the Lord; <hi>He beholdeth the earth, to heare the groanes of the prisoner.</hi> 10. Albeit the Lord suffer his childien to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned and condemned to die, yet he can interpose himself (if he please) for their delivery, before the purpose of their enemies be executed; <hi>He beholdeth the earth, to loose those that are appointed to death.</hi> 11. The end, both of the sufferings and deliverances of the Saints, is the glorifying of God, and as their danger doth grow, so doth the matter of Gods praise for doing for them grow up also; <hi>For he beholds the earth, to hear the sighes of the prisoner, and to loose them that are appointed to death; To declare the Name of the Lord in Sion, and his praise in Ierusalem.</hi> 12. The time of glorifying God for his works done for the Church of the Jewes, is in a special manner to be under the Gospel, in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of the Churches of the Gentiles; for, <hi>He loosed those that were ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the first, he compareth the case of the Church unto his own personal condition. for as he in the flower of his age was like to die by reason of grief for the Church, so was the Church like to perish in their captivity, and not to go on unto the hoped for coming of the Messiah, and calling in of the Gentiles, which was necessary for the perpetuation of the Church unto the end of the world. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

When the Lord did scatter the ten tribes, and after that also did lead in captivity the other two unto <hi>Babylon</hi>: it seemed unto <hi>Israel</hi> a stopping of them from going on their appointed journey, to the coming of Christ, and a making the tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> so weak, as there was no appearance of the possibility of their endurance, or making progresse to their desired end: for so much is imported in the words of the Prophet, taking on the person of <hi>Israel: He weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my strength in the way.</hi> 4. Yea, there was fear of cutting off of that tribe, and of the abolishing of <hi>Israel,</hi> and that the Messiah coming of them should not appear; and this was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Church scattered in the Babylonish captivitie; and the fear, and the tentation, wherewith the Church and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet about the end of the captivity, were wrastling, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in these words, <hi>He shortened my dayes,</hi> that is, to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance (saith <hi>Israel</hi> by the Prophets mouth;) I was cut off from being as a Church or tribe, for any such use as I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 5.

The Church and any member thereof, may possibly sometime be put in fear of being cut off, before they can attain their desired end; as here, <hi>Take me not away in the midst of my dayes,</hi> doth import. 2.

which may be seen in the works of Creation, is a rock for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, who is in Covenant with God to rest upon; for what can he not do who hath made all things of nothing? <hi>Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</hi> 6 The immutability of God is a notable comfort to his afflicted people, who because he is not changed, therefore shall they not be consumed; <hi>Heaven and earth shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, but thou sholt endure, &amp;c. but thou art the same.</hi> 7.

In praising God, special care is to be had of the sincerity of our heart and affections; <hi>All that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, blesse his holy Name.</hi> 4. Whatsoever is said of God, will be found really to be true of him, and the believer will subscribe unto the unstained glory of his Name, and may say, <hi>All that is w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thin me, blesse his holy Name.</hi> 5. Albeit we do not obtain of our heart at first what we would, yet must we still insist in the stirring up of the grace of God in us, for any service we are about; <hi>Blesse the LORD, O my soul,</hi> saith he the second time. 6. God hath put so many obligations upon every believer, as may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50629:20"/>
reasons of praise and thanksgiving; <hi>Blesse the Lord abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and forget not his benefits.</hi> 7. As oblivion is always unthankful, so the remembrance and calling to minde what the Lord hath bestowed upon us, with a due estimation of the meanest bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, is a point of upright thankfulnesse: <hi>Blesse the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,</hi> that is, forget not any of his benefits, as the forme of speech in the Original doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>

               <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Who forgiveth all thine iniquities: who healeth all thy diseases.</q>
            <p>The first reason of thanksgiving is for remission of sinnes: the second reaason is for healing specially of spiritual maladies. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Saving grace bestowed upon us, should have the first room in our thanksgiving unto God, because it is the evidence of Gods special love to us: for this doth the order of the Prophets thanksgiving teach us. 2. The most holy of Gods servants are not justified by their good works, but by gracious remission of their evil works: <hi>Blesse the LORD, who forgiveth thy iniquities.</hi> 3. The remission of sin is a perfect taking away of the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, not of some only, but of all sins: <hi>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities.</hi> 4. After remission of sin, and justification of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, there remaineth much inbred corruption, and many not only bodily, but also and especially sinful infirmiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, diseases and maladies of our soules, whereby we become unable to do the good which we would, or to eschew the evil which we would not do: and of these diseases God becometh a Physician to heale them all, by his Spirit of Sanctification bestowed upon all whom he justifieth; <hi>Who healeth all thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.</hi>

               <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Who redeemeth thy life from destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: who crowneth thee with loving kindnesse, and tender mercies.</q>
            <p>The third reason of thanksgiving, is for delivering of him graciously, from perishing: and the fourth reason is, for giving
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50629:21"/>
unto him mercifully many good things; <hi>By destruction</hi> here he meaneth, not only the danger of being killed by his enemies, but also and especially the state of condemnation and perishing in Gods wrath, from which the man justified is redeemed by the Mediator. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The benefit of preservation from eternal death, is given unto the man, to whom all iniquity is forgiven; for here these benefits are joyned the one with the other. 2. The deliverances which are given to believers, as well bodily as spiritual, temporal as well as everlasting, do come to us in the way of Redemption, made by our kinde and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kinsman Jesus Christ; <hi>Who redeemeth thy life from destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> 3. A man must be sensible of the merit of sin, and see himself in the state of perdition for sin, before he can put a right estimation upon his delivery, he must count himself a lost man, till the LORDS Redeemer deliver him, as we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the Prophet, saying, <hi>He hath redeemed thy life from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi> 4. The favour which God bestoweth upon a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is not in giving unto him one or two, or some few evidences of his love and mercie, but in a constant compassing of him on every hand, in every thing: so that he shall turn him about to what A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t he will, he is circled round about with love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, supplying wants, preventing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The evidences of Gods kindnesse and mercie to a man, is not only a meanes to glorifie God, but also a meanes to put respect and honour; yea, and a crown of glory on the head of the believer, in the sight of all who look upon him; therefore saith he, <hi>Who crowneth thee with loving kindnesse and tender mercies.</hi>

            <p>The fifth reason of thanksgiving is, not only for blessing the use of the creatures unto him, but also and especially for feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with spiritual food, and giving comfortable refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his Church, set forth under the similitude of corporal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeding upon dainties. The sixth reason is for comforting his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50629:21"/>
spirit, and reviving it in its dead condition, as the Eagle is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived and renewed after casting her bill. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The blessing of God upon the believer, maketh the use of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and his ordinary meales and morsels, savourie and sweet, because he hath all that is given to him, with Gods allowance and good-will; <hi>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things.</hi> 2. The Lord after spiritual hunger and thirst, giveth such satisfaction to the soul of the believer, as banquet-chear and dainties do give to a hungry and thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sty man, as the similitude here sheweth; <hi>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things.</hi> 3. As the Eagle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth and groweth lean, when her bill or beak groweth so long and crooked as she cannot eat for it, and when she casteth her bill, and her beak is now fitted better to take her food, then she is revived and strengthened, and as it were groweth young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: so fareth it with the soul of the believer, which sometimes is so exercised and troubled, as it refuseth comfort, and lieth in a dead condition; but when the Lord reneweth the sense of his love, it is a new life, and the inner man is revived again; <hi>Thy youth is renewed as the Eagle.</hi> 4. It is an act of thanksgiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, to give account to our selves, and to reckon over to our own soules, what the Lord hath bestowed on us, and done for us, as appeareth in the Prophets practice here, speaking all this to his own soul, in reckoning over the benefits.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 6.</hi> The LORD executeth righteousnesse and judgement for all that are oppressed.</q>
            <p>He goeth on in his thanksgiving, and ascendeth from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies shewn to himself, unto the praising of Gods righteousnesse and mercifulnesse toward all believers, as well as toward him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, according as every ones need doth require: and here is the seventh reason of Gods praise, for maintaining the cause of all his oppressed people. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The sight of Gods goodnesse towards our selves, should lead us to the observation of Gods goodnesse to all his children in common, and unto his righteous, holy and gracious nature, as the example of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist teacheth us. 2. As to be oppressed was not <hi>Davids</hi> lot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but is the common condition whereunto the godly in all ages are subject: so to have God the defender and the avenger of those that oppresse them, was not the priviledge of <hi>David</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50629:22"/>
but common to him and all Gods children; <hi>For the Lord executeth righteousnesse and judgement for all that are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</hi>

               <hi>Ver. 7.</hi> He made known his wayes unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</q>
            <p>The eighth reason of Gods praise, is, for his revealing of his will and works to his Prophet <hi>Moses,</hi> and to the people of <hi>Israel; Whenee learn,</hi> 1. The knowledge of Gods will, of his way of dealing with men, and of his works, are mysteries which men cannot understand, till the Lord reveal all to them; <hi>It is he who maketh his wayes known.</hi> 2. As God hath the choosing of people to whom, so also of the men by whom he will reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his wayes; <hi>He made known his wayes unto Moses, his acts to the children of Israel.</hi> 3. As the revealing of Gods way, wherein he will walk with us, and of his way wherein he will have us to walk before him, is no small mercie to his Church: so is it no small obligation put upon his people, and matter of praise and thanks unto God; for this is made here the matter of the Churches thanks, and of Gods praise, <hi>That he made known h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ninth reason of Gods praise is, for his merciful and gracious nature expressed in sundry titles. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord is compassionate toward us in our miseries, and ready to pardon our sins; <hi>The Lord is merciful.</hi> 2. The Lord is not hindered by our unworthinesse to do us good, when we come unto him, but is ready to shew favour to such as acknowledge themselves to be unworthy, and do seek nothing but of his free love; <hi>The Lord is gracious.</hi> 3. The Lord doth not easily let forth the evidence of his anger, even when he is provoked; <hi>He is slow to anger.</hi> 4. Even in wrath he remembreth mercy, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50629:22"/>
doth not let forth the effects of his wrath in full measure, but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth his chastisements, so as we may endure them, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mitigations in the most bitter cups; <hi>He is plenteous in mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 9.</hi> He will not alwayes chide: neither will he keep <hi>his anger</hi> for ever.</q>
            <p>The tenth reason of praise is, for the short continuance of the effects of his wrath. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord be ready to live as a reconciled God and father with us his children, yet we are given to strife, and do frequently offend and grieve him, and give reason to him to rebuke us, as his <hi>not chiding</hi> of us doth import. 2. When he hath debated his controversie by words, and by the rod, and hath made our conscience challenge and chide us, he doth not entertain the controversie long; <hi>He will not alwayes chide.</hi> 3. Albeit the tokens of Gods anger endure longer then we would, yet shall they be removed at length, he will not pursue his quarrel furrher then our real humiliation; <hi>Neither will he keep his anger for ever.</hi>

            <p>The eleventh reason of Gods praise is, for the common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which the Saints have had already of his mercy. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. What the Word saith of Gods grace, mercy, long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and other titles of his goodnesse, the common experience of his children, yea, and of all the members of the visible Church may bear witnesse unto it: <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our sinnes.</hi> 2. The felt mercies of the Lord should not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate our sinnes, but rather make us aggravate our faults, and weigh our misdeservings in the balance of the Sanctuary; for not by the weight of judgements, (which oft-times are laid aside, or are gently inflicted) but by the Word must we judge of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities; <hi>For he hath not rewarded us according to our iniquities.</hi>

            <p>The twelfth reason of Gods praise is, for the unmeasurable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse nf his mercy toward his servants, compared to the unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable height of the heaven above the earth. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Our minde cannot finde out a comparison too la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those are the children of God, who howsoever they are not free of sin, yet they are careful to please God, and loath to offend him; They are persons <hi>that feare him.</hi> 3. The consolations of God, and the riches of his mercy, are not appointed to foster sin or security in any man, but to cherish the hearts of those that stand in awe to offend God, and study to please him: <hi>Great is his mercy to them that feare him.</hi>

            <p>The thirteenth reason of Gods praise is, for compleat ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of remission of sin unto the believer in him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit sins hinder our accesse to God, yet they do not hinder Gods approaching unto them, on whom he will have mercy; for sin is not removed, till Christ come to the sinner, as here is imported. 2. Remission of sin is a gift, full and compleat, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by God unto every believer in Christ, and the guiltinesse and debt of sin, is so far and so fully removed, that it can never be imputed unto the believer, nor come near to hurt him; <hi>As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions from us.</hi> Understand this of the believer, who doth not turne the grace of God into wantonnesse, but maketh use of grace, to strengthen him in his battel against the body of sin in himself.</p>

            <p>The fourteenth reason of Gods praise is, for his fatherly pity toward all his weak children, who would heartily serve him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they do. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The course of renewed pardon of sin, and daily removing of sin from the penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, doth flow from the Lords adopting of believers to be his children, as the similitude taken from a father doth shew unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. The love which nature teacheth a father to bear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his obedient childe, is but a shadow of the love of God to believers: <hi>Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</hi> 3. As none of the Lotds children want their own infirmities, short comings in duties, and fallings into transgressions; so all of them are looked on by God, in as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pity as ever father did shew to children: <hi>Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that feare him.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this of such as do esteem their sinful inclination, their greatest misery.</p>

            <p>The fifteenth reason of Gods praise, is his discretion in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating his dealing with us, so as our weaknesse may beare; and this reason serveth to clear and confirme the former. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There is no more strength in man of himself, then there is in the matter he was made of; <hi>We are but dust.</hi> 2.

            <p>The sixteenth reason of Gods praise is, for his everlasting mercie, and constant fidelity in performing whatsoever he hath promised to every sincere beleever. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. All the glory of man in his naturals, when he is adorned at the best, with learning, wisdome, beauty, strength, riches, honour, and whatsoever other ornaments he can have, is but like the glory of grasse and flowers, which are very tender and subject to many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmities and mortality, serve indeed to humble a man, but do not hinder the humbled man to come and receive of God compleat mercy, that is, pardon of sinnes, supply of all wants, and life everlasting: <hi>Mans dayes are as the flower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the winde go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over it, and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more, but the mercie of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting.</hi> 3. The true believer and heire of the promises, is he, who in his greatest confidence in Gods everlasting mercie, doth stand in awe to offend God; <hi>The mercy of the Lord is upon them that feare him.</hi> 4. As mercie is decreed and prepared before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, for the beleever who feareth God; so is it let forth in actual application unto him in this life, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore after this life is gone; <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting to everlasting to them that feare him.</hi> 5. Such as out of love to God are loath to offend him; and out of faith in Gods mercy study to please him, shall have justice to be their friend, to themselves and to their children who follow their footsteps, from one generation to another, the Lords righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

shall be for them, and not against them; all that is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Saints, shall be done to them, and for them: <hi>His righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse shall be unto his childrens children.</hi> 6. As God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the offer of his grace by Covenant, for reconciliation of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; so hath he given his Law and Commandments for a rule, to lead the reconciled man unto salvation, and he only is the heire of the promise of everlasting mercy and righteousnesse, who stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieth to prove the sincerity of his faith, by his endeavouring of obedience: For the promise here is made <hi>to such as keep his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</hi>

               </gap>ng God: True it is, that the Angels need not to be exhorted to blesse God, and many of the Lords hostes and workes are not capable of our exhortation; yet this forme of speech signifieth, that all of them in their own kinde, and materially at least, do shew forth the blessednesse of God; and that if they were all endued with reason, able and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted formally, expresly, and directly to glorifie God, they were all too few for the work, and could not either severally, or joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorifie the Lord, as his deserving is. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. The weight of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffering of praise unto God, is too heavy for men to lift; and as for Angels, it will take up all their strength, and their best abilities to go about it: <hi>Blesse the Lord, ye his Angels that excell in strength.</hi> 2. It is the commendation of Angels, that they obey all Gods commands readily, and we should follow their example, and aime at their perfection in service; that the will of God may be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven: <hi>For they do his Commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word.</hi> 3. All the several rankes of creatures, are so many mustered hosts, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to execute Gods judgements, as they are directed; and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in their kinde setting forth on all hands, the glory and goodnesse of God: <hi>Blesse the Lord, all ye his hosts.</hi> 4. The family of Beleevers, the servants of the Lord, who know his will, and study to do it; and in speciall, his Ministers in the Church, servants in State, Pastors and Teachers of Gods people, have in a special obligation lying on them to blesse the Lord, who has intrusted them in his service, and made them do his will: <hi>Blesse the Lord, ye Ministers of his that do his pleasure.</hi> 5. There is none of Gods works in any part of the world; nothing which his hands hath made, how base and mean soever it may seem, which doth not contribute matter unto the song of Gods praise, and furnish reasons to glorifie and blesse the Maker: <hi>Blesse ye the Lord, all his works, in all places of his dominion.</hi> 6. When the Believer looketh on all the creatures in their own kinde, as contributers unto the glorifying of God, he shall finde his own particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation for special mercies bestowed upon himself, calling for particular praise and thanks at his hands; as <hi>David</hi> doth here, who when he hath set all the creatures on work to blesse God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth thus: <hi>Blesse the Lord, O my soul.</hi>

            <p>Here is the scope of the whole Psalme, wherein he stirreth up his own soul, and by his own example, all others that have ears to hear, to glorifie our God for his greatnesse and Majesty, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in his works of Creation and Providence. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord is to be praised by his children; not only for his benefits bestowed upon them, but also for his own glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and greatnesse; not only is he to be praised for the works of Redemption and Grace to his Elect children, but also for the works of Creation, and what he hath bestowed upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as this Psalme compared with the former doth teach us.

2. Because men have oft-times the words of praise in their mouth, and do care little to have their affection suitable to the work in their heart; therefore when we go about to praise God we should stir up our spirits unto a Religious disposition, as <hi>David</hi> doth here, saying: <hi>Blesse the Lord, O my soul.</hi> 3.

               </gap>ods praise, we should consider his Majesty, how great he is, and worthy to be praised: <hi>O LORD, thou art very great.</hi> 4. Then is the heart best fitted for Gods praises, when the soul that is about the work of praise, doth apprehend its interest in God, and looketh upon him as reconciled, and in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with it self: <hi>O Lord my God, thou art very great.</hi> 5. The praises of God do not depend upon tbe man that praiseth him, but are fixed in God, and flow forth from himself so clearly, that none can be excused of ingratitude, who do not acknowledge his glory: <hi>Thou art cloathed with honour and Majesty.</hi> Albeit God be invisible, and unsearchable; yet his honour and Majesty may be seen in his works, which are as a garment, both to hide him in one respect, and hold him forth in another to be seen: <hi>Thou art cloathed with honour and Majesty.</hi>

The works of creation, besides their natural use, do serve for spiritual uses also; to wit, to furnish unto us the knowledge of God, to edifie us in faith, and stirre us up to glorifie the Maker, as here doth appear. 2.

As light filling the world, is nothing but as the garment of the glorious Creator, manifesting himself wirhin the compasse of the world to his creatures; so the Heavens in their largest circle, are but the Canopy cast about the seat of a King: <hi>for he stretcheth out the heavens like a curtaine.</hi> 5.

That a dwelling house might be sitted and prepared for man not as yet created, the Lord by his powerful command, made the waters go off so much of the earth as might serve for mans use; and straightway, as if the waters had been driven and chased, they did run away hastily from off the bounds allotted unto them, as it were terrified at the thundering, imperious and effectual command of God: <hi>At thy rebuke they fled; at the vo ce of thy thunder they hasted away.</hi> 4 If a man had been present when God commanded the Seas to retreat from the Earth, he might have seen both a terrible and a joyful spectacle of a wonderful hasty chase and flight of the waters running fiercely over the mountaines; and when no more moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

were in their way, glyding down through the valleys into the place wherein they are now: <hi>They go up by the mountaines, they go down by the valleys, unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</hi> 5. The waters of the Sea, albeit they be higher then the Earth, yet are they bounded in the place wherein they are, that without command given to them from God, they may not passe over the bounds prescribed unto them, but do stay within the Sea-mark, and there lay down their proud boasting waves: <hi>Thou hast set a bound that they may not passe over, that they turne not again to cover the earth</hi>: Which they would infallibly do by their own natural motion, if this miraculous standing command were not constantly in force, as was to be seen in the flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> when the boundaries were loosed for a year, till God did execute vengeance on the wicked world, and thereafter they were sent back never to come again for such an universal judgment.</p>

Because the use of fresh waters was necessary for man, and necessary it was that man should have it nigh hand unto him; for the more commodious use, the Lord broke up wells of water in several places, and made brookes and waters, and rivers and floods, like veines in a mans body, to carry from them wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter along to all habitable places of the earth, where God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed men to dwell: <hi>He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.</hi> 2.

For the furnishing of mans house on earth, God hath pruvided him with parks for beasts to feed in, and trees for fowles and birds to live in, and ponds for fishes, as we will hear afterward; and these beasts and fowles, and singing birds, have their drinking vessels set for them: <hi>They give drink to every beast of the field, the wilde asses quen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord doth not dissolve the clouds all at once, but by little and little maketh them distill smaller or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er drops only: <hi>He watereth the hills from his chambers.</hi> 7. There is no part of the earth, whereupon God bestoweth not so much of the fruit of his operation, as may fill it full of his glory: <hi>The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</hi> 8. The grasse and herbs, and the divers sorts of them, serving for the use of beasts and men, are worthy of a room in our meditation of Gods provident care for man and beast: <hi>He causeth the grasse to grow for the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and herbs for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth.</hi> 9.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the trees the Lord will have us take notice of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, as of a speciall plant of his husbandry on the earth, for their height and greatnesse, and durablenesse of the timber, and namely of those of Lebanon, designed for the use of his people: of which he saith, <hi>The Cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted.</hi> 14. It is worthy of our marking, that fot the nests of birds, he hath provided high trees, where they might breed and lodge, and bring forth their young more safely and securely: <hi>Where the birds make their nests: as for the Storke, the Firre-trees are her house.</hi> 15. It is worthy of our observation for glorifying of God, that God hath taught weak creatures, naturally to draw themselves to strong defences; and sundry sorts of them, to have their severall sorts of refuge: <hi>The high hills are a refuge for the wilde goates, and the rocks for the Conies.</hi>

The minde of man is not able to overtake all Gods works at once, whether in their number or order, or properties, or uses, as the Prophets pitching upon some of them only, doth teach us. 2. The making of two great lights, the Sunne and the Moon, is worthy of our special observation; for by them the glory of the rest of the works, is much manifested: <hi>He appointed the Moon for seasons, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The making of two lights to move about the earth, the one to supply in a sort the others absence, is a reason of Gods praise: <hi>He made the Moon and the Sun.</hi> 4. The dividing of time into nights and dayes, and sundry seasons that the continuance thereof might not be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udes, is a reason for magnifying Gods wisdome and goodnesse to man: <hi>He appointed the Moon for seasons, the Sun knoweth his going down.</hi> 5. The Lord hath so wise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y mixed the motion of the Sun and Moon, that a sweeter temper is not imaginable: for if their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been the same, and they did move near together, then the use of the Moon had been the lesse; if the Moon had been alwayes punctually opposite to the Sun, then she should have been in a perpetual eclipse; if the course of the Sun had not been compleat once a year, and the course of the Moon once every moneth, the earth could not have had so great service of both: <hi>But God hath appointed the Moon for seasons, and the Sun know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his going down</hi>; each of them exactly keeping their course as God hath ordained. 6. As Gods wisdome and goodnesse is to be seen in the Light, so also in the vicissitude of Darknesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween day and day; For Darknesse intervening between dayes, maketh Light every day a new gift, and Darknesse calleth man from his labour and travel unto r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

None of the ravenous beasts finde their prey, till God bring it unto them: <hi>For the young Lions,</hi> for hunger, <hi>roar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50629:29"/>
creatures, are in substance natures prayer to its Maker for relief and help: <hi>The young Lions by their roaring, seek their meat from God.</hi> 10. It is a matter of praise to God, that the day-light is made a natural terrour to cruel beasts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that any measure of being feared by man is left in them: <hi>The Sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dennes.</hi> 11. It is the Lords praise that he giveth daily new use of the light of the Sun to man, that he may follow his work and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the better, till the evening, and suffereth it to remaine only so long a time, as weak bodies may endure moderate travell: <hi>Man goeth forth to his work, and labour untill the evening.</hi> 12. The more men do meditate on Gods works, the more do they finde a bottomlesse deep; and the number and variety of them, more and more unsearchable: <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy works!</hi> 13. Thus much may be learned of Gods works, that they are all of them excellently well, and wisely wrought and ordered; and that the riches of Gods bounty to man and to the creatures, doth fill all the earth <hi>In wisdome hast thou made them all, the earth is full of thy riches.</hi>

            <p>He cometh now to the works of the fifth day, specially the furnishing of the Sea as a fish-pond for mans use; and making it portable for ships to saile in. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The greatness and widenesse of the Sea, the ebbing and flowing thereof, the motion and saltnesse of it to keep it from rotting, do speak of the glory of God, no lesse then the ornament and rich furniture of the earth doth. For, <hi>as the earth is full of riches, so is this great and wide Sea</hi> 2. The diversity and number of great and small fishes in the Sea, speak much of Gods power, wisdome and bounty: <hi>wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great fishes.</hi> 3. The making of the Seas for the use of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, that men who cannot flee nor swim, might the more commodiously keep commerce one with another in all parts of the world, is a point of Gods praise; <hi>There go the ships.</hi> 4 Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit all and every one of Gods works do set forth Gods power,

yet some of them do it more eminently then other some, for making men see Gods glory the more in the rest, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the meanest of his works; Such for example are the Elephant on earth, and the Whale, and other huge great monsters in the Sea: <hi>That Leviathan whom thou hast made to play therein.</hi>

            <p>In the third place, he bringeth forth arguments of Gods praise, from the care the Lord hath of the preservation of his works, which most appeareth in the feeding of all living creatures, and propagation of the kinde; for when some of the kinde are dying from time to time, others are quickened and put in their room. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There is a natural instinct in all the living creatures in their want, to wait on Gods providence, which men may observe in them; although the brute creatures know not this, and cannot reflect upon their own inclinations: For the Psalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist speaking of all living creatures, no lesse then of the fishes, he saith; <hi>These all wait on thee, that thou mayest give them their meat.</hi> 2 So long as God will have any creature to live, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth timously enough for its food: <hi>They wait for thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.</hi> 3. Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reacheth to the least bit of food, which any living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture meeteth with: <hi>That thou givest them, they gather.</hi> 4 The Lord is liberal in his dispensation, and feede h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> all the creatures abundantly, so long as he will have them to live: <hi>Thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good.</hi> 5. The Lord demonstrates himself to be the fountain of life, and that the living creatures do hold their life of him, as well by the sickening and weakening of the living creatures, as by the feeding and strengthening of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50629:30"/>
them: For when God withdraweth in any measure the wonted influence of his power from them, then they finde a change to the worse: <hi>Thou hidest thy face from them, they are troubled.</hi> 6. God hath no lesse special hand in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>emoving life, then in giving of it: <hi>Thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</hi> 7. Albeit the Lord take away the life of all individual li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, yet he preserveth the species and kind of every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling creature, by making new ones, and raising them up in the roome of those that are taken away: <hi>Thou sendest forth thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they are created.</hi> 8. The same Spirit which created the world in the beginning, worketh yet powerfully in forming new creatures continually: <hi>Thou sendest out thy Spirit; they are created.</hi> 9. The Lord puts a new face as it were upon the earth, from time to time, partly by Spring-time and Summer every year; partly by young living creatures, in their several generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one after another, and all these things do contribute to his renewed praise: <hi>Thou renewest the face of the earth.</hi>

            <p>In the last place is the conclusion wherein he addeth yet more reasons for praising of God, and then maketh sundry uses of the former Doctrine. He taketh up all that he would say, in this; That God shall have perpetual glory from the works of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and power. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The end of all the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, is Gods glory, and he is worthy of glory for his work, and shall not want his glory from his works for ever: <hi>The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever.</hi> 2. As the Lord saw all his work in the beginning to be good; so in the closing thereof, he shall see all that he hath done, to be good, and nothing properly to be repented of, whatsoever he hath done: <hi>The Lord shall rejoyce in his works.</hi> 3. As the Lord is bountiful to his creatures: so also is he terrible to the strongest of them, that he may be feared, as well as loved and praised: <hi>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the hills, and they smoak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 4. The signes of his terrible power which he hath actually manifested, in sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the earth, and kindling of the mountaines, do bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse how powerful and terrible the Lord is: <hi>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the hills, and they smoak.</hi>

            <p>Here he setteth down the uses of this Doctrine, which are five, teaching us so many Doctrines: For the first use, here he bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon himself an obligation, joyfully to praise God for ever, teaching us to do the same, when we consider the Lords works: <hi>I will sing unto the Lord so long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.</hi> 2. For the second use of this Doctrine, he promiseth to himself joy and gladnesse, in the discharge of the work of Gods praise; which teacheth us how profitable it is to our selves to praise God: Nothing more sweet to a Believer, then to be about the glorifying of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the matter of his praise, <hi>My meditation of him shall be sweet, I will be glad in the Lord.</hi> 3. For the third use, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth wrath and destruction unto the contemners of God, who do not regard his glory, but do stand out as common enemies of God, and of all his workmanship; which teacheth us, that such as do not j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe first part of this Psalme was sung at the carrying up of the Ark of God to the City of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.8. The whole containeth an exhortation to the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> to praise God for his mercies shewen towards them, with reasons serving to presse the duty. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is set down, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The reasons are more particularly expressed in the rest of the Psalme: the first rank whereof is taken from the Lords covenanting with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the care which the Lord had of their persons, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. The second rank is taken from the care the Lord had of their posterity, when he sent them down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and all the while they were there, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. The third rank is taken from the manner of their delivery out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they were oppressed, and from the plaguing of the Egyptians for their sake, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27, 28, to 37. The fourth rank is taken from the Lords care in leading them through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, from, <hi>ver.</hi> 37, to 43. and the last rank of reasons is taken from the Lords placing of them in <hi>Canaan,</hi> where they might serve God according to his law, <hi>ver.</hi> 44, 45.</p>

            <p>The Prophets exhortation unto thankfulnesse, is branched forth in ten particulars, whereof three are in this verse set down in order. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As in the matter of glorifying of God, there are several motives, so should there be several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of these motives, and acts of praising the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thereto, and namely in relation to benefits received, the gifts should be acknowledged and confessed to his praise; <hi>O

            <p>The fourth, fifth and sixth branches of the exhottation unto thanksgiving, are set down in this verse: <hi>Wherein learn,</hi> 1. The Lord requireth as a part of his praise, and of our thankfulnesse, that we rejoyce in him, and expresse our joy by singing; <hi>Sing unto him.</hi> 2. It is not sufficient to offer the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty vessel of our joy unto God, or our singing voice in musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal tune only, but also it is required that we fill our joyful voice with holy matter and good purpose, whereby God only may be reasonably praised: <hi>Sing Psalmes unto him.</hi> 3. Albeit we have nothing to speak of Gods wonderful works, but what is known to any neighbour as well as to our selves, yet it is a part of Gods praise, and of our thankfulnesse to make his known works the matter of our talk and ordinary conference, as we get occasion; <hi>Talk ye of all his wondrous works.</hi>

            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 3.</hi> Glory ye in his Name: let the heart of them rejoyce that seek the LORD.</q>
            <p>The seventh and eighth branch of the exhortation, is set down in this verse; <hi>Wherein learn,</hi> 1. It is a part of Gods praise, and of our thankfulnesse to him, to make our boast of God, and rejoyce because of our interest in him; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim our selves blessed, because of our communion with him; <hi>Glory ye in his holy Name.</hi> 2. Our gloriation in God should be holy, joyned with a low estimation of our selves, and with great reverence toward our most holy God; <hi>Glory ye in his holy Name.</hi> 3. It is a part of Gods praise and of our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, to professe our need of God, and in the conscience of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50629:32"/>
our emptinesse, and his unsearchable riches, to seek our supply in him; for here the seeking of God is recommended unto us. 4. As seeking communion with God is a marke of a childe of God, so it is also a reason of gladness and joy, because it both declares that we are of the number of Converts and true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of God, and also that joy is reserved for us; <hi>Let the heart of them rejoyce that seek thee.</hi>

            <p>The ninth branch of the exhortation is here set down, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the people where and how, and for what cause to seek God, to wit, in his own Ordinances before the Arke, which was the figure of Christ to be incarnate, and is called here the <hi>Lords strength,</hi> because it was a pledge of Gods powerful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with them, who come unto God through Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as also it is called <hi>Gods face,</hi> because God is reconciled and favourable to all that seek him in Christ, who was signified by the Arke and me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e learn,</hi> 1. It is not unusual for the Scripture, to give the name of the thing signified unto the signe appointed of God, to represent or shadow it forth, because of the judicial union of the signe and thing signified and exhibited unto the believer, by the appointment and institution of God, the supreme Judge and Law-giver: so here the Ark of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanr is called <hi>the Lord, and the Lords strength,</hi> and <hi>the Lords face,</hi> because the believer, seeking God according to his Ordinance, did meet by faith with the Lord, and his strength, and face or good will engaged unto the true worshipper. 2. Whensoever the beleever maketh use of holy signes of Gods presence, it is not the signe, but God or Christ signified by the signe, which the believer doth fix his heart upon; as here, he that looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Ark, which was the signe of God in Christ, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himself to the world, not imputing their trespasses unto them, is commanded to seek the thing signified: <hi>Seek the Lord, seek his strength, seek his face.</hi> 3. None do seek the Lord so earnestly, but they have need of stirring up to seek him more earnestly, neither have any attained to such a measure of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, but they have need to seek for a further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: therefore is it said, <hi>Seek the Lord, seek his strength, seek his face evermore.</hi>

The remembrance of the Lords wonderful works, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words, is to be joyned with seeking of his face, as a special help of us unto this duty, as the conjunction of the parts of the exhortation do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God is not for a day, or for temporal favours only, but also and especially for spiritual &amp; everlasting mercies: so the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth neither lesse nor more of that which he hath promised, but albeit long time may intervene before the performance of his promise, yet neverthelesse he remembereth it still, till it be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; <hi>He hath remembered his Covenant for ever.</hi> 4 The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of every age and proof had of Gods faithfulness, should force men in every age, to bear witnesse unto the Lords stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in his Covenant; <hi>He hath remembred his Covenant for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the word which he hath commanded to a thousand genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> 5.

The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace made with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and with believers after them, did consist in promises made by God, and embraced of them by faith, as here it is described; for the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant is expounded to be the Lords, saying: <hi>Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of thy inheritance</hi>; which promise being received by faith, became a Covenant with the believer. 11.

            <p>In the second rank of reasons of Gods praise, taken from the care the Lord had of the posterity of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in bringing them into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and preserving of them there; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Every plague, and in special famine, is a servant of God, ready at a call to come forth, and execute his judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Moreover, he called for a famine on the land.</hi> 2. No food can be had, except God do furnish it, and no food when it is given can feed, except God give a powerful blessing with it; when that is removed bread feedeth not: <hi>He brake the whole staffe of bread.</hi> 3. The way of the Lords performing of his Covenant, is not such as carnal reason would prescribe, by giving probable meanes of bringing it to passe, but the way he chuseth is such as may try the faith of his children, to wit, by seeming to do the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; As here the Patriarchs having the promise of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> shall not be suffered to be so much as sojourners in it, but must leave it, and go elsewhere; <hi>He called for a famine on that land</hi>: which might seem to make it in lesse request, and by the famine also did force them to go where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey might finde bread. 4. Whensoever the Lord doth bring his children into straits and difficulties, he maketh provision for their sustenance in their straits, and deliverance from the same. When the Lord
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50629:35"/>
was to bring his people into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he provided so as they should have a friend at Court before they came: <hi>He sent a man before them, even Ioseph.</hi> 5. Whatsoever may be the intent of men or devils in troubling of Gods children, God hath a hand in every thing which doth befal them, how accidentally soever it may seem to come: <hi>Iosephs</hi> coming down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> is called Gods message; <hi>He sent a man before them, even Ioseph.</hi> 6. That which men dw sinfully, for satisfacti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of their own lusts, God doth holily and wisely for his own ends: by <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren their selling of their brother, to be rid of him; God sendeth <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to provide for their livelihood; <hi>He sent a man before them, they sold him for a servant.</hi> 7. It is not strange to see the man whom the Lord mindeth to exalt, most humbled before he be exalted; and cast into prison, before he be lifted up to liberty. <hi>Ioseph was sold for a servant, whose feet they hurt with fetters.</hi> 8. When the Lords servants are entered in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of their faith, they may look to be soundly searched, before they have ended their trials, and that by sharp affliction, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> was tried; <hi>Whose feet they hurt with fetters, he was laid in iron.</hi> 9. The afflictions and trials of Gods children, will not end when they could wish, but they have a set measure and time determined of God: <hi>He was laid in irons until the time came, &amp;c.</hi> 10. There is a secret word of Gods decree and providence, for ending of the affliction of Gods children, which God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth to light in his own time, and until this come, his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants must lie in bonds, as <hi>Ioseph lay in iron, till the time that his word came</hi>; that is, till God made his decree manifest about the loosing of him. 11. Before affliction shall end, the manifested work of Gods providence in affliction, must put the afflicted to the trial of all that is in him, and trial must go before deliverance; <hi>The word of the Lord tried him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 12. The time appointed in Gods decree, to send delivery to his afflicted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is made manifest in the effectual moving of instruments and meanes of delivery, and in this case if need be, Kings shall be set on work for the delivery of the Lords children; <hi>The King sent and loosed him.</hi> 13. Such as are bound ignominiously for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, shall be one way or other loosed honourably; <hi>The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the people let him go free.</hi> 14. When the Lords people are humbled sufficiently, God doth raise them up, and sometime even in a visible manner before the world, as here <hi>Ioseph</hi> is by the King of <hi>Egypt made Lord of his house, and Ruler of all his substance.</hi> 15. As Gods children are exalted, for the benefit of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50629:36"/>
those over whom they are set, so should they manage and maintain their honour and power, by doing good to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did who was exalted; <hi>To binde Pharaohs Princes at his pleasure, and teach his Senators wisdome.</hi>

Albeit a man hath wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with God in prayer, and gotten his blessing, yet may he be tossed in the world by troubles; <hi>Israel also came into Egypt.</hi> 2. The heires of the promise, and the Lords dearest children may be made sojourners among wicked people, even in their old age, when they need most to be at rest; <hi>Iacob sojourned in the land of</hi> Cham. 3. As when the Lords people grow up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any considerable number among idolaters, it is no strange thing if they finde enmity: so it is no strange thing in Gods way, to make them grow the more in number and power, the more they be opposed; yea, and to make them under oppression and persecution, to become mightier then their adversaries; <hi>He encreased his people greatly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made them stronger then their enemies.</hi> 4. The hearts of all men are in Gods hand, to turne them whither he pleaseth to love or hate, as their affections may serve best his holy purposes: <hi>He turned their heart to hate his people.</hi> 5. The trouble and exercise of Gods people, by whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever instruments it be moved, is of the Lord, and he will owne the evil of trouble, which is in the city or countrey whatsoever; <hi>He turned their heart to hate his people</hi> 6. In the most sinful affections, plots and actions of the wicked against Gods people and servants God hath a holy hand, and is not the cause of their sin: for all the motions of the creatures, which live, and move, and have their being of God, are made use of by the Creator, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, whereby he worketh his own just and holy work for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50629:36"/>
his own ends: but when men are about that same work for their sinful ends, it becometh sinful in them, what is holy in Gods part: as the crucifying of Christ was most holy on Gods part, and most sinful on his enemies part; <hi>He turned their heart to hate his people: to deal subtilly with his servants.</hi>

            <p>In the third rank of reasons, taken from Gods delivering of his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and plaguing of the Egyptians; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When by the malice of enemies Gods people are brought to greatest straits, then is deliverance near to be sent from God unto them; <hi>They dealt subtilly with his servants, he sent Moses his servant.</hi> 2. As it is the Lord who bringeth his own people into trouble and straits, so it is he who delivereth them again, and provideth instruments for the doing thereof; <hi>He sent Moses his servant.</hi> 3. As whosoever do serve Gods Church to any good purpose, do it not of themselves, but by stirring up, or commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from God; so whosoever are about to do the Church good, should do it of intention, as doing him service; <hi>He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron his chosen.</hi> 4. As to the end that God may have his own glory in every good work, his part is to be distinguished from his servants part: so when his servants do the servants duty faithfully, God will have them commended and approved for it among men; <hi>Moses</hi> therefore is called <hi>Gods servant,</hi> and <hi>Aaron his chosen.</hi> The signes and wonders, are called the Lords signes and wonders, and <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is called their shewing of his signes; <hi>They shewed his signes among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</hi>

God can make most useful creatures to become noisome; <hi>He turned their waters into blood.</hi> 4. God can plague men in the matter of their meat, as well as in their drink, and when the Lord doth plague in the one, it is not strange if he shall plague in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also; <hi>He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</hi> 5. God can daunt the pride of the stoutest of his enemies, by his meanest creatures; <hi>The land brought forth frogs in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, in the chambers of their Kings.</hi> 6. As the Lord speaketh, so shall it be found in due time, he needeth not to make much ado in any businesse, but speak the word, and it shall be done; <hi>He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies.</hi> 7. When the proud do strive against God, they gaine nothing but more and

When lighter judgements do not move men, God will send more heavy plagues, which shall leave their impression behinde them; <hi>He smote their vines also, and their fig-trees, and brake the trees of their coasts.</hi> 11. When God fights against a people, all the creatures are ready to fight against them also, as they are called forth: <hi>He spake, and the locusts came, and Caterpillars, and that without number.</hi> 12.

Albeit there may be many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the delivery of Gods people out of their trouble, and from their persecutors, yet the work of delivery is perfected at length; for when God had smitten <hi>Egypt</hi> in favour of his own people, <hi>He brought his people forth.</hi> 2. All riches that men have are at Gods disposing, to transfer the right and possession thereof to whom he pleaseth, and the Lords special and expresse warrant gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When God grants a delivery, or any sort of benefit, it is a new gift to inable a man to make use of the offered delivery or bestowed benefit, such was the benefit bestowed on <hi>Israel,</hi> when Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> brought his people out of <hi>Egypt, There was not one feeble person among their tribes.</hi> 4. The Lord can make bloody perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of his people to cease from their persecution, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their delivery; and to be desirous to be rid of them: <hi>Egypt was glad when they departed.</hi> 5. God can make his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted people terrible to their persecutors, which is no lesse a wonder then to make the wolfe tremble for feare of the lambes: <hi>Egypt was glad when they departed, for the feare of them fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi> 6. Except the Lord did take the guiding and protecting of his own people, they should perish many wayes, after their delivery out of trouble: but whom he delivereth he taketh a care of them, as he did of <hi>Israel,</hi> for whom he provided the pillar of cloud, to temper unto them the heat of the day: and the pillar of fire, to temper unto them the darknesse and cold of the night, and made both of them to direct their journey: <hi>He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light in the night.</hi> 7. Sometime the Lord will give unto his people at their earnest desire, that which is not good for them, that so he may give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them evidence of his readiness, much more to give them what is good for them, when they earnestly ask it; <hi>The people asked, and he brought quailes.</hi> 8. When ordinary meanes of the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Gods people do faile; God will provide for them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, as he gave his people Manna in the wildernesse; <hi>And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</hi> 9. As the fountain of the feeding of Gods people, is not in the creatures: but in God,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50629:38"/>
so should the eye of his people be carried above the creatures, unto heaven, for preservation of this life, as well temporal as spiritual: for this end it is said, <hi>He satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</hi> 10. God can bring consolation unexpected, and that by means most unlikely to yield it; <hi>He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out.</hi> 11. There is no scarcity in God, of what the Lords people do stand in need of, he both can and doth furnish plenteously, and makes the opportunity of having the use of his provision follow his people whitherso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he leadeth them; <hi>The waters out of the rock ran in the dry places as a river.</hi> 12. What the Lord doth to his people, he doth it for his Covenants sake; as here, <hi>He remembred his holy promise.</hi> 13. How many yeares soever do intervene Gods promise-making, and the performance, the Lord doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his promise, as here we see after foure hundred and thirty years; <hi>He remembreth his holy promise, and Abraham his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>

               <p>THe summe of this Psalme is to teach the godly in the time of calamity, lying upon the Church, or upon themselves; First, to glorifie God by faith in him. Secondly, to reckon up for their encouragement, the frequent forgivenesse of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sins to his people in former times. And thirdly, to pray for the like favour to themselves; and in hope to have their prayer granted, to give thanks to God. There are three parts of the Psalme answerable thereunto: The first part is the Prophets strengthening of his own faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The Psalmist stirreth up himself and others foure wayes to glorifie God under sad afflictions, by believing on him; First, by exhorting all to praise and thank the Lord for his goodness. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The exercise of praising and thanking the Lord, is very fit for a soul, lying under the sense of affliction and guiltiness: for that whieh serveth for the Lords praise, serveth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the comfort and encouragement of humbled sinners: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, saith he, <hi>Praise ye the LORD.</hi> 2.

               </gap>nes which he useth, to stir up himself and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to glorifie God in believing on him, is wondering at the Lords works, and innumerable causes of praise. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a disposition fit for praising of God, to be sensible of our unability and unfitness, for so great a work, as the Prophet doth shew in this example, saying, <hi>Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord?</hi> 2. There is such an impression of Gods Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on all Gods works, and in special on those works wherein he hath been pleased most clearly to manifest his power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no man can comprehend or express it; <hi>Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord?</hi> 3. Albeit the praises of the Lord surpass all mens ability to declare them, yet neither must the greatness of the work, nor the weakness and unworthiness of the servant of God, hinder him to praise as he is able; for even this is a part
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50629:40"/>
of praising of God, to confesse and say, <hi>Who can shew forth all thy praise?</hi>

            <p>The third meanes whereby he stirreth up himself to glorifie God by believing in him, is a declaring how blessed the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The consideration of the blessing of God upon every true believer, is a notable encouragement to put confidence in God; <hi>Blessed are they that keep judgement, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The evidence of a sincere believer, is not only to keep judgement, that is, to receive, respect and entertain the Word of God, as a decree wisely given forth by him, but also to study to obey it in practice constantly upon all occasions: <hi>Blessed are they that keep judgement, and he that doth righteousnesse at all times.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>The fourth meanes of stirring up himself and others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in God, especially in this time of the presupposed calamity of the Church, and of the Supplicant, is prayer to God for a new proof of the loving kindnesse, which God beareth to his people in all ages. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Whatsoever be the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflicted estate of Gods people, yet they are still beloved, still in favour, even when tokens of anger by publick calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are manifested against them: <hi>Remember me with the favour which thou bearest unto thy people.</hi> 2. There needeth no more felicity unto any man, save to be one of Gods people: it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent any man to have his lot with the children of God, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever condition they are put into: for the Psalmist cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no more, but, <hi>Remember me, O LORD, with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which thou bearest unto thy people.</hi> 3. Albeit the Lords people seem to be forgotten, yet the Lord will make evident that he doth not forget them, nor any one of them: <hi>Remember me, O LORD, with the favour which thou bearest unto thy people.</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50629:40"/>
4. Such as do share with Gods people in their grief, shall be partakers also of their consolation, deliverance and salvation, which God hath wisely prepared for them; therefore prayeth the Psalmist, <hi>O visit me with thy salvation, &amp;c.</hi> 5. As there are times wherein God declareth his displeasure against the sins of his people, so there are times when he removeth the tokens of his displeasure, and letteth forth the evidence of his love and respect to them, in doing them good, making them glad, and causing them to glory in him; this is it which the Psalmist look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after, <hi>Visit me with thy salvation, that I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoyce in the gladnesse of thy Nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</hi> 6. The near interest which God hath in his people, and which they have in him, is a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid ground of hope of good, and gladness, joy and gloriation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for them; for they are Gods <hi>chosen,</hi> Gods <hi>Nation,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate unto him: and his <hi>inheritance,</hi> to remain in his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session from generation to generation; whereupon the Psalmist doth assure himselfe and the Church of his hope of good, reserved for the Church; <hi>That I may see the good of thy chosen, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 6.</hi> We have sinned with our fathers: we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</q>
            <p>In the second place is the confession of sins, for which God justly might afflict the Supplicants, but in his mercy could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them also, as he had done to his people in former generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The force of his reasoning is this, many times thou didst shew mercy to our fathers in their afflictions, notwithstanding their grievous provocations, therefore we must intreat thee, yea, and hope also for the like mercy in our time; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is not for nought that the Lord bringeth calamity on his people, he is provoked so to do by their grievous offences; <hi>We have sinned.</hi> 2. As judgements are sent to convince of sin, and to draw forth the acknowledgement thereof: so there is no re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier way to remove the sin and judgement also, then by confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof; <hi>We have sinned.</hi> 3. As God when he punisheth his people, doth reckon with them, both for their own, and also for their fathers faults, whose footsteps they have followed: so must the penitent reckon with God for their own faults, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50629:41"/>
for their fathers sins whereunto they have accession; <hi>We have sinned with our fathers, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Confession of sins must not be slighted, but seriously gone about, and aggravated duly; <hi>We have sinned, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</hi> 5. True penitents will neither excuse their sins by the example of their fathers, nor justifie themselves, how holy soever they be, when God is pleading with his Church, but will joyne in confession with the multttude, as here the holy Prophet doth; <hi>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</hi>

The Lord hath other things to look unto, when he hath to do with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then presently to fall upon the punishing of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and misdeservings, even when they are found Delinquents: he useth to respect the glory of his mercy toward his people, and the declaration of his power against his enemies in favour of his people; <hi>Neverthelesse he saved them for his Names sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</hi> 4 The manner and circumstances of Gods working, is as well to be considered as the matter, and how easily he bringeth the greatest works to passe; <hi>He rebuked the red-sea also, and it was dried up.</hi> 5. The Lord can make a danger to turne into a delivery, and a peril wherein a man was like to perish, to be a means of preservation; <hi>So he led them through the depths, and through the wildernesse.</hi> 6. In any one mercy unfolded, we may take up more mercies then one, and each particular part of the mercy when it is discovered, will appear no lesse glorious, then the whole mercy looked upon confusedly and in grosse, as here in the delivery at the red-sea, the delivery from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50629:42"/>
and the waters covered their enemies.</hi> 8. When the Lords time cometh to enter in judgement with the foes of his Church, he will not misse one whom he mindeth to overtake, as here, <hi>There was not one of them left.</hi> 9. The Lord sometime worketh so clearly, for convincing of the misbeliever, that the most blinde and obstinate infidel shall be forced to acknowledge his works; <hi>When the waters covered their enemies, then believed they his words.</hi> 10. It serveth much for Gods glory, when he extorteth credit unto his words by wonderful works, but little to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the believers, who give credit to Gods Word upon that ground only; as here we see, for not before, but <hi>then did they believe his words,</hi> which importeth their preceding mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and that their duty was to believe his Word, whatsoever appearance might be to the contrary. 11. A temporary belief extorted by some extraordinary work, may have joyned with it a temporary joy, and praising of God for a time, without any root of saving grace in the heart: <hi>Then they believed his words, they sang his praise.</hi>

Temporary faith with the fruits thereof, lasteth no longer then a new ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation doth assault, and faith grounded not on the word or truth of it, but only on Gods sensible works, is ready to vanish, when the work is a little past and gone; <hi>They soone forget his works.</hi> 2.

and to try them whether they will follow their own will or his <hi>counsel,</hi> as here is insinuated. 4.

When men do not wait on Gods direction, lusts become their leaders, and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous drivers of them as poor slaves to all unreasonable appetites; <hi>They lusted exceedingly.</hi> 6.

They that are ready to change the Government of the Church, which God hath appointed, will be ready also to change the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, as experience in the Israelites doth teach, who are charged with the one fault, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and with the other here; <hi>They made a Calfe in Horeb, and worshipped the molten i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:50629:43"/>
2. Idolaters are so bewitched with the opinion of the lawfulnesse of idolatry, as they dare both devise and practise it in Gods presence; <hi>They made a Calfe in Mount Horeb</hi>; the mountaine where the Lord did shew himself terrible. 3. Albeit image-making in the matter of Religion and image-worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping be an old sin, yet this relative worship offered unto God before an image, is alwayes rejected of God as no worship done to him, but only to the image: for God doth not expound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of worship to an image, or relative worship before an image, according to the intention of the worshipper, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the action, which is discharged in the second command of the moral law: <hi>Israel</hi> in ended to offer the holy day to the Lord, and appointed the worship toward the golden image for him, as the history sheweth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4, 5. <hi>To morrow is a feast of the Lord</hi>: yet here the Lords Spirit decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this to be a worship, not of God, but of the image; <hi>They worshipped the molten image.</hi> 4. Making of images to represent God, or any of the persons of the holy Trinity, is but a vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the glory of God, and giving it to the image of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yea, the making of an image to represent God, is the changing of the glory of God into a vile image of some base creature, and the placing of the one in the others stead and room, for so God judgeth, saying, <hi>Thus they changed their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the similitude of an Oxe that eateth grasse.</hi> 5. To have God for our God, and to have him alone for our God, and the only object of our worship, without any mixture of humane devices is our glory; and to do otherwise is the shame of the worshipper: <hi>They changed their glory into the image of an Oxe.</hi> 6. To devise images or pictures to put us in minde of God, is a very forgetting both of Gods nature, and of his authority, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging such dyvices, for so doth the Lord expound it; <hi>They forgot God their Saviour.</hi> 7. Whatsoever works God hath wrought, for making people know him, are all forgotten as well as God is forgotten, whensoever men may make devices of their own for memorials of God: <hi>They forgot God their Saviour, which had done great things in Egypt, wondrous things in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the red-sea.</hi> 8. Idolatry openly committed in a land, is a cause sufficient to destroy the Nation which is guilty of that sin: for, <hi>Therefore the Lord said he would destroy them.</hi> 9. As they who feare God in a land, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate Gods wrath that it fall not on it, and should stand in the gap to divert the Lords wrath: so is their intercession acceptable
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50629:44"/>
to God, and a hopeful means to divert wrath, as is to be seen in <hi>Moses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who stood up before him to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them</hi> 10. When God is glorified in a peoples obedience unto him, he is a wall about them to save them from harme; but when he is provoked by open idolatry or avowed sin, then is a gap made in the wall of his protection, that mischief may enter now in upon them at the breach: <hi>He said he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach.</hi>

When the promised inheritance of heaven, (which was figured by the pleasant <hi>land of promise,</hi>) is not counted worthy of all the paines and difficulties, which can be sustained and met with in the way of going toward it: the promised inheritance is but little esteemed of, as appeareth in the Israelites, who for love of ease, and fear of the Canaanites were ready to turne back to <hi>Egypt; They despised the pleasant land.</hi> 2. Misbelieving of Gods Word, is the cause of disesteeming of his precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as here is shewen; <hi>They believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not his Word.</hi> 3. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimation of Gods precious promises, maketh men to quarrel with Gods providence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he is leading men to the possession thereof: for this made the Israelites male content with all that God had done unto them: <hi>They murmured in their tents.</hi> 4. When Gods dispensation doth not please men, they will not faile to take a course of their own, and misregard what God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

them: <hi>They murmured in their tents, and hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.</hi> The faithlesse man is secluded from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and from Gods rest by an Oath; <hi>They hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord, therefore he lifted up his hand against them</hi>; that is, not only began to smite them; but also as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. <hi>He swore they should not enter into his rest.</hi> 6. We should fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of us should seem to come short of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. and we should labour to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.11. because against unbelieving <hi>Israelites, God lifed up his hand to overthrow them in the wildernesse.</hi> 7. The Lords vengeance against unbelievers, and despisers of the Gospel, and of the precious promises thereof, readily doth follow the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of unbelievers, as here the vengeance reached, <hi>To over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</hi> 8. As the Lords threatenings do go forth for sure execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so they leave room to repentance and intercession, and do make both the man that perisheth inexcusable, and the man that is spared to know the wrath which he hath deserved; For God lifted up his hand to destroy the unbeliever in the wildernesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did destroy them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and threatened the posterity before the execution did come: For this the Apostle, <hi>Heb</hi> 4. doth teach us, from the example of Gods dealing with the <hi>Israelites.</hi>

evident in the Israelites; who by the lust of their flesh, mixed themselves with the daughters of <hi>Moab</hi>; and then joyned with them in their Idolatry: <hi>They joyned themselves also to Baal-Peor.</hi> 2. Idolatry is a breach of wed-lock with God, and an adulterous joyning of a mans soul to an Idol; <hi>They joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Baal-Peor.</hi> 3. Communion with Idolaters in worship, or in ceremonies and appendicles of Idolatrous worship, doth prove the Communicants to be guilty of Idolatry; <hi>They are the sacrifice of the dead.</hi> 4. Such as fall from true Religion to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, do make an ill bargain; they go from the living God to dead Idols, and deadly Idolatry; <hi>They are the sacrifice of the dead.</hi> 5. Mens devices in Religion, and Gods acceptable Ordinances, do stand in opposition one to another: for mens inventions cannot please God, <hi>For thus they provoked him with their inventions.</hi> 6. Nothing doth draw on more suddain and sore judgement, then change of the true worship of God with mens inventions: <hi>They provoked him to anger, with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them</hi> 7. Such as have warrant from God to punish open sin, should not delay justice; for thus much doth the extraordinary service of <hi>Phinehas</hi> teach unto the ordinary Magistrate, who beareth the sword by office: <hi>Then stood up Phineas to exceute judgement.</hi> 8. As the Lord is loath to strike when he is provoked, so he is ready to hold his hand, and cease upon any covenient occasion: <hi>Phinehas stood up to execute judgement, and so the plague was stayed.</hi> 9. The rule and order which God hath appointed unto men to follow, doth not hinder God to give extraordinary commission to whom he pleaseth, for any extraordinary piece of service, as appeareth in this instance of <hi>Phinehas.</hi> 10. What God doth set men a work to do by inward and immediate inspiration, that he maketh manifest to the Church by his revealed word of approbation, as the inspired command given to <hi>Phinehas,</hi> was justified by Gods revealed will to the Church: I say, <hi>by inspiration</hi>; because im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions on mens spirits, or instigations unto that which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God doth not allow; or secret impulses unto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful actions, is one thing, and inspiration of Gods extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary direction unto any special work, is another thing: for <hi>inspiration from God,</hi> was the way of shunning Gods revealved will, which was to be communicated with the Church, by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way of command given to the Prophet; such as was that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, whereby God used sometimes to reveal his will to the Church, before the writing of the Scripture was fully closed:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50629:45"/>
Thus God revealed his will expressely to <hi>Abraham,</hi> concerning the offering of his son <hi>Isaac:</hi> Thus God gave order to <hi>Moses</hi> for the Israelites borrowing of the Jewels of the Egyptians, upon his own right and title, which he hath unto all the creatures to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of them at his pleasure: Thus the whole Scripture was not of private interpretation, but the holy men of God spake as they were inspired and moved by the Holy Ghost; And thus was <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas</hi> instructed unto the particular service: but impressions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsions, instigations, which are not according to the revealed rule of Gods Word, which now is fully set down in Scripture, as they want Gods moral direction to teach them, so also they want Gods moral approbation: I say, <hi>moral direction,</hi> because pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential leading of a man unto any action, is one thing, and moral direction is another thing. In the way of providential lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a man may be led in Gods justice by his own lusts, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans impulse into tentation; against which evil Christ directeth us to pray, <hi>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from that evil,</hi> or the evil one. But where morall direction is, the man hath his manifested commission, and knoweth formally the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his action, and so doth not sin therein; in providential leading, a man is onely a brute instrument, as the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was, whom God made use of as of a rod of his indignation, and he knew it not: but in moral direction, the man is a rational servant, as knowing what he doth to be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able service; and so was <hi>Moses</hi> in all the house of God a faithful servant, doing all as God commanded <hi>Moses;</hi> and so was <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas</hi> here Gods servant, following morally a clear divine inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a clear command and direction, and therefore had he also Gods morall approbation: <hi>For it was counted to him for righteousnesse.</hi> 11. As there is a justification of a mans person, which is only by faith in Jesus Christ; so there is a justification of a certain deed or action, when it is accepted by God for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and of this sort is the justification of <hi>Phinehas</hi> his zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous act: for this act was <hi>imputed unto him for righteousnesse,</hi> or for a righteous piece of service. 12. What God doth justifie, whether it be a man, or a mans action, no man may condemne it, for it standeth absolved, as in this may be seen; <hi>It wat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto him for righteousnesse, unto all generations for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>

            <p>The seventh sin confessed, is murmuring at <hi>Meribah</hi> for want of water, whereby meek <hi>Moses</hi> was drawen in the snare of a rash speech, and of a notable inconveniency, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Oft repeated sin obstinately persisted in, cannot but provoke God to anger; for as before they had murmured, so also now murmuring again, <hi>They angered God at the waters of strife.</hi> 2. When the Lords servants in doing their calling are striven against, there God is also striven against; for this cause the place where the people strove with <hi>Moses,</hi> is called the waters of strife: to wit, with God, because they strove with <hi>Moses.</hi> 3. The Lords servants are in danger to be drawen into sundry ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and snares, by the evil carriage of the people, over whom they have charge, as by occasion of the peoples murmuring, <hi>It went ill with Moses for their sakes.</hi> 4. Albeit men are to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied who are provoked to sin, yet the provocation excuseth not the sinner, but it aggravateth the sin of the provoker; as here, <hi>It went ill with Moses yet for their sakes: Because they provoked his spirit.</hi> 5.

            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:50629:46"/>The eight sin, is their disobedience to Gods command after they were placed in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is set down in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particulars. The first is, their sparing of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> whom God commanded them to destroy. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and omission of that which God doth command to be done, doth bring men under guiltinesse and challenge and wrath, and proveth the fountain of more mischief afterwards, then men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, as here appeareth; <hi>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them.</hi> 2. Men should not spare the lives of those whom God commandeth to destroy, lest God make a quarrel of it, as here he doth against the <hi>Israelites.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>The second particular following on the former sparing of the <hi>Canaanits,</hi> is forbidden marriages with them, and contagion of their ill manners. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Sinnes of omission, make way for, and draw on sins of commission, as here we see. 2. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall matching with open Idolaters, draweth on contagion of Idolatry; <hi>They were mingled with the heathen, and learned their works. And they served their Idols:</hi> 3. Making of images in the matter of Religion, is a work of the heathen; for so it is here reckoned and called, <hi>their work.</hi> 4. Image-worshipping, and Idolatry, is a sin that is easily learned, the contagion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth spread quickly, <hi>For the</hi> Canaanites <hi>Idols were a snare to the</hi> Israelites. 5. Service to Images is condemned of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of Images is condemned: yea, God comprehendeth under service, all and whatsoever respect done to Images, as an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and damnable sin; <hi>For they served their Idols,</hi> is here the challenge. 6. How pleasant soever, and delectable, and profitable men do plead Images to be; yet God esteemeth of them as dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inventions, which bring no profit to their servants and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers, save dolour and grief; for so much doth the word in the Original give us to understand. 7. Whatsoever faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences men do suffer themselves to be led away with, unto the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of Idolaters and service of images, are nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding

            <p>A third particular of their disobedience in <hi>Canaan,</hi> is their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing their children to Idols, whereby the land was fearfully polluted. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When men depart from the rule of Gods Worship, there is no stay nor standing till they fall into the grossest Idolatry, whereunto they are tempted: <hi>Yea,</hi> (saith he) <hi>they sacrificed their sonnes and daughters.</hi> 2. The rage of Idolatry is such, as it will not spare whatsoever is dearest, even the lives of children and friends to maintain it: <hi>They sacrificed their sons and daughters.</hi> 3. The service done to Idols, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of mans devising, is not done to God, as men do pretend who worship them; but to Devils, who are the devisers, suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers nnd enticers of men unto all sort of unlawful worship; and who are served and obeyed in effect by false Religion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.17. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. <hi>They sacrificed their sons and daught<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Idolaters are blood-thirsty, and do not stand for the innocency of any party or person, by whose blood-shed the Idol may be honoured, and Satan may be pleased who is a liar and murtherer from the beginning: <hi>They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the Idols of</hi> Canaan. 5. When innocent blood is shed, the land is polluted, whatsoever be the cause which is pretended; <hi>They shed innocent blood, and the land was polluted with blood.</hi> 6.

Following of mens inventions in Religion, is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry or spirituall adultery, because God is forsaken in so farre, and another god and lord in Religion is received in Gods stead: for so much faith the Text, <hi>They went a whoring with their own inventions.</hi>

            <p>Here is shewen what followed on their following of their own inventions, to wit, slavery and subjection unto men, in Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When men do follow sin and their own wayes, wrath followeth them: <hi>For therefore was the wrath of God kindled against his own people.</hi> 2. When from the Word of the Lord men will not believe how odious superstition is to him, he will make them finde it by his plagues: <hi>For therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled.</hi> 3.

When Gods people do follow the superstition of Idolaters, either by complying to gratifie them, or in way of pleasing themselves; it is justice with God to make Idolaters their masters, and to make his people lose the benefit hoped for by complyance: <hi>And he gave them into the hand of the heathen.</hi> 5. It is righteousnesse with God to put his people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of men that hate them, when they have cast off the easie yoke of God who loveth them: And when men follow wayes which God abhorreth, God justly doth make them suffer what they do most abhorre; <hi>He gave them over into the hand of the heathen: and they that hated them, ruled over them.</hi> 6. The sins of Gods people do make open way for their enemies, and do put strength, courage, and victory into their hands; and lest the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50629:48"/>
Lords people should not be moved by that change of government, he makes their burden under their enemies unsupportable: <hi>Their enemies also oppressed them.</hi> 7. When people will not humble themselves in the way of repentance, it is righteousnesse with God to bring them low by judgements, as here is seen: The <hi>Israelites</hi> do not repent of their sins, <hi>And they were brought into subjection under their enemies hand.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>The ninth and last point of confession, is of a heap of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold sins often repeated; notwithstanding which God did shew pity to his people for his Covenants cause. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord leaveth no means unessayed to gain his people, sometimes he puts them to sore trouble, sometimes he delivereth them, and exerciseth them with the vicissitude of calamities, and deliveries, if by any means they may be saved: <hi>Many times did he deliver them.</hi> 2. Such is our wickednesse and perverse na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that still we give the Lord a bad meeting for his mercies; and instead of thankfulnesse, do provoke him by doing and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing what we our selves think fittest, as is to be seen in the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites: Many times did God deliver them, but they provoked him with their counsel.</hi> 3. Men in the course of their sins, have high and self-pleasing conceits of themselves, and no impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is without pride; but by sad judgements God many times maketh them lie low in affliction, who do not walk humbly in the way of obedience, as here we see the <hi>Israelites provoked God by their counsel,</hi> that is, by their own devices, conceits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; <hi>But they were made low by their iniquities.</hi> 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Gods people oft-times provoke him, and in their prosperity
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50629:48"/>
do not regard God nor his commands; yet God regards them so, as both after a whiles prosperity, to correct them; and after a whiles adversity, to comfort them: <hi>Neverthelesse he regarded their affliction.</hi> 5. God by heavy affliction moveth men to cry unto him, who otherwise would not have called upon him at all, as his dealing with proud provoking <hi>Israel</hi> here doth shew, who in affliction are made <hi>to cry.</hi> 6. Albeit there be commonly great unsoundnesse in the cry of oppressed people; yet God will hear that cry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and help them out of a temporal trouble, as here; <hi>He regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry.</hi> 7. As when Gods people do abuse his grace, and do forget their Covenant, and are plagued for their sins; the good of the Covenant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with God is obscured, buried, and as it were forgotten: So when the Lord doth change his dispensation, the benefit and good of the Covenant is brought to light again; for then God taketh occasion to shew, that albeit his people do forget the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet he forgets it not: <hi>For he remembered for them,</hi> or, for their behalfe, <hi>his Covenant.</hi> 8. The unchangeablenesse of Gods merciful nature and love to his people, maketh him change the course of justice into mercie, and no other change, except of this dispensation is meant by Gods repentance, when it is said, <hi>And he repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</hi> 9. The mercy of the Lord is so large, as the multitude of former sins, and abused by-past favours cannot hinder the sinner once again to come unto the inexhaustible fountaine of grace, and cannot hinder God once more to shew mercy to a sinner; yea, albeit God hath entered in judgment with the sinner, and hath begun to poure our deserved wrath upon him; even justice thus begun to be executed, cannot hinder God to hold his hand, and shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy once again to the sinner: for here experience teacheth, that oft times when he had entered in judgement with <hi>Israel, He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented according to the multitude of his mercies.</hi> 10. God hath the ruling of all mens affections, to make them turne as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth: God mixeth the most bitter cup of judgement given to his people to drinke, with the ingredient <hi>of compassion</hi>; and what pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty his people do finde from any hand, it is the fruit, effect, and evidence of Gods pitie toward them: <hi>He made them also to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of all those that carried them capt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The last part of the Psalm, wherein the Psalmist draweth two conclusions from what he hath been speaking, and teacheth the Church to do the same in their sad afflictions: The one is a prayer for the fresh experience of the like mercy unto the Church; and to every member thereof in their time, <hi>v.</hi> 47. The other is a praising of God in assurance of faith, that he would certainly do so, <hi>v.</hi> 48. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The right use of the history of Gods mercies to his Church, is to go to God in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and to encourage our selves to seek and expect the like to our selves: <hi>Save us</hi> also, saith the Church here. 2. Seeing God in shewing mercy to his people, doth alwayes respect the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; it is good for the sinner not to quit his interest therein, but to claime new experience of mercy, according to the tenour thereof: For this respect, the Church prayeth here; <hi>Save us, O LORD our God.</hi> 3. The visible Church may be so defaced for a time, that howsoever the visible members thereof can never cease to be, but one generation shall follow another; yet the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward societies and solemne assemblies of the Church, may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved and disappear by scattering of them, as this part of their prayer, <hi>Gather us,</hi> doth import. 4. It is a heavie affliction for the godly to live in the company of enemies: and of men of a false Religion: from this evil they desire to be delivered, <hi>Gather us from among the heathen.</hi> 5. The face of a visible Church, wherein we may have the communion of Saints, and occasions to dwell together with them, and enjoy with them the publick and free use of Religion; is a great mercy, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that God should be intreated for it: <hi>Gather us from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the heathen, to give thanks to thy holy Name.</hi> 6. The Lords people are allowed to glory in the LORD, and to boast in his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50629:49"/>
praise; and the end of their seeking the liberty of free assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of themselves together, should be, that they may declare the LORDS praise, and glory in him: <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther us to give thanks to thy holy Name, and to triumph in thy praise.</hi> 7. When we have prayed according to Gods will, we should take our prayer for granted, and leave it lying at GODS feet, as the Church doth here. 8. Let the LORD do to his Covenanted people what he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, they shall never want reason to praise, thank and blesse him, for the closing of this Psalme teacheth so much: <hi>Blessed be the LORD GOD of Israel.</hi> 9. The LORD is the everliving Fountaine of spirituall and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting blessings to his owne people; and whatsoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of temporal things, there is reason of blessing GOD for spirituall and everlasting mercies; and to say, <hi>Blessed be the LORD GOD of Israel, from everlasting to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the Spirit of the LORD doth raise the Song of the praises of GOD by his Prophets and Ministers; It is the Brides part, and the part of every Member of the Church, to joyne in the thanksgiving, and subscribe with acclamation unto the blessing of GOD: <hi>And let all the people say, Amen.</hi> 11.

               <p>THis is a Psalme of praise for Gods gracious and wise dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations towards men.

            <p>Here is set down the second exercise of Gods people, to wit, by captivity and imprisonment brought upon them for their sins, and their delivery from it, upon their turning to God, with the use thereof. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As liberty of our persons to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our callings freely, is no small benefit; so imprisonment is a sore affliction, even a sort of living death, and a sort of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the quick: <hi>For they sit in darknesse, and in the shadow of death.</hi> 2. Bonds and chaines put upon the prisoner, do adde much weight unto the heavy condition of the imprisoned, and yet the Lords people are subject to both: for here is presupposed, <hi>They may be bound in affliction and iron,</hi> in their prison. 3. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the affliction of imprisonment and bonds, when the cause of the imprisonment is not righteousnesse, but, <hi>because they have rebelled against the word of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High.</hi> 4. The not bearing the easie yoke of obedience, may bring on the heavier yoke of Iron, bonds and imprisonment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, as here is expressed. 5. The greatnesse of the Majesty of God, aggravateth the sin of despising his Word; <hi>They contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the counsell of the most High.</hi> 6. As the Word of the Lord is both deep counsel for wisdome, and also profitable advice for us; so the contemning of it is so much the greater sinne, and draweth on the greater wrath: <hi>They were bound in affliction and iron, because they rebelled against the words of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the counsel of the most High.</hi> 7. The Lord bringeth men into sore distresses, to make them sensible of their despising his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and to break their natural pride, and stoutnesse of heart against him, and to shew them the vanity of all their former fleshly confidence: <hi>Therefore he brought down their heart with labour.</hi> 8. Affliction is then come to the height, and its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat measure, when the sinner is made sensible of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and doth see that there is no help for him, save in God alone:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50629:52"/>
               <hi>They fell down, and there was none to help.</hi> 9. When all help and comfort under heaven doth faile, relief may be found in God for them that cry unto him for it: <hi>There was none to help, then they cryed to the Lord in their trouble.</hi> 10. The Lord will not only hear and help them who are unjustly imprisoned, but those also who for their sins are so punished: <hi>They cryed, and he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them out of their distresses.</hi> 11. It matters not how deep the danger be wherein a man is, when he turneth to God for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: for so great as his distresse is, so great shall be his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>He brought them out of darknesse and the shadow of death, and brake their bonds in sunder.</hi> 12. The end of the delivery of poor sinners, is, that they may glorifie the Lord, and may invite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do the like: for this here is a part of the thankful mans duty, <hi>O that men would praise the Lord for his goodnesse, and for his wonderful works to the children of men.</hi> 13. No power of man, no bonds, no opposition which any creature is able to make, can hinder the delivery of the man whom God will own: <hi>He hath broken the gates of brasse, and cut the barres of iron in sunder.</hi>

for sinning against God, so doth sicknesse come amongst the rest: <hi>Fooles because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities are afflicted.</hi> 2. Sin doth blinde sinners, and bereave them of the right use of their reason; and makes them choose trifles, with the losse of what should be most precious: therefore they are just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>fooles.</hi> 3. Natural means of life and refreshment, are unsavory and unable to refresh, except God give the man ability to make use of them, and put his blessing into them: <hi>Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat.</hi> 4. As in other troubles, so in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, men are not easily brought to the sense of their sin, till trouble be at the height, and the man made low: <hi>Their soul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth all manner of meat, and they draw near to the gates of death.</hi> 5. Great is the stupidity of a sleeping conscience, which cannot be wakened up to seek Gok till extremity come: <hi>They draw near to the gates of death, then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble.</hi> 6. When men are brought unto the sense of their sins and misdeservings, and of their danger, and of their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and thereby made to seek unto the Lord, the mercy and relief is near at hand: <hi>Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, so he saved them out of their distresses:</hi> And here is to be seen mercy and goodnesse in God, to cause sicknesses as his Serjeants and Messengers to lay hold on the fugitive sinner. 7. Neither sicknesse nor health do come or go, but God giveth order to them, as to his own servants: He saith to <hi>sicknesse,</hi> go from a man; and to <hi>heal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When trouble doth shew wrath, and that doth weaken the sense of sin, and sense of sin sends the man to seek mercy, then God will readily remove all his troubles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>He sent his word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Art of Navigation and following of the Merchant-Trade by Sea, how dangerous soever it be; yet is lawful, and allowed of God, for compassing of mens affaires, in commerce between Nation and Nation: for this is set down here as the vocation and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of some men, to wit, of <hi>those that go down to the Sea in ships, that do businesses in great waters.</hi> 2.

            <p>In the latter part of the Psalme, the Lord is praised for his wisdome, in making changes upon Countreys and Nations, mens persons and estates, some in justice, some in mercy, as he seeth fit: of which changes he reckoneth up five. The first whereof is, the turning of a fertile land into barrennesse for the inhabitants sins. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When fertile land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh barren, and men are cut short of their commodities by sea or land, by the creatures not yielding service, as they were wont to do, men should lift their eyes above all second causes, and fix them on God, who what way he thinketh best bringeth the change: <hi>He turneth rivers into a wildernesse, and the water-springs into dry ground</hi>; that is to say, <hi>a fruitful land into barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> 2. The proper meritorious cause of Gods cursing of a fertile land, is the sins of the inhabitants, whom God will have so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in their labours on the ground, as they answer the Lord in his husbandry and paines taken upon them, and whom God will chastise for their sin, and so move them to repent: <hi>He turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a fruitful land into barrennesse, for the wickednesse of them that dwell therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 35.</hi> He turneth the wilderness into a standing water: and dry ground into water-springs.</p>
               <p n="36">
                  <hi>36.</hi> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell; that they may prepare a city for habitation.</p>
               <p n="37">
                  <hi>37.</hi> And sowe the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of intrease.</p>
               <p n="38">
                  <hi>38.</hi> He blessed them also, so that they are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied greatly: and suffereth not their cattel to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The second change mentioned, is of a barren land into fertility. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The fertility of land is not to be attributed to mens industry, but unto God: <hi>He turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50629:55"/>
the wildernesse into a standing water, and dry ground into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-springs.</hi> 2. If God afflict, his justice findeth the cause of it in man: but if he do good to any man, it is of his own good pleasure, without any cause in man: therefore no reason is given here of this change, as was of the former, but simply, <hi>He turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth dry ground into water-springs.</hi> 3. The Lord taketh pleasure to provide for the needy, and they shall be forced to acknowledge his goodnesse in his provision for them: <hi>And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation.</hi> 4. When God openeth a door of blessing men, he will have it improved, and ordinary meanes diligently used, as here, <hi>He will have them sowe the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</hi> 5. When the Lord is pleased <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o blesse men, he will blesse them largely in the growth of their families and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and will extend his care even to their beasts; <hi>He bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them also, so as they are multiplied greatly, and suffereth not their cattel to decrease.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 39.</hi> Again, they are minished and brought low, through oppression, affliction and sorrow.</q>
            <p>The third change is, by spoiling a populous and well-planted countrey. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such as have been raised from a low condition, can hardly bear prosperity, but are readily puffed up with it, as this change presupposeth. 2. God can bring down such as do abuse prosperity, and make them as base as ever they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Again, they are minished and brought low.</hi> 3. The Lord hath more wayes then one to spoile a fertile countrey; for albeit he do make it continue fertile, yet he can bring the sword of the enemie on it: <hi>They are brought low, through oppression, affliction and sorrow.</hi>

               <hi>Ver. 40.</hi> He poureth contempt upon Princes: and causeeh them to wander in the wilderness, <hi>where there is</hi> no way.</q>
            <p>A fourth change is, in the pulling down Princes, and putting Statesmen to perplexity. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers do not keep their place, and power, and estimation among
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50629:56"/>
men, but by Gods investing them with dignity, so when they lose their dignity and are despised, they must look to God as the doer, and search the quarrel: for God will honour them that honour him, and they who despise him shall be lightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed: <hi>He poureth contempt upon Princes.</hi> 2. It is God who giveth wisdom and prudence unto men, for ruling of States; and when their wit is employed for their own earthly interest, he can take their wisdome from them, and give them a cup of giddie wine, and put them in such perplexity, as they know not what to do; he can banish them out of their countrey, and send them as vagabonds through the earth; <hi>He causeth them to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the wildernesse, where there is no way.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 41.</hi> Yet setteth he the poore on high from affliction: and maketh <hi>him</hi> families like a flock.</q>
            <p>The fifth change is, in comforting the afflicted, and raising them out of the dust into a better condition, after they are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the sense of their own poverty. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Lord casteth down the mighty, and putteth the wise to perplexity, yet he will pursue them no further then unto hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, if so be they take with their sins, and seek reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with God, as his Word prescribeth, and depend upon God as needy poor soules, he will lift them up again; <hi>Yet he setteth the poore on high from affliction.</hi> 2. As pride and self-estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because of riches, or power, or wisdom, or any other earthly reason, goeth before ruine; so lowlinesse of minde, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation in the sense of sin and of unworthinesse, and of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and witlesnesse, driving a man to depend on God, as a begger doth for almes, goeth before exaltation; <hi>He setteth the poore on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:50629:56"/>He closeth the Psalme with two promises, one of performing what is here said, to the comfort of the righteous, and shame of the misbelieving proud sinner: The other is of manifesting his loving kindnesse to such as do observe and make use of Gods providence. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such as being justified by faith, do endeavour to order their conversation righteously, shall be witnesses of the Lords performing of his Word: <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous shall see it.</hi> 2. As there is joy in believing of the Lords Word, so there is yet more joy in beholding the performance of his Word; <hi>The righteous shall see it and rejoyce.</hi> 3. Among other mercies bestowed upon the righteous man, this is one, that the Lord putteth him upon the counsel of his working, doth expound his providence unto him by his Word, teacheth him to compare Gods Word and his Works, and maketh him wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that God is as good as his Word; <hi>The righteous shall see it and rejoyce.</hi> 4. The wicked shall be disappointed of his expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in regard of the good which he hoped to himself, and shall finde himself mistaken about the godly, whose wayes he counted to be folly: <hi>The righteous shall rejoyce, and all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity shall stop her mouth.</hi> 5. As the works of the Lords good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, justice and mercy are wrought in the sight of men, that they may observe his way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and keep the observation thereof in memory: so are they the wisest sort of men, who do observe Gods providence best, and do compare it with the Lords Word, that they may understand it rightly; <hi>Who so is wise, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these things.</hi> The wise man, and the observer of Gods wayes toward the children of men, here is one. 6. Albeit there be very few wise observers of Gods proceeding with men in justice or mercy, yet so many as are his disciples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Students of his Word, and do walk answerably thereunto, shall never want matter of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Gods kindnesse toward themselves; <hi>For who so is wise, even they shall observe the loving kindnesse of the Lord.</hi>

Again, in these two former Psalmes, whence he doth repeat the words of this Psalme, he had his own interest to plead, beside what was typical in his exercise: Here, his own interest being setled, and the promise made to himself perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he recommendeth this experience of his in a more abstract notion from his own particular, and in a more typical way of a pledge of the victory of the true Church militant, under her Head and Lord, over all her both intestine enemies and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, without the verge of the visible Profession, that in the faith of Christ, and hope of his prevailing in the work of enlarging and reforming of the visible Catholick Church, and overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the open enemies of Christs Kingdome, typified under the exercise of <hi>David,</hi> the true subjects of Christ might go on in their warfare with the greater confidence.</p>

It is our duty, especially when we are about any piece of immediate spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual worship, to take heed what we are doing, what the work is about which we are going, who the Lord is with whom we have to do, and how our heart is disposed, that so we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our selves to God with the more comfort: for this doth the Psalmists example teach us; <hi>O God, my heart is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I will sing.</hi> 2. In Gods worship it is very needful we should have our mindes present without diversion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our affections composed, and set rightly toward the Lord, and the work in hand, as here, <hi>My heart is fixed.</hi> 3.

            <p>Here is the praise of God, and the reasons thereof; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is no small help unto the discharge of a duty, to engage the heart unto God for the doing of it, for in effect that is the most we can attain unto in this life, but in the next life we shall have full vent for our will to praise God, and shall follow our purpose with perpetual perseverance: <hi>I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people.</hi> 2. Sincerity hath confidence to professe its purpose before the Lord: <hi>I will praise thee, O Lord.</hi> 3. As it is the duty and desire also of a true worshipper, that all the world should be stirred up to praise the Lord: so it was the comfort of the Church of the Jewes, to foresee the joyning of the Gentiles in the song, and to see the Gentiles stirred up by the songs of the Jewish Church; <hi>I will praise thee, O Lord, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, and will sing praises unto thee among the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> 4. The matter and reasons of Gods praise, are higher then the worshipper can reach, and larger then he can fathom, and in special the mercy of the Lord toward his people, is lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the wide circle of Heaven: <hi>Thy mercy is great above the Heavens.</hi> 5.

In the third part, he putteth up a prayer to God for himself, and is comforted.

And so <hi>David</hi> here, is not satisfying his own private revenge against <hi>Achitophel,</hi> or any other such like traitor, but as a Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling what judgement was to fall on the desperate enemies of God, and as a Saint subscribing to Gods righteous judgements, for the terrour of all opposers of Christs Kingdom.</p>

A good conscience may be sure to be cleared from false imputations, and should comfort it self with Gods approbation in the meane time, because whatsoever infamie the believer doth lie under, the Lord will bring forth his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and commendation: for this reason among others, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth call the Lord, <hi>O God of my praise.</hi> 4. Impudent back-biters will put such a face upon the most wicked calumny and slander of an innocent servant of God, and will avow it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in his face, as if it were of truth, as here we see: <hi>For the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me, they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</hi> 5 An innocent man may be so circumvented with calumnies and lies forged of him, as he shall be unable to finde out any way to clear himself, as here we see; <hi>They compassed me about also with words of hatred,</hi> 6.

It is not the way to overcome the calumnies of the wicked, to render reviling for reviling, or to loose the tongue unto evil words; but the only way to overcome all, is to go to God as Supplicants, as here the Psalmist did; <hi>But I gave my self to prayer.</hi> 9.

            <p>In this second part of the Psalme, he pronounceth the most fearful vengeance of God upon malicious calumniators, and that as a Prophet and the Messenger of God, to shew the wrath of God against such wicked persons in general, and especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enemies of the Gospel; for he speaketh here as the type of Christ, as <hi>Peter</hi> sheweth, applying this prophecie to <hi>Iudas</hi> by name, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit it be not lawful for any man to use such imprecations, out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenge, or against any man in particular, as <hi>David</hi> doth, who was led as a Prophet by the Spirit of God, yet this doth shew unto us, that fearful and heavie are those judgements which attend ingrateful calumniators of honest men, and in special all such as are enemies to Christ and to his Gospel, and to his faithful Ministers, or to those in whom the work of Gods grace doth appear, and that in special for their devising and fostering lies and slanders of them that professe Gods truth, of purpose to make them, and the truth which they maintaine, and all of their kinde, to be the more hated and despised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: for this which is written here, shall be their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according as they draw deeper in this sort of transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

and do approach to <hi>Iudas</hi> his treacherie. 2. More special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, these are the wages and reward of the desperate enemies of Christ, and the Gospel, and Christs servants; First, all sort of mischief shall come upon such a mans own person from men, and from devils, and from Judicatories, and from Heaven, Wrath shall be on him, in relation to his liberty, to his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, to his suits of law, and his exercise of Religion, till he be cut off from the world, and rooted from his place, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. Secondly, mischief shall be on his family, wife and children, goods and estate, whereof his children shall have no benefit, but be exposed to all misery without pity, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12. Thirdly, mischief shall be upon his posterity till they be rooted out, with infamie to him of whom they came, being pursued in wrath to the third and fourth generation, as the children of him that hated God, till his fame and memory perish, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15. and that for his mercilesse persecuting of the Lords poor children, <hi>v.</hi> 16. Fourthly, the curse of God, without hope of Gods blessing, shall pursue his gracelesse and cursed disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the vexation of his soul and body, and it shall be fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened on him on all hands perpetually, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18, 19. as the just reward of the deadly enemies of the Lord, and of the salvation of his people, <hi>v.</hi> 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this is set down as a part of a Psalme of <hi>David,</hi> to be sung unto Gods praise, and allowed and said <hi>Amen</hi> unto, by all the people of God, against the desperate and unreconcileable enemies of Christ, and of his true servants, whereby the Church of God may be edified and kept fast in the faith and profession of Christ, and free from persecution of his faithful servants.</p>

            <p>From his first prayer, and the reason thereof; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever mischief be appointed for the enemies of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ, it shall not prejudice the godly persecuted, nor hinder their accesse unto God, or Gods befriending of them, for so teacheth the Psalmist; <hi>But do thou for me. O God, the Lord.</hi> 2. It concerneth God in his glory, as to punish his foes, so to defend his friends and children: <hi>Do thou for me for thy Names sake.</hi> 3. The plea of the believer is not his own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but the readiness of Gods mercy unto Supplicants; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thy mercy is good, deliver thou me</hi> 4. Because God is good and merciful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he will not suffer his own to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in their affliction; <hi>Because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.</hi> 5. Before the Lord do comfort his children in their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he bringeth them to the sense of their own insufficiency, and of their need of his help, and when this poverty of spirit is given, it is a fore runner of delivery; <hi>Deliver thou me, for I am poor and needy.</hi> 6. As the Lord by affliction doth waken the sense of sin, and wound the mans spirit, so is he a ready Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician to the contrite: <hi>Deliver thou me, for my heart is wounded within me.</hi> 7. This mortal life is like a shadow, and when affliction is superadded to mortality, mans life is like the shadow of the evening, which is speedily stretched forth til it vanish, and when a Saint is in this condition, he may expect the fruit of Gods compassion, as here, <hi>Deliver me, for I am gone like a shadow when it declineth.</hi> 8. The children of God must not look for any certain dwelling place, but to be driven to and fro by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, as the winde maketh the locust to leap from place to place; <hi>I am tossed up and down as the locust.</hi> 9. The grief of the godly under persecutio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> may overcome the natural comfort of meat and drink, and bring their body to wasting leannesse; <hi>My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>

10. As it is usual for the wicked to mock the godly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought low by persecution: so there is no part of the crosse more heavie to the godly then derision; <hi>I became also a reproach unto them when they looked upon me.</hi> 11. That which God doth threaten for a curse on the wicked, may for the point of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calamity fall upon the dearest children of God; as what is threatened, <hi>Deut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

As trouble is lengthened and lyeth on, so must prayer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and insisted upon, as here: <hi>Help me, O Lord my God, and save me according to thy mercy.</hi> 2. When the Lords children do perceive that Gods honour is obscured by their suffering, they become no lesse desirous to have God restored to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then to have themselves delivered from trouble; <hi>Save me, that they may know that this is thy hand, that thou, Lord, hast done it.</hi> 3. Albeit the Lord be the inflicter of the troubles of the godly for their trial, and for manifestation of his truth toward them, and grace in them, yet the world cannot perceive this, till God lift up the hand of his own out of trouble; <hi>Save me, that they may know that this is thy hand, and that thou, Lord, hast done it.</hi> 4. When God sheweth himself reconciled to a soul, light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth in trouble, to let them see both their own relief, and the

overthrow of their adversaries, as here is shewen in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the condition of the godly and their enemies. 5. It matters not what the enemie speak against the godly, so long as God approveth them: yea, the more the enemie be despiteful, the more will the Lord be kinde to his servants: <hi>Let them curse, but blesse thou.</hi> 6. When the controversie between the godly, and their persecutors cometh before the Lord to be judged, shame shall cover the face of the persecutor, and Gods childe shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; <hi>When they arise,</hi> (to wit, for pleading of their cause) <hi>let them be ashamed, but let thy servant rejoyce.</hi> 7. The pretences whereby the wicked deceive their own consciences in persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Saints, shall be their sin, and their shame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; <hi>Let mine adversaries be cloathed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</hi>

            <p>He closeth his prayer and the Psalme comfortably. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

               <p>THis Psalme containeth the doctrine of Christ, God and man in one person, concerning his everlasting Kingdom and Priesthood, whose Kingdom albeit begun to be manifested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewes, yet was to be extended unto the Gentiles with great success, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3 As for his Priesthood, he is setled therin for ever by an Oath, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and that with the overthrow of his enemies, how great or many soever, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. yet not without Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, by which he was first to be humbled, and then to be exalted, <hi>v.</hi> 7.</p>

               <hi>Ver. 1.</hi> THE LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand: until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</q>
            <p>In the first place, the Prophet being taught of God, describes the Person of Christ, in both his Natures, and in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office, which he exerciseth in heaven from the beginning of the world to the end thereof, until all his enemies shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the understanding of Christs person and offices be necessary unto the Church, yet none know the Son save the Father, and they to whom he will reveal him: for <hi>David</hi> knew Christ only by the Fathers teaching; <hi>The Lord said,</hi> saith he. 2. Christ is <hi>Davids</hi> Son, and <hi>Davids</hi> Lord also: <hi>Davids</hi> Son, in regard Christ assumed his humane nature of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> seed; and <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, because he is God, very God and very man in one person; <hi>The Lord said to my Lord,</hi> that is, God the Father revealed to me concerning God the Son, my Lord and Redeemer. 3. Christ in his Kingly office is exalted to

the fellowship of glory and power with the Father, authorized by him in his Kingdome, and established therein by divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: <hi>The Lord said to my Lord.</hi> 4. Christ since the beginning of the world hath had, and to the end of the world shall have enemies to his Kingdome, who shall fight against him, but he shall prevaile over them complea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly and gloriously, to their shame and confusion: <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</hi> 5. No lesse then divine power is able to subdue the enemies of Christs Kingdome; for devils and wicked men, sin, death and hell are opposite to his throne; <hi>Sit there until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</hi> 6. Albeit this victory is not fully obtained, till the end of the world, because of the renewing of the battel by new instruments, from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation, yet till then and for ever Christ the King enjoyeth his glory in heaven, and sitteth judging and ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully all things for the good of his Church; <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</hi>

            <p>In the second place he sheweth the meanes and manner of his Conquest and governing, to wit, by the preaching the Gospel. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Christ wanteth not a rod and scepter whereby to govern, but he hath the Word of God preached for the Ensign of his Princely power and preheminencie, which is the arme and power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which is able to throw down every strong hold exalted against the knowledge of him; <hi>This is the rod of thy strength.</hi> 2. Christ was King in his Church, and was in exercise of his office before his Incarnation, and that by his Word preached, which is the rod of his mouth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.4. <hi>For he shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion,</hi> presupposeth the rod of his strength in <hi>Sion.</hi> 3. It was decreed, that Christs Kingdome, howsoever first and most clearly manifested among the Jewes, yet should not be limited within <hi>Iudea,</hi> but should go forth unto the Gentiles for subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; <hi>The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion.</hi> 4. How many enemies soever shall oppose the Kingdome of Christ, and how powerful soever they shall be, yet Christ shall

            <p>In the third place he sheweth what successe Christ shall have; for he shall have abundance of Converts, who shall come to his Church offering themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the free-will-offerings were brought to the beautiful holy Temple, and that in such multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Whatsoever course our Lord shall take, for inviting and compelling guests to come to his feast, and to the society of his visible Church, yet only his Elect, his redeemed ones, all of them are made most willing Converts by his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power, effectually inclining their hearts, and making them willing; <hi>Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> 2. Christs Church by the administration of holy Ordinances, by the setting forth of the Lords holinesse, by her teaching and perswading effectually unto the duties of holinesse, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding beautiful in the eyes of God, and of spiritual behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; <hi>Thy people shall be willing in the beauty of holinesse.</hi> 3. True Converts by the power of the Gospel are Christs children and off-spring, who shall grow up before him in simplicity and harmlesnesse, as the youth in each generation do grow, and shall be for multitude as the starres of Heaven, as the sand on the sea-shore: or as the morning dew descending from the Heaven: <hi>From the wombe of the morning, thou hast the dew of thy youth.</hi>

               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:50629:65"/>
1. Christ as he is King of his Church, so he is Priest also, for the teaching of Gods will to his subjects, for reconciling them to God by his propitiatory sacrifice, for sanctifying them, for making their services acceptable, for bearing the iniquity of their holy things, for interceding alwayes for them, and blessing them effectually in the Name of the Lord: <hi>Thou art a Priest,</hi> saith the Lord unto our Lord. 2. Christ is an everlasting Priest, who liveth for ever to make intercession for us, and neither need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nor can admit any successor, or suffragan to himself in his office; <hi>Thou art a Priest for ever.</hi> 3. Christ in his office is no Usurper, for he is called to it, his Priesthood is unchangeable, confirmed by an Oath, having the glory of God laid in pawne for its stability and continuation without change: <hi>The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art a Priest for ever.</hi> 4. <hi>Aarons</hi> order was not confirmed by an oath, but was an imperfect type of Christs Priesthood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to endure only till the Lord came, till the time of Reformation came, and was to be changed at Christs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; for seeing a change behoved to be made of the Priesthood. a change behoved also to be made of the Levitical law: <hi>Thou art a Priest for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>In the fifth place is set down the victory of Christ over

his enemie. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Christ the Mediatour, and King of his Church, and every believer in him, have God ready at hand in all that they have to do: for as Christ is at the right hand of the Father for glory, so the Father is at Christs right hand for cooperation and assistance: <hi>The Lord at thy right hand,</hi> saith he. 2. As the Kings and Rulers of the earth are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually great enemies to Christs Kingdome, so he is the hardest party that ever they sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord hath a time of patience wherein he beareth with his enemies, and a day of wrath when he will break forth against his adversaries: <hi>He shall strike through Kings in the day of his wrath.</hi> 4. Christs Government is wise and just, convincing some of sin, and pordoning the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; convincing others of sin, and sealing them up to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, casting down the proud, and comforting the cast down, and doing all things for the good of the subjects most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly; <hi>He shall judge among the heathen.</hi> 5. Were there never so many enemies to Christ, they are all dead men before him, whom he wili kill, and will cast their carcases in the ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of their own campes; <hi>He shall fill the places with dead bodies.</hi> 6. As he will punish the multitudes of people, who under wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Commanders do oppose his Kingdome: so will he in special punish wicked Rulers, that lead on their people against him, how many soever they be who are joyned in conspiracy; <hi>He shall wound the heads over many countreys.</hi>

            <p>In the last place is set down the manner of Christs carrying on his Kingdome and Priesthood in his Church, to wit, by suffering and enderlng hardship, as a good souldier pursuing the victory: for which his humiliation it is promised he shall be exalted. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It behoved Christ first to suffer, and then enter into glory: <hi>He shall drink of the brook in the way</hi>; or, he shall partake of the waters of affliction. 2. Whatsoever a good souldier doth, or suffereth in his warfare against, and in pursuit of his enemies, Christ did and suffered in pursuing his enemies in his own person, and shall do and suffer in his mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body; <hi>He shall drink of the brook,</hi> that is, content himself

with any obvious entertainment, which he meeteth with in the chase of his enemies, and not be retarded with any care of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fare, then what may further his purpose. 3. As Christs personal sufferings were not to endure any longer then the time he was on his way to his glory, so neither are the sufferings of his souldiers or his Church militant, his mystical body, to endure any longer then they are in their way to the triumph, that is, during this short life: <hi>He shall drink of the brook in the way.</hi> 4. As Christ in his person was exalted after his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as Victor, and did enter into his glory: so shall he exalt every member of his mystical body after their suffering, and lift up their head: for it is appointed even for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <argument>
               <p>THe scope of this Psalme is to stir up all to praise God, and that for so many reasons as there are verses in the Psalme. The exhortation is in the first words: <hi>Praise ye the Lord.</hi> The reasons follow in order. The Psalme is composed so after the order of the Hebrew Alphabet, as every sentence or half verse beginneth with a several letter of the <hi>A B C</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and all the Psalme is of praise only. Whence we learn in general, 1. Sometime it is expedient to set all other things apart, and employ our selves expressely to proclaim the praises of the Lord only; for so is done in this Psalme. 2. The praises of the Lord are able to fill all the letters, and words composed of letters, in all their possible junctures or composition; for so much doth the going through all the letters of the <hi>A B C</hi> point out unto us he is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> and all the middle letters of the <hi>A B C</hi> of praise. 3. The praises of the Lord are worthy to be kept in memory: for that this Psalme may be the better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, it is composed after the order of the <hi>A B C,</hi> and so it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth thus much to us.</p>

            <p>He setteth down the scope of the Psalme in a word of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to praise the Lord, and then annexeth ten reasons and motives thereunto. The first motive is from his own example; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When we are about any part of divine worship. it shall be to good purpose to set our eye mainly upon the scope which we propound to our selves therein: for so with lesse wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of thoughts, and more fixed presence of minde, we shall follow our purpose; Thus much doth the Psalmists example here teach us, setting down all he purposeth to aime at in this word, <hi>Praise ye the Lord.</hi> 2. The Pastor of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being about to stir up others to this, or any other spiritual duty, should go before them in his own example, and stir up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for that same end: for so teacheth the Psalmist, saying, <hi>I will praise the Lord.</hi> 3. As the Lord is worthy of hearty prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so should we with our heart take up the Song, and bear out the work; <hi>I will praise the Lord with my whole heart.</hi> 4. Solemn meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gods children for Gods publick worship, and furthering one another therein, is an Ordinance of God appointed for that end: <hi>I will praise in the Assembly, and in the Congregation.</hi> 5. Albeit the true members of the Church invisible, be only they who are justified, and who are regenerate, and who are Students of sanctity and righteousnesse; and albeit such only are fittest hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, discerners and joyners in the Lords worship, yet must the whole Congregation, or visible members of the Church, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they be before God, be admitted to the fellowship of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God praised; for thereby the elect unconverted may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; for when the Psalmist hath said, <hi>I will praise the Lord in the Assembly of the upright,</hi> he subjoyneth also, <hi>and in the Congregation.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:50629:67"/>The second reason of the exhortation to praise God, is from the greatness and excellency of Gods works. <hi>When<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e learn,</hi> 1. We need not go far to seek matter for praising the Lord, his works are at our hand to furnish matter; and albeit the Lords works in comparison one with another be some of them greater, some of them lesser, yet all and every one of them being looked upon severally are great; <hi>The works of the Lord are great.</hi> 2. Whatsoever glory doth appear in Gods works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is more hid treasure and excellency therein to be sought out, and if men do not see much in Gods works, it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> because they do not seek them out; <hi>The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them, &amp;c.</hi> 3. It is a mark of a wise childe of God to take pleasure in Gods work, and to take pleasure to search and see Gods praise therein, and these only do reap the right use and benefit thereof; <hi>They are sought out of all them that have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure therein.</hi>

            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 3.</hi> His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousnesse endureth for ever.</q>
            <p>The third reason of praise, is the glory and honour of God to be seen in his works. <hi>Whence learn,</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. The glory of Gods wisdome, power, justice or mercy, or some of his attributes, is stamped upon his works of Creation and Providence, and they who have an open eye to look upon them rightly, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it; <hi>His work is honourable and glorious.</hi> 2. When the rayes of Gods wisdom, power, goodnesse, or any attribute, are perceived in his work, they cause an honourable estimation of God, and of his work also; and a right estimation of Gods work cannot be attained till his glory be seen in it; <hi>His work is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and glorious.</hi> 3. Albeit the world alwayes, yea, and Gods children also, do often misconstrue the Lords work and dealing with themselves and with others, yet there is no wrong therein, there was never any wrong, nor ever shall there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the least point of injustice in his dealing; <hi>His righteousnesse endureth for ever.</hi>

remembred: the LORD <hi>is</hi> gracious, and full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</q>
            <p>The fourth motive to praise God, is the course he taketh to make his works to be remembred, mixing mercy and compassion in all his providence towards men, and specially his own people. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. What the Lord hath done for his Church, he hath ordained that it should be remembred; and this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth, partly by printing upon his works the large impression of his power and goodnesse; partly by doing the like works when the Church standeth in need thereof; and partly by his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, commanding them to be remembred; <hi>He hath made his wonderful works to be remembred.</hi> 2. As the grace and loving pity of God towards his Church, is the cause of the wonderful working of God for his Church: so are they strong motives to cause his works to be remembred unto his praise; <hi>For the Lord is gracious and full of compassion,</hi> doth here infer so much.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> He hath given meat unto them that feare him, he will ever be mindful of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</q>
            <p>The fifth motive to praise God, is, because God according to his Covenant provideth for the necessities of his people. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord in all ages hath carefully furnished maintenance for the life, both bodily and spiritual of his own people; <hi>He hath given meat to them that feare him.</hi> 2. As what good the Lord doth unto his people, is because of his Covenant with them, so what is to be done for them, he will do for his Covenants sake also, without being wearied: <hi>He wil ever be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Covenant.</hi>

            <p>The sixth motive to Gods praise is, the proof which he gave of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50629:68"/>
his power for, and good-will to this people, in bringing them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and unto <hi>Canaan. Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lords work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonderfully and extraordinarily for his people, were it but once and at one time, as it is a sufficient reason of praising him ordinarily at all times thereafter, so it is a sufficient prop to the faith of his people at all times; for this use are we taught to make of the Lords working for his people, <hi>in giving them the heritage of the heathen.</hi> 2. As the Lords working for his people at one time, giveth evidence of what he can do for them at any time: so will he have his own people in special spectators, observers and witnesses of his working at any time, that they may make use thereof at all times; <hi>He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>The seventh and eighth motives to Gods praise, is the suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of his Work unto his Word, and the stability of his Word and Works in truth and uprightness. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The works of the Lord done for his Church, and in his Church to his people for their correction or comfort, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their enemies for their overthrow, do prove the Lord to be true and faithful in his promises and threatenings: <hi>The works of the Lord are verity and judgement.</hi> 2. As the Words and working of the Lord agree together, so should they be esteemed of, acknowledged and commended by us: <hi>The works of the Lord are verity and judgement.</hi> 3. The whole Word of God, all which he hath commanded us to observe and make use of, is worthy of all commendation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of perpetual use; for all the parts of it do agree one with another, suitable to the condition of his people in all ages, good and profitable to them: it is clear and plain, and not ambiguous, when it is rightly considered and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with it self: for even the ceremonial law, albeit abolished for the outward observation of the carnal ceremonie, which figured forth Christ to come, yet endureth for ever in the real signification of substance, benefits and duties thereby shadowed

As there is matter of great delight and contentment in Gods Word, unto all them who feare God: so the true mark of a sound believer and fearer of God, is delighting to know, beleeve and

            <p>The first proof of the believers blessednesse, is the blessing of his children, (if God shall see it good to give him sons and daughters of his body,) or the blessing of those that do by his teaching and example follow the footsteps of his faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1 Albeit we are bound to serve God, whether he give unto us benefits or not; albeit our service at the best be but a very weak endeavour, and many wayes taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and albeit we be unprofitable servants, presupposing we could so serve, as we should give perfect obedience, and do all that is commanded; yet it pleaseth God to allure us unto his service, by propounding rewards and encouragements unto us, as in this Psalme we see. 2. The best way to bring a blessing on our children and posterity, is to feare God, by our instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and example to teach them to follow us in the Lords fear; <hi>For their seed shal be mighty upon earth,</hi> even Kings and Priests unto God, whatsoever shall be their worldly portion. 3.

Whether God shall give more or lesse to the upright man, one way or other it shall be more useful to him then all the wealth of the wicked can be to them: <hi>Wealth and riches shal be in his house</hi> 2.

            <p>The third proof of the believers blessednesse, is comfort in all troubles, and a deliverance out of all difficulties, as the fruit of Gods grace enduring in him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord will not exempt the believer from dark passages of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or from affliction and perplexity, yet he will make him sure of comfort, direction, and a good event; <hi>Unto the upright there ariseth light in darknesse.</hi> 2. The light and comfort which is bestowed upon the upright, is the fruit of Gods grace toward him, and of the juncture of saving graces in him: for the words may be extended both to God, and to the believer by Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; <hi>He is gracious and full of compassion, and righteous</hi>; which is true of the believer in some degree, and of God it is true, absolutely and infinitely.</p>

The believer to whom God hath extended favour and kindness, will be good to them among whom he liveth, and by the fruits of equity, love, kindnesse and mercy, will give evidence of Gods grace dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him: for here the believer is called, <hi>A good man, who sheweth mercy, and lendeth.</hi> 2.

            <p>A fifth proof of the beleevers blessednesse, is the promise of his stability in grace, and estimation with God for ever. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. No man shall serve God for nought; the grace bestowed upon him making him to abound in well-doing shall be followed with more grace, rewarding and crowning grace in him, and in special he shall be setled in the state of grace, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever temporal changes of inward or outward condition he may suffer; <hi>Surely he shall not be moved for ever.</hi> 2. Albeit the world may misregard the believer, and traduce him while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and calumniate him when he is dead, yet his memory shall remain fresh and fragrant before God, Angels and good men who know him: <hi>The righteous shall be in everlasting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>

            <p>A sixth proof of the beleevers blessednesse, is from the peace of God guarding his heart against the fear of evil. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the believer wanteth not his own infirmities and feares, yet he is not overcome of fear, as the wicked or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous are; <hi>He shall not be afraid of evil tydings.</hi> 2. The guard of the godly mans heart, is not confidence in his owne wisdom or strength, natural courage or any earthly thing, but that which setleth him is faith in God: <hi>His heart is fixed, trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Lord.</hi>

terrible, and such as will be studying a mischief against him, and breathing out terrours, yet faith in God will guard his heart so, that he shall not be moved from the course of Gods obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for all that the enemy can do; <hi>His heart is established, he shall not be afraid.</hi> 2. The light of Gods Word doth shew unto the believer both his own delivery, and the overthrow of his enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if he do not see in full effect in his own time, yet he shall foresee it in the predictions of Gods Word: <hi>He shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.</hi>

            <p>The eighth proof of the believers blessedness, is from his constant course in fruitfulness of faith, and from the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The works of mercie to the distressed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are a special fruit and commendation of the faith of the beleever: <hi>He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poore.</hi> 2.

As the beleevers righteousness by justification, so his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be righteous in the effect of sanctification, is not by fits, but constant and permanent; <hi>His righteousnesse endureth for ever.</hi> 4.

            <p>The last proof of the blessedness of the beleever is, that his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies shall envie his happinesse, when they shall see the godly in good case, and themselves miserable. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Lord be no lesse conspicuous in his throwing down of the mighty, then in the raising of the poore: yet will he rather take his praise here from his lifting up of the needy and poore, then from the casting down of the mighty, that so he may give comfort and hope to the dejected that depend upon him: <hi>He lifteth the needy out of the dunghil, that he may set them with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> 6.

The Lords most glorious work done for his people, in special the work of redemption, should be oftenest remembred, as the mention-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king here and elsewhere <hi>of the time when</hi> Israel <hi>came out of</hi> Egypt, sheweth. 2. Redemption is then best esteemed of, when the miserable condition wherein we were, is called to minde, as here <hi>Israels</hi> Redemption is commended from the state they were in, in <hi>Egypt: The house of Iacob went from a people of a strange language.</hi> And this is the first reason of commending this work of God.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Iudah was his sanctuary: <hi>and</hi> Israel his dominion.</q>
            <p>The next reason of commending this glorious work, is the joyning of delivered <hi>Israel</hi> in a near fellowship with God. Whence learn, 1. People redeemed by God, are no more their own, but are the Lords purchase, redeemed for his service: <hi>Iudah was his sanctuary, and Israel was his dominion.</hi> 2. The title and interest which God justly doth claime in his people, is that they may be consecrated unto him in holinesse, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themselves as his loyal Subjects to his Government: <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah was his sanctuary, and Israel was his dominion.</hi> 3. All the consecration and sanctification of <hi>Israel,</hi> is comprehended in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50629:74"/>
and floweth from what was to be found in the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and that is in Christ Jesus the flower of his tribe: <hi>All Israel is his dominion, but Iudah is his sanctuary.</hi>

            <p>The third reason of Gods praise for this work, is from the drying of the red-sea, and of <hi>Iordan,</hi> that his people might passe out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and into <hi>Canaan. Whence learn,</hi> 1. Gods dealing for his people whom he hath ransomed, doth prove his wonderfull power for them, and love towards them, as the two miracles of the drying of the sea, and of <hi>Iordan</hi> do commend the redemption of <hi>Israel.</hi> 2. When God will deliver his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, no opposition can hinder, and when he will possesse them in what he promised, no impediment can withstand him: <hi>The Sea saw it, and fled, and Iordan was driven back.</hi>

            <p>The fourth reason of Gods praise, is the causing mount <hi>Horeb</hi> and other hills (in their way to <hi>Canaan</hi>) to tremble and quake, when he put forth his power on them in the sight of his people. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There is no power in the earth which God cannot overtop when he pleaseth, though they were like the strongest mountaines: for as he can shake the earth, so can he move and remove any power on earth, as he gave evidence when he made the mountaines by earth-quake <hi>to skip like rams, and the little hills like lambs.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:50629:74"/>The fifth reason of Gods praise, is the evidencing of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, put forth before his people, in so wonderfull and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a manner, as no cause can be given of the works wrought for his people in their coming out from <hi>Egypt,</hi> their entry into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in the wildernesse, except only Gods extraordinary manifestation of his presence amongst his people, and for them: which the Psalmist bringeth forth, by asking the cause of these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, &amp; answering the question by the terrible presence of God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord can work so clearly for his people, that the most stupid and brute souls shal be convinced of his respect to his children, as this experience doth shew. 2. If Atheisme, and unbeliefe in men could finde any natural reason, or any pretence of reason, whereby they might obscure the glory of Gods doing for his people, they would not faile to do it, as this interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on teacheth; <hi>What ailed thee, O thou Sea, &amp;c?</hi> 3. The more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly the works of the Lord are looked unto, the more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth his power and presence appeare in working them, as the answer unto the question, and holding forth the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence twice for the cause of such changes on the creatures do shew. 4. The end and use of Gods power manifested in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his people, is first, that all flesh should fear God, and stand in awe of him; and next, that his covenanted people should look upon his terrour, as their bulwarke: <hi>Tremble thou earth at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Iacob.</hi>

            <p>In praying for relief from the bondage of idolaters, they reject all confidence in themselves, and bring arguments of their hope to be helped from other grounds. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is no strange thing to see Gods people for their chastisement, or trial, put under the power of idolaters, as this experience of <hi>Israel</hi> doth shew. 2. When we seek any thing from God, we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our own unworthinesse and ill deserving, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all confidence in our selves: <hi>Not unto us give the glory,</hi> saith the Church here. 3. Albeit the Lords afflicted people may want all ground of hope from their own behaviour, yet grounds of hope can never be wanting, when they look to Gods mercy and truth, and the glory of his grace in helping of them: <hi>Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for thy mercy, and for thy truths sake.</hi>

because if the Lord do not deliver them, idolaters, under whose power they do lie, will continue to blaspheme the true Religion, and the true God, whom the true Church doth worship. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. The enemies of the Church are ready to blaspheme the true Religion, when the Lords people are brought in straits, and under their power, as here, <hi>The heathen say, Where is now their God</hi>? When we have brought our selves in misery, and our Religion in danger of disgrace, we ought to be more carefull to have the Lord restored to his honour; and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion restored unto its own beauty, then to be freed from misery; for the Church here cannot endure the dishonour of God in their affliction: <hi>Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?</hi>

               <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> But our God <hi>is</hi> in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he pleased.</q>
            <p>The third reason of hope to be heard, is, because God is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and supreme Governour of all things, and his authority is as his power, absolute, to do what he pleaseth: and this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son strengthens also the former reason. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. The more the wicked do oppose God and the true Religion, the more should his servants assert his glory, and truth: as the Church doth here, saying, <hi>But our God is in heaven.</hi> 2. The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods absolute power, and authority exalteth God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all idols, stoppeth all murmuration against his dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on toward his people, and their enemies; closeth all disputation against his revealed will, and looseth all objections, arising from difficulties, and impediments, which might hinder hope to be helped out of misery, as here we see, <hi>Our God is in heaven, he doth whatsoever he pleaseth.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>A fourth reason of hope, that the Church shall be delivered from the power of idolaters, is, because there is no other God to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, save the Lord: Idols can neither help their worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, nor hurt Gods people who despise them, and therefore his people will hope in their own true God, and despise idolaters and their idols both. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Images in the matter of Religion whatsoever they seem to be, or represent, are but idols; for so are they called here. 2. Images in Religion profit nothing, but bring trouble to men, as their name in the original importeth. 3. Albeit idolaters do bestow largely upon their Idols; and put upon them artificially some shape, to represent some perfections by them, yet the riches of the matter can give them no excellency: They are but silver or gold at the best, their forgers and authours are but men; for it is sufficient to disgrace any point of Religion if it be of mans devising: <hi>They are the work of mens hands.</hi> 4 So many members as the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages have, serving to represent some perfections by them, are so many lies: <hi>for they have mouthes, but speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; They have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For closing this reason, he turneth the reproach, which ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters did cast upon the true God and his worship, over upon themselves. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord be angry at his own people, yet must they not forsake him, and go after idols to be helped by them: for so doth the Church here teach us. 2. The consideration of the folly of false Religion, should make us cleave the closer to the true Religion, and to abhorre the errors of humane devising; for so are we taught by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. 3. As it is an honour to be of the true Religion, so it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50629:76"/>
is the greatest disgrace a man can have, to be an idolater: for the disgrace of the idol falleth upon the worshipper thereof, as here we see. 4. All idolaters are brutish, the makers of idols, authorizers of them, worshippers and servers of them, are all like reasonlesse, and senslesse blocks, in this matter, like the idols which they make: <hi>They that make them, are like unto them,</hi> that is, <hi>They have eyes, and see not, &amp;c.</hi> 5 Whosoever do expect any good, by making or worshipping of images, they joyne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worshipping of them, with the outward: and in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any good by that means, they prove themselves like reasonlesse blocks, as void of true wisdome in this point, as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are of sense and motion: <hi>So is every one that trusteth in them.</hi>

            <p>In the latter part of the Psalme, the Church is encouraged to trust in the Lord, and so to expect deliverance according to the petition set down, <hi>v.</hi> 1. And that by seven reasons. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to trust in God is threefold, one directed to <hi>Israel, v.</hi> 9. Another to the Priests, and Levits, <hi>v.</hi> 10. The third to all that fear God, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Unto which exhortation, the first reason of encouragement is added and repeated again and again. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. No tentation of affliction should drive us from expecting relief in trouble, and trusting in God for it: for notwithstanding the Church here is under the feet of the heathen, yet all are exhorted to trust in God: <hi>O Israel, trust thou in the Lord.</hi> 2. Whosoever in their trouble do trust in God, may be assured to be delivered, and guarded against all evils which may marre their blessednesse: <hi>Trust in the Lord for he is their help, and their shield.</hi> 3. The Ministers of Gods house should go before the Lords people in trusting in God, and adhering to him, specially in time of trouble; <hi>O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord.</hi> 4. Such promises as are made in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50629:77"/>
common to the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> are sufficient to support the faith of publick Ministers of the Lords house, as here we see: <hi>He is their help, and shield.</hi> 5. As every one that feareth God, is of the number of true Israelites: so trusting in the Lord, he may be no lesse confident of the consolation, and protection of God, then the publick Ministers of the Lords house: <hi>Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord, he is their help, and their sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The second reason of encouragement is taken from former experience of Gods respect unto his people that fear him: and the third is taken from the promise of blessing them, in time to come. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord useth to afflict his people, yet he doth not forget them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or lay aside affection to them: <hi>The Lord hath been mindful of us.</hi> 2. The right use of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past experience of Gods care of us in affliction and trials, is to put trust in God in after-times of new trial and affliction, as here, <hi>The Lord hath been mindfull of us,</hi> is made use of to this end. 3 As the duty in trusting in the Lord, is common to all sorts of persons, so the blessing of faith is common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to all sorts of beleevers, great and small: <hi>He will blesse us, he will blesse the house of Aaron, he will blesse them that fear the Lord, both great and small.</hi>

            <p>The fifth reason of encouragement is, because God omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hath pronounced believers to be blessed, how miserable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may seem to themselves, and to others. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Whatsoever distresse believers may fall into, yet can they never be accursed nor deprived of the blessing of righteousnesse, and eternal life: for it is said to them all, <hi>You are blessed of the Lord,</hi> who calleth things that are not, and maketh them to be. 2. The sight of the Lords work in making heaven and earth of nothing, should strengthen us to apprehend how richly the Lord can and will perfect what he saith of blessing his people: <hi>You are blessed of the Lord, who made the heaven and the earth.</hi>

            <p>The sixth reason of encouragement to trust in God is, that albeit the Lord be abundantly satisfied in himselfe, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing from the world, yet men have need to depend upon his goodnesse, and trust in him, who hath given unto them the use of his creatures on the earth. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As it is no need of any creature which hath moved God to make a world, but rather his superabundant self-sufficiency hath made the heavens &amp; the earth, to this end, that therein he may set forth his al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For this cause also the Psalmist doth not prefixe his name unto this Psalme, whatsoever might be fit for his particular experience in it, but leaveth it to run the more clearly and directly toward the Messiah, or Christ, who is here mainly intended.</p>
               <p>The Psalm may be divided into three parts.

            <p>The exhortation is unto the visible Church in general, to thank God for his everlasting mercy, and to the house of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and to those that fear God more specially, to praise him for that same cause. <hi>Whence learn</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Upon all occasions we ought to glorifie God, and stir up others to do so, especially when we consider what God doth for the Kingdom of Christ, and here let us say: <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord.</hi> 2. Albeit the wisdom, power and justice of God, be glorious matter of praising of him, yet none can heartily glorifie him for these reasons, till they first
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50629:84"/>
have experience of the sweetnesse of his goodness and mercie; <hi>Give thanks, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 3. Such as are partakers of the goodness which is purchased by Christ, may lay hold on everlasting mercies, and give thanks for those; <hi>Because his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 4 Albeit all the elect have interest in Gods praise, for mercies purchased by Christ unto them, yet the elect of <hi>Israel</hi> have the first room in the song: for Christ is first promised to them, and came of them according to the flesh, and will be most marvellous about them: <hi>Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 5. Men who have more gifts, higher place, and in special they who are Ministers of Gods house, should go before others in glorifying Gods mercy manifested in Christ: <hi>Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 6. Whatsoever othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s do, such as worship God in their spirits sincerely, should let forth their thankfulnesse for Gods grace manifested to them through Christ; <hi>Let them now that feare the Lord say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 7. As the salvation of the elect is one, and the love of God to them one: so should their song be one; as here foure several times it is said; <hi>His mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 8. Christ being come at length into the world, in the fulnesse of time, and having ended his sufferings, and entered into his Kingdome, notwithstanding all the provocations of men to move God to cut short this mercy, hath given proof once for all of his everlasting goodnesse and mercy: therefore is it said, <hi>Let Israel now; Let Aaron now; Let them that feare God now, say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> And this is one reason of his praises.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> I called upon the LORD in distresse: the LORD answered me, <hi>and set me</hi> in a large place.</q>
            <p>Another reason of this thanksgiving is, the Psalmists experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, representing Christs suffering and victory, he called to God and was delivered. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the deliverance which <hi>David</hi> had out of his troubles, was a reason of joy to all the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> because of the benefits which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed under his Government: so the deliverance which Christ had out of his sufferings, is a reason of joy, thanksgiving, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50629:85"/>
glorifying God to all his subjects; <hi>I called upon the Lord in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, he answered me, and set me in a large place.</hi> 2. Albeit the Lord do bring his children into straits, yet he will not leave them in distresse, but will bring them forth into a large place, as this experience of the Psalmist, and of Christ our Head, both distressed and delivered for our sake, doth give assurance. 3. The distresse of the Lords children is not so bitter, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery and enlargement out of it is sweet; <hi>For he answered me, and set me in a large place,</hi> is here the matter of victorious joy, and of Gods high praises. 4 Delivery out of any great danger, is a matter of glorifying God, especially when it is the returne of prayer, as here, <hi>I called on the Lord, and he answered me, &amp;c.</hi>

            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> The LORD <hi>is</hi> on my side, I will not feare: what can man do unto me?</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <hi>7.</hi> The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see <hi>my desire</hi> upon them that hate me.</p>
            </q>
            <p>A third reason of praise is, because the Psalmist hath by this experience received such confirmation of Gods respect to him, as made him fearlesse for time to come, and assured of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of his enemies. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Experience of hearing our prayer should confirme us about Gods friendship: as here from his late experience he draweth this Conclusion; <hi>The Lord is on my side.</hi> 2. Gods favour and friendship believed should free us from the feare of men; <hi>The Lord is on my side. I will not feare.</hi> 3. Albeit the power of man be an ordinary tentation to divert the godly from their duty, yet when Gods favour and displeasure are well weighed, and compared with mans hatred and favour, it shall be found to be but little which mans either terrour or allurement can do, as rhis inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation speaketh; <hi>What can man do unto me?</hi> 4. Faith ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth more good by deliveries, then it findeth hurt by assaults, and then is true saith victorious, when Gods friendship is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to whatsoever the wrath of the creature can do, as here is seen. 5. Albeit we have gotten some notable victories against our enemies, yet we must know our warfare is not ended: for
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50629:85"/>
so much doth the Psalmist insinuate, when he goeth to make party against his enemies; <hi>The Lord is on my side, the Lord taketh my part.</hi> 6. Albeit the Lords people do not despise meanes and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet they rely not on them, but on Gods help, who can blesse the meanes: <hi>The Lord taketh my part with them that help me.</hi> 7. Faith in its own victory by Gods assistance, seeth also the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of the adversaries; <hi>The Lord taketh my part, therefore I shall see my desire on them that hate me.</hi> 8. Many good uses may a believer make of one benefit, one victory, one experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as here the Psalmist doth, he confirmeth himself in his reconciliation and friendship with God, he encourageth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against dangers to come, he exalteth God, and putteth down to nought the hatred and favour of man, he resolveth to use meanes, and to expect the blessing from God, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sundry good uses which follow hereafter.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 8.</hi> It <hi>is</hi> better to trust in the LORD, then to put confidence in man.</p>

            </q>
            <p>A fourth reason of praise and thanks unto God, is for blessing the course of faith, and making it better then the course of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy or carnal reason; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As faith gathereth strength, when it seeth what blessing doth follow on beleeving, so God getteth praise by blessing the obedience of faith; <hi>It is better to trust in the Lord, then to put confidence in men.</hi> 2. Such as beleeve in God, in whatsoever mean condition they may be in, are in better case then the minions of Kings, who lean only to mens favour, and time will prove this to be true; <hi>That it is better to trust in the Lord, then to put confidence in Princes.</hi>

                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> All Nations compassed me about: but in the Name of the LORD will I destroy them.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <hi>11.</hi> They compassed me about, yea, they compassed me about: <hi>but</hi> in the Name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>

            </q>
            <p>A fifth reason of thanks unto God, is <hi>Davids</hi> victory in the type, and Christs victory signified, begun and made sure to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over a world of adversaries. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Many adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries had <hi>David,</hi> but Christ hath more; for all the world are deadly adversaries to him, <hi>All Nations compassed me about.</hi> 2. The Church and Kingdom of Christ hath neither power to defend it self, nor way in this world to escape from its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>All Nations compassed me about,</hi> is thrice expressed. 3. Christs enemies are so despiteful, that in fighting against his Kingdome, they regard not what becomes of themselves, so be they may hurt his people; but as the Bee undoeth her self in stinging, and loseth her life or her power with her sting, so do they; <hi>They compassed me about like bees.</hi> 4. All that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of Christs Church can do against his people, is but to trouble her externally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their wounds are like the sting of a Bee, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto paine and swelling, and a short trouble only, but are not deadly. <hi>They compassed me about like bees.</hi> 5. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whereby victory is obtained over the enemies of Christ and his people, is meerly divine, even the Omnipotency of the Godhead of our Lord, who fighteth all his own battels and ours: <hi>In the Name of the Lord will I destroy them,</hi> thrice expressed. 6. Particular victories now and then, do give ground of hope of compleat victory over all enemies; for Christ hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken here to destroy them all; <hi>In the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.</hi> 7. The rejoycing of the enemies, and the putting forth of their malice against the Church, is but for a short time, and all to destroy themselves; <hi>They are quenched as the fire of thornes.</hi>

            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 13.</hi> Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.</q>
            <p>A sixth reason of thanks, is, for delivery to Christ mystical, from the chief ruler of the adverse powers, that is, from Satan. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Whosoever be the instruments of persecution
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50629:86"/>
of Christ in his members, Satan is the prime Agent, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of these cursed souldiers: for toward him mainly is this speech directed; <hi>Thou hast thrust sore at me.</hi> 2. The aime of Satan in his opposition unto the Church, is to drive them from their station which they have by faith in God, that they may despaire and sin: <hi>Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall.</hi> 3. How weak soever the Lords persecuted children are, when Satan raiseth persecution against them, and driveth his dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>hem; <hi>But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Lord helped me.</hi> 4. The Lords servants being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in their trials, shall have such deliverances, as shall give them reason to insult, time out of minde, over Satan and all their enemies, as here the Psalmist, as a type and souldier of Christ, and Christ our Chieftain doth.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 14.</hi> The LORD <hi>is</hi> my strength and Song: and is become my salvation.</q>
            <p>This we make the second part of the Psalme, wherein the song of praise and thanksgiving is renewed, and foure new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are added<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And first, he giveth all the glory of his victory unto God his strength and salvation. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane strength is not sufficient to overcome Satan, so must the wrastler be emptied of the conceit of his own abilities, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himself unto God, as the compleat furnisher of him, as this example doth teach us. 2. He that hath renounced confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in created strength, and hath betaken himself unto Gods furniture promised in his Word, shall have cause to sing, <hi>The Lord is my strength and song.</hi> 3. Experimental proof of the truth of Gods promises, is a new impression of believed truth, and a new taking up of it, which maketh a man say, I perceive of a truth that God is such as he calleth himself; <hi>He is become my salvation,</hi> doth import so much: and this is the first reason of his renewed song.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 15.</hi> The voice of rejoycing, and salvation <hi>is</hi> in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doth valiantly.</p>

            </q>
            <p>The second reason is from the joy which cometh to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified through faith in Christ, for the certainty of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purchased by his sufferings and battels. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such as believe in Christ, and do endeavour new obedience, as they are the persons to whom Christ hath purchased salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so shall they finde the joy of the purchase, and acknowledge it to Gods glory: <hi>The voice of rejoycing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous.</hi> 2. Albeit the righteous be pilgrims and have no setled dwelling place, yet is their pilgrimage and private tabernacles made refreshful to them by the joy of their salvation; <hi>The voice of rejoycing and salvation is in the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of the righteous.</hi> 3. The matter of the joy of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is the sight of Gods power employed for their safety, and victoriously working out their salvation and his own glory; <hi>The right hand of the Lord doth valiantly; The right hand of the Lord is exalted; The right hand of the Lord doth vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly.</hi>

            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 17.</hi> I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the LORD.</q>
            <p>The third reason of thanksgiving, is assurance of compleat victory, and employment of all gifts given to him in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The believer may be assured, that death shall not prevent him, till he have ended his appointed ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: and that as death had not dominion over Christ, so shall it not have lasting dominion over him; <hi>I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.</hi> 2. To honour and praise God in this life, should be life to the beleever, and dearer to him then his life, in regard he loveth this life, and the next also, mainly because he shall therein praise God: <hi>I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 18.</hi> The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:50629:87"/>The fourth reason of thanksgiving is, the Lords moderating all chastisements so, as the Psalmist is not destroyed by them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As Christ our Head was chastised for our peace, and tasted of death, but was not given over unto it: so his servants, albeit not exempted from chastisements, yet they shall not be destroyed by them; <hi>The Lord hath chastened me sore, yet he hath not given me over to death,</hi> saith the type of Christ, speaking history of himself, and prophecie of Christ. 2. The moderation of chastisements and salvation wrought by them, should swallow up the grief of them, and make them the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Song, as here we are taught; <hi>The Lord hath chastened me sore, yet he hath not given me over unto death.</hi> 3. It is wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to observe the moderation of chastisements, as well as their sharpnesse and weight, and to remember that when adversaries do trouble us, and would destroy us, God is about only to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us, and do us good: as here is observed.</p>

               </gap>6, 27. Fourthly, the Psalmist as a type of Christ, glorifieth God reconciled by Covenant to the Church, and promiseth to praise him still, and closeth the Psalm with an exhortation to thanksgiving, as he began, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29</p>
            <p>As for the first, the Psalmist as the type of Christ, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to make way for his entering into the Lords Temple, and assembly of the Saints where he may praise the Lord. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The place of Christs and the believers tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing on the earth, is the Assembly of the Church, and they who are touched with the feeling of Gods grace and salvation, have and should have a great desire to have God glorified in the holy Assemblies: <hi>Open to me the gates of righteousnesse.</hi> 2. As
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50629:88"/>
the material Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was: so every visible As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the place where the righteousnesse of faith and obedience is to be preached, where the Saints are to be edified in the course of righteousnesse, and toward which the truly righteous have and should have great affection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to frequent and honour these meetings: <hi>Open to me the gates of righteousnesse,</hi> in which the righteous enter: <hi>I will go into them.</hi> 3. The exercise of the Church met together, is mainly to proclaim the Lords praise: <hi>I will go into them, and praise the Lord.</hi> 4.

            <p>The second part of the description of the triumph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath the song of the Psalmist, as the type of Christs song of praise, wherin he in his own name and in the name of all believers praiseth God for hearing of the intercession made for the Church, and for granting salvation to them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The intercession of Christ, and the prayers also of the Saints put up in his Name, are all granted, and thereby God is greatly glorified: <hi>I will praise thee, for thou hast heard me.</hi> 2. The several victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Christ, and of his militant members, are the fruits of Christs intercession, and evidence of salvation to his mystical members; <hi>Thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.</hi> 3. As <hi>David</hi> the type, so Christ represented by him, was first despised and set at nought by the chief Rulers, before he was exalted; for he was indeed that precious stone set at nought by men; <hi>The stone which the builders refused.</hi> 4. Men may have high place in the visible Church, who cannot take up Christ
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50629:88"/>
when he sheweth himself, who have little skill to embrace Christ, and apply him to themselves or others, as the builders of the Church, Priests, Scribes and Pharisees refused to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Christ so much as for a true member of the Church; <hi>He is that stone which the builders refused.</hi> 5. Albeit men do misregard Christ offering himself in his doctrine and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, yet he is the rock whereon the Church is builded, the foundation whereupon to settle it, the corner-stone to hold the building compact together, and the head-stone of the corner for adorning and perfecting the building gloriously, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 9, 15, 42. <hi>He is become the head-stone of the corner.</hi> 6.

Where Christ cometh, salvation also and spiritual prosperity cometh, which was promised before, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed forth in types: for, <hi>Save now, I beseech thee, send now prosperity,</hi> is a promising prayer. 3. Albeit Christ hath no need of our prayers, for advancing of his own Kingdome, yet will he have us to pray for his peoples sake, that his Kingdome may come, and will have all believers in testimony of their love to his honour, to draw the chariot of his triumph, that it may ride prosperously, saying, <hi>Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord, send now prosperity.</hi> 4.

               <p>After he hath set down the rule of a young mans Conversion and conversation, he offereth himself as an example to follow this rule, and here are the first and second evidences of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in aiming at this way; The first is, the conscience of his upright seeking of God: and the second evidence is his prayer, to be preserved from wandering from the way of Gods obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

               <p>The third evidence of his sincere endeavour to cleanse his way, by taking heed thereto according to his Word, is, the laying up of the Word by faith in his heart; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is not sufficient to have the Word of God in brain-knowledge, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon memory, for not wit and memory, but the heart is the chest to keep it in: <hi>I hid thy Word in my heart.</hi> 2. Seeing it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to keep sin out of the heart, void of the Word of God, it is necessary for the servant of God, to lay up the Lords Word in his heart by faith and honest affection to it: <hi>Thy Word have I hid in my heart, that I should not sin against thee</hi> 3. It is a proof of our sincere endeavour to profit by the Word of God in the course of sanctification, to be careful that we let not the Word of God slide from us, that we be not spoiled of it by feare of men, or force of tentation: that we be not deceived by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans wiles, that we suffer it not to go by our negligence and forgetfulness of it, and that we be careful to approve our selves to God, in our love to the Lords Word, and estimation of it, as of a most precious Jewel, as here we see; <hi>Thy VVord have I hid in my heart, that I should not sin against thee.</hi>

It is a mark of sincerity of obedience, to be thankful for what measure we have received, and to be seeking to encrease, as young birds receive their food and cry for more: <hi>Blessed art thou, O Lord, teach me thy statutes.</hi> 2. Beside all external teaching, we have need of inward and effectual teaching from God, to make knowledge lively and fruitful; <hi>Teach me
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50629:94"/>
thy statutes.</hi> 3. The goodness of God, and his readiness to blesse more and more, is a ground of encouragement to seek a greater measure of his blessing; <hi>Blessed art thou, O Lord, teach me thy statutes.</hi>

               <p>A fifth evidence of his sincere endeavour to make use of Gods Word, is his care to edifie others, and glorifie God by the knowledge and experience which he had of it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The revealed will of God in Scripture should be the matter of our speech and conference with others; <hi>With my lips have I declared all the judgements of thy mouth.</hi> 2. The Word of God in Scripture should be looked upon as the sentence of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge, uncontrollable and unalterable by any creature, and whereby men must judge of all truth, and look to be judged by it: for therefore it is called, <hi>The judgement of his mouth.</hi> 3. As the conscience of communicating of our knowledge, and our spiritual gifts, is a means of encouragement to seek a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er measure: so it is an evidence of the sincerity and fruitfulness of what knowledge we have; <hi>Teach me thy statutes, with my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</hi>

               <p>The sixth evidence of his sincere endeavour to conforme his way to Gods Word, is his joy in Gods service. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Delight in Gods service and worship, is a mark of sincere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his Word: <hi>I have rejoyced in the way of thy te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies.</hi> 2. Spiritual joy in spiritual objects farre exceedeth any joy in worldly possessions; <hi>I have rejoyced in the way of thy testimonies, more then in all riches.</hi> 3. It is a most sure joy, which ariseth from the conscience of practical obedience, and not from contemplation only; <hi>I have rejoyced in the way of thy testimonies</hi>

               </q>
               <p>The seventh evidence of his sincere endeavour to conforme his way unto Gods Word, is his engagement to set his heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Gods Word in time to come, and not to rest upon any thing already past and done. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1 Sincerity of our obedience present and past, is proved best, by joyning of our hearty resolution and purpose to go on for time to come: <hi>I have rejoyced, I will meditate, I will delight in thy statutes.</hi> 2. It is a profitable meanes to grow in grace, to meditate on Gods Word; <hi>I will meditate on thy Precepts.</hi> 3. Meditation is then fruitful, when in our conversation we have respect to the wayes of God set down in his Word, whereupon we have medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; <hi>I will have respect unto thy wayes.</hi> 4. In meditation on the Word, and endeavour to make use of it in our life, we will easily wax weary, except we make this course our delight; <hi>I will delight my self in thy statutes.</hi> 5. Meditation will faile, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation will wax cold, except the Word be treasured up in a sanctified memory: <hi>I will not forget thy Word.</hi> Thus a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is cast for a young man to cleanse his way, and to make his life comfortable.</p>

Beside the outward trouble from men which the godly oft-times do feel, it pleaseth God to exercise them also somtimes with trouble of mind, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from his own hand; <hi>My soul cleaveth unto the dust.</hi> 2. Albeit the Lord suffer his owne to lie so long low in their heavy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of spirit, as they may seem dead, yet by faith in his Word he keepeth in so much life, as doth furnish unto them prayer to God for comfort; <hi>Quicken thou me according to thy Word.</hi>

               <p>Another petition is for direction and power to obey Gods Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because he had laid open before God all his own course, and confessed what he knew of his own way. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When we are deserted in the point of consolation, it is wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to search our way, if any thing in it possibly hath grieved Gods Spirit, and what we finde right, or wrong, or doubtful, it is our wisdome to lay it out before the Lord in sincerity as here, <hi>I have declared my wayes.</hi> 2. As we have found audience and comfort after confession in former times, so may we expect to finde the like again: <hi>I have declared my wayes, and thou heardest me.</hi> 3. The end of our exercise is to make us study to walk with God more holily, and to feel his direction and guiding more effectually: <hi>Teach me thy statutes.</hi>

               <p>A third petition is, for encrease of understanding of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Gods Word, that thereby he might edifie others. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

It is not sufficient to know the meaning of the VVord, except we know also the way of practising it prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Make me to understand the way of thy Precepts.</hi> 3. Desire of knowledge should not be for satisfying of curiosity, or for ostentation, or for worldly gaine, but to edifie our selves and others in wisdome: <hi>So shall I talke of thy works.</hi> 4. It is good first to understand, and then to talk of, and to expresse truth formerly meditated and digested, as the order of these two doth teach us. 5. The works of Creation, Redemption and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, either set down in Scripture, or observed in our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, do transcend our capacity, and cannot but draw ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration from them that see them well; <hi>I shall talke of thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous works.</hi>

               <p>A fourth petition is for strength and consolation, in his felt fainting. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lords children do finde su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural both joyes and sorrowes, which the natural man who wanteth experience of spiritual exercise, doth not understand, as this expression sheweth: <hi>My soul melteth for heaviness.</hi> 2. No natural meanes can be a remedy to a spiritual disease, but the VVord of God only, being quickned by himself is the proper cure; <hi>Strengthen thou me, according to thy Word.</hi> 3. Spiritual exercise doth give unto the Saints the clearest discerning of their own weaknesse, and need of support from God: <hi>My heart melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, strengthen thou me.</hi> 4. VVhatsoever the believer needeth, God doth by the VVord supply unto him, as <hi>light,</hi> that he may not wander: <hi>life,</hi> that he die not: <hi>comfort,</hi> that he saint not: and <hi>strength,</hi> that he fall not: <hi>Strengthen me according to thy Word.</hi>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50629:97"/>
and from the course of lying in particular, that so he might neither deceive others, nor be deceived himself, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Gods law, which can deceive no man. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. All sinful courses in life or religion, are all ways of lying, because they cannot but deceive a man, whatsoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences they carry; <hi>Remove from me the way of lying.</hi> 2. As ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in special, and all sinful courses are liable to our nature, and do lie close unto us: so should we pray the more against them unto God, who only can remove them: <hi>Remove from me the way of lying.</hi> 3. Nothing can decipher unto us a lying way, nor guard us from it, but Gods law which is the only true way: therefore, saith he, <hi>Grant me thy law.</hi> 4. Not only are we encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned naturally to lying, but also we have so foully defiled our selves with the lying way of sinning, that it is so much the more grace to finde any deliverance from it: <hi>Grant me thy law gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously.</hi>

               <p>A sixth petition, is to be saved from shame, and comforted, with the reason thereof: because he had adhered to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the VVord, and hoped to go on chearfully in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereof, if God should be pleased, by the removal of his feared reproach, to comfort and enlarge his heart. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. VVhen a man is about to resolve upon the way of his carriage, in general or particular, many rules and counsels will be suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and offered unto him, each of them having a pretence of some good, so as a man had need to be well advised what course he chooseth; and then only doth a man resolve rightly when he chooseth the way of obedience of Gods VVord, which cannot deceive him; <hi>I have chosen the way of thy truth.</hi> 2. He that would have special direction in any particular trial, must be a man resolved to follow the Rule of Gods VVord, in all his wayes in general, for otherwise he may be left without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50629:98"/>
when he hath most need, except he may say for the whole course of his life, <hi>I have chosen the way of truth.</hi> 3. The solid consideration, that Gods Word is Gods decree, may guard a believer against mens terrours and allurements, and fix him in his right choice, as here; <hi>Thy judgements I have laid before me.</hi> 4. As he who hath been most stedfast in trialls, in not past danger of being driven from Gods Word: so of all men it is greatest shame for such a man in trialls to quit his hold; <hi>I have stuck to thy testimonies: O Lord, put me not to shame.</hi> 5. In the triall of our sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast obedience unto God, there is no way to persevere, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the sense of our weaknesse, and faith of Gods goodnesse, we shall call on God to save us, who will not suffer us to be confounded: <hi>O Lord, put me not to shame.</hi> 6. The child of God is subject to bondage of spirit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after regeneration, in sundry cases, especially when God bringeth troubles upon him; hideth his comfort from him; and letteth forth appearance of wrath upon him: as the straitening of <hi>Davids</hi> heart here doth import. 7. As when a mans spirit is in bonds, hardly can he walk in Gods service chearfully, so when God sheweth his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and comforteth a man, then all Gods service is easie: <hi>I will runne the way of thy commandments, when thou hast enlarged my heart.</hi> 8. When the Lord giveth large comfort, and looseth a mans affection from the spirit of bondage, he useth to give also large measure of strength and activity in his service, albeit not so large as the mans affection is: <hi>I will runne the way of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, when thou hast enlarged my heart.</hi>

               <p>In this section there are eight petitions, according to the number of the verses. From the first; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The narrow way of Gods obedience is hard to be found, hardly kept, and easily mistaken, except God do teach us daily by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, what he doth at any time teach us by his Word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have need again and again to pray, <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes.</hi> 2. As the Lord requireth our perseverance in his service, so our perseverance dependeth on his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued direction and assistance, which the believer and daily supplicant for grace may promise to himselfe in Gods Name: <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, and I shall keep it to the end.</hi>

               <p>From the second petition; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. There is no true wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, except by the knowledge of Gods will revealed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and applied by him, and this we should alwayes pray for: <hi>Give me understanding.</hi> 2. Where God becometh teacher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the disciple may promise obedience: <hi>Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law.</hi> 3. As no service pleaseth God, but that which a man desireth, at least to do heartily: so he that purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to persevere, must purpose also to serve God affectionately: <hi>Yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.</hi>

                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:50629:99"/>From the third petition; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Because there are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable by-paths from terrors and allurements without, to make us decline from the obedience of God, and we of our selves are both weak and subject to errors within us, therefore should we be the more instant in prayer, <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy commandements.</hi> 2. As it is a faire grace of God to have pleasure and delectation in Gods service, so he who hath gotten of God this grace, may expect also direction and strength, to go on in the path of Gods obedience: <hi>for therein do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> is given as a reason of his praying, <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy commandments.</hi>

               <p>From the fourth petition; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the most holy of Gods servants have in them the remainder of their natural stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and aversnesse from the obedience of Gods Word, so are they of all men most sensible of this sicknesse, and most instant with God, the only Physician to heal it: <hi>Incline my heart unto thy testimonies.</hi> 2. The heart cannot want some object where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it must cleave, a man must love something: and if the heart be not set on things spiritual and heavenly, it will not faile to pitch upon things base, and earthly, as here is insinuated by opposition of <hi>covetousnesse</hi> to Gods <hi>testimonies.</hi> 3. The love of Gods testimonies, or of obedience to Gods Word, and the love of base objects, as the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, are inconsistent; for the one is contrary to the other, as here is shewn: <hi>Incline mine heart unto thy testimonies, and not unto covetousnesse.</hi>

               <p>From the fifth petition; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The sinful concupiscence of the heart hath defiled the externall senses, and made them ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto it selfe, except God do heal both the heart and the senses, as the petition, <hi>Turne away mine eyes,</hi> doth import. 2. Albeit the corruption of the heart be deadly wounded, yet it may soon recover life and strength by the external objects of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50629:99"/>
the senses, if watching over the external man be neglected, as, <hi>turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity,</hi> doth import. 3. Whatsoever doth draw away the heart from Gods obedience, is but deceit and folly, whatsoever it may seem to the beholder: <hi>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity.</hi> 4. Albeit we know that the outward allurements of sinne be nothing but vanity, yet we cannot beware of them, nor renounce them, except the Lord help us, when the baite is offered: therefore is it needfull to pray, <hi>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity.</hi> 5. As God setteth a watch over the senses, and keepeth the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the renewed heart, and the eyes, and doth renew the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the life of gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the sixth petition, he prayeth for the fruit of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, for circumcising his heart, and purifying of it, and that by experience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he may be settled in the faith of the promises. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Faith purisieth the heart by laying hold on the promises of sanctification, and urging of God by prayer to the performance of them: <hi>Stablish thy Word unto thy servant,</hi> 2. Albeit the promise be sure in it selfe, and sure unto faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, yet when experimental performance cometh, the truth of it is much more confirmed to us: <hi>Stablish thy word unto the servant.</hi> 3. Then do we believe the promises, when we take them as made not onely to others, but also as made to our selves by name, as this prayer sheweth, <hi>Stablish thy word to me thy servant,</hi> (to wit, the promise of sanctification made to believers) and so <hi>to me thy servant.</hi> 4. He who prayeth for the performance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, should resolve to be a servant, and carefull to observe precepts: <hi>Stablish thy word to thy servant.</hi> 3. That man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is Gods servant, how weak soever he be in practice, who is devoted unto Gods fear: for he proveth himselfe to be a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant by this, <hi>Because I am devoted to thy fear.</hi>

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:50629:100"/>From the seventh petition; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the godly are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to sinful out-breakings, which may bring reproach on them, and on their profession: so are they also jealous of themselves, as unable to keep themselves, except God prevent them from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving scandal: <hi>Turn away my reproach which I fear.</hi> 2. The way to be kept blamelesse, is to feare to offend, and to pray unto God for preservation, and to watch over our hearts, as we are taught here, <hi>Turn away my reproach which I fear.</hi> 3. As the fear of dishonouring of our profession by sinne, is a guard on the one hand: so estimation and love of prescribed holinesse, as of a good and profitable thing, is a guard against sinne on the other hand; <hi>Turn away my reproach which I fear, for thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are good.</hi>

               <p>From the eighth petition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Sincerity loveth to come to the light, and offereth it selfe to be approved to God; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have longed after thy precepts.</hi> 2. To love and long for sanctified subjection unto Gods Word, is a proof of sincerity; <hi>I have longed after thy precepts.</hi> 3. A Saint may have a great desire to believe, and obey Gods Word, and yet in his own sense feel much deadnesse in his affections for a time; <hi>I have longed, quicken me.</hi> 4.

               <p>From his first petition, and the reasons of it; <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. The believer must lay hold on mercies not seen, and must not rest till he draw them forth by prayer; <hi>Let thy mercies come also unto me, O Lord.</hi> 2. Whatsoever may remove our sinnes, and evill merits, and make way for performance of promises, is mercy in effect, and must be sought no lesse then inward quickning and consolation: <hi>Let thy mercies come also unto me.</hi> 3. As perils and hazards of life must be resolved upon by Gods servant, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances one after another, and salvation may be surely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: <hi>Let thy mercies come unto me, even thy salvation.</hi> 4. It is not any sort of delivery by any meanes, which the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God being in straits doth call for, or desire, but such a deliverance as God will allow, and be pleased to give in a holy way: <hi>Let thy salvation come.</hi> 5. As the Word of promise is the rule of our petition, so is it a pawn of the thing promised, and must be held fast till the performance come; <hi>Let thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation come, according to thy word:</hi> and this is one reason of the petition. 6. As the Lords delivering of his children from the hand of persecutors, doth stop the mouthes of their enemies, who say of them, that they are in a wrong course, and that God is not their friend: so the believer desireth the Lord to appeare for him, to this very end, that the mouth of the enemy may be stopped: <hi>So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me:</hi> and this is another reason of his petition. 7. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever be our encouragements in our sufferings, the Word of God received by faith must be the ground of our comfort and confidence, or else the work will not be sound; <hi>for I trust in thy Word,</hi> is the ground of <hi>Davids</hi> comfort.</p>

               </q>
               <p>From the next petition, and the seven reasons added thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is not sufficient for Gods glory, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Word of God in our heart, but we must also confesse it with our mouth in the time of trial; <hi>Take not thy Word out of my mouth.</hi> 2. As God may justly for our sinnes desert us in the time of trial, when his glory and our duty calleth for a testimony: so we must in the sense of our ill deserving, flee to Gods grace by prayer, and say with confidence, <hi>Take not thy Word out of my mouth.</hi> 3. If it shall please God, for humbling of us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert us in some passage of our trial, yet let us believe in him, and deal with him not to forsake us altogether in our trial: <hi>Take not the Word of truth utterly out of my mouth.</hi> 4. Where the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of Gods executing of his Word of threatening and promise hath place with Gods children, there is hope that neither mens terror nor allurement shall overcome them in their trials: <hi>for I have hoped in thy judgements,</hi> is set down here for the first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his hope to obtaine his petition. 5. The Lords keeping our heart in faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our mouth and outward man in the course of confession and obedience, is the cause of our perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; <hi>So shall I keep thy law continually, for ever and ever:</hi> and this is the second reason of his petition. 6. As he who departs from confessing of Gods truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth cast himselfe in straits, in dangers, and bonds: so he that beareth out the confession of the truth, doth walk as a free-man, the truth doth set him free; <hi>And I will walke at liberty:</hi> which is the third reason of his petition. 7. Even the conscience of honest endeavour to obey the Word, hath the promise of not being utterly deserted in the day of trial: <hi>for I have fought thy precepts,</hi> is the fourth reason of the petition. 8. The terror of Kings, and of men in power,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50629:101"/>
is an ordinary hindrance of free confession of Gods truth in time of persecution, but faith in the truth sustained in the heart by God, is able to bring forth a confession upon all hazards: <hi>I will speak of thy testimonies before Kings.</hi> 9. He that is resolved to confesse the questioned truth of God, whosoever do mock at it, shall not be ashamed of his confession, but rather shall have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit by it: <hi>I will speak of thy testimonies also before Kings, and will not be ashamed:</hi> and this is the fifth reason of the petition. 10. The more men do know the excellency of Gods truth, and do feel the power of Gods hand, sustaining them in the faith and confession of it, the more will they love, delight and take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the Word of the Lord: <hi>I will delight my selfe in thy commandments, which I have loved</hi>: which is the sixth reason of his petition. 11. He that findeth himself born out in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the truth in time of triall, should in all time after so much the more as his experience is greater, embrace heartily the Lords commands, as precious gifts, and should give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe absolutely to be governed thereby: for the <hi>lifting up of his hands to the Lords commandments,</hi> doth import so much. 12. He who out of love to Gods commands, hath endured trial by trouble, and hath overcome tentations, may comfortably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himself in his former loving of the Lords commands, and thereby renew, and increase his love to the obedience of them: for after he hath said, <hi>I will lift up my hands to thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> he sheweth that he will do so, with a ratification, and approbation of his love to them, by adding, <hi>thy commandments which I have loved.</hi> 13. The experience of the worth of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, which is able to bear out it selfe, and the man also who doth confesse it, should set a believer on a more and more earnest study, to know the minde of God revealed therein, as the Prophet resolveth to do, <hi>And I will meditate in thy statutes</hi>: and this engagement is the last reason of the petition.</p>

               <p>The fruits which he hath found already by his faith in the Word, are seven, all in order set down in the rest of the verses of this section. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Faith and hope in God do not exempt Gods children from troubles, but do comfort them in their trouble, so as all other consolations are naught in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; <hi>This is my consolation in my affliction.</hi> 2. When the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50629:102"/>
believer is damped with trouble, and sometime as it were dead in regard of spiritual operations, motions and affections, faith draweth life againe out of the Word of promise; <hi>for thy Word hath quickened me:</hi> and this is the first fruit of faith in Gods Word. 3. Albeit impenitent, gracelesse men do mock grace, do mock faith and obedience in the godly; and (in Satans drift and theirs) to the intent they may make the godly forsake Gods law, yet faith in the Word is able to bear the believer up against derision, as experience sheweth: <hi>The proud have had me greatly in derision, yet have I not declined from thy Law:</hi> and this is the second felt fruit of his faith. 4. It is good to have a number of examples of Gods dealing with his servants, and with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, laid up in the storehouse of a sanctified memory, that thereby faith may be strengthened in the day of affliction: for so are we here taught, <hi>I remembred thy judgements of old, O Lord.</hi> 5. Faith doth draw comfort out of the execution of Gods Word of promise, and of threatening also, in former times; <hi>I remembred thy judgements of old, O Lord, and was comforted</hi>: and this is the thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d felt fruit of his faith. 6. It is an evidence of sincerity in Gods service, to see wrath and judgement in the face of sinne, and to be diverted from sinning by the sight of Gods judgement threatened and executed upon the wicked: <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour hath taken hold upon me, because of the wicked that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thy law</hi>: and this is the fourth felt fruit of his faith. 7. As Gods children are in this world strangers and pilgrims in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and dealt with as strangers where they live, so also are they oft-times banished from their native Countrey: <hi>Thy sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes have been my song in the house of my pilgrimage.</hi> 8. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the believer is, and whatsoever be his outward conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Word of God received by faith, shall bear him company, and furnish him with matter of comfort and rejoycing: <hi>Thy statutes have been my song in the hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of my pilgrimage</hi>: and this is the fifth felt fruit of his faith. 9. The knowledge and deep impression of the Majesty of God, as he revealeth himselfe in his works, and Word, is a powerfull meanes to strengthen us in the obedience of faith; <hi>I have rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mbred thy Name, O Lord, and have kept thy Law</hi>: and this is the sixth felt fruit of his faith. 10. Well spent time in secret when we are solitary, shall be rewarded openly by a good carriage in society and company: <hi>I remembred thy Name in the night, I have kept thy law.</hi> 11. It is no small benefit to see and observe what good we have had by our obedience to God, and how grace hath been rewarded by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50629:103"/>
grace in our persons: <hi>This I had</hi> (to wit, all the former fruits,) <hi>because I kept thy precepts</hi>: and this is the seventh felt fruit of faith, that a man may enjoy the approbation and comfort of the fruits of faith. 12. Those are reckoned keepers of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, not who have no sinne in them, but who study to be free of sinne, and to do Gods will: <hi>This I had, because I kept thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</hi> 13. It is wisdome to reckon what good we have by faith in God, and to endeavour to please him, rather then to reckon our temporary and light afflictions in our service, as here we are taught.</p>

               <p>In this section he laboureth to confirme his faith, and to comfort himselfe in the certainty of his regeneration, by eight properties of a sound believer, or eight marks of a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The first whereof is, his choosing of God for his portion.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50629:103"/>
                  <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such as God hath chosen and effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they get grace to make God their choice, their delight, and their portion: and such as have chosen God for their portion, have an evidence of their regeneration and election also; for here <hi>David</hi> maketh this a mark of his regeneration: <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord.</hi> 2. It is another mark of regeneration, after believing in God, and choosing of him for our portion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to bring out the fruits of faith in new obedience, as <hi>David</hi> did; <hi>I have said that I will keep thy words.</hi> 3. As it is usuall for Gods children, now and then because of sinne falling out, to be exercised with the sense of Gods displeasure: so it is a mark of a new creature, not to lie stupid and senslesse under this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, but to deal with God earnestly, for restoring the sense of reconciliation, and giving new experience of his mercy, as the Psalmist did; <hi>I intreated thy favour with my whole heart:</hi> and this is the third evidence of a new creature. 4. The penitent believer hath the Word of grace, and Covenant of God, for his assurance to be heard when he seeketh mercy: <hi>Be mercifull to me according to thy Word.</hi> 5. The searching in what condition we are in, and examination of our wayes according to the Word, and renewing of repentance, with an endeavour of amendment, is a fourth mark of a new creature: <hi>I thought on my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</hi> 6. When we do see our sin, we are naturally slow to amend our doings, but the sooner we turne us to the way of Gods obedience, we speed the better, and the more speedy the reforming of our life be, the more sound mark is it of a new creature: <hi>I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</hi> 7. Enduring of persecution, and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our goods, for adhering to Gods Word, without forsaking of our cause, is a fifth mark of a new creature: <hi>The bands of the wicked have robbed me, but I have not forgotten thy law.</hi> 8 As it is the lot of Gods children who resolve to be godly to suffer persecution, and to be forced either to lose their temporal goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else to lose a good cause, and a good conscience: so it is the wisdome of the godly, to remember what the Lords Word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us, and speaketh unto us, and this shall comfort our conscience more, then the losse of things temporal can trouble our mindes: <hi>The bands of the wicked robbed me, but I have not forgotten thy Law.</hi> 9. A sixth mark of a new creature, is to be so farre from fretting under hard exercise, as to thank God in secret chearfully for his gracious Word, and for all the passages of his providence, where none seeth us, and where there is no
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50629:104"/>
hazard of ostentation: <hi>At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee, because of thy righteous judgements.</hi> 10. A seventh mark of a renewed creature, is, to associate our selves, and keep communion with such as are truly gracious, and do fear God indeed, as we are able to discerne them: <hi>I am a companion of all them that fear thee.</hi> 11. The fear of God is evidenced by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and obeying the doctrine and direction of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and no other wayes: <hi>I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</hi> 12. The eighth mark of a new creature, is not to rest in any measure of renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but earnestly to deal with God for the encrease of saving knowledge, and fruitfull obedience of it: for, <hi>Teach me thy sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> is the prayer of the man of God, in whom all the former marks are found. 13. As the whole creatures are witnesses of Gods bounty to man, and partakers of that bounty themselves: so are they pawnes of Gods pleasure to bestow upon his servants greater gifts then these, even the encrease of sanctification, in further illumination of minde and reformation of life: for this the Psalmist useth for an argument, to be more and more sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; <hi>The whole earth is full of thy bounty, O Lord, teach me thy statutes.</hi>

               <p>In this section, he gives eight marks of a thankfull soul deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from heavy trouble for a time. The first mark is his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acknowledgement of Gods goodnesse toward himself. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There is a time to acknowledge mercies received, as well as to pray for good things not as yet received: and as it is the duty of a believer to pray in his need, so it is the duty of the thankfull man to confesse what he hath received for supplying of his need: <hi>Thou hast dealt well with thy servant.</hi> 2. The Lord will so performe his promise, as he shall make the believing supplicant witnesse of his fidelity: <hi>Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, according to thy word.</hi> 3. As gifts prayed for, so also
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50629:104"/>
gifts received ought to be examined, whether they be given to us, as to servants of God, and according to the promises made to his servants in the Word, or not: otherwise a man can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make right use of them, nor be thankfull for them, as the Psalmist doth here, who saith, <hi>Thou hast dealt well with thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant according to thy word.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 66.</hi> Teach me good judgement and knowledge: for I have believed thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q>
               <p>Another work of his thankfulnesse, is his seeking the increase of wisdome and discretion, for enabling of him unto better ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God in time to come. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Beside the knowledge of the general rule of Gods will, it is necessary to have the gift of discretion, to know our duty, when particulars cloathed with circumstances, come to be tried by the rule: and this the thankfull man should pray for; <hi>Teach me good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and knowledge.</hi> 2. He that would be directed in the faith and obedience of Gods Word in particular, ought to be cleare in general of his estimation and belief of all Gods Word in Scripture. <hi>Teach me good judgement,</hi> (saith he) <hi>for I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved thy commandments.</hi>

                  <hi>Ver. 67.</hi> Before I was afflicted, I went a stray: but now have I kept thy word.</q>
               <p>The third mark of his thankfulnesse is, his acknowledgement of the wisdome and goodnesse of God, manifested in, and wrought by afflicting of him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. So perverse are we by nature, as we are the worse oft-times by prosperity: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was afflicted I went astray.</hi> 2. When prosperity is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it is Gods mercy to us to visit us with the rod of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and by it to drive us to make better use of his Word; <hi>But now have I kept thy word.</hi> 3. When affliction is sanctified and found in the fruits thereof, it is no lesse sweet when it is past, then it was bitter when it was present; as the comparison of times here doth shew.</p>

               <p>The fourth mark of his thankfulness, now being comforted after trouble is, his acknowledgement of the goodnesse of Gods nature and working, and his drawing from this fountain more sanctification. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As goodnesse is Gods nature, and good is his work: so it is the thankful mans part to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, acknowledge it, and heartily to praise him for it, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s called unto this by late favours, as the Psalmist doth here: <hi>Thou art good, and doest good.</hi> 2. When the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God is solidly apprehended, it furnisheth ground of great confidence to seek further fruits thereof towards us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as here the Psalmist doth. 3. Of all the fruits of Gods goodness, which a thankful man can crave to himself, none is fitter to be sought, then the growth of the grace of sanctification: as here, <hi>Teach me thy statutes.</hi>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 69.</hi> The proud have forged a lie against me: <hi>but</hi> I will keep thy Precepts with any whole heart.</q>
               <p>A fifth mark of a thankful man comforted, is his renewed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose not to sin, for fear of the malice or craft of any persecutors. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Beside violence and crueltie we shall finde lies and false calumnies to be the weapons of the wicked against the godly; <hi>The proud have forged a lie against me.</hi> 2. The slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and calumnies of the wicked against the godly, are so trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and dressed up with much artifice, as if they were cast in a mould; <hi>The proud have forged a lie against me.</hi> 3. The only way of resisting and overcoming this tentation, is by the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere adhering to God in the faith and obedience of his Word; <hi>But I will keep thy Precepts with my whole heart.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:50629:105"/>The sixth mark of a thankful man comforted after affliction and persecution, is his despising the prosperity of the wicked, in comparison of the benefit of a good conscience, and joy in God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is the prosperity of the proud, which encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth them to persecute the godly, yea, their prosperity so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummeth their consciences, that they may not fear to persecute: <hi>Their heart is as fat as grease.</hi> 2. As a benummed and seared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is a sin annexed to the sin of persecution, so is it also the plague of God upon them ordinarily, that they should not repent; <hi>Their heart is as fat as grease.</hi> 3. The comfort of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the comfort of delighting in the obedience of faith, is a greater welfare to the godly then prosperity, how great soever it can be unto the wicked, and so the godly need not envie the proud and prosperous man: <hi>Their heart is fat as grease, but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thy law.</hi>

               <p>The seventh mark of a thankful minde comforted after affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is his estimation that holiness wrought by affliction bringeth more pleasure and gain, then affliction did bring with it losse or pain. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The godly have as evil na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as the wicked have, which cannot be subdued and beaten down, except by affliction, as appeareth by this experience of the Psalmist. 2. Albeit no affliction for the present be pleasant, yet afterward it proveth medicine to the godly, whose wisdom it is to observe all the advantages which come thereby, as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist doth here: <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted.</hi> 3. Profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in sanctification, is more then may recompence all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which we are put unto in learning of it: <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.</hi>

God to all riches. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. No affection to the Word of God can be in a man, till it be esteemed by him, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the VVord of Gods mouth, as it were breathed out by himself speaking it: for it is called here, <hi>The law of thy mouth,</hi> to direct and inforce our obedience. 2.

               <p>In this section is set down the example of the right carriage of a believer, brought out of one calamity, and cast into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: his good behaviour consisteth in these six duties. The first is, to guard well against sin, by seeking wisdome from God to bear well the tentation of new trouble. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 2. Albeit nothing can satisfie misbelief, yet true faith will make use of the most common benefit of Creation to strengthen it self; <hi>Thine hands have made me and fashioned me.</hi> 2. It is a good way of reasoning with God, to ask another gift, because we have received one: and because he hath given common benefits, to ask that he would give us also saving graces: <hi>Thy hands have made me and fashioned me, give me understanding that I may learn thy Commandments.</hi> 3. Seeing God is our Creator, and the end of our Creation is to serve God, we may confidently aske whatsoever grace may enable us to serve him, as the Psalmists example doth teach us. 4. As the afflicted Petitioner for grace to obey Gods Commandments, is strengthened in his faith, by the hope of the glory which may come unto God by his holy
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50629:106"/>
behaviour, so also is he strengthened in his prayer, by the hope of the edification, which others the Lords children may have by beholding his carriage; <hi>They that feare thee, will be glad when they see me.</hi> 5. It should be the joy of all believers, to see one of their number sustained, and borne out in their sufferings; for in the proof and example of one sufferer, a pawne is given to all the rest, that God will help them in the like case: <hi>They that feare thee will be glad when they see me.</hi> 6. The Lord shall so work for the man that hopes in his Word, that both he and others shall have cause to be glad, for the grace of faith and hope bestowed on him: <hi>They shall be glad when they see me, because I hoped in thy word.</hi>

It is not sufficient that we justifie God, and forbear to murmure against Gods afflicting of us, but we must believe that God out of love doth afflict us, by way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of his Covenant unto us; <hi>I know that thou in thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness hast afflicted me.</hi>

must not hinder us to seek comfort from God in that affliction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and nothing can comfort the afflicted, except the sense of Gods kindnesse and mercy to him: <hi>Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be for my comfort.</hi> 2. Albeit full remedy be promised in the Word, and albeit salve for every sore be treasured up there, yet the sweet effect of these promises we cannot have, without dealing with God by prayer, to apply in particular, what faith in the Word beleeveth in general: <hi>Let thy merciful kindnesse be for my comfort according to thy Word.</hi> 3. To the end we may have the benefit of the promise, it is wisdome to thrust in our selves among those to whom the promise is made, under one title or other as we can and to put our name in Gods Writ: <hi>Let comfort come into me, according to thy Word to thy servant:</hi> that is, the Word of Promise which is made to servants, and so to me, and so let it come to me. 4. The sense of Gods tender mercy to the beleever, is the very life of the beleever, it is death to him to want it: <hi>Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live.</hi> 5. As we love the sense of Gods mercy, so must we love Gods Word, and studie the obedience of faith, and he who hath the one, may pray and hope for the other; <hi>Let thy tender mercies come unto me, for thy law is my delight.</hi>

                  <hi>Ver. 78.</hi> Let the proud be ashamed, for they dealt perversly with me without a cause: <hi>but</hi> I will meditate in thy Precepts.</q>
               <p>The fourth duty of the afflicted servant of God, especially by persecution, is to pray against his enemies, and then to go on in his way of serving God. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. Proud, gracelesse, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent men, will not prove friends to the godly, but unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able persecutors of them, as they finde occasion: <hi>The proud have dealt perversly with me without a cause.</hi> 2. When the proud and wicked in the world are our party, God will be a friend to us who do seek for relief from him, and will disappoint them of their plots against us: <hi>Let the proud be ashamed, for they dealt perversly with me without a cause.</hi> 3. Persecution by the wicked maketh and should make the godly studie to understand the Word of God more clearly and fully then before: <hi>Let the proud be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but I will meditate in thy Precepts.</hi> 4. The best defence against persecution, is to stand fast in a good cause, and studie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50629:107"/>
to Gods Word; for by this meanes the afflicted do remain Gods servants, and the Lord is engaged to do for them as his servants; for this is the course the Psalmist taketh.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 79.</hi> Let those that feare thee turne unto me: and those that have known thy testimonies.</q>
               <p>The fifth duty of the afflicted and persecuted is, to labour to know friendship and fellowship with others who are godly, which may both strengthen themselves and others. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. As it should not seem strange unto us if the godly forsake our fellowship when we are persecuted, seeing God doth suffer this for the humbling, and trying, and turning us to believe in God alone: so it is our duty to recover them who have desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and to draw them in unto us again, and to pray to God to further us: <hi>Let those that feare thee turne unto me,</hi> doth teach all this. 2. As God when he pleaseth, diverts the comfort of the fellowship of godly friends, so he can bring them back again to us, as the prayer doth import. 3. Only they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who with feare to offend God, have the sound knowledge of Gods Word, are fit comforters and strengtheners of the godly under persecution; <hi>Let those that feare thee, turne unto me, and those that keep thy testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi>

                  <hi>Ver. 80.</hi> Let my heart be sound in thy statutes, that I be not ashamed.</q>
               <p>The sixth duty of the afflicted, is to studie above all things, to be sincere in his carriage, and in his defence of a good cause; uprightly aiming to do what is right rightly, and for the right ends. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Minde and heart in the best men, are so perverted by natural corruption, (which is not fully abolished in any) that not mans free will, but Gods free grace must help this evil: for this prayer, <hi>Let my heart be sound in thy statutes,</hi> doth import so much. 2. Sound knowledge of the statutes, and sound affection toward the statutes, and a sound purpose in the following of the statutes, must be joyned together in the Lords Martyrs; <hi>Let my heart be sound in thy statutes.</hi> 3. As the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound heart will not bear out the good cause, nor keep up with the godly in their good way, but will fall off to his own shame: so the upright man fleeing unto God in the fear of his owne weaknesse, and suspicion of the deceit of his own heart, shall be preserved from shame, as this prayer importeth: <hi>Let my heart be sound in thy statutes, that I be not ashamed.</hi>

               <p>In this section is shewen how deep the persecuted servant of God may draw in his affliction before God give him comfort, in the first foure verses thereof, and how he should behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in that sad condition, in the last foure.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 81.</hi> My soule fainteth for thy salvation: <hi>but</hi> I hope in thy word.</p>
                  <p n="82">
                     <hi>82.</hi> Mine eyes faile for thy word: saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</p>
                  <p n="83">

                     <hi>84.</hi> How many are the dayes of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgement on them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute me?</p>
               </q>
               <p>As for the first, there are foure degrees of his deepnesse in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, to wit, fainting of faith, almost failing of hope, failing of the body, and longing for death; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is not strange to see God breaking the heart of his own childe with affliction, even when he is suffering persecution, that so his faith may be tried and trained unto more strength: <hi>My soule fainteth.</hi> 2. A beleever in God, how afflicted soever he be, seeketh not to be delivered, but in a way allowed of God; <hi>My soul fainteth for thy salvation:</hi> or, till thou deliver me in thy good way. 3. The strength of the faith of the strongest of Gods servants will prove but small, when affliction is great, and Gods help is delayed: <hi>My soule fainteth for thy salvation.</hi> 4. Albeit the faith of the Lords children seem to faint, yet it cannot die, it cannot faile altogether: for it looketh to the Word, and thereby gathereth strength and hope; <hi>My soule fainteth, but I hope in thy Word.</hi> 5. Albeit hope keepeth the eye of the minde so fixed upon the promise, as it is ever looking for deliverance, yet
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50629:108"/>
long delay of help maketh hope weak, and ready to faint; <hi>Mine eyes faile for thy word.</hi> 6. Hope, and patience, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God may stand altogether, but they must never be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from prayer; <hi>Mine eyes faile for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</hi> 7. Longer exercise by trouble may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the bodie of Gods dearest children, so as wasting leanness may be seen on it: <hi>I am become as a skin-bottle dried in the smoak.</hi> 8. No trouble should drive us to sin, but we should choose rather to pine away in affliction, then to be freed from it with sin; <hi>I am become like a bottle in the smoke, yet I do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thy statutes.</hi> 9. It is good in time of persecution or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whatsoever, to have an eye both on the Promises, and on the Precepts: for the looking to the Promise doth encourage to hope, and the eyeing of the Precepts doth prove the hope to be sound: The Psalmist <hi>hoped in the word,</hi> v. 81. and v. 83. <hi>He forgate not the statutes.</hi> 10. Albeit long affliction be able to make the believer weary of life, and to desire to die, yet must he yield unto God, to live so long as he pleaseth: <hi>How many are the dayes of thy servant?</hi> 11. The delivery of the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is ordinarily joyned with the punishment of the persecutors, and the afflicted must wait till their cup be full; <hi>When wilt thou execute judgement on them that persecute me?</hi>

               <p>He sheweth yet further how he carried himself in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he layeth out his enemies carriage before God, <hi>v.</hi> 85, 86. and his owne stedfastnesse in extream danger, <hi>v.</hi> 87. and prayeth for comfort, that he may in his trial beare out, <hi>v.</hi> 88. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The course of persecutors, is full of traps and snares, whereby they studie to overtake the godly, without fear of sinning in so doing; <hi>The proud have digged pits for me, which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50629:109"/>
are not after thy law.</hi> 2. As the common quarrel of the wicked against the godly, is for keeping of Gods commands: so the common comfort of the godly is, that they have a good cause to defend; <hi>All thy Commandments are faithful, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute me wrongfully.</hi> 3. The worse the cause and course is, which our adversaries do follow, the more hopeful may we be to be helped of God: <hi>They persecute me wrongfully, help thou me.</hi> 4. It is a good meanes of courage, and comfort, and strength in persecution, to lay the carriage, and cause of us, and of our adversaries before our eyes, and compare them together by the Word, and then lay them forth before God, as the Psalmist doth here. 5. Albeit the godly may run the hazard of losing all things they have in the earth, yet that is the height of their hazard in defence of Gods truth, for what they have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven cannot be taken from them: <hi>They had almost consumed me upon earth.</hi> 6. No hazard of whatsoever we have in the world, life, lands, goods, friends, liberty, or what else, can warrant a man to depart from the obedience of Gods command, contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted between the persecutor and him: <hi>They had almost consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me upon earth, but I forsook not thy Precepts.</hi> 7. Through the infirmity of the flesh, the feeling of the comforts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the freedome of following Gods service chearfully, may be interrupted, as <hi>quicken me,</hi> here doth import. 8. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever measure of spiritual life, strength or comfort can be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diminished by affliction, the renewed sense of Gods love and friendship to us, (which we should seek after always,) can easily restore and recompense it: <hi>Quicken me after thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindness, so shall I keep the testimonies of thy mouth.</hi>

               <p>In this section, he sheweth, first, how he was comforted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der persecution, by faith in Gods Word: and to this end he commends the worth of the Word of God, or of the Scripture, for foure reasons: The first is, because of the stability of it in heaven, <hi>v.</hi> 89. The next, for the durable usefulness of it in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very age of the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 90. The third is, because by Gods Word the earth is established, <hi>v,</hi> 90, 91.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50629:109"/>
of his own experience of comfort and strength by it in his affliction, <hi>v.</hi> 91. And in the next part, he expresseth his thankfulnesse in the rest of the verses of this section.</p>

               <p>In his setting down his comfort, which he had by faith in the Word, and what estimation he had of the Scripture; Let us learn, 1. God hath given unro us his Word to bear up our faith, in every hardest condition, and it is a sure rock which wil not fail us, whatsoever appear, or howsoever we do faile or faint: <hi>For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, O Lord, thy word is established.</hi> 2. Albeit the effect of Gods Word doth not appear sometime, but is over-clouded with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and tentations, yet it is sure and fixed by Gods decree unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in heaven, and cannot want the effect in due time: <hi>For ever, O Lord, thy word is setled in heaven.</hi> 3. The stability of the Lords Word depends upon the stability of Gods truth and faithfulness, which because he is absolutely unchangable, his VVord is so also; <hi>Thy faithfulness is unto all generations.</hi> 4. The truth of God is not alwayes hid up in heaven, but in all generations the truth of the VVord, and the faithfulness of God who hath spoken it, is from age to age made manifest among men; <hi>Thy faithfulness is unto all generations.</hi> 5. The stability of the earth is nothing but the effect of Gods VVord, and the stability of the earth, and frame of the world, is a pawne of the stability of Gods VVord: <hi>Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.</hi> 6. As heaven and earth do continue in their motion and station, and do serve God as his Word hath ordained, so should we do: <hi>They continue this day according to thy Ordinances, for all are thy servants.</hi> 7 Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction draweth forth the worth of Gods Word, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise could not be known, and lets it be seen, that the Word of God is able to save a sinking man in tribulation; <hi>Unlesse thy law had been my delight, I should then have perished in my affliction.</hi>

8.

               <p>In the latter part of this section, he sheweth his thankfulness: first, by engaging his heart to the faith and obedience of the Word, <hi>v.</hi> 93. Then, by dedication of himself unto God, as his servant, to be saved by him, <hi>v.</hi> 94. Thirdly, by engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his heart to continue against all persecution in the obedience of the Word, <hi>v.</hi> 95. And fourthly, by commendation of the Word above all things in the world, <hi>v.</hi> 96. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The worth of the Word of God is found so excellent in the experience of the believers, that their experience doth sixe and settle their estimation of it, their love to it, and their purpose to make use of it alwayes; <hi>I will never forget thy Precepts, for with them thou hast quickened me.</hi> 2. The believer is the Lords peculiar servant, bound to him by the bonds of Creation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Covenant; and it is his duty thankfully to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his interest and right in God, and Gods interest in him, for his own encouragement and for Gods praise; <hi>I am thine.</hi> 3. When a mans faith is strengthened about his own interest in God, then may he be confident to pray to God, and to expect for salvation temporal and eternal from him: <hi>I am thine, save me.</hi> 4. Honest endeavour to obey Gods commands, how weak soever, doth prove the believers interest in God, and confirmeth his hope to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him; <hi>I am thine, save me, for I have sought thy Precepts.</hi> 5. Persecutors of Gods servants for obedience to Gods Word, are in effect murtherers both of soul and body, in driving them
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50629:110"/>
to forsake Gods commands: <hi>The wicked have waited for me to destroy me.</hi> 6. The trouble which the godly sustain by persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, should drive them to search more deeply into the Word of God, and to harden themselves against all that the persecutors can do: and every comfort given to them from the Word, should do the same; <hi>But I will consider thy testimonies.</hi> 7. The use of all things visible is temporal, but the use and benefit of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is everlasting: all things visible have their own perfections in their own kinde, and do extend some of them to one tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral use, others of them to another use, but the Word of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth in its kinde to all uses, which may bring blessedness in this life, and in the world to come; A man may satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the contemplation of the worth and vertue of any thing, which is visible in the world, but the riches of the Word of God is unsearchable, the deep wisdome of God in the Scriptures is unscarchable, and the perfection of the Scripture is above all comparison; <hi>I have seen,</hi> (saith he) <hi>an end of all perfection, but thy Commandment is exceeding broad.</hi>

               <p>He goeth on in this section, to commend the VVord of God, and to shew his estimation of it for eight reasons. The first is, because it hath gained the affection of his heart unto it, so as he cannot but continually dwell upon the meditation of it. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. As the Scripture in it self is most lovely for the Author, matter and use thereof: so is it most affectionately loved by the beleever, and none can either expresse or judge, how great is his affection to it, except God only, <hi>O how love I thy law</hi>! 2. True love to the Scripture maketh good memory of it, and frequent meditation of it also; <hi>It is my meditation all the day.</hi>

               <p>The second reason of commending the Scripture, is the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which it teacheth against enemies. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is great wisdome: for albeit learning, and malice, and long experience may teach persecutors much, yet wisdom from the Word of God doth teach the persecuted believer far more: <hi>Through thy Commandments thou hast made me wiser then mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</hi> 2. Such as derive their wisdom not from the Word of God, but from the counsel of flesh and blood, within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out themselves, cannot have their counsellors alwayes with them to consult with, but he that seeketh his wisdom from God and his Word, hath his counsel alwayes present with him, to bring to his remembrance what he hath learned, and to teach him to make use of it; <hi>For thy Commandments are ever with me.</hi> 3. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever use or benefit we make by the Word of God, all the glory thereof belongeth to the Lord; <hi>For thou through thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hast made me wiser then mine enemies.</hi>

               <p>The third reason of commending the Scripture is, because the beleever thereby is made more wise then his teachers. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Wisdome is not so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though the teacher give forth the general doctrine of faith and manners, yet there is a more particular application of the Word to the hearers, which only God furnisheth unto the beleever by the Word: and in this respect the believer may say, <hi>I have more understanding then all my teachers.</hi> 3. The special application of the Word to our several necessities, cometh by joyning private means with the publick, such as are reading, praying and meditation: <hi>For thy testimonies are my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</hi>

Old age and experience in common affaires, is not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to direct men in the course of Gods obedience, especially when they have to do with persecutors, but Gods special wisdom by the VVord must come in here and teach: <hi>I understand more then the ancients.</hi> 2. To keep close to direction of Gods Word is more safe then to follow the minde of antiquity departing from the VVord, or the authority of men; <hi>I have more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing then the ancients, because I keep thy Precepts.</hi>

               <p>The fifth reason of the commendation of the Scripture, which is also an evidence of his respect unto it is, because for the love of the understanding of it, and keeping of it, he had abandoned every sinful course<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how pleasant and how profitable soever it seemed to be. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> He that would be a wise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Gods VVord, must beware <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o follow sinful courses, for so he shall grieve Gods Spirit, who must make the VVord clear unto him: neither is it sufficient to abstain from notorious sins only, but also from every evil way for the same reason; I <hi>have restrained my feet from every evil way, that I may keep thy VVord.</hi>

               <p>The sixth reason of his commending the VVord is, because he was enabled by it to overcome all tentations which tended to divert him from obedience thereof. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. As there
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50629:112"/>
are nor wanting tentations on all hands, to divert men from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the VVord, specially in time of persecution: so there is great need of adhering unto it alwayes, and specially in time of trouble, as the Psalmist did: <hi>I have not departed from thy Commandment.</hi> 2. He who hath stood fast in his obedience in the day of trouble, may lawfully take comfort in it afterward, but must give the glory thereof unto God, as here: <hi>I have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thy judgements, for thou hast taught me.</hi>

               <p>The seventh reason of his commending the Scripture is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of felt sweetnesse in it. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. There is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and delight to be found in hearing, reading, speaking and meditating on Gods VVord, yet only the believer is he who can discern it: <hi>How sweet are thy words to my taste!</hi> 2. Spiritual pleasure doth far surmount earthly and carnal pleasure; <hi>Thy words are sweeter then honey to my mouth.</hi>

               <p>The eighth reason of his commending the VVord is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is made wise to sanctification by it, and made to hate all sin for it. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. As men are involved in error, because they understand not the Scriptures: so by the knowledge of it they are delivered from errour, and made wise against se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers: <hi>Through thy Precepts I get understanding.</hi> 2. He that rightly understandeth the Scripture, as he cannot choose but love and commend it, so he cannot choose but hate every course con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it: <hi>Therefore I hate every false way.</hi> 3. Because every sinful way is a false way, and cannot but deceive the man that walketh therein, therefore we must hate every sinful way, and that from the fountain of love to the VVord of God; <hi>Through thy Precepts I get understanding, therefore I hate every false way.</hi>

               <p>As in the former section he gave evidences of his love &amp; respect to the Word of God, so in this section he giveth eight evidences of his sincere purpose to make use of it in his practice for time to come. The first is, his resolution to make it his light to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him in all his actions. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. A mans wayes are all in darknesse, except in so far as he followeth the direction of Scripture; but he that followeth the rule of the Word, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whither he goeth, and what he doth; <hi>Thy Word is a lamp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my feet.</hi> 2. The light of Scripture is not only able to give a man general rules for ordering his life, but also to direct every particular action. <hi>Thy Word is a light unto my path.</hi> 3. Love to the word, &amp; estimation of it (which is the duty set forth in the former section) is best evidenced by making practical use of it in a mans conversation, which is the duty set down in this section: and whosoever loveth it, and loveth it so as to obey it, shall finde a sweet, lively and comfortable light in it, to carry him through all the dark passages of this miserable and sinful life, that he shall have cause to say, <hi>Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Ver. 106.</hi> I have sworn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I will perform it: that I will keep thy righteous judgements.</q>
               <p>The second evidence of his purpose, to conforme his life to the rule of the Word, is the tying of himself by an oath to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The upright man is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be bound to the obedience of Gods Word, not only with
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50629:113"/>
the necessary bond of Gods Command, and of his natural duty to his Sovereign, but also by the straitest voluntary bonds he can, and will not repent his resolution for ever: <hi>I have sworne and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgements.</hi> 2. Vowes, Covenants and Oathes, to tie us unto the faith, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and obedience of the true Religion set down in Scripture, are lawful and sanctified meanes to help us to be constant; <hi>I have vowed and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> 3. The equity of all the Commands of God should be a great motive to fasten us unto the obedience thereof; <hi>I will keep thy righteous judgements.</hi>

               <p>A third evidence of his purpose to make use of Gods VVord is, his seeking nothing for his comfort and encouragement in his greatest affliction, except the quickening of spiritual life in himself by the VVord. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is no strange thing for the most holy men to be acquainted with the saddest sort of affliction, bodily and spiritual: <hi>I am afflicted very much.</hi> 2. From whence soever affliction doth come, faith goeth to God only for comfort, as here, <hi>Quicken me, O Lord.</hi> 3. VVhen God is pleased to make the VVord of Promise lively, or to performe what the promise alloweth us to expect, such a consolation is a sufficient antidote to the heaviest affliction; <hi>Quicken me, O Lord, according to thy VVord.</hi>

               <p>A fourth evidence of his purpose to make use of Gods VVord, is his present practising of it, in offering spiritual sacrifices of confession, praise and prayer, that his service may be acceptable, and that he may be taught yet more in the obedience of the VVord. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. It was spiritual, moral service, which the Lord by the Ceremonial Law did teach his people of old to offer unto him through Christ, and the godly in the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50629:113"/>
Jewish Church were not ignorant of this; for here the Psalmist prayeth: <hi>Accept, I beseech thee, the free-will-offerings of my mouth.</hi> 2. Albeit our best service be unworthy of it self to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to God, but must have weight by Gods gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, yet must we offer it, and have hope through Christs sacrifice that it shall be accepted: <hi>Accept, I beseech thee, the free-will-offerings of my mouth.</hi> 3. Together with the offer of our present service, it is good to joyne the purpose of growing in obedience and prayer for grace so to do still; <hi>Accept the free-will-offerings of my mouth, and teach me thy judgements.</hi>

               <p>The fifth evidence of his purpose to practise Gods VVord, is his resolution on all hazards, even of his life, to keep affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate memory, and actual respect unto Gods revealed will. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> VVhosoever will live godly, must resolve to run hazard of life daily in the time of persecution, and he who layeth his reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning so, hath evidence in himself of his upright purpose, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Gods VVord; <hi>My soul,</hi> or my life <hi>is continually in my hand,</hi> as ready to be laid down for maintaining of righteousness: <hi>Yet do I not forget thy law.</hi>

               <p>The sixth evidence of his purpose of constancy in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is his approving of his former carriage, in his by-past trial, which sheweth he is resolved so to do also for time to come. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is usual with persecutors to make acts and statutes, or to broach some danger one or other, which shall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther force the godly to go off the right way of obedience to Gods VVord, or to fall in the snare; <hi>The wicked have laid a snare for me.</hi> 2. The godly must hold on the royal way of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, whether he fall in the snare of worldly inconvenience or not, as the Psalmist did: <hi>Yet I erred not from thy Precepts.</hi> 3. He who hath kept the high-way, and hath troden upon snares, and repenteth not his course, giveth evidence of his sincere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50629:114"/>
to follow the Lord thereafter also, through all dangers, as this example teacheth us.</p>

               <p>A seventh evidence of his purpose to adhere to Gods Word, is, his placing of his riches and pleasure in his adhering unto it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Word of God beleeved, is the surest riches of the Saints, which when all things faile, doth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and hold up their right unto God and eternal life and so should it be looked upon by the beleever; <hi>Thy testimonies have I taken as my heritage for ever.</hi> 2. The felt benefit of the Word of God, furnishing spiritual light, comfort, peace, strength, meat, drink, clothing, and whatsoever commodities an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance can yield, is and should be the joy of the believer, and a tie upon his heart to make him stick close unto it; <hi>Thy testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have I taken as my heritage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart.</hi>

               <p>The eighth evidence of his purpose to practise the Word of God, is the bent of his heart, carrying him on to performe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God doth command all the dayes of his life. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit it be Gods work only to incline the heart unto Gods testimonies, as we see, <hi>v.</hi> 36. yet when God hath made the change, and his childe is content to follow the direction of Gods Word, this inclination of the heart is counted also the mans own work, as here, <hi>I have enclined my heart.</hi> 2. As only hearty ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice pleaseth the Lord, so that only is sincere and constant, which proceeds from the heart: and he who findeth this inclination, hath in himself the witnesse of his sincerity; <hi>I have enclined my heart to perform thy statutes alwayes even to the end.</hi>

               <p>As he gave before evidences of his affection to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and of his purpose to obey it in his practice: so in this section he giveth six evidences of his hatred of the evil, which is contrary to the good, which is promised and commanded in the Scripture. The first evidence is his hatred of the most secret and meanest degrees of actual breaches of the Lords law: and for this protestation he giveth three reasons. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. With earnest love to good, hatred of evil necessarily must be joyned, as the connexion of these duties in several sections doth teach. 2. Every dislike of evil is not sufficient, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred is required of us against all sorts and degrees of sin: <hi>I hate vain thoughts.</hi> 3. All sinful courses in Religion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, (such as are all those that are not warrantable by Gods Word,) are unprofitable, and shall disappoint all those who do follow them; <hi>I hate vaine thoughts.</hi> 4. Hatred of sin is then acceptable to God, when it floweth from the love of Gods Word set down in Scripture: <hi>But thy law do I love.</hi> And this is the first reason of his protestation. 5. The protection and defence which is to be found in God against the evil of trouble, should strengthen the believer in the hatred of the evil of sin, as here it doth: <hi>Thou art my hiding place and my shield:</hi> and this is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reason of his protestation. 6. Faith in Gods Word is the fountain of the hating of sin, and confiding in God; <hi>I hope in thy Word</hi>: and this is the third reason of his protestation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 115.</hi> Depart from me ye evil doers: for I will keep the Commandments of my God.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:50629:115"/>A second evidence of his hatred of sin, is his renouncing all fellowship in sinning with whatsoever person or persons; let them seek Associates where they list, he would have no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with them in the unfruitful works of darknesse. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. He that would eschew sin, must beware to comply with wicked men in their wicked courses, and in this respect must separate from them, not altogether from conversing with them, for then a man must go out of the world, but from fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with them in evil doing: for in this respect is it that he saith, <hi>Depart from me ye evil doers.</hi> 2. Nothing can save a man from complying with sinners, but sincere resolution to keep Covenant and Communion with God, and not to displease him; <hi>For I will keepe the Commandments of my God.</hi>

                  <hi>Vers. 116.</hi> Vphold me according unto thy Word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.</q>
               <p>The third evidence of his hatred of sin, is partly his estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it as a shameful thing, and partly his prayer to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the shame which sin doth draw after it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The believer doth not lean to his own strength, or holy purpose, but is sensible that he shall easily fall into sin, except God preserve spiritual life in him: and therefore he prayeth: <hi>Uphold me that I may live</hi> 2. Albeit a beleever be not able in himself to persevere, yet because of Gods promise to hold up the weak who lean unto him, he may be confident to stand, <hi>Uphold me, according to thy VVord, that I may live.</hi> 3. Sin should therefore be hateful, because it bringeth shame to the sinner of it self, and shameful disappointment of his hoped for felicity; <hi>Uphold me, and let me not be disappointed of my hopes.</hi>

               <p>The fourth evidence of his hatred of sin, is his fear of mischief and perishing, which he cannot eschew, except by Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50629:115"/>
of him in the course of his obedience. <hi>VVhence learn</hi>; 1. The strongest believer is most sensible of his own weaknesse, and most afraid to sin, and most apprehensive of the evil of sinning, and of the good of persevering in the obedience of God: therefore again he prayeeh, <hi>Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe.</hi> 2. Gods preserving a man from sinful courses, giveth great encouragement to him to persevere sincerely in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Gods commands: <hi>Hold thou me up, and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.</hi> 3. The believer may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any duty, provided he take God for the surety of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, who if he be sought unto by prayer, and relied upon in the use of the meanes, will not refuse to inable us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme whatsoever duty we shall undertake; <hi>Hold thou me up, and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>The fifth evidence of his hatred of sin, is his observation of the mischief decreed and begun to be executed against evil doers. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a special meanes to preserve us from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courses, to observe the mischief which followeth thereupon: <hi>Thou hast troden down them that erre from thy statutes.</hi> 2. Only they who fear to sin, do see the evil of other folks sinning, and only they can make good use of Gods judgement on others, who are sensible of the merit of sin, if they should fal into it themselves: for this is the observation of a believer. 3. Albeit the wicked hold their head high, and lift up themselves in their sinful cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against God, yet he hath already trod down many such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and hath decreed to tread down all of that sort: <hi>Thou hast troden down all them, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Not only such as openly and grossely are wicked and prophane, but also all they who please themselves in the by-pathes of their own wandering, and do not care for pleasing of God, shall perish: <hi>Thou hast troden down all them that erre from thy statutes.</hi> 5. Whatsoever be the baits of pleasure, profit and preferment which draw men from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of God, and whatsoever be the excuses, pretences and confidences which do secure the impenitent sinners consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50629:116"/>
all will be found to be selfe-deceit, lies and vanity: <hi>For their deceit is falsehood.</hi> 6. The godly and wicked live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the visible Church, as drosse and good mettal, but God who is the purger of his Church, will not fail by diversity of trials, and judgements to put difference between them, and at last will make a perfect separation of them, and cast away the wicked as refuse: <hi>Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth as drosse.</hi> 7. The destruction of evill doers, as it should make us hate sinne, so should it move us to love the course of holinesse: <hi>Thou puttest the wicked away, therefore I love thy testimonies.</hi>

               <p>The sixth evidence of his hatred of sinne, is the fear he had of Gods threatening, and wrath, and judgements. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. A render heart is easily affected, as with Gods mercies, so also with Gods judgements: <hi>My flesh trembleth.</hi> 2. The godly because of the remainder of sinne in them, and their natural frailty, are not exempted from the sense of the terror of God, yea, it is needfull they be now and then exercised therewith, that so they may be kept in awe, and their joy may be tempered with fear and trembling, and their prayer may be sharpened, and they may be kept watchfull, and so their obedience may be furthered: <hi>My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

Seeing the Lord is obliged to his people by Covenant, to defend his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants against their enemies, and that all things shall turn to their good, the believer hath warrant to imploy God in his need, to interpose himselfe for the relief of his servant, that he be not distressed: <hi>Be surety for thy servant for good, and let not the proud oppresse me.</hi> 2. Before men do turne persecutors of the godly, they forget both God and their own condition, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come proud: <hi>Let not the proud oppresse me.</hi>

               <p>A third reason, because he is like to faint, and to lose hope by the Lords long delaying of delivery. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As men have received a greater measure of faith, so use they to get a greater measure of trial, as here this Champion is suffered to lie in trouble till he be like to sink in it: <hi>Mine eyes faile for thy salvation.</hi> 2. Albeit the words of promise be neither performed, nor like to be performed, yet faith should justifie the promise, for true and faithfull: <hi>Mine eyes faile for the word of thy righteousnesse.</hi>

When tentation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mis-beliefe doth oppose our petition, or the reasons thereof, it is wisdome to resist it, and to assert our interest in the promise, whatsoever be opposed, and to pursue our petition: <hi>I am thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, give me understanding, that</hi> I <hi>may know thy testimonies.</hi>

               <p>The fifth reason of his petition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is because the persecutors were come to the height of sinne, and did stand in no awe of God, or his Word, but rejected it as a thing of nought. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. As sinners grow in sinne till they trample Gods law under their feet, so according as they grow in their sinne, the time of Gods manifesting his justice draweth near; <hi>It is time for thee, Lord, to work.</hi> 2.

               <p>The sixth reason of his petition, is because the more the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors do go about to make Gods law void, the Psalmist was the more zealous for it, loved it, esteemed of it, justified it, and hated whatsoever was contrary to it so much the more. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> The hatred of holinesse and of Gods truth, perceived in the persecutors, should stirre up the love of the godly to the truth so much the more, <hi>Therefore I love thy commandments.</hi> The more that the wicked despise Gods Word, we should esteem the more of it; <hi>I love thy commands above gold, yea, above fine gold.</hi> The more they wrangle, and wrest it in any point, the more should we defend and justifie it in every point; <hi>Therefore I esteem thy precepts concerning all things to be right.</hi> And the more the wicked love wickednesse, we should the more hate it, and all the branches of it; <hi>I hate every false way.</hi>

Word of God, and in a vehement passion of love toward it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the Word of God in Scripture is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in it selfe, and wonderfull in the operations thereof so when it is best seen, it is most admired, and every new looking upon it, raiseth new admiration of it: <hi>Thy testimonies are wonderfull.</hi> 2.

Albeit the Word of God in Scripture be full of high mysteries, yet (which is indeed wonderfull) it may be read with profit by simple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or any who desire knowledge; and it is so plaine to every one who will be Gods disciple, as it giveth light and direction presently to the reader, in the maine points of salvation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duties: <hi>The entrance of thy word giveth light.</hi> 5.

Common and ordinary affection, or desire after the saving knowledge of the Scripture, is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but affection earnestly bended, is necessary according as the excellency of the wisdome in it doth require: <hi>I opened my mouth, and panted.</hi> 8.

               <p>Unto this profession of his estimation and affection unto the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50629:118"/>
Scripture, he subjoyneth four petitions for the right use and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof. The first is the sense of that mercy which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and usually bestowed upon such as love the Lord. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord bestoweth but short glimpse of his favour and reconciliation on his servants, that they may finde their need to have that sense often renewed unto them: <hi>Look thou upon me, and be mercifull unto me.</hi> 2. As it is a mark of Gods child to finde in himselfe love of Gods Name, so it is a mark put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to be visited by God with glimpse of kindnesse, and mercy to him: <hi>Look upon me, and be mercifull unto me, as thou usest to do to them that love thy Name.</hi> 3. As it is good to mark Gods usual dealing with his own children, so it is good to study conformity with Gods children in our affection to God, that we may sinde conformity with them in consolation, for so doth the Psalmist here. 4. It is wisdome for us not to affect singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of divine dispensations toward us, but to be content to be dealt with as others of Gods children before us have been dealt with: <hi>Be mercifull to me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy Name.</hi>

               <p>The second petition is for sanctification of his actions, and for mortification of sinne. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit we have the Word of God for our perfect rule, yet we have need that God should fit us, and strengthen us to the obedience of it: <hi>Order my stepts in thy word.</hi> Albeit by nature we are ignorant and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, uncertaine and unstable in the way of Gods obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet in the sense of our sinne and weaknesse, we may pray to God with confidence to be heard; <hi>Direct, order, and establish my steps in thy word</hi>: for so much the Word in the Original doth import. 3. Albeit by nature we are slaves to sinne, and any sinne may bring us in subjection, yet when in the sense of our weaknesse, we have recourse to God to be helped, we may pray with hope to be heard: <hi>Let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:50629:119"/>The third petition is for delivery from the oppression of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, that they be not able to drive us from the belief and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Gods Word. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Beside the body of sinne and inward tentations, the godly have the persecution of the wicked without to drive them from Gods service, as this prayer doth import. 2. When the Lords servants in the sense of their weaknesse, do seek help against persecutors, he both can and will deliver them either by breaking the yoke of the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, or by giving strength to them to bear out in holy obedience of Gods Word, under the burthen: <hi>Deliver me from the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of man.</hi> 3. The end of our seeking to be free from bodily bondage and trouble from men should be, that we may serve God the more chearfully: <hi>Deliver me, so will I keep thy statutes.</hi>

               <p>The fourth petition is for spiritual consolation, and increase of sanctification. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the sense of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to us may be withdrawn for a time, yet the right which we have to God reconciled to us in Christ, may bear us out in the hope of having it renewed unto us in his service: <hi>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant.</hi> 2. Because the Lord useth, with the light of consolation, to give also the light of direction in duties we should seek both, and wait for both from the Lord: <hi>Make thy face to shine, and teach me thy statutes.</hi> 3. As there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Gods manifesting of his favour, and degrees of profiting in the obedience of Gods Word: so should we seek the increase of both, and no measure received should hinder the seeking of a greater measure, as the often repeating of the same petitions in effect doth shew: <hi>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant, and teach me thy statutes.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>He addeth a reason to this last petition, because it grieved him much to see God dishonoured by them among whom he lived, and to see them, by not obeying Gods statutes, draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50629:119"/>
themselves Gods wrath. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. He who is sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for dipleasure and dishonour done to God, may look to be comforted by God, as the connexion of this reason with the former petition doth teach. 2. True zeal is so farre from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenge of personal injuries received by persecutors, as it can pitty their miserable case, and mourn for them: <hi>Rivers of waters runne down mine eyes, because they keep not thy Law.</hi> 3. Godly affections are larger then bodily expressions can set forth and that which bodily expressions do set forth, signifieth a will to vent much more then the body could furnish. <hi>Rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters runne down mine eyes, because they keep not thy Law.</hi>

                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:50629:120"/>The second reason of the petition is, because the testimonies of Scripture which God hath commanded us to believe and obey, are not only righteous but also very faithfull, which can never faile a man that believeth and obeyeth them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. To the end that our faith and obedience may be solidly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we must hold for a foundation, that the Scriptures are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and true, and that every truth revealed therein, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a command to believe it; and every duty of men declared therein, includeth a command to obey it: <hi>Thy testimonies which thou hast commanded, are righteous, and very faithfull.</hi> 2. It is needfull for a believer to labour to have the impression of the truth, and righteousnesse of the Word of God in Scripture stamped on his own heart by freequent meditation, and acknowledgement thereof, as the Psalmists example here doth teach us.</p>

               <p>The third reason of the petition is, because his zeal to the commands of God was so great, as the opposition which his enemies made unto them, did torment him, and such zeal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired growing knowledge. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Zeal had great need of sound knowledge, that it misccary not, and he that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth zeal kindled in his breast, should labour to informe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe well, as the Psalmist doth, <hi>v.</hi> 144. and here: <hi>My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy word.</hi> 2.

               <p>The fifth reason of his petition is, because the Word of God held up his heart, and comforted him against all the contempt of men. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

The righteousnesse which God hath devised and set down in his Word to justifie sinfull men, is an everlasting righteousnesse, even the righteousnesse by faith in Jesus Christ, borne witnesse unto by the Law and the Prophets: <hi>Thy righteousnesse is an everlasting righteousnesse, and thy Law is truth.</hi> 3.

This is the main Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in all the Word of God, to teach men concerning everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteousnesse, or how a man is justified before God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this again repeated, <hi>Thy righteousnesse,</hi> or, <hi>the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy testimonies is everlasting.</hi> 2. The belief or saving understanding of this Doctrine bringeth eternal life to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: and for this end being joyned as the last reason with the former seven reasons, it should make a man seek to grow in the faith, or in the saving knowledge of the testimonies of God set down in his Word: <hi>Give me understanding, and I shall live.</hi>

               <p>In this section he falleth on another maine petition unto God, for restoring unto him, and encreasing in him the vigour of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life by his Word, <hi>v.</hi> 149. and to presse this petition he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth foure arguments, some going before, some following after it. The first argument hath foure branches; the first is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had prayed earnestly before for quickening of him, that so he might be enabled to serve God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When the world is crying, Who will shew us any good thing? this man wishing for pleasure, and that man for riches, and he for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and he for preferment, the Lords children should be seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace to serve God, as the Psalmist did: <hi>I cried with my whole heart, hear me, O Lord, and I will keep thy statutes.</hi> 2. When the conscience can bear witnesse of hearty seeking of grace to serve God, the Supplicant may confidently call for, and expect comfortable quickening of his spirit unto Gods service, as the comparison of this verse with the 149. verse doth shew. 3. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever spiritual grace we seek of God, we should seek it ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly: for if we seek it, so as if we did not regard whether we obtained our request or not, such seeking should under-value the grace which we seek; <hi>I cried with my whole heart.</hi>

               <p>Another branch of the argument is, because he did not pray for delivery out of his trouble, for satisfaction of his natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, but that he might give further proof of his purpose to obey
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50629:122"/>

               <p>A third branch of the argument is, because out of hope to finde the fruit of Gods promises, he had been early about the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of prayer. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Prayer should be earnestly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and with no small diligence in using of the meanes, specially of prayer, so the Lords children come by their holy desires, as here we see; <hi>I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried.</hi> 2. Looking unto the Word doth furnish faith and hope, and faith and hope do furnish prayer, or else the Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant might soon faint: <hi>I cried, I hoped in thy Word.</hi>

               <p>A fourth branch of the argument is, because when his nights rest was broken by troubles, he did meditate on Gods Word: when his persecutors were securely sleeping. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The difficultie wherein the Lords children are cast many times, doth bereave them of their nights rest: <hi>Mine eyes prevent the night-watches.</hi> 2. The time which solicitude doth take from our sleep, is to be spent upon prayer and meditation of Gods Word, and not upon perplexing thoughts: <hi>Mine eyes prevent the night-watches, that I might meditate in thy VVord.</hi>

Word, wherein he giveth a second reason of this his prayer, taken from Gods kindnesse expressed in his promises. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. Albeit a man had no special promise of help in a particular exercise of trouble, yet the consideration of Gods mercy and loving kindnesse, manifested in general in his Word, is a sufficient ground to strengthen his hope to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Hear my voice, according to thy loving kindnesse; O quicken me according to thy judgements.</hi> 2. As the feeling of spiritual dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth argue life and sense in Gods children, so doth it fit a man for renewed influence, and sense of spiritual life: <hi>O Lord, qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
               <p>The third reason of his petition is, because his enemies were ready to do him a mischief, and were far from regarding Gods law, but he believed God was the more n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar to deliver him, and that his Word was true, and therefore he desireth renewed vigour of spiritual life. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The more near that danger is, the more ground of confidence have Gods children in their danger, to call and hope for the influence of his Spirit: <hi>They draw near that follow after mischief.</hi> 2. The further the enemies of the godly are from Gods law, and the nearer they are to do a mischief, the nearer are Gods children to finde the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the life of God; <hi>They draw near that follow after mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, they are far from thy law.</hi> 3. For the consolation of a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer for righteousnesse, it is necessary to believe Gods readiness to deliver him, and to believe the truth of Gods Word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his cause is justified; for the following of Gods command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a pledge of Gods assisting of him, and delivery also, no lesse then a promise: <hi>Thou art near, and all thy Commandments are</hi>

                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:50629:123"/>A fourth reason of the petition is because he had long since expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the everlasting stability of Gods testimonies, and therfore craveth to be quickned according to them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

As no trouble or tentation should drive us from the obedience of Gods Word, so the more closely we adhere to the Word in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more may we be assured to be delivered: <hi>Deliver me, for I do not forget thy law.</hi>

                  <hi>Ver. 154.</hi> Plead my cause, and deliver me: quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me according to thy Word.</q>
               <p>He urgeth the same petition, and insinuateth a second reason
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50629:123"/>
for it, from the Lords engagement by his Word, to be Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for him, to deliver him, and to quicken him. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1 Albeit the godly under persecution have a good cause, yet they cannot plead it, except God their Redeemer shew himself as Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for them: therefore prayeth the Psalmist, <hi>Plead my cause.</hi> 2. When God the Redeemer pleadeth a mans cause, he doth it to purpose really and effectually: <hi>Plead my cause, and deliver me.</hi> 3. Except the Lords Clients shall finde new influence from God from time to time in their troubles, they are but as dead men in their exercise: for, <hi>Quieken me,</hi> importeth this. 4. Till we find lively encouragement given to us in trouble, we must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Word of promise: <hi>Quicken me according to thy Word.</hi> 5. What the believer hath need of, that God hath not only a will to supply, but also an office to attend it, and power to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate it, as here he hath the office of an <hi>Advocate,</hi> and of a powerful <hi>Redeemer</hi> also, wherein the believer may confidently give him daily employment, as he needeth; <hi>Plead my cause, and deliver me, quicken me according to thy Word.</hi>

               <p>A third reason of his petition of delivery is, because the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who misregard Gods commands when they fal into trouble, are far from delivery. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The wicked have neither rght to salvation, nor to temporal delivery from trouble when they fall into it; <hi>Salvation is far from the wicked.</hi> 2. It is the mark of a wicked person to misregard, or not to care to know and obey Gods Word: <hi>Salvation is far from the wicked, for they seek not thy statutes.</hi> 3. Salvation is near to those that make conscience to obey Gods Word, how strait soever their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition shall seem, for so much doth the force of this reason im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>

                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:50629:124"/>A fourth reason of his petition is, because Gods tender mercies are great, and therefore the Psalmist may expect the influence of life till he be delivered. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When the godly do think or speak of the damnable condition of the wicked, they should not be senselesse of their own deserving, nor of Gods grace, which hath made the difference between the wicked and them; <hi>Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord.</hi> 2. As the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Lord, which are the fountain of all the benefits which the believer doth ask, are very excellent in themselves: so are they in the estimation of the believer, when he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon them: they are many and mother-like, tender and great; <hi>Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord.</hi> 3. Spiritual life is subject to often fainting, and hath need frequently to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and restored by the believers looking on the promise, and presenting of his case unto God on the one hand, and by Gods granting of the petition on the other hand: <hi>Quicken me according to thy judgements.</hi>

               <p>A fifth reason of his petition is, because he had many perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and yet did adhere to Gods Word. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As it is no strange thing to see the godliest men exposed most to persecution; so it is no small measure of grace which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth on them, to bear out the truth against all opposition; <hi>Many are my persecutors and mine enemies, yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.</hi> 2. He who continueth in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Word against persecution, may expect sustenance and consolation in his trouble, and delivery out of it: for this is the force of the reason.</p>

               <p>A sixth reason of his petition is, because he was sorrowful to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50629:124"/>
see his enemies provoke God by their transgressions. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. Anger, grief, indignation and loathing (which the word in the original doth bear) are lawful in Gods quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin; <hi>I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved, because they kept not thy word.</hi> 2. He who is affected with grief, anger and vexation for Gods cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he seeth God provoked by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors, may expect consolation and strength to himself in the defence of Gods cause, as the force of the reason doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>

               <p>A seventh reason of his petition is, because he did sincerely love the Lords Word, and therefore expected to be quickened in the sense of Gods kindnesse. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a mark of true zeal for God, which floweth from love of the Lords Word, and he who findeth this mark in himself, may offer it to God for a proof of his sincerity; <hi>Consider how I love thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</hi> 2. He who can approve his love to Gods Word, and his zeal for God to be sincere, may expect consolation and strength from God in his need, as the reason doth prove. 3. So oft as we finde deadnesse in our spirits, so oft should we run to Gods kindnesse, the fountain of life to repaire it: <hi>Quicken me, O Lord, according to thy loving kindnesse.</hi>

               <p>The eighth reason of his petition is, because the Word of God, and every part of it, according whereunto he craved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and delivery out of his trouble, was true and unchangeable for ever. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such is the excellency of the Word of God, as neither it can be sufficiently commended, nor the believer satisfie himself in commmendation thereof, as this among many commendations doth testifie. 2. Truth, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50629:125"/>
all truth is the short summe of the whole Scripture, from the beginning to the ending of it nothing but truth; nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in it but righteousnesse: <hi>Thy Word is true from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and every one of thy righteous judgements endure for ever.</hi> 3. He who foundeth his prayer for comfort and delivery on the rock of Gods faithful and righteous Word, may be sure to obtain his request: as the force of this reason doth evidence.</p>

               <p>In this section, he taketh comfort by six approved evidences of saving grace felt in himself, which he presenteth unto God to be sealed by him. The first evidence is his adherence to the obedience of faith, notwithstanding of his being persecuted by Princes. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a sore tentation when the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are persecuted for righteousnesse by their Governours, by whom they should be encouraged and defended, and yet this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the godly is no strange matter: <hi>Princes have persecuted me without a cause.</hi> 2. As it is an ease, and a piece of comfort to the godly, that they have not deserved persecution: so their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency is an aggravation of the sin of the persecutor, as here; <hi>They have persecuted me without a cause.</hi> 3. There is no means to save us from sinning for fear of men, but the fear of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of the Almighty; <hi>But my heart standeth in awe of thy word,</hi> which is all one as to stand in awe of God. 4. To bear out persecution of Princes, out of respect to the obedience of Gods Word, and fear to offend God, is a mark of saving grace, as here it is brought forth.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 162.</hi> I rejoyce at thy Word: as one that findeth great spoile.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:50629:125"/>The seeond evidence of saving grace in him, is a greater joy felt in Gods Word, then in any thing in the world, yea, such a joy, as the greatest joy of worldly men, is but a shadowing si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. He that feareth to offend God more then he feareth to fall into any worldly inconvenience, may rejoyce in the obedience of faith more then in any worldly advantage, as the experience of the Psalmist doth teach, who saith; <hi>My heart stood in awe of thy Word, when Princes did persecute me,</hi> and subjoyneth, <hi>I rejoyce in thy Word, as one that findeth great spoile.</hi> 2. The joy of a believer, which he findeth in the obedience of faith, is so great, as the joy which a Victor in battel doth finde in the spoile of his defeated enemies, which is but a shadow of it, albeit the joy of delivery from death, the joy of victory, the joy of riches, honour and peace, and ease are joyned in the Victors breast altogether on a sudden: <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced at thy Word, as one that findeth great spoile.</hi> 3. The jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of fear to offend God, and joy in obedience of him, is a mark of a gracious spirit, as the Psalmists producing of it as a mark of grace in him maketh evident.</p>

               <p>The third evidence of saving grace in the Psalmist, is his joynt hating and abhorring of all sin, and loving of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods Word. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the speaking of untruth, or concealing of truth which should be confessed, is a lying; so every controvening of professed obedience unto Gods Word, is a work of lying and self-deceiving, which a beleever should hate and eschew: <hi>I hate and abhor lying.</hi> 2. Slight ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of a sinful course, is not sufficient to guard a man against it: for where the enmity is not great, the mans agreement with sin may soon be made, but such abhorring and deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of sin is required, as cannot admit reconciliation: <hi>I hate and abhor lying.</hi> 3.

                  </gap>ing and abhorring of all sin arising from, and joyned with the love of Gods Word, is a solid mark of saving grace: for abhorring of some sin, and of all sin, for temporary reasons, may prove unsound; but this is sincerity, when a man can say, <hi>I hate and abhor lying, but thy Law do I love.</hi>

               <p>The fourth evidence of saving grace in the Psalmist, is the frequent admiration of the goodnesse of God to man, set forth in Gods Word, with hearty praising of God for it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the studying of the Word of God bringeth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to see his own blessednesse revealed in it: so it bringeth him also to admire and praise God for that and for all his righteousnesse declared in it: <hi>Seven times a day do I praise thee, because of thy righteous judgements.</hi> 2.

               <p>For confirmation of the former marks of saving grace, he commendeth the love of Gods Word, by two notable effects; One is, that it bringeth a glorious peace with it: Another is, that it maketh a man hold on the way of Gods obedience, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever impediments or stumbling blocks shall be cast in his way. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. The receiving of the truth of God in love, giveth great peace, peace passing understanding: for the law of works doth shew a mans debt and danger, and the beleever sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth lovingly to the justice thereof: and the law of saving faith sheweth remission of sin, righteousnesse and eternal life through the Messiah Jesus Christ, and the beleever embraceth the offer heartily: and the law of new obedience directeth the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified man how to go on to the full possession of blessednesse, and the believer doth heartily take on this holy yoke upon him, and so he walketh as a man reconciled with God, and at peace with him: <hi>Great peace have they who love thy law.</hi> 2. Albeit there
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50629:126"/>
be many stumbling blocks and impediments to divert the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, from the obedience of Gods Word, arising from the terrour and allurements of the world, from the troubles and exercises of the godly, from the scandals given by Professors, and such like, yet the love of Gods Word is able to carry a man strait on his way to heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without stumbling or turning aside to the one hand or the other: <hi>Great peace have they who love thy law, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall offend them.</hi>

               <p>The fifth evidence of saving grace in the Psalmist is, the conscience of his sound faith and obedience. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Sound hope of salvation is joyned with the care of keeping the Commandments: for he who hath this hope purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he may be holy: <hi>Lord, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy Commandments.</hi> 2. As none can have heart or hand to keep Gods commands, except he have hope to be helped out of every trouble wherinto he may fall, and to be fully saved at last: so he who hath the hope of salvation, hath great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto obedience, and where the conjunction of these two are found, the man hath evidence of saving grace, and boldness to go to God in this confidence, as the Psalmist doth; <hi>Lord, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

               <p>The sixth evidence of saving grace is, the approved testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his conscience concerning the sincerity of his heart, and that after a new examination of the soundnesse of former marks, which here are looked upon over again, and presented to God with other three marks of sincerity, to wit, spiritualness in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, exceeding love to the VVord, and daily walking as in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50629:127"/>
the sight of God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. After a believer hath found marks of saving grace in himself, it is wisdome for him to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine these marks over again, whether they be in him indeed and in truth or not: for if they be indeed in him, how weak soever they be, and albeit joyned with imperfections, if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the perfection of the moral law, yet will they beare weight in the balance of the Gospel, (where any measure of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse passeth for perfection,) as here the example of the Psalmist doth teach. 2. Where the soul, or the renewed part of the man is for the obedience of faith, there is a sincere keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the commands: <hi>My soule hath kept thy testimonies.</hi> 3. VVhere the love to Gods VVord, and the obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of exceedeth the mans love to any thing which might divert him, there is a sincerity in keeping of the VVord; <hi>I love thy testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies exceedingly.</hi> 4. As the looking alwayes unto Gods all-seeing eye, is a special meanes to make a man keep his commands: so the conscience of his endeavour so to do, testifieth sincerity; <hi>I have kept thy Precepts and thy Testimonies: for all my wayes are before thee.</hi>

               <p>In this last section, he closeth all the former sweet meditations, and comfortable expressions concerning his faith and love, and the fruits thereof, with five petitions. The first is, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of saving knowledge of the Scriptures. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Nothing is so necessary to be sought of God as practical knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby a man may know how to behave himself toward God and man in every estate, according to the rule of Scripture; <hi>Give me understanding according to thy word.</hi> 2. If God delay to answer us in this petition or any other, or seem to hide himself from us, let us follow hard after him with earnest supplication, as the Psalmist teacheth us; <hi>Let my cry come near
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50629:127"/>
before thee, O Lord.</hi> 3. The promises of Gods Word are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to give us breath in crying, and hope to have a good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and patience till it come: <hi>Give me understanding accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy Word.</hi>

               <p>The next petition is, for deliverance out of his trouble. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the believer is not exempted from trouble, but rather engaged to bear the crosse, till he come to the crown, yet is he priviledged to have accesse to God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for comfort, strength and deliverance from it; <hi>Let my sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication come before thee: deliver me according to thy Word.</hi> 2. The believer craveth nothing but what is promised, and as that may, so it doth satisfie him: <hi>Deliver me according to thy Word.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>He strengthens his hope in these two prayers, by a promise of thankfulness for any measure of a gracious answer. <hi>Whence learn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1. As the end of our petitions should be that we may be enabled to praise God really, so the use of granting of our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions should be thanks and praise; <hi>My lips shall utter thy praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.</hi> 2. Thanksgiving in words doth best beseem the man, who indeed is obedient in his life unto God: and as no man can obey God in his deeds, but he that is taught of God, so he that is taught of God to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey in deeds, may well promise upon that condition, to praise God in words also: <hi>My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.</hi> 3. To teach others the wayes of God, requireth that we our selves be taught of God; <hi>When thou hast taught me thy statutes, my tongue shall speak of thy Word.</hi> 4. There is no ground of edifying our selves and others, and of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50629:128"/>
glorifying of God, but from the Word of the Lord: <hi>My tongue shall speak of thy Word.</hi> 5. True righteousness is to be found only in the Word of God; and nothing is approved in it, nor recommended to us by it, save righteousnesse only, which should move us thy more to study it our selves, and then to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to others: <hi>For all thy Commandments are righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>A third petition is for assistance in trouble, till God should send full delivery to him, whereof three reasons are subjoyned: One, from his making choice of the Word above all earthly things: Another, from his longing and expecting of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance according to it: And the third, is from his delight in the Word. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As they who are resolved to serve God may be sure of opposition, and of adversaries, and of trouble from them: so may they be perswaded to finde Gods help in all their troubles against adversaries, for this much is imported in those words, <hi>Let thy hand help me.</hi> 2.

                  </gap>beit allurements to divert the believer from Gods obedience, be offered unto him, yet must he reject them, and deliberately prefer Gods obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them all: for thus much is imported in the Psalmists practice: <hi>For I have chos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He who hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred obedience to the baits of sin, and hath resolved rather to suffer then to sin, may look for Gods assistance to sustain him in his trouble, that he shall never have cause to repent him of his choice: <hi>Help me, for I have chosen thy Precepts.</hi> 4. Albeit it be natural to seek deliverance out of trouble, yet it is proper to the godly to love no deliverance but such as God sendeth by his owne meanes in his own time, and in this minde to wait for this sort of deliverance in the way of Gods obedience; <hi>For I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord,</hi> was the Psalmists way to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. 5. The beleever is not comfortlesse in his trouble, he hath his own spiritual comfort, pleasure and delight in Gods truth or in God manifested therein; <hi>Thy Law is my delight,</hi> saith the Psalmist in trouble.</p>

               <p>A fourth petition is, for continuation of his life for honouring of God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the godly have no will to fall into the hands of men, or to lose their life by murtherers: so do they not love life, but for further glorifying of God: <hi>Let my soule live, and it shall praise thee.</hi> 2. Whosoever have a design to honour God in their life, which design they have not as yet attained, may lawfully pray for prolonging their life a while; <hi>Let my soule live, and it shall praise thee.</hi> 3. As the Word of God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced sentence already for the sustaining of his suffering servants, and for taking order with their persecutors: so accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly may the godly pray and expect to be helped; <hi>Let thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments help me.</hi>

               <p>The fifth and last petition is, that the Lord would recal the Psalmist, now being a banished exile, and bring him home to the communion of his people, as a wandring sheep is brought home to the flock by a kindly shepherd. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the beleever is alwayes a pilgrim in his affection toward this earth: so also he may be corporally banished from his native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and thrust out f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit the banished beleever be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the fellowship of the Church, and from his friends, yet not from communion with God the good shepherd, who heareth the bleating of the poor wandering sheep whereever it be, and will take care of it, and seek it out: <hi>Seek thy servant,</hi> saith the exile Psalmist unto the Lord. 3. The way for the beleever to keep communion with God in his trouble of banishment or whatsoever other trouble, is to remember the direction of God in his Word, for going on in the way of faith and obedience, and he may assure himself that the good shepherd shall not forget
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50629:129"/>

Nothing can satisfie faith, except the alsufficiency of God, who made heaven and earth of nothing, and can give help where there is no appearance of relief: <hi>My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.</hi>

That which commendeth a place most of any thing, is the erecting of the Lords banner of love in it, and making it a place for his people, to meet together for his worship; <hi>Ierusalem is a city whither the tribes go up.</hi> 3. Whatsoever civil distinction Gods children have among themselves, and howsoever they dwell scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in several places of the earth, yet as they are the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they should entertain a communion and conjunction among themselves as members of one universal Church, as the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the peoples meeting thrice in the year at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> did teach: <hi>Whither the tribes did go up, the tribes of the Lord,</hi> 4. As the tribes, so all particular Churches, how farre

soever scattered, have one Lord, one Covenant, one Law and Scripture, signified by the tribes going up to <hi>the testimony of Israel,</hi> or to the Ark of the Covenant or testimony, where the whole ordinances of God were to be exercised 5. The end of the ordinances of God, of holy covenanting and communion, and joyning in publick worship, is to acknowledge the grace and goodnesse of God, and to glorifie him: for the tribes did go up <hi>to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.</hi> 6. The Church of God wanteth not the one Government and Governours, Courts and Judicatories, belonging to Christ and his Church, as the erecting of Ecclesiastick Judicatories in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> did signifie and teach: <hi>for there are set thrones of judgement.</hi> 7.

none can pray for the welfare of the Church heartily, except they love her: so none shall love her and seek her welfare, but shall fare the better for it; for it is promised here, <hi>They shall prosper that love thee.</hi> 3.

Peace within the Church is no lesse needfull, then prosperity within it; and if peace be within the Church, it matters the lesse what enemies she have without: <hi>Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces,</hi> doth import or insinuate so much. 5. All the members of the Church militant, should be affected one to another, as brethren, as fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-partners in losse and gaine; for the relation which they have to one Father the Lord, and one Mother the Universal Church: <hi>For my brethren, and companions sake, I will now say, Peace be within thee.</hi> 6.

            </q>
            <p>From the Psalmists addresse unto God, by this short prayer, under the oppression of the Church; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The force of prayer doth not consist in multitude of words, but in faith, and fervent laying forth of desires before the Lord, as here we see. 2. It is not strange to see Gods children oppressed, and despised, and destitute of all relief, except of what may be expected from heaven, as this case here set down sheweth. 3. Albeit the Lord seem to hide himselfe from all manifestation of his kinde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects unto his people on earth, yet he will be found in heaven, and there must we betake our selves in hardest straites: <hi>Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.</hi> 4. The very lifting up of the bodily eye of the believer towards God in his trouble, hath its own use and force with God. <hi>Unto thee lift I up mine eyes.</hi> 5. As servants of old were in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition slaves, deprived of the common comfort of liberty, might wear no weapons, were exposed to all injuries, and had no help or comfort, except the favour of their Master or Mistresse: so fares it oft-times with the believer for his outward condition, as the similitude and present case of the Church here teacheth: <hi>Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their Masters.</hi> 6. It is fitting that the persecuted believer have a low estimation of himself before God, be patient under his hand, submissive to his dispensation, and hopefull of help in his addresse unto God: for so much the similitude from servants behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their master and mistresse doth teach: <hi>As the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistresse, so our eyes wait upon the Lord.</hi> 7. The interest which the believer hath in God under any relation, hath comfort sufficient included in it, as here the Lords being <hi>Master,</hi> is sufficient to sweeten bondage of <hi>servant,</hi> and <hi>handmaid,</hi> but Covenant-interest sweeteneth it much more: <hi>Our eyes are upon the Lord our God.</hi> 8. As masters and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses are taught to shew pitty, mercy, bounty, and protection unto their servants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the one hand, and servants are here taught on the other hand, by their good behaviour, not to marre their
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50629:134"/>
favour: so the believer is taught to behave himselfe before God, as a <hi>servant</hi> indeed, by endeavouring indeed to obey God. 9. The terme of the Saints patience and waiting, is till God shew mercy: <hi>Behold, as the eyes of the servants, &amp;c. so our eyes wait on the Lord our God, until that he have mercy on us.</hi>

            <p>In the acknowledgment of their wonderful delivery, the Psalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist doth shew that their adversaries on the one hand, were so strong, so many, so crafty, so cruel &amp; malicious, and the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the other hand were so weak, and so destitute of all counsell and help, that their deliverance could be ascribed to no cause, save to Gods strong power assisting his own. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

After we are delivered out of a

Men in the state of nature are ready to be party adversaries unto the Church: <hi>If the Lord had not been on our side, when men rose up against us.</hi> 5. The wicked have an appetite after the blood of Gods people, as wilde beasts have after their prey: <hi>Then they had swallowed us up quick.</hi> 6.

            <p>From the first encouragement to trust in God in the time of trial; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. There is no service more acceptable to God, or more profitable to us, then glorifying of God by faith in him, when tentations do assault us, as the professing of the duty, and motives which are used here do teach us. 2. Seeing the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of the believer is so established that he cannot misse of it, he may the more chearfully hazard in God service all things temporal and moveable, trusting in the Lord: <hi>They that trust in the Lord, shall he as mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</hi> 3. The preservation of the believer, and the stability of his blessednesse, floweth not from any strength in himselfe, but from the Lords guarding of him: <hi>As the mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aines are round about Ierusalem, so the Lord is round about his people.</hi>

            <p>From the second encouragement of the beleever to trust in God in the time of trial; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. No promise made to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, must secure him from being exercised with trouble, but rather must fore-warne him of, and fore-arme him against trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for here it is presupposed he may be burthened by <hi>the rod of the wicked.</hi> 2. It is a sore trial for the godly, to have their Rulers their persecutors for righteousnesse, but this exercise shall not last long: <hi>For the rod</hi> (which is the signe of power) <hi>of the wicked, shall not rest on the lot of the righteous.</hi> 3. Because there is hazard lest the believer should faint in trouble, therefore the Lord will not trie his own who believe in him above their strength, but will give them a deliverance that they may escape: <hi>The rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</hi>

            <p>In the thanksgiving the mercy is magnified; First, because it was above all their expectation, <hi>v.</hi> 1.

Whosoever be the instruments of the delivery and consolation of the Church, the Lord will so order matters as he shall be seen to be the worker of the work himself; therefore

is it said here; <hi>When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> 3.

There is a special eminencie of the Lords working for his people, above what he worketh for the rest of the world in governing of them: <hi>The Lord hath done great things,</hi> say both the heathen and the Church. 8. There is this great difference between the praise which the heathen are forced to give to God, and that which the Lords people heartily offer unto him: the one doth speak as having no interest nor share in the mercy; the other do speak as they to whom the mercy is intended, and wherein they have their portion with others: <hi>He hath done great things for them,</hi> say the heathen: but, <hi>he hath done great things for us,</hi> say the Lords people.</p>

            <p>From the prayer; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The offer and opportunity given of a mercy, is one benefit: and the embracing of the offer, and taking the opportunity to make use of it, is another benefit: many have the one who receive not the other, as many had the liberty of returning from the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who made no use thereof, but did prefer the ease and pleasures of <hi>Babylon,</hi> unto the prerogatives of <hi>Zion,</hi> as this prayer importeth. 2.

            <p>In these two verses, we have the objection made against his prayer, from the conscience of his sins, according to the law, and his answer unto the objection from the mercy of God, according to the grounds of the Gospel; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Sin furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ground to all our vexations, and tentations, and objections made against our prayers, our comfort and our faith: as the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Psalmist doth teach us, against whom his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here stood up; to hinder his answer from God. 2. In the case of conscience wherein sin is justly charged upon us, there is no shift for us to deny or excuse sin: it must be confessed and laid open before God, as the Psalmist doth here. 3. If the Lord should deal with Supplicants in the way of strict justice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of the Law or Covenant of works, no man could escape condemnation and the curse; <hi>If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?</hi> that is, no man should stand. 4. He who is fled for refuge unto Gods mercy, according to the Covenant of grace in Christ Jesus, may decline judgement according to the Covenant of works, and betake him unto the way of Justification by faith, according to the Covenant of grace, whereby remission of sin is promised to the beleever; <hi>If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? but there is forgiveness with thee.</hi> 5. The belief of Gods mercifulnesse doth open our mouth in prayer, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth us unto the hearty worship, service and obedience of God, whereunto otherwise we could never have heart nor hand: <hi>But forgivenesse is with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</hi> 6. Then is grace and mercy in God rightly made use of, when we feare to offend God, so much the more as we believe him to be gracious, to forgive the penitent Supplicant; <hi>Forgivenesse is with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</hi>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50629:145"/>
not haughtie.</hi> 2. He who will approve himself in his humility unto God, must purge his heart as the fountain from pride, and his eyes and outward carriage also, that they be not the signes and tokens of pride, and watch over his actions, that they go not without the bounds of his calling, and commission given to him in Gods Word: <hi>Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I exercise my self in great matters, or in things too high for me</hi> 3 Albeit the most excellent of men are but witless, weak and unclean things, comparable to young children lately weaned from the breasts, yet it is the property of the godly to know this, and acknowledge himself to be <hi>as a childe that is weaned of his mother.</hi> 4.

The godly must not look to be satisfied in their childish will and appetite, but must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to be deprived of their carnal comforts, which naturally they most affect, as a childe weaned is put from the breast to a more hard diet, this doth the comparison import. 6. The humble man must be content to be handled and dealt with as the Lord pleaseth, and to submit himself absolutely unto Gods dispensation, must depend upon his care and favour, and wait for the manifesting of it, when and how it shall please God to dispose, and this most of all doth prove humility; <hi>My soule is even as a weaned childe.</hi> 7. The peace and quiet comfort of humility is such, as the humble man from his own experience may encourage every man to follow that way, with confidence to finde the benefit of it: for, <hi>Let Israel hope in the Lord,</hi> saith the Psalmist here from his own experience. 8. The servant of God who desireth to persevere to the end, must wait on God in the way of humility, and hope in him unto the end: <hi>Let Israel hope in the Lord, from hence forth and for ever.</hi>

            <p>From this doctrine we may have the description, both of a proud man, and of an humble. He is a proud man, who being ignorant or insensible of his sinfulnesse and infirmities, doth lift up himself in some vaine confidence, to follow some unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable course, for satisfying his own minde, and will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself unto Gods dispensation. Again, he is an humble man, who in the sense of his sins and infirmities standeth in awe of God, keepeth himself within the bounds of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and commission, renounceth all confidence in his own wit,

               <p>From the whole Psalme in general; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. There is a perpetual Kingdom and Priesthood, appointed to be established
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50629:146"/>
among the people of God in his Church, as the prayer given to the Church, to be applied and made use of in all ages, doth give us to understand, and this is the Kingdom and Priesthood of Christ. 2. As the evident appearing of this Kingdome and Priesthood of Christ, should be dear to the hearts of all Gods children, so should supplication daily be made to God, that this his Kingdome may come, with its own blessing following upon it, as the Church is taught here.</p>

            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 1.</hi> LORD, remember David, <hi>and</hi> all his afflictions.</q>
            <p>In the first petition; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Seeing the Covenant made with <hi>David,</hi> especially concerning sure mercies, was known mainly to belong to Christ, and to concern the Church and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very member thereof; it is wisdom for the Church in all ages to look to their interest in this Covenant, and to hold up before God the memory and use thereof, as here the Church is taught to do: <hi>Lord remember David,</hi> that is, remember the Covenant made with <hi>David</hi> in type, and with Christ represented by him. 2. Albeit the Lord can properly forget nothing, yet he is said to remember, when he by effectual working testifieth his not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting; this is the remembrance which the Saints do here pray for; <hi>Lord remember David.</hi> 3. The Covenant made with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and with Christ, consisteth well with afflictions probatory on <hi>Davids</hi> part, and expiatory on Christs part, and neither the one sort nor the other wanted their own respects with God, but Christs afflictions being redemptory and meritorious, are most to be heeded by the Church; <hi>Remember David, and all his afflictions.</hi> 4. Whatsoever care the godly have to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Gods honour, whatsoever grief and sorrow they bear when they finde opposition, or want successe in this their endeavour, whatsoever trouble and persecution they suffer in the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or promoting of Gods cause, all is reckoned up unto them as parts of service, which God will not forget to follow with mercy to them, and to theirs after them; <hi>Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>In the second place is set down the care which <hi>David</hi> had to settle the worship of God in the land; what time this Vow and Oath was made by <hi>David,</hi> it is not specified in any other place of Scripture, neither is it needful for us to be curious about the time or forme of words; for the meaning is not, as if <hi>David</hi> on a certain day, being ignorant of the place of setling of Gods Ark and building the Temple, did limit God to reveal it unto him ere night came; but the meaning is, that <hi>David</hi> swore to have a care of the setling of Gods Ark, before he setled his own house, and that he would not enjoy the commodities which his royal Palace (not as yet builded) might yield unto him, before he saw the Ark setled in the place where the Temple should be built. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is lawful to tie our selves by an Oath unto that duty, whereunto we were absolutely tied by law before: yea, and it may sometimes be expedient to tie our selves unto a duty by swearing, for evidencing our hearty purpose to follow that duty cheerfully, and for stirring up of our selves so much the more to follow it, as we are conscious of our slacknesse unto it, or feeblenesse to resist temptations; for here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>David sware unto the Lord,</hi> that he would discharge such a duty. 2. A lawful Vow is a part of divine worship, due to be made to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; for <hi>David</hi> offered this religious worship to God only: <hi>He vowed unto the mighty God of Iacob.</hi> 3. The Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God is the treasure of the Churches strength, wherein eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry believer hath an interest: <hi>He is that mighty one of Iacob.</hi> 4. The care of Gods publick worship, and establishing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where we have place and power, should be more earnest and greater in every true subject of Gods Kingdom, then the care of his own private affaires, and in the case of competition and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50629:147"/>
comparison, the setling of Gods worship should be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our setling in any worldly commodity: as the example of <hi>David</hi> here doth teach us.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Lo, we heard of it at Ephrata: we found it in the fields of the wood.</q>
            <p>In the third place, the Church speaketh and compareth the setled condition of the Ark now with the fleeted condition wherein it was before, for it was sometime in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> in the tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and now say they; <hi>Lo, we heard of it at Ephrata</hi>: and when it was in a manner lost, being taken by the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they say, they found as a thing once lost, the Ark in <hi>Kiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath-jearim,</hi> or City of the woods; <hi>We found it in the fields of the wood,</hi> and now it is setled will they say, we know where to finde it established: for this to be the Churches meaning is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to understand in the next verse, wherein they say: <hi>We will go up into his tabernacles. Whence learn,</hi> 1. The presence of the Lord in his Ordinances, was never so fixed in any place but that mercy may be turned into a story of, <hi>It was or hath been</hi>: if it be abused, as what the Lord did to his house in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> was a history in the dayes of the Kings, <hi>Lo, we have heard of it</hi>: (that is, of the Ark of the Covenant) <hi>at Ephrata.</hi> 2. When once the Lord hath fleeted the tokens of his presence far out of a land, it is a rare mercy and unexpected, and no lesse then is the finding of a treasure, or of a lost jewel, to see the restoring of his Ordinances again, as was to be seen when God brought back the Ark from the Philistines to <hi>Kiriath-jearim</hi>; which mercy the Church here acknowledgeth; <hi>We found it in the fields of the wood.</hi> 3. The way of God, about the shewing of his presence in his holy Ordinances in any place, is not as men may expect, but as God seeth good to dispose, as the Churches speech gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us to understand; <hi>We found the Ark in the fields of the wood.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 7.</hi> We will go into his Tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</p>

            </q>
            <p>In the fourth place, the Church stirreth up her self to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in <hi>Sion,</hi> where the Ark, representing Christ, was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, praying now for the benefit of Gods presence, as <hi>Moses</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the marching and setling of the Ark. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When God hath revealed his will in any point of Religion, we should without delay or dispute go follow his direction, as the Church doth here, when the Ark is setled in <hi>Sion; We will go into his Tabernacles.</hi> 2. Where the Lord hath promised to be found, there must we come and keep trust with him, and worship him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>We will go into his tabernacles, we will worship at his footstool.</hi> 3. The true worshipper must lift his minde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every external and visible Ordinance of God, and seek him in heaven where his glory shineth most, counting all things on the earth no more but as his footstool: for so was the Church of old directed to do, when they had the Lord most sensibly manifesting himself in his Tabernacle and Temple: <hi>We will worship at his footstool.</hi> 4. The Church in after-ages may call for, and expect the like benefit of Gods presence with his Ordinances, which his Church in former ages hath found, as the prayer of the Church here, being one with the prayer of the Church in the wildernesse, doth teach us: <hi>Arise, O Lord,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> said, when the Ark did remove. 3. The Ark of the Covenant was the figure of God incarnate, the type of Christ in whom the fulnesse of the Godhead dwelleth bodily, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after the manner of Sacraments, the signe receiveth the name of the thing signified; <hi>Arise, O Lord, thou and the Ark of thy strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Let thy Priests be clothed with righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and let thy Saints shout for joy.</q>
            <p>Now he closeth the first petition with a prayer for Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of his Ministers, and of their Ministery among the people; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Where the Lord is received, he must have Ministers, men set apart for his publick worship and service, as the Prayer for the Priests doth presuppose. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The chief badge
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50629:148"/>
and cognizance of the Lords Minister, is the true doctrine of justification and obedience of faith in a holy conversation: <hi>Let thy Priests be clothed with righteousnesse.</hi> 3. People have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to rejoyre, who have the benefit of such approved Ministers; and whosoever do really embrace the true doctrine of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by grace, whereby men justified by faith, become the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of righteousness in their life, are indeed Saints, and are called to rejoyce; <hi>Let thy Priests be cloathed with righteousnesse, and let thy Saints shout for joy.</hi> 4. It is the duty of the whole Church to pray for such a Ministery, and for such effectual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing following on it, as may make sinners become Saints, and sad souls to sing for joy, as here is prayed for.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For thy servant Davids sake: turne not away the face of thine anointed.</q>
            <p>The second maine petition is, for the manifestation of Gods respect unto <hi>Davids</hi> off-spring, wherein under the figure of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> successors in the Kingdom, he prayeth for the Kingdome of Christ, as before he prayed for his Priesthood. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Every faithful member of the Church should pray, as for the Churches welfare, so also for the welfare of the supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and of the Civil State whereof they are members: for so runneth the prayer here in the figure: <hi>Turne not away the face of thine anointed,</hi> to wit, the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> for whom they pray, that he benot put to shame by disappointment of his hopes. 2. The Lords anointed, or the supreme Ruler of the Lords people, should be a daily Supplicant unto God, and a depender upon him: for the petition doth presuppose, that his face was toward the Lord, praying to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and waiting for good from him: <hi>Turne not away the face of thine anointed.</hi> 3. The Lords Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is of great respect with God, and should be made much use of by us, as here we are taught; <hi>For thy servant Davids sake, turne not away the face of thine anointed,</hi> that is, for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants sake made with <hi>David</hi> in the type, and with Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by him, refuse not his lawful petitions. 4. The truth intended in the type, teacheth us that the intercession of Christ for his subjects shall never miscarey, nor shall Christ be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in what he willeth to be done to or for his subjects: for in him the prayer is surely heard: Christ that anointed
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50629:148"/>
One cannot be refused, nor any who truly do pray in his Name.</p>
            <q>

                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> The LORD hath sworne <hi>in</hi> truth unto David, he will not turne from it: Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</p>

            </q>
            <p>For strengthening of faith in this petition, he calleth to minde more particularly the Covenant of God with <hi>David. Whence learn,</hi> 1. Every Word and circumstance of Gods promise, is worthy to be looked upon, and well considered, as this example teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us. 2. Whosoever do seek a benefit, according to Gods Word, ought firmly to believe the promise of it, and to rest upon the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the promise, as here we finde the example: <hi>The Lord hath sworne, he will not turne from it.</hi> 3. Albeit the promise, that Christ should come of <hi>David</hi> be absolute, and setled with an Oath, yet the promises of temporal things made to <hi>David,</hi> are conditional, as God should see fit to give them, and as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should carry themselves in Gods obedience, so should they have temporal benefits, and succeed him in the temporal throne: <hi>If thy children will keep my Covenant and my testimonies, thy children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore,</hi>
               <q>
                  <p>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He giveth a reason for the absolute promise of Christs coming to rule the spiritual Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> or the Church, because the Lord had chosen <hi>Zion</hi> in the type, and the universal Church under the figure, to be his chosen Temple and habitation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he delighted. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Where God will settle his Sanctuary, there he will settle his Kingdome also: <hi>Sion</hi> must not want a King; for the reason here, why the Lord will with
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50629:149"/>
an oath set up one who shall be the fruit of <hi>Davids</hi> body upon the throne, is, <hi>Because he hath chosen Sion.</hi> 2. The Lords pitching upon any place to dwell in, or persons to dwell among, cometh not of the worthinesse of the place, or persons, but from Gods good plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No reason is to be craved for Gods everlasting good will to any person or incorporation; his pleasure may suffice for a cause: <hi>This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell, for I have desired it, or have pleasure in it.</hi>

            <p>The rest of the articles of the Lords Covenant with <hi>David,</hi> are so many promises which the Lord doth make concerning the blessing of the Ministers of Christ, unto the Churches good, and the encrease of Christs Kingdome, in despite of his enemies, in the last verses.</p>

The dispensation of good things unto Gods children, is such as shall make them sensible of their own insufficiency; they are not exempted from feeling their wants, and being in straits, but as they feel their need, so shall they be provided for: every evil which they feel, shall have a perfect remedy in Christ, and in his Word, which shall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the needy soul: <hi>I will satisfie her poor with bread</hi> 3.

The Ministers of righteousness teaching the true way of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obedience of faith, are also the Ministers of salvation: <hi>for the cloathing of the Priests with righteousnesse, v.</hi> 9. is here, <hi>the cloathing of them with salvation.</hi> 5.

            <p>From the promises made in favour of Christs Kingdome; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

The glory of typicall <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Kingdome, was revived in Christ the true <hi>David</hi>; the budding of Christs Kingdome in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was the budding of <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdome in a more glorious way then ever his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdome flourished: <hi>There will I make the horne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid to bud.</hi> 3. This is the Crown and accomplishment of the Churches felicity, that she hath Christ for her King: <hi>There will I make the horne of David to bud.</hi> 4. How low soever Christs Kingdome can be brought in the world, yet it is fixed as a well rooted tree, it is rooted as the horne of an Unicorne; although it may seem gone, or so weak as it cannot subsist, yet it shall bud and grow in despite of all opposition: <hi>There will I make the horne of David to bud.</hi> 5. It is no wonder to see adversaries opposing Christs Kingdome, for it is here foretold and presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: <hi>His enemies will I cloath with shame.</hi> 6. Albeit the enemies of Christ do promise to themselves advantage, by their opposition made unto Christ, and hope to overturne his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50629:150"/>
yet have they all been, and shall be ashamed for ever of their expectation, whosoever do hate his Kingdome: <hi>His ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will I cloath with shame,</hi> which they shall not be able to hide, but must put on and walk therein, as a man doth in his garments. 7. The more Christ is opposed, the more shall his splendor, and glory grow in the world: <hi>But upon himselfe shall his crown flourish.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>In this short Psalme, the Spirit of the Lord, by the mouth of the Psalmist, exhorteth the Lords Ministers to go about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their publick Ministery, in praying, preaching and praising God, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. and blessing the congregation met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> BEhold, blesse ye the LORD: all ye servants of the LORD: which by night stand in the house of the LORD.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Lift up your hearts <hi>in</hi> the Sanctuary: and blesse the LORD.</p>
            </q>
            <p>From the exhortation to the Lords Ministers; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The publick worship of God is to be carefully looked unto: and all men, but especially Ministers, had need to be stirred up to take heed to themselves, and to the work of Gods publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship when they go about it: for so much doth <hi>behold,</hi> in this place import. 2. The scope and special end of publick worship is to set forth the blessednesse of God in himselfe, and in his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for, and toward his Church: for all the parts of publick worship and service, in prayer, reading of Scripture, preaching, praising, and thanksgiving, singing of Psalmes, and blessing of the people, do aime at this: <hi>Behold, blesse ye the Lord.</hi> 3. The discharging of the publick worship of God, requireth that there be publick Ministers, appointed by God, and separated unto this holy function; <hi>Blesse ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord.</hi> 4. It was commanded in the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20, 21. that so soon as day-light began to fall at even, lamps should be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and shine all night in the Tabernacle, till the morning, and that the Priests and Levits should by course waite upon his service, that there should not be darknesse in the Lord house,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50629:151"/>
but light alwayes night and day: whereby was signified, that howsoever the world lieth in the darknesse of ignorance, of sinne and misery, yet in the Lords Church remedy against all those evils, and relief from them is to be had: and that God hath ordained Ministers, and publick Officers, to entertaine and hold forth the shining of the light unto the Church; and to this end not to stand to break their nights rest, when the service doth call for it: <hi>Blesse the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, which by night stand in the house of the Lord.</hi> 5. Prayer to God, as the mouth of the people, is a part of the office of the Lords Ministers: for so much is imported by pointing at the gesture of the supplicant: <hi>Lift up your hands in the Sanctuary,</hi> that is, in the place where the people assemble. 6. To praise the Lord, and to teach the people what the Lord is, what blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is to be found in him, and how they should acknowledge this, and make use of it, is another part of the Ministers office: <hi>Lift up your hands in the Sanctuary, and blesse the Lord.</hi>

            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 3.</hi> The Lord that made heaven and earth: blesse thee out of Sion.</q>
            <p>In this verse the Lords Ministers as they are directed, so they go about to blesse the people out of <hi>Sion,</hi> in the Name of the Lord: <hi>Out of Sion,</hi> because there was the Arke of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the figure of Christ, God incarnate, through whom alone the Lords blessing is derived unto his Church. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. All men lie under the curse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till God bring them into the fellowship of his Church, and pronounce them blessed by his Word, as, <hi>The Lord blesse thee,</hi> doth import. 2. It is a part of the office of the Lords Ministers, to pronounce with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Gods blessing upon his people, which is no more then a wish or prayer for them; for they are sent of God with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to say. <hi>The Lord blesse thee,</hi> 3. No blessing is to be expected but from Christ, represented by the Arke of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which was in <hi>Sion: The Lord blesse thee out of Sion.</hi> 4. The confidence of the believer to obtain whatsoever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the Lords Word, is builded upon the Covenant of God, and the omnipotency of God: and what can a soul stand in need of, which this fountaine cannot yield? <hi>The Lord that made heaven and earth, blesse thee out of Sion.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>In the exhortation directed to the whole Church, and to the Ministers; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The work of praising God, should be gone about affectionately; and unto it should we stirre up our selves, and others with all our might: as this manifold exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>to praise the Lord, and sing praise,</hi> doth teach us. 2. That which is spoken or manifested of God, must be carefully taken notice of, that he may be praised out of knowledge: for he will not have praises, but as his Word doth direct; for this doth, <hi>Praise the Name of the Lord,</hi> import. 3. The publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Gods House, who are set apart for teaching and leading of the people in his service, by reason of their Office and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, must stirre up themselves unto this work of praising God, whatsoever may be their own private condition, sad or joyfull: for their obligation so to do is greatest, <hi>Praise him, O ye Saints of the Lord, O ye servants of the Lord.</hi> 4. As our priviledges
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50629:152"/>
are more then the rest of the world, by being in Covenant with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and admitted to have room in the holy assemblies of his people, so should our care to praise God be the greater; <hi>Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the Courts of the house of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Praise the LORD, for the LORD <hi>is</hi> good: sing praises unto his Name, for <hi>it is</hi> pleasant.</q>
            <p>He insisteth in the exhortation, and beginneth to give reasons to move us to praise God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord is worthy to be praised, not only for his essential goodnesse, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the letting forth thereof on the creatures, and towards his people most of all; <hi>Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good</hi>: and this is the first reason or motive to praise. 2. Singing of the Lords praises is a part of the moral worship of God, and should be done with cheerfulnesse of heart, as a work wherein we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to be employed: <hi>Sing praises unto his Name.</hi> 3. The work of praising God, hath a sort of reward joyned with it: when we praise God most, we get most benefit by so doing: it is so comely in it self, so pleasant unto God, and profitable to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that offereth praises, so fit to chear up his spirit, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his faith in God, whose praises are the pillars of the believers confidence and comfort, that a man should be allured the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: <hi>Sing praises unto his Name, for it is pleasant</hi>; and this is the second motive or reason to praise God.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For the LORD hath chosen Iacob unto himselfe: and Israel for his peculiar treasure.</q>
            <p>The third reason of praising God is, because he hath by elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Israel,</hi> put a great respect and price upon his people. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Jewes have a respect of honour put upon them, (how unworthy soever they have proved themselves of it many times,) above all the Nations of the world, in that God hath chosen them to be his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among whom he will alwayes have a chosen number, which of no other Nation can be said: <hi>For the Lord hath chosen Iacob unto himself.</hi> 2. The Lords Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50629:153"/>
people are no lesse precious in his eyes, then a peculiar treasure is in a mans eyes; <hi>He hath chosen Israel for his peculiar treasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> For I know that the LORD <hi>is</hi> great: and <hi>that</hi> our <hi>LORD is</hi> above all gods.</q>
            <p>The fourth reason of Gods praise is, because the Lord is greater then all earthly, yea, then all imaginable excellencies in the world, as the Church doth both believe and know by experience. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The largenesse of Gods dominion over all Nations, and over all imagined excellency of the idols of the Gentiles, doth commend the mercy of God to that Nation, which he doth prefer unto the rest, by taking them in Covenant with himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The Lord is great, and our Lord is above all gods.</hi> 2. As the Lord doth by his extraordinary working for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple make manifest his glorious and great majestie to them, so should they so much the more for their experience praise him before all the world: <hi>For I know that the Lord is great, and our Lord is above all gods,</hi> doth import not only the Psalmists be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the point, and experience of the truth thereof, but also his practice of the duty.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 6.</hi> Whatsoever the LORD pleased, <hi>that</hi> did he in heaven, and in earth: in the seas, and all deepe places.</q>
            <p>The fifth reason of Gods praise, serving also to confirm the former reason is, because God is the Omnipotent Creator, and absolute Governour of all things, disposing of them as he pleaseth. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The great works of Creation, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation, and governing all things, do shew the Lords great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and do furnish matter of his praise: <hi>Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth, in the sea and all deep places.</hi> 2. The Lords will and pleasure is the measure of the extending of his Omnipotency, and no further must we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his power unto action, then his revealed will giveth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; <hi>Whatsoever the Lord pleased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that did he.</hi> 3. The Lords
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50629:153"/>
will is the sovereign and absolute cause of all his working, and that whereon all mens faith and reason must rest; <hi>Whatsoever he pleased, he did.</hi>

            <p>The sixth reason of Gods praise is, because there is no motion in the clouds or in he aire, but that which he maketh. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> There is none of the motions of the creatures so light o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> variable, which are not wrought by God, and wherein his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence doth not actually put forth it self in vapours, clouds, rain, lightnings, windes and all: <hi>He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth, he maketh lightnings for the raine, he bringeth the winde out of his treasuries.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 8.</hi> Who smote the first-borne of Egypt: both of man and beast.</p>

                  <hi>12.</hi> And gave their land <hi>for</hi> an heritage: an herit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age unto Israel his people.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The seventh reason of Gods praise is, for his wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his people out of <hi>Eqypt,</hi> and powerful overthrow of the Canaanites, and placing of his people in their room. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lords working for his Church in former times, is matter of praising God in all after-ages: as this example of the mentioning so oft <hi>of the slaughter of the first-born of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50629:154"/>
both of man and beast,</hi> doth teach. 2. Gods working for his people is such, that their enemies being posed, must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his wonderful acts: <hi>He sent tokens and wonders in the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and all his servants.</hi> 3. When God engageth for his people, he will overtop the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest Kings and Kingdomes, and tread them under in favour of his Church; <hi>Who smote great Nations, and slew mighty Kings, Sihon King of the Amorites, and Og King of Bashan, and all the Kingdomes of Canaan.</hi> 4. The care of God for his people is indefatigable, he ceaseth not to prosecute begun fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, till he bring them to an end: He followeth <hi>Israels</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> till he give them possession of <hi>Canaan.</hi> 5. Albeit there be difficulties and opposition to the setling of Gods people in their possession, yet the work goeth on, and must be perfected; and the close of Gods work is no lesse glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the beginning of it: <hi>He gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.</hi>

               <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Thy Name, O LORD, <hi>endureth</hi> for ever: <hi>and</hi> thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.</q>
            <p>In the second place, the Psalmist turneth his speech toward the Lord, and praiseth him yet more: and then, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verses addeth other two reasons of his praising God. From this verse, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. What the Lord doth declare himself to be in one generation toward his Church, may and should be a meanes to know what he will do in all time to come for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as need shall require<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever, and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generation.</hi> 2. As the constancy of Gods love toward his people, and care for them is a matter of high praise unto God: so it is a matter of sweet refreshing joy to the beleever, which maketh him look up kindly unto God, and praise him: as here the Psalmist in praising Gods constancy, turneth his speech twice toward him: <hi>O Lord, O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 14.</hi> For the LORD will judge his people:
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50629:154"/>
and he will repent himselfe concerning his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</q>
            <p>The first new reason of Gods praise is the hope, that the Lord will plead the cause of his afflicted people, and will comfort them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Then are by-past mercies of God rightly made use of, when they strengthen faith and hope in God for mercies to come: as here we see the Lords memorial made use of, for the Churches present comfort. 2. Wheresoever Gods people are oppressed by their enemies, howsoever God hath ever just quarrel against his people, yet will he examine what moved the enemies to trouble them: and albeit he do not at first give out sentence, yet he will execute justice in favour of his people in due time: <hi>For the Lord will judge his people,</hi> to wit, by pleading their cause against their enemies. 3. The constancy of Gods love to his people, makes the change of his sad dispensations into more comfortable, to be certain: and therefore Gods afflicting of his people, is a work wherein he will not continue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because his mercy toward his people is everlasting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>For the Lord will judge his people, and he will repent himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his servants.</hi> 4. As it is a sort of grief to God to afflict his people, so it is a sort of comfort to him to comfort his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by delivering of them from their sad affliction; for the word, <hi>Repent himself,</hi> in the Originall doth signifie also <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himself.</hi>

                  <hi>Ver. 15.</hi> The idols of the heathen <hi>are</hi> silver and gold, the work of mens hands.</p>

The wisdom of God appearing in the fabrick of heaven, as it is worthy to be praised, because it is of so large a compasse, as the motion of it shall be no wayes troublesome to man: the stars so glorious an ornament, so useful to man, and so regular in their motion as is wonderful: <hi>To him that by wisdom made the Heavens.</hi> 6.

It is the Lords mercy that he hath not changed this course, nor removed this much abused benefit from us; <hi>For his mercie endureth for ever,</hi> 11.

The Lords punishing of the enemies of his Church in <hi>Egypt,</hi> is an obligation on the Church to praise him for ever: and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant mercy giveth assurance, that he will avenge the quarrel of his oppressed people in all ages: <hi>To him that smote Egypt in their first-borne, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 4. The delivery of <hi>Israel</hi> from the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is a matter of Gods perpetual
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50629:158"/>
praise: and it is a pledge of Gods mercy to his Church in all ages; <hi>He brought out Israel from amongst them; for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 5. As the work of the Churches delivery is more difficult, so doth the Lord put forth more clearly his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency for perfecting of it, as appeared in <hi>Israels</hi> bringing forth out of <hi>Egypt, with a strong hand and out-stretched arme.</hi> 6. One proof of Gods power manifested for his Church, is a pawne of his purpose to give so oft proof as need shall be, of his power for his peoples relief; <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 7. The most improbable deliverances from danger, are very possible to God, who can turn the sea into dry land for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples escaping; <hi>To him which divided the sea into parts.</hi> 8. The constancy of Gods mercy to his Church, maketh his dividing of the sea a pawne of his power and purpose to deliver his Church how great soever their straits shall be: <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 9. It is a work of no lesse mercy and power, to give his people grace to make use of an offered meanes of delivery, then to prepare the deliverance for them, but the constancy of Gods mercy doth not only provide the meanes, but also giveth his people grace to make use thereof in all ages: <hi>He made Israel to passe through the midst of it, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God can make that meanes which proveth effectual for the safety of his people, to prove a snare to the wicked for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, as the Red sea was a snare to the Egyptians; <hi>But he overthrew Pharaoh and his hoste in the Red-sea.</hi> 11. The constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Gods mercy toward his people, is a pledge of the constant course of his justice against their enemies; <hi>For his mercy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever.</hi> 12. As thankfulnesse maketh search of many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the bosome of one, so the innumerable multitude of Gods mercies doth force the thankful man to summe up many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in one: as here all the mercies in the fourty yeares journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wildernesse are drawn up in a word; <hi>To h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is the constancy of Gods mercy, which maketh him continue the conduct of his people, and bear with their manners, till he put an end to their journey; <hi>He led his people through the wildernesse, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 14. The people of God may meet with no lesse difficulties in their way to heaven, then they have found hinderances of their Conversion, as the typical example of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> meeting with opposition before they entred <hi>Canaan</hi> doth shew. 15. Albeit Kings and potent Powers should oppose the setling of Gods Church in any place where he pleaseth to plant
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50629:158"/>
it, yet they shall not be able to hinder his work: for his mercy is forth-coming in one age as well as in another, that praise and thanks may alwayes be given unto him; <hi>Who smote great Kings, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 16. Men of renown lose their credit, when they meddle with the Lords Church, and readily they lose their lives also: and this should be a document to all mighty men, and a matter of comfort to Gods people; <hi>He slew fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Kings, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 17. The Lord will have the first opposers of the setling of his people exemplarily punished, and their punishment made no lesse famous then their sin hath been; <hi>He slew Sihon King of the Amorites:</hi> and the like will the Lord do in all ages against the chief adversaries of his people: <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 18. When judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon one enemie doth not terrifie others of them from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Gods people, the like destruction shall fall upon those that make head against the Church; <hi>And he slew Og King of Bashan.</hi> 19. The slaughter of the enemies of Gods people is the work of the Lord, whosoever be the instruments; for it is not here said that the Israelites slew <hi>Sihon</hi> and <hi>Og, but the Lord slew them</hi>; and the like mercy may the Church look for in all ages; <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 20. It is the Lord who giveth heritages at his pleasure, and who can dispossesse such men of their lands, who will not suffer the Lords people to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit that land which the Lord hath given them: <hi>He slew Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon and Og, and gave their land for an heritage</hi>; and the like mercy may the Church look for in all ages, as it shall be found good for her: <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 21. When the Lord puts down the enemies, and puts his servants in their place, it is a double mercy; As <hi>He gave the lands of Sihon and Og to be an heritage unto Israel his servants.</hi> 22. There can no cause be found in Gods people, why God should do good to them, or why he hath done good unto them: but the constancy of his own mercie only; <hi>For his mercy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever.</hi>

The Lords presence, help and assistance, good-will and respect to us, is better observed by afflicted people then by prosperous: for troubles, necessities and straits, are meanes to open mens eyes, and waken up their senses, to take up the worth of the Lords working: <hi>He remembred us in our low estate.</hi> 4. The mercy of the Lord is set on work for his people, both when they are in adversity to sustain them, and to raise them out of it: and in prosperity to maintain them in it, and to teach them the good use of it, in looking wisely on Gods dealing with them in both conditions: <hi>He remembred us in our low estate, for his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever.</hi> 5. Albeit the proud enemies of the Church may prevaile, and bring the Church into bondage for a time, yet the Lord will not suffer the enemie to oppresse, nor his people to be oppressed alwayes, but will deliver his own in due time: as here, <hi>He hath redeemed us from our enemies.</hi> 6. The same reason and cause is to be found of the delivery of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of the delivery of the Church at any time from their enemies, and that is <hi>mercy</hi> only; <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:50629:160"/>The Lords people carried with them into their captivity their harps; first, as meanes of stirring up their affections, in their private worship of God.

There are times when the signes of our joy may be suppressed, and the signes of our sorrow expressed: <hi>We hanged our harps on the willowes.</hi> 4. The most lawfull and commendable sorrow, is that which is taken for the dishonour of God, and the desolation of the Church: <hi>When we remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sion, we hanged our harps.</hi> 5.

               <p>THis Psalme is <hi>Davids</hi> thanksgiving unto God, and praising of him for the experience he had of his love and faithfulnesse. The promise of praise or thanksgiving, is set down, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and six reasons are to be subjoyned in the verses following, which are closed with a prayer in the end of the Psalme.</p>
            </argument>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 1. I</hi> Will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praises unto thee.</q>
            <p>In the promise of praising God; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is a part of our thankfulnesse, to engage our heart to praise God for after-time, when we finde that all the thanks we can give for the present, are short of our duty or desire to praise him; <hi>I will praise thee,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> 2. As sometimes the believer will finde his heart set at liberty in Gods worship, which at another time he will finde to be in bands, so should he take the opportunity of an enlarged heart, to runne in the way of Gods service, as <hi>David</hi> doth here: <hi>I will praise thee with my whole heart.</hi> 3. Albeit the faces of Princes, Rulers, and Magistrates, use to lay some restraint upon the liberty of speech, which men use to take before mean persons, and albeit Princes ordinarily love rather to hear themselves praised by flatterers, then to hear either God or man magnified in their audience, yet a heart enlarged with the sense of Gods Majesty, greatnesse, and goodnesse, will not stand to confesse, and proclaim Gods truth, greatnesse and goodnesse, and other points of his praise, in the audience of the greatest men on the earth, pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> case they should think themselves cried down, and more lightly esteemed of, by this meanes: <hi>Before the Lord will I sing praise to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 2.</hi> I will worship toward thy holy Temple, and praise thy Name, for thy loving kindnesse, and for
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50629:163"/>
thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy Word above all thy Name.</q>
            <p>He engageth himselfe also unto the publick ordinary worship of God, according to Gods command, and then giveth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of his engagement. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Worshipping of God in secret is indeed necessary, but it is not sufficient for the man who mindeth thankfulnesse to God, except he follow the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meanes also, and that after the way which is prescribed by God, directing all his service to be offered to God through Christ: for this is imported in <hi>Davids</hi> worshipping toward the Arke, which was placed in the tabernacle or Temple: <hi>I will worship toward the holy Temple, and praise thy Name.</hi> 2. The experience of the Lords kindnesse and faithfulnesse in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made to his people, is a lively motive unto believers to praise him: <hi>I will praise thy Name for thy loving kindnesse, and thy truth.</hi> 3. There is more to be seen and felt in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods children, then they could promise to themselves out of Gods Word: for they finde that God in effect is better in his payment then in his promises, for thus much doth this commendation import; <hi>Thou hast magnified thy Word above all thy Name,</hi> that is, I have found more effect in the performance of thy promise, then the promise seemed unto me to hold forth in thy Name, and this is the first reason of <hi>Davids</hi> engagement unto thankfulnesse.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> In the day when I cried, thou answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst me: <hi>and</hi> strengthenedst me <hi>with</hi> strength in my soul.</q>
            <p>The second reason of his thanksgiving is more speciall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God had upholden him by his inward comfort in the time of his trouble, and had answered his prayer graciously. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord useth to put his children unto straits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deliver them, that he may be seen the more clearly to be their deliverer: for <hi>David</hi> cried unto the Lord, before the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of his ordinary and daily prayer was given unto him; <hi>In the day when I cried,</hi> saith he. 2. To be supported in trouble, and to have strength to bear out in trouble till the full delivery come,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50629:163"/>
is a reall and remarkable answer from God to his peoples prayers: <hi>In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.</hi> 3. Albeit before the outward and compleat delivery come, the passages of Gods secret sustaining of a man be not well marked, yet when they are looked back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the clear light of accomplished deliverance, the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of delivery and secret supporting of the man under trouble; will appear clearly to be answerers of prayer, and begun delivery: as <hi>David</hi> here observeth, and giveth account thereof. <hi>In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 4.</hi> All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD: when they hear the words of thy mouth.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.</hi> Yea, they shall sing in the wayes of the LORD: for great <hi>is</hi> the glory of the LORD.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The third reason of his thanksgiving is, because he foreseeth in the Spirit of prophecy, how great glory and praise, and thanks the Lord shall have, when he shall convert the Gentiles, and reveal his Word and works unto them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The foresight of the glory which God shall have in the world before its end, by the promised propagation of his Gospell, should stirre up all who believe the approaching glory of God, to magnifie and praise him in their own time: for the foresight of the glory of God to be manifested among the Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is here the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the song of <hi>David,</hi> and of the Church of the Jewes <hi>All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord.</hi> 2. When the glory of the Lord is seen it doth overshine all the glory in the world: for Kings when they see Gods glory, shall fall down and praise God: <hi>All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord.</hi> 3. It is the Word of God mainly which sheweth forth the glory of the Lord, and maketh his works to be wonderfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, when they hear the words of thy mouth.</hi> 4. Albeit the knowledge of God which cometh onely by his works, be able to convince even the Heathen, of the Lords care over his people, and to astonish them, yet not the knowledge of the Lord which cometh by his works, but that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50629:164"/>
by the hearing of the Word of the Lord, is able to convert a man, and to make him walk in the obedience of faith, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God, and to sing his praises cheerfully: <hi>When they hear the words of thy mouth, they shall sing in the wayes of the Lord,</hi> 5. The glory of the Lord which is manifested in his Word, is the highest glory which is manifested to the world; for after all the glory of his works of Creation and Providence, which the Word holdeth forth, it sheweth forth the glory of Gods grace and mercy to the self-condemned sinner, which mercie to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent soul in some re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pect, is above all Gods works, for in this respect it is here said: <hi>Great is the glory of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off.</q>
            <p>A fourth reason of <hi>Davids</hi> thanksgiving and praising of God, is for his different dealing with the humble and proud. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord be so highly exalted above all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as it is a sort of humbling himself to behold his creatures, even in the heavens, yet he is so good and gracious, that his superlative grandour, doth not hinder his taking notice of the meanest lost sinner, who humbleth himself before him: <hi>Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly.</hi> 2. The greatness of the Majestie of God commendeth his humility, and the Lords looking low for the good of the poore Supplicant, commendeth his greatnesse, and maketh it more lovely: for it is here put for a point of his praise: <hi>That though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly.</hi> 3. The Lord observeth the disposition of men, who are proud and who are humble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this doth the text point at. 4. The humble do lose nothing by their humility, nor do the proud gain any thing by their pride, but by the contrary the humble finde grace, and the proud are resisted of God; <hi>He hath respect to the lowly, but the proud he knoweth afar off.</hi> 5. Pride excludeth a man from accesse to God, and a proud man cannot have communion with God: <hi>He knoweth the proud afar off.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 7.</hi> Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50629:164"/>
thou wilt revive me, thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.</q>
            <p>The sixth reason of his giving thanks &amp; praise unto God, is his confidence, that whatsoever trouble he shall fal into hereafter by his enemies, the Lord will sustain him under it, and deliver him out of it <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a good use of by-past experience, to conceive hope to be helped of God in time to come: as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>David</hi> here teacheth us. 2. Whatsoever trouble a man hath been in, he may fall in as great or greater afterward: yea, he may possibly be in a comfortlesse condition, and helplesse and hopelesse for any thing can be seen, yea, and be compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with trouble on all hands, yea he may faint under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and be as a dead man: for thus much <hi>David</hi> presupposeth may be his condition afterward: <hi>Though I walk in the midst of trouble.</hi> 3. How great soever, and how many soever straits and difficulties the believer can forecast and foresee, he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to himself as great and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> many supplies of strength, and deliveries from God: <hi>Though I walk in the midst of troubles, thou wilt revive me,</hi> that is, thou wilt put new life and comfort in me. 4. Against the power and wrath of adversaries, Gods power and good-will is a sufficient guard, succour and relief: <hi>Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> The LORD will perfect <hi>that which</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, <hi>endureth</hi> for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.</q>
            <p>The sixth reason of his giving thanks and praise, is his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the Lords constant continuing with him, and making him to persevere in Gods obedience unto the end, which he clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with a prayer that he may persevere. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The believers heart cannot be quiet, till it be sure of perseverance, and of this he may be made assured: for the same Spirit of grace which hath made him see the Lords engagement for him in time past, can give certainty of the continuing of Gods grace in time to come; <hi>The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me</hi>: He find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:50629:165"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct that work of grace which he hath begun 2 The believer doth not build his hope of perseverance upon any strength or constancy in himself, but upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse of Gods eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lasting mercy, as here <hi>David</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto us: <hi>The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me,</hi> why? and upon what ground is he so confident? <hi>Thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever.</hi> 3. True assurance of perseverance must be joyned with the sense of a mans own weaknesse and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and ill deserving, (if God should deal wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h him in justice) yea, it must be joyned with dependance upon God in faith and prayer, and use of the meanes; for such was the assurance which <hi>David</hi> had, who after that he hath said, <hi>The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me,</hi> subjoyneth, <hi>forsake not the work of thine own hands,</hi> which importeth so much. 4. Faith hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for its own strengthening to make use of all bonds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and it self as a creature, and in special as a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that seeing his calling and gifts are without repentance, he would make out the work of grace and salvation, where he hath begun it, as <hi>David</hi> teacheth us: <hi>Forsake not the work of thy own hands.</hi>

            <p>In his acknowledging of Gods Omniscience, and perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of every thing in him, and in his betaking himself unto God, for clearing of him, comforting of him, and bearing him through all calumnies and reproaches: <hi>Learn,</hi> 1 The godly may sometimes be so overclouded with calumnies and reproaches, as they cannot finde a way to clear themselves before men, but must content and comfort themselvs with the testimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and with Gods approbation of their integrity, as here <hi>David</hi> doth, saying, <hi>O Lord, thou hast searched me and known me.</hi> 2. As the knowledge which the Lord hath of us is most accurate, having, as it were, a perfect searching joyned with it: so the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this point is necessarily to be applied to our selves, that it may rule our conversation, breed us comfort and peace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in our approaches unto God, whosoever be against us, as <hi>Davids</hi> example here doth teach us. 3. The Lord is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the motions of the external man, the meanest
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:50629:166"/>
gesture of the body falleth under his cognition and observation: <hi>Thou knowest my down-sitting and my uprising.</hi> 4. What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visements we are upon, what consultations and deliberations we are about, the Lord knoweth all perfectly before we conclude any thing: <hi>Thou understandest my thoughts afarre off.</hi> 5. The Lord doth not only observe our aime and scope, but also how we purpose to convey out matters, and how we go on and proceed in accomplishing of our purposes, what rule we follow or reject, from the morning to the evening: <hi>Thou compassest my path, and my lying down.</hi> 6. The Lord knoweth us so well as the best know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which our entire friend can have of us, with whom we do communicate our minde, and who knoweth all our designe and way to go about it, is but a shadowing similitude of Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of us: <hi>Thou art acquainted with all my wayes.</hi> 7.

We are so inclosed within the view of Gods beholding of us, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed by his providence, and so powerfully ruled by his power, as we cannot turne this way or that way, but we are still in his sight, and under his disposing of us, as he seeth fit: <hi>Thou hast beset me behinde and before, and laid thy hand upon me.</hi> 9. The knowledge which God hath of us and of our wayes, is so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and perfect, so far above our capacity, as we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the manner of it: <hi>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.</hi> 10. When we are about to look upon Gods perfections, we should observe our own imperfections, and thereby learn to be the more modest in our searching of Gods unsearchable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: <hi>Such knowledge,</hi> saith <hi>David, is too high for me, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain unto it.</hi> 11. Then do we see most of God, when we see him incomprehensible, and do see our selves swallowed up in the thoughts of his perfection, and are forced to fall in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, as here, <hi>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</hi>

            <p>In the third place, where the Psalmist giveth a reason of Gods exact knowledge of, and power over him, because he hath form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the belly wonderfully; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. In regard that God hath made us in the wombe, and we live, and move, and subsist

by his power, it is not possible that God should not know our words, works and thoughts and all, and have us alwayes in his sight and under his power: <hi>For thou hast possessed my reines, thou hast covered me in my mothers wombe.</hi> 2. The knowledge of God, and his Government of the creature, is not like a mans, who setteth himself for a while on this object, and then turneth off to another object, but Gods Knowledge and Government is a setled possessing of his own workmanship, by a constant behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by a setled ruling of his work, by a constant maintaining and judging of the most secret motion of a mans spirit: <hi>For thou hast possessed my reines, thou hast covered me in my mothers wombe.</hi> 3. The Lord in framing our bodies in our mothers wombe, did cover his tender work with his mighty power from all inconveniences, as with a shield: <hi>Thou hast covered me in my mothers wombe.</hi> 4. The right sight of Gods workmanship in our very bodies, will force us to praise Gods unspeakable wisdom: <hi>I will praise thee, for I am fearfully made.</hi> 5. When God is seen in his glory in any thing, his majesty becometh terrible to the beholder, his glory is so bright; <hi>I am fearfully made.</hi> 6.

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50629:168"/>
when as yet there was none of them.</hi> 13. The Lords decrees of things to be done, are so clear, so determinate, so certain, as if the description and history of the thing already come to passe were written in a book: for so much doth the comparison taken from a written book to shew the nature of Gods decrees, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; <hi>In thy book all my members were written, which in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</hi> 14. There is rare wisdome to be learned out of Gods decrees and works; <hi>How precious are thy thoughts unto me?</hi> 15. What pains a man taketh in the searching thereof, is well recompensed with pleasure and profit, as <hi>Davids</hi> experience doth teach. 16. We should studie this wisdom till we finde it sweet, and then lay it up as a precious jewel in our minde, when we have found it: <hi>How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God?</hi> 17. All Gods revealed decrees, are the matter of the beleevers comfort and his joy, how harsh soever they seem to the unbeliever and unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man; <hi>How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God?</hi> 18. The particulars of Gods purpose and decreed will toward his own children, which from time to time do come to light, as they are revealed by the daily execution of them, are innumerable; <hi>How great is the summe of them? if I should count them, they are more in number then the sand.</hi> 19. Albeit the most vigilant of the Saints sometimes fall in drowsinesse and sleepinesse of Spirit, that they cannot perceive Gods presence with them, and care of them, and love unto them, yet when the Lord wakeneth up their soules, and reneweth their spiritual senses, they are forced to see and acknowledge that the Lord doth never leave them, even when they least perceive his presence: <hi>For, when I awake, I am still with thee,</hi> doth import all this.</p>

courses. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Where we perceive wickeddesse to reign, there we may be assured destruction will follow: <hi>Surely, thou wilt slay the wicked, O God.</hi> 2. When we do passe our judgement of mens persons and courses, we had need to conform our judgment unto what we know the Lord will allow as here the Psalmist doth, directing his speech to God, 3. When the Lord will comfort his servants under persecution, he will let them see not only their own blessednes in himself, but also the destruction of their enemies approaching, as here we see. 4. When we see destruction attending upon the way wherein others are walking, we ought to keep off from fellowship with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful works or darknesse: for otherwise whatsoever duties any special relations do call for at our hands, <hi>David</hi> was very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant of them toward his greatest enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he separated from them only as wicked and as bloody, and as they were on a course of perdition; <hi>Depart from me therefore ye bloody men.</hi> 5.

            <p>After declaring his judgement of his enemies, he professeth his hatred to their persons, qualified with wickednesse, as is said <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There are some men, who beside the common enmity which is in all men against God, do oppose themselves in an eminent way against God and godlinesse, as <hi>haters</hi> of God; for this the text doth presuppose. 2. Such as
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50629:169"/>
are perceived open enemies unto God, we may lawfully hate them, without breach of the law of love: for the love which we owe unto God absolutely, giveth warrant to hate them who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose God comparatively: <hi>Do not I hate them that hate thee?</hi> 3. Injuries done against God, should touch and affect us, no lesse nearly then injuries done to our selves; <hi>And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</hi> 4. When God is injured by our enemies, we had great need to look to the sincerity of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that our hatred against them, and our zeal for God and his truth be upright, so as we may say with <hi>David, I hate them with a perfect hatred, I count them mine enemies.</hi>

            <p>When <hi>David</hi> hath searched himself, and is approved of his own conscience, he offereth himself over again to be searched by God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As we have need to try our zeale, when Gods quarrel and our interest are joyned, that there be not some dregs of our ill humours mixed therewith: so must we not rest upon the testimony of our own conscience in this case, but must offer our heart to be searched of God, over and over again, and must intreat him to purge us of every corrupt mixture, as <hi>David</hi> doth; <hi>Scarch me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts.</hi> 2. He had need to be sincere in all his wayes, who craveth Gods approbation in any one of his wayes, for if a man be corrupt in any of his wayes, he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his own heart in all other of his wayes: this doth <hi>David</hi> import, when he saith, <hi>And see if there be any wicked way in me.</hi> 3. Every wicked way, is a way of grief, trouble and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: for so imports the name given to it in the original. 4. The good way allowed of God, is a lasting way appointed of God of old, and will be approved by him for ever: <hi>Lead me in the way everlasting.</hi> 5 We cannot walk in the wayes of God, without his actual and effectual leading of us therein, beside his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given in common by his Word; and therefore we had need to pray with <hi>David, Lead me in the way everlasting.</hi>

            <p>From the first request; <hi>Learn,</hi> That most innocent and godly men, by the calumnies of the wicked, are sometimes cast in great dangers, whence they see no appearance of deliverance, for clearing their name, or saving of their life, except God finde it out: and in this case God is and should be their refuge; <hi>Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man.</hi> 2.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50629:173"/>
allurement, as this petition doth import. 2. The holiest of Gods servants have reason to pray unto God, <hi>Lead us not into tentation,</hi> when they consider that their daily sinning, may open a door to justice, to give over their hearts, for a time, to its own natural wicked inclination: for in the sense of this danger, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayeth; <hi>Encline not my heart to any evil thing.</hi> 3. As to meet injuries with injuries, is not a meanes to be rid out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but a meanes to involve us in further trouble: so also to comply with workers of iniquity, for fear of danger from them, is not a meanes to eschew trouble, but rather a meanes to draw down Gods wrath: <hi>Encline not my heart to any evil thing, to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise wicked works with them that work iniquity.</hi> 4.

            <p>The fourth petition, is for the benefit of the communion of Saints, wherein <hi>David</hi> perceiving the mischief which unhappy flatterers about the King, procured to the King, and to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the land, he prayeth to God, to grant him such godly men about him, as would never consent to any wrong deed of his, but would disswade him, dissent from him, yea, reprove and rebuke
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:50629:173"/>
him rather, if need were; which sort of friendly smiting of him, he promiseth shall be most acceptable to him: and for this, he giveth four reasons: the first whereof is, because he had so much love to his enemies as to pitty them in their calamities, and to pray for them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As flatterers are a plague to Princes, especially when they are upon unjust courses: so righteous and faithfull admonishers of us, in whatsoever place we are in, are a notable blessing, and worthy to be prayed for: <hi>Let the righteous smite me.</hi> 2. According as a man doth hate sinne, and love righteousnesse, so he hateth flattery, and loveth to be freely dealt with, and reproved or admonished: for it is the love of righteousnesse, and hatred of sinne, which maketh <hi>David</hi> say, <hi>Let the righteous smite me.</hi> 3. No man is so farre mortified, but a reproof will be a wound to his proud flesh: <hi>Let the righteous smite me.</hi> 4. Free dealing and plaine reproof, is a fruit of love unfeigned: <hi>Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindnesse.</hi> 5. As most precious oile is to the body, so is the counsell, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reproof of the righteous to the soul: for the fruit of both is health and gladnesse; <hi>Let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oile, which shall not break my head.</hi> 6. The godly when they are persecuted, need not to seek private revenge: for cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities do abide their persecutors, which they by faith in Gods Word, may clearly foresee, as <hi>David</hi> here doth presuppose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably, that their calamities were coming: <hi>My prayer shall be in their calamities.</hi> 7. The Lords children should be so far from private revenge, and so ready to come off that course, if they be tempted to it, that they should keep so much love to their adversaries, as may make them discharge all commanded duties toward them, as <hi>David</hi> here is disposed, whose words import thus much, if I were set upon private revenge, Lord let me finde a friend to hinder me, because I resolve to follow the duties of commanded love toward mine adversaries: <hi>For yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.</hi> And this is the first reason of the fourth petition.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> When their judges are overthrown in stony places: they shall heare my words, for they are sweet.</q>
            <p>The second reason is, from his purpose to deal with the simple people, (who now did persecute him, by the misleading of their
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:50629:174"/>
corrupt Rulers) as with his kindly subjects, disciples or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and doth hope to finde them tractable: <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Difference must be put between ring leaders in an evill course, and those that follow it in simplicity; for so doth the Prophet here put difference betwixt the people, and their corrupt and wicked Judges. 2. Wicked Rulers and mis-leaders of people, shall be fearfully punished, as they who are cast down from a steep place, and fall among stones; <hi>Their judges shall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in stony places.</hi> 3. Mis-led people should be kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, and instructed in the truth of Gods Word, as disciples and children, so soon as the Lord doth offer opportunity: <hi>When their judges shall be overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words.</hi> 4. As the doctrine of grace and godlinesse is sweet and pleasant in it selfe, so should it be esteemed of by the preachers, and so recommended to the people, and so handled in the way of preaching of it, as it may be acknowledged by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be such; and this shall be, if with the deciphering of sinne and the curse, the remedy constantly be holden forth in Christ; if with the doctrine of all moral duties, people be directed to draw strength to obey them from Christ, and to seek to have their service acceptable through Christ; for thus shall the words of the Lord be both pleasant and profitable to people: This course did <hi>David</hi> resolve, <hi>They shall hear my words, for they are sweet.</hi>

            <p>This is a third reason, not only of the fourth petition, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and mainly of the whole prayer, for comfort and delivery from persecution, wherein many of the Lords Priests were slaine, and many others of <hi>Davids</hi> friends were undone, and no more regard had of their lives and bones, then the hewer of wood hath regard to the chips which fall off in hewing: wherein <hi>David</hi> and his followers, were a type of Christ, and of his followers, whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution is here represented, and Prophesied of. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the death of the Lords servants be dear unto him, yet their lives, and the burial of their bones, are no more regarded by the wicked, then so many chips of wood, which the hewer of wood heweth off with his axe: <hi>Our bones are scattered at the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:50629:174"/>
graves mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.</hi> 2. When Christs subjects are so entertained, (as here is set forth) their case being presented unto God, hath no small force to draw down delivery, and to bring a change of the affaires of their foes, as the force of the reason annexed unto the prayer doth teach.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> But mine eyes <hi>are</hi> unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust, leave not my soul destitute.</q>
            <p>The fourth reason of the petition, relating mainly to the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for delivery: after which is subjoyned the fifth petition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the substance of all his prayer. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. How great soever the darknesse of his calamities may be, and how thick soever the cloudes of present trouble are, to hide from us the Lords care of us, and his loving kindnesse unto us, yet faith must look, and pierce through them all unto God, and to his power and constancy of truth and love: <hi>But mine eyes are unto thee.</hi> 2. Whensoever faith turneth it selfe toward the Lord, it seeth sufficiency in God to help, as the man hath need: <hi>Mine eyes are toward thee, O God the Lord.</hi> 3. As it is good to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God in time of greatest straites, so it is good to avow our beliefe before God, and to observe this for our further strengthening, that we have obtained mercy to believe, as here <hi>David</hi> doth; <hi>Mine eyes are toward thee: in thee is my trust.</hi> 4. A soul which hath God for a covering of protection and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, hath also every condition it can be in, well seasoned: but the soul that lacketh this governing, is bare and naked, and destitute, without guard against any evil which may fall upon it: against this evil we have great need to pray, <hi>Leave not my soul destitute.</hi> And this is the fifth petition in this prayer.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Keep me from the snare <hi>which</hi> they have laid for me: and the grinnes of the workers of iniquity.</q>
            <p>The sixth petition, is to be saved from the privie plots, which his enemies had laid against him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50629:175"/>
of Gods people, or persecutors of the righteous for righteousnesse, are workers of iniquity, let them pretend unto godlinesse, lawes, or justice, as they please, for so are they here described<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Persecutors of the righteous, use not to go so openly to work, as to persecute them directly for righteousnesse, but do make plausible lawes and statutes, which may seem rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to the world, and yet such lawes as the godly cannot without sinne obey, and so their commands do insnare the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as here they are called, <hi>snares and grinnes.</hi> 3. From the plots of persecutors, and in special from iniquity established by a law, none can deliver the godly so, as they shall neither sinne nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the penalty, except God alone: <hi>Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and the grinnes of the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Let the wicked fall into their own nets: whilest that I withal escape.</q>
            <p>The seventh petition is, as for his own delivery, so also for the overthrow of obstinate enemies, who cannot be reclaimed. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The prayers against persecutors which are dited to the penmen of the Scripture, are prophecies of their punishment, and decrees whereunto the Church may subscribe in the general: and this prayer is one among the rest. 2. When the persecutors do lay plots and snares against the righteous, they lay plots against themselves; and there is no need of another plot for their ruine, save that which is of their own devising: <hi>Let the wicked fall into their own net.</hi> 3. It is not unusual to see the overthrow of persecutors, and the delivery of the righteous, wrought by one and the self-same meanes, and brought about at one time: <hi>Let the wicked fall into their own net, whilest that I withall escape.</hi>

               <p>THis Psalme doth shew what was <hi>Davids</hi> exercise, when he was in the cave of one of the mountaines of <hi>Engedi,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.) flying from <hi>Saul:</hi> wherein he first setteth down his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of himselfe to prayer in general, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.

It is wisdome for us to mark the special dangers wherein we fall, and how we have behaved our selves therein, and to see what use we should make thereof, as this example of <hi>Davids</hi> calling to minde of the danger he was in, in the cave, doth teach us.</p>

            </q>
            <p>In the setting down of his exercise in this danger, and how he made God his refuge by prayer; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The grace of God can so calme a mans mind, in the deepest danger of present death, as he may confidently put up his desire for delivery; and no danger can be so desperate, but a man may by prayer be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of it, one way or other, as <hi>Davids</hi> experience teacheth: <hi>I cried unto the Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> being in the cave, halfe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:50629:176"/>
as in a grave, <hi>Saul</hi> and his host being at the mouth of it. 2. He that is acquainted with God, and haunteth his presence by prayer, ordinarily will finde a ready way to go to God, in an extraordinary danger, whereof <hi>David</hi> in this difficulty, sheweth his experience. 3. The uttering of right words, with the voice in prayer, in the time of perplexity, is a work of faith, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose there were so much inward confusion and multitude of thoughts in the minde, as might call in question whether the supplication of so perplexed a minde could be an acceptable prayer: therefore <hi>David</hi> twice mentioneth the uttering of his voice: <hi>I cried with my voice, with my voice.</hi> 4. It is a sweet mercy to have grace to pray to God, and is not only profitable for the present, but also the memory of this mercy is refreshfull afterward, as experience here doth shew. 5. It may be an ease to our minde, when we are full of perplexity, and grief and fear, to tell the Lord what aileth us: <hi>I poured out my complaint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi> 6. To present our confusion and perplexity and trouble of minde, to be looked upon by God, and to be read by him, is a reall prayer or supplication; <hi>I shewed before him my trouble.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>In the prayer, as it is generally propounded; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bodily trouble is able to raise trouble of minde, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conscience also, especially when outward trouble continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth long, and God seemeth to debar prayer from accesse, or not to give answer thereto, as this experience of <hi>David</hi> sheweth, 2. Whatsoever be the trouble of a mans minde, and from what cause soever it ariseth, prayer is the first and readiest meanes of ease and quietnesse, as here we see in <hi>David, Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give eare to my supplication.</hi> 3. The Lords faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and righteousnesse, which serve to terrifie a natural man, are props and pillars of comfort and encouragement unto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, who is fled to the throne of grace: <hi>In thy faithfulnesse an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer me, and in thy righteousnesse.</hi> 4. When the conscience of sin opposeth our prayer, or our hope of delivery out of trouble, it must be answered by flying to Gods grace: and when justice seemeth to pursue us, then the prayer of faith doth change the Court of justice into the Court of grace: for albeit the sinnes of the godly may take peace of conscience from them for a time, yet they cannot debar them from seeking favour and pardon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant of grace, especially when they are stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to serve God, as this example teacheth us: <hi>And enter not into judgement with thy servant.</hi> 5. There is no way of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the works of the Law, neither before regeneration nor after, but only by grace: for <hi>David,</hi> a man of singular holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, saith, <hi>En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ver. 3.</hi> For the enemie hath persecuted my soule, he hath smitten my life down to the ground: he hath made me to dwell in darknesse, as those that have been long dead.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:50629:178"/>The reasons of his prayer are two: the first is taken from the miserable condition, wherein the violence and oppression of the enemie hath driven him, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. the other is, from his careful use of the meanes for finding grace, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. In the first reason; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. After we have fled to Gods mercy, according to the Covenant of grace for remission of sin, we may confidently lay forth all our worldly trouble before God, and hope for relief, as here <hi>David</hi> doth. 2. It is not strange to see the godly in a manner wracked by their persecutors, and undone in their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condition, for so was <hi>David</hi> served: <hi>The enemie hath persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my soul, he hath smitten my life down to the ground, he hath made me dwell in darknesse, as those that have been long dead:</hi> and this he speaketh in regard of his being hunted from place to place, and forced to hide himself in the wildernesse, and at length to take banishment upon him, and to live among idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the land of darknesse. 3. Troubles when they are long continued, are able to daunt the natural courage of the stoutest of Gods servants: for God, for emptying of his owne children of self-conceit, and humbling them in the sense of their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, useth to suffer trouble to have more weight, then they could before-hand apprehend, as here, <hi>Therfore is my spirit overwhelmed within me, my heart within me is desolate.</hi> 4. How heavie so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever trouble be found, and how unable soever we finde our selves to bear it any longer, yet must we not succumbe, nor give over wrestling, but must present our case unto the Lord, as this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample doth teach us.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> I remember the dayes of old, I meditate on all thy works: I muse on the work of thy hands.</p>

            </q>
            <p>From the second reason of his prayer, taken from the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his diligent use of the ordinary meanes, for finding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and relief: <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The remembrance of our own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experience, and of the experience of others of the Saints set down in Scripture, (which should have force to support our faith, albeit we have nothing of our own experience,) is a fit exercise for a fainting soul under trouble, as here we see, <hi>I remember the dayes of old, I meditate on all thy works.</hi> 2. The
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:50629:178"/>
meditation of the works of Creation and Providence, is a fit meanes also to support our faith in Gods Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> albeit we have no example, nor experience of any who had been in the like condition before us: for therein we shall finde the evidence of what the wisdom and Omnipotency of God can do, in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of promises; <hi>I muse on the works of thy hands.</hi> 3. Before we can draw profit by the pledges of Gods power apparent in his works, we must resolve to meditate and muse upon them at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: for a slight look of these will not draw forth the profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able use of them: <hi>I remembered, I meditate, I mused,</hi> saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> 4. With meditation upon Gods works, earnest prayer must be joyned: <hi>I stretch forth my hands unto thee.</hi> 5. When faith seeth not only a promise of help, but also by the experience of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have been helped, a probability also of its coming speed, it raiseth a drought and longing for the fruit of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and keepeth the eye fixed upon God, without looking for relief from any where else; <hi>My soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land.</hi>

            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 7.</hi> Heare me speedily, O LORD, my Spirit faileth, hide not thy face from me: lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.</q>
            <p>In the rest of the Psalme, he presseth this prayer in nine petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more particular: The first is for speedy deliverance; the second for some blink of favour, and both these have their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons adjoyned in this verse. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Sore trouble and long delaying of Gods help, is able to shake faith and weaken courage: <hi>Hear me speedily, O Lord, my heart fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> 2. The beleever must never give over seeking of Gods help, how nigh soever he be to failing and falling off: <hi>Hear me, O Lord, my spirit faileth me.</hi> 3. Faith maketh use of extreme dangers and instant destruction, as of wings to mount it self up unto God; for death and destruction cannot be so nigh, but faith findeth time to flee to its refuge, and run to God, to interpose himself before destruction be executed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s <hi>Hear me speedily, my spirit faileth.</hi> 4. The Lords displeasure apprehended in trouble, is more terrible then the trouble it self, and the least intimation of his favour, is very life and delivery; for, <hi>Hide not thy face from me,</hi> was here <hi>Davids</hi> deepest distresse, and the shewing of the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:50629:179"/>
least blink of Gods favour, should have relieved him. 5. The Lord will not suffer his childrens faith to be over set, albeit he suffer it to be hardly assaulted: <hi>Hide not thy face from me, lest I be like to them that go down to the pit,</hi> or lest I be like to them that perish. 6. The sense of trouble and weaknesse in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, acknowledged before God, is more able to bear them through from under their troubles, then all the stupid stoutness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of contumacious mindes, as the experience of this Champion <hi>David</hi> sheweth unto us.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Cause me to hear thy loving kindnesse in the morning, for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for I lift up my soule unto thee.</q>
            <p>The third petition is, for timous comfort in the Word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: and the fourth is, for direction in the way of Gods obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and both have their reasons adjoyned in this verse. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The consolation which the believer doth seek, is that which is promised in the Word, and he will content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the comfort which cometh by hearing, till the full ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the promise come: <hi>Cause me to hear thy loving kindnesse.</hi> 2. That comfort is indeed early, and sufficiently timous, which cometh before we perish or despair; <hi>Cause me to hear thy loving kindnesse in the morning.</hi> 3. Trusting in God without comfort, is a reason to perswade us we shal have comfort, and the readiest way that can be to come by it: <hi>Cause me to hear thy loving kindnesse: for in thee do I trust.</hi> 4. As it is the believers trouble to be in such perplexity, as not to know how to behave himself in it: so is it a part of his comfort and delivery, to understand what to do next, and how to behave him self: <hi>Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk.</hi> 5. He who seeketh direction from God, must lift up his heart off all diversions, and depend on God only; for, <hi>I lift up my soule to thee,</hi> is the reason of his petition to be directed.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ver. 9.</hi> Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flie unto thee to hide me.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:50629:179"/>The fifth petition is for delivery from his enemies, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reason is added here. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As there is no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, from whom the Lord cannot deliver a man who is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, how potent soever the enemie be: so deliverance from ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> enemies is a fruit of our friendship with God; <hi>Deliver me from mine enemies.</hi> 2. Albeit our enemies had compassed us so, as there were no apparent escape, yet the believer may finde a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place in God; <hi>I flie unto thee to hide me.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>The sixth petition is for grace to walk righteously and holily, till he came to <hi>heaven,</hi> which he calleth <hi>the land of uprightnesse. Whence learn,</hi> 1. In time of trials and troubles men are in no lesse danger of sinning and foul-losing, then they are to fal into further bodily dangers and inconveniencies, and have need, in the sense of their inability, to walk circumspectly, and to seek direction from God: <hi>Teach me to do thy will</hi> 2. The Covenant of grace wherein the believer is entered, giveth ground to pray and hope for the growth of sanctification: <hi>Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God.</hi> 3. We have need of such teaching, as hath with it leading, such direction, as hath with it strengthening un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obedience, such information as doth direct us, not only in the general rule, but also how to apply it in particular actions, and which doth not leave us in any part of our dutie to our selves: <hi>Teach me, lead me.</hi> 4. Heaven is the land of uprightnesse, and we must have the Lords constant teaching, and his constant leading of us, till we be possessed of heaven; <hi>Lead me into the land of uprightnesse.</hi> 5. The teacher and leader of believers, in the obedience of Gods Word and Will, is the Spirit of God, whose goodnesse must be opposed to our natural sinfulnesse and ill deserving: <hi>Thy Spirit is good, lead me into the land of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse.</hi>

Albeit believers be subject to soul-fainting and deadnesse, yet they retain life spiritual in such a measure, as maketh them still sensible of their own weaknesse, and able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan themselves unto God, who is able to revive them; <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me, O Lord.</hi> 2. It concerneth God in his honour, to revive the spirits of the contrite ones, when they have their recourse unto him; <hi>Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Names sake.</hi> 3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Lord acquaint his children with trouble, yet he will not suffer them to lie still in trouble, but will in due time set them free; <hi>Bring my soule out of trouble.</hi> 4. The Lord will have his justice not terrible to his children in trouble, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and a pawne of their delivery from their oppressors: <hi>For thy righteousnesse sake, bring my soul out of trouble.</hi>

The enemies of the righteous who are persecuted for righteousnesse, shall perish: <hi>Cut off mine enemies, destroy them all.</hi> 2.

               <p>THis Psalme is altogether of praises, every verse beginning with a several letter of the Hebrew, <hi>A, B, C,</hi> from the first to the last: wherein <hi>David</hi> stirreth up himself to the work of Gods praise somewhat more generally, from the beginning to <hi>v.</hi> 8. and from the eighth verse, he praiseth God more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, giving ten arguments of praise, unto the last verse, and closeth the Psalme with the engaging of himself anew again, and exhortation of others to follow the song for ever.</p>
               <p>From the Inscription, which is <hi>A Psalme of praise; Learne,</hi> 1. It is our duty, and a point of spiritual wisdom, to set aside all particulars of our own, and go about the work of praising God only, as this Psalme teacheth us. 2. The praises of God are able to fill all the volumes in the world, and what composition of letters can be made in any language: and this the going tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all the letters of the Hebrew <hi>A, B, C,</hi> giveth us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. 3. It is expedient to commit to memory some select Psalmes, especially about Gods praises, for to help memory: The wisdom of God hath ordered this, and some other Psalmes, so as the order of the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet may help the memory not a little.</p>

theme, which the Lord giveth his people to study and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: <hi>They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> 6.

            <p>The second reason of Gods praise, is his bounty generally unto all his creatures, and that for mans sake. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord is good and kinde to all men, even the wicked not excepted: <hi>The Lord is good to all.</hi> 2. Gods mercy may be seen toward man, in the continuation of the whole course of the creatures, which being defiled by mans sinne, he might in justice have abolished, or made them either uselesse to man, or else in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of his grief: <hi>His tender mercies are over all his workes.</hi>

            <p>The third reason of Gods praise, is the glory of his works, which do furnish matter unto the Saints to blesse God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit all men were silent, the Lords works one and all, shall speak each of them in their own kinde, to the praise of God. <hi>All thy works shall praise thee, O God.</hi> 2. Albeit every man doth not make use of Gods goodnesse and works, but most men do smother the glory of God in their atheisme, yet the Lord hath a number who have found grace in his eyes, who shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Gods goodnesse, both to the creatures and to themselves, and shall blesse him upon that account; <hi>And thy Saints shall blesse thee.</hi>

            <p>The sixth reason of Gods praise, is from his care and sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the weakest of the subjects of the Kingdome of grace. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit none of the subjects of the Kingdome of grace, are freed from the danger of falling into sin, and into trouble; yet they are preserved that they fall not so deep as the bottome of sinning unto death, or perishing in their troubles: for God interposeth himselfe to prevent their perdition: <hi>The Lord upholdeth all that fall.</hi> 2. So many of the subjects of the Kingdome of grace, as feel their own weaknesse and inability to stand under the burden, either of sinne or trouble or both, do finde God a supporter of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a comforter of them, and a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer of them: <hi>He raiseth up all them that be bowed down.</hi>

            <p>The seventh reason of Gods praise, is his particular care to maintaine the life of every living creature, so long as he pleaseth to lend it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

            <p>The ninth reason of Gods praise, is for his hearing the prayer of needy supplicants. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord loveth the praise, which ariseth unto him, from his goodness to his people, and citizens of his Church, more then any other points of his praise: as the often falling upon the praising of God from this ground doth shew. 2. Albeit God be every where present, yet there is a sort of more friendly presence, which God giveth to them that worship him, then that which is his common presence every where; and this is the nearnesse of grace and friendship: <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that call on him.</hi> 3. As God will have his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious presence opened up, and manifested to his worshippers, by prayer, so will he have this favour alike patent to all that pray unto him, and seek him without exception of persons: <hi>The Lord is nigh to all them that call upon him.</hi> 4. Because there is a counterfeit and false sort of worshipping, and calling upon God, which is debarred from the benefit of this promise, to wit, when the party supplicant is not reconciled, nor seeking recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation through Christ the Mediator, or is seeking something not promised, or something for a carnall end, that he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it on his lusts: therefore he who hath right unto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the Lord answer not the prayer of the man that feareth him, at first, yet when he calleth in earnest, when he is in trouble, in straits and hazard, he will answer him, and close his exercise with salvation: <hi>He also will hear their crie, and will save them.</hi>

            <p>He closeth the Psalme with a promise to praise the Lord yet more, and exhorteth all men to blesse him for ever. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When a man hath said all he can in Gods praise, he shall finde himselfe come short of his duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his obligation to praise God to be still lying on him, as this example of <hi>David</hi> in the close of the Psalme doth shew us. 2. The Lord will be praised in our spirits, and outwardly in our words and externall expressions also; <hi>My mouth shall speak the praises of the Lord.</hi> 3.

            <p>From the stirring up of others and himselfe to praise God; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

            <p>In the forbidding of carnall confidence; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. What a man doth most trust in, that he esteemeth most of, and praiseth it in his heart most: therefore doth the Psalmist set us upon God, as on the right object of trust, and diverteth us from the wrong, that he may teach us to make God the only object of praise. 2. Because the maine object of our carnall confidence naturally, is man in power, who seemeth able to do for us, able to promote us to dignity and riches, and to keep us up in some state in the world, therefore must we throw down this idol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For encouraging of us yet more to believe in God, who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe to be reconciled with us, and to be our God in Christ, he giveth other ten motives: and as every one of them is a point of Gods praise, so is it a prop and pillar to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the believers faith. The first motive to believe in God, and first reason of Gods praise, is, his omnipotency and al suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, made manifest by the work of creation, and preservation of all creatures: <hi>Which made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that therein is.</hi> 2. The second motive to believe in God, is
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:50629:189"/>
another point of Gods praise, to wit, his faithfulnesse in making and keeping Covenant, and performing his promises unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting: <hi>Which keepeth truth for ever.</hi> 3. The third point of Gods praise, and prop of faith, is this, albeit the Lord, for the glory of his Name, and good of his own people, do suffer the godly to be persecuted and oppressed also, yet he will plead the cause and controversie of the believer, and will deliver the oppressed, and punish the oppressor: <hi>Which executeth judgement for the oppressed.</hi> 4. The fourth point of Gods praise, and pillar of faith, is this, albeit the Lord suffer the believer to feel the need of what is needfull for soul or body, yet he doth not suffer him to starve for want of what is necessary: <hi>He giveth food to the hungry.</hi> 5. The fifth point of Gods praise, is, albeit the believer may, for his sinnes or for trial of his faith, be cast in prison, and brought in bondage, yet the Lord will loose his bonds; <hi>The Lord looseth the prisoners.</hi> 6. The sixth point of Gods praise is, albeit the believer may be in darknesse of trouble, and anxiety of minde for a time, and knoweth not what to do, yet the Lord will shew him deliverance, and give him direction and comfort: <hi>The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind.</hi> 7. The seventh reason of Gods praise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to trust in him is, that howsoever the burden of trouble may over-power the believer, and make him walk hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily under discouragement, yet the Lord will renew strength and comfort, and delivery unto him: <hi>The Lord raiseth them that are bowed down.</hi> 8. The eighth reason to praise God, and eighth encouragement to trust in God, is the believer who is fled to the righteousnesse of the Mediator for his justification, and studieth to a holy and righteous conversation, may be sure he is free from the curse, approved of God, and shall finde the fruits of Gods good will to him: <hi>The Lord loveth the righteous.</hi> 9. The ninth reason of Gods p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the true Church are oft-times scattered one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not only by common judgements, but also by persecution and schismes, that they cannot keep that sweet communion one with another which is to be wished, but God is the only gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and uniter of them, after whatsoever sort of scattering: <hi>He gathereth together the out-casts of Israel.</hi>

            <p>The third reason of Gods praise is, for his care of the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed believer, when by trouble outward, or inward, or both he is wounded in spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The fourth reason of the exhortation to praise God is, his particular knowledge of every thing, which doth transcend the capacity of men, and to them is impossible: <hi>He telleth the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the stars, and calleth them all by their names.</hi> In which si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude he sheweth also, that albeit <hi>

            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Great <hi>is</hi> our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.</q>
            <p>The fifth reason of Gods praise is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because in his attributes he is incomprehensible, namely in his dominion over all, in power, to do all, and in his wisdom to contrive whatsoever we stand in
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:50629:191"/>
need of, so that nothing can be against us, but he is above it; nothing can be needful for us, but his wisdom can devise the meanes to bring it to us, and his power doth put his will in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for our good; <hi>Great is the Lord, his power it great, his understanding is infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> The LORD lifteth up the meek: he cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wicked down to the ground.</q>
            <p>The sixth reason is, from his different dealing with the godly and the wicked: as for the godly, who in the meeknesse of a subdued spirit, do submit themselves under the mighty hand of God, he comforteth them and relieveth them: but he abaseth the proud who do not stand in awe of his Majesty: <hi>The Lord lifteth up the meek, but he casteth the wicked down to the ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving: sing praise upon the Harp unto our God.</q>
            <p>The second exhortation unto praise and thanksgiving, in cheerfulnesse and joy, is expressed with three reasons. In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; <hi>Learn,</hi> The whole works of God, each of them in their own way, call (as it were) for our estimation and praising of the workmanship which we see, they call for our answer, as it were, and our duty requireth of us, joyfully to make answer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the call, (as the Word importeth) in praising the Maker, and thanking him for the use and benefit which we have of his works: <hi>Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving, sing praise upon the harp unto our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth raine for the earth: who maketh grasse to grow upon the mountaines.</q>
            <p>The first reason of the second exhortation is, from his wise disposing of the clouds. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Sometime the Lord
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:50629:191"/>
hideth the glory of the open heaven with clouds, that it may appear again, with so much more new, fresh and pleasant lustre: <hi>He covereth the Heaven with clouds.</hi> 2. The change which God maketh upon the face of the Heaven by dark clouds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the inhabitants of the earth: <hi>He prepareth raine for the earth.</hi> 3. The Lord taketh care of the most barren parts of the earth, to make them, by raining on them, more pleasant and profitable, then otherwayes they could be: <hi>He maketh grasse to grow upon the mountaines.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> He giveth to the beast his food: <hi>and</hi> to the young ravens which cry.</q>
            <p>The second reason of the second exhortation to praise God is, from the Lords care of beasts and fowles, whereby he giveth men to understand, that he hath a far greater care of them: <hi>He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legges of a man.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <hi>11.</hi> The LORD taketh pleasure in them that feare him: in those that hope in his mercy.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The third reason of the second exhortation is, because God esteemeth very little of those things wherein men naturally do put confidence, whether their own strength or the strength of any creature, such as horses are, whereof men do make most use: but he taketh pleasure in the godly, who do fear him, and do hope in him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Men have more objects of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal confidence, then the idol of the power of Princes, or of the multitude of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollowers: for before man want an idol, he will idolize his own strength, or the strength of an horse, and put confidence therein, as the slight estimation which God hath of these confidences, and the discharge of putting confidence in them do insinuate. 2. Wherein soever a man delighteth most, and puts most confidence, that is the mans idol, and that which the man doth bring in competition with God, as the Lords dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:50629:192"/>
of taking delectation or pleasure in the creature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of discharging to esteem of it, or put trust in it, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. 3. God esteemeth of no man for his riches, honour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of horse and foot, nor for his bodily strength: <hi>He delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.</hi> 4. The only right object of our joy, pleasure and confidence, is God himself, as the opposition doth teach us: such as both beleeve in God, and fear to offend him, are the only men acceptable to God, in whom God delighteth, and taketh pleasure to keep communion with them; <hi>The Lord taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy</hi>; and by consequence such as do not fear him, and who, when they are overtaken in a transgression, do not run to him for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the hope of mercy; <hi>He taketh no pleasure in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Praise the LORD, O Ierusalem: praise thy God, O Zion.</q>
            <p>In the third exhortation to praise God, expressely directed to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> representing the Church in all ages; <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>earn,</hi> 1. Albeit all the earth be obliged to praise God, yet only the Lords people are the right estimators of his glory, and the fit proclaimers of his praise: <hi>Praise the Lord, O Ierusalem.</hi> 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit all the creatures are the Lords, yet the Church is the Lords in a more nigh relation; for the Church may claim interest in God as her own by Covenant; <hi>Praise thy God, O Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For he hath strengthened the barres of thy gates, he hath blessed thy children within thee.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <hi>14.</hi> He maketh peace <hi>in</hi> thy border: <hi>and</hi> filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The reasons for the third exhortation are six, whereof foure are in these verses. The first is, the Lord hath fenced his Church with walls, gates and barres, that the gates of hell cannot prevail against it: <hi>He hath strengthened the barres of thy gates,</hi> to wit, by interposing of his Omnipotent power for her preservation. 2. The second reason of praise is, that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:50629:192"/>
one generation to follow another in his Church, and the children to be in greater number then their forefathers, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding daily unto the Church such as are to be saved; <hi>He hath blessed thy children within thee:</hi> not only in regard of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of them, but also by making them to abound in all knowledge and grace. 3. The third reason of praise is, that the true members of the Church have peace with God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, in that measure which is expedient for her good: <hi>He maketh peace in thy borders.</hi> 4. The fourth reason is, because he feedeth his people with food convenient, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in regard of their spiritual nourishment, in giving them the bread of life, whereof the finest floure is but a similitude; <hi>He filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> He sendeth forth his commandment <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> earth: his Word runneth very swiftly.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <hi>16.</hi> He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoare frost like ashes.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <hi>17.</hi> He casteth forth his ice likt morsels: who can stand before his cold?</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <hi>18.</hi> He sendeth out his Word and melteth them: he causeth his winde to blow, <hi>and</hi> the waters flow.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The fifth reason of the third exhortation unto Gods praise, is taken from Gods powerful ruling of the least changes in the clouds, and in the aire, in making foule wearher and faire, frost and fresh weather, as he pleaseth, by which similitude he will have his people to understand, that the Lord ruleth with a more special eye all the changes which fall out in the external condition of the Church. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The course of the creatures, and the changes in them, even unto the least meteor or change, which is to be seen in the clouds or in the aire, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly directed and governed of God, whose will is a law to the creature, and whose command hath ready execution: <hi>He sendeth forth his Commandment upon earth, his Word runneth very swiftly.</hi> 2. The least change of weather, by snow or frost, or ice, is by Gods dispensation and appointment, much more any change of affaires in his Church; <hi>He giveth snow like wool, he scattereth the hoare frost like ashes, he casteth forth
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:50629:193"/>
his ice like morsels.</hi> 3. The consequents and effects of the changes which God doth make, as well in one case as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could not be endured if God should not temper them, and provide some remedy against them, as appeareth in the making of frost: <hi>Who can stand before his cold?</hi> 4. Before any change from frost to faire weather can be made, a new order must come forth from the Lord, and when that cometh, aire and water do return to their former course, and so it is in any other change in the world, especially in the affaires of the Church; <hi>He send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out his Word, and melteth them: he causeth the winde to blow, and the waters flow.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> He sheweth his Word unto Iacob: his statutes and his judgements unto Israel.</p>
               <p n="20">
                  <hi>20.</hi> He hath not dealt so with any Nation, and as for <hi>his</hi> judgements they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The sixth reason of the third exhortation to praise God is, from the different dealing of God with his Church, and with the rest of the people of the world. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Scriptures, and the opening up and application of them, unto the edification of the hearers, is a precious gift of God: and this benefit the Lord hath bestowed on his Church, called by the names of <hi>Iacob</hi> or <hi>Israel; He sheweth his Word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iacob, his statutes and his judgements unto Israel.</hi> 2. The benefit of the Scriptures, and revealing the Word of life unto the Church, maketh Gods people in a better condition, and more excellent then any other incorporation can be in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>He hath not dealt so with any Nation.</hi> 3. Where the Word of God in his Scripture is not opened up, there the Lords dealing with men in justice and mercie, and the way which the Lord keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in ruling of the world, is not understood, but people there do live in deadly darknesse; <hi>As for his judgments they have not known them.</hi> 4. As the benefits bestowed upon the Church are most excellent, so the Church is most bound to praise God, both for those mercies, and for all other his glorious works: <hi>Praise ye the Lord.</hi>

            <p>In the exhortation to praise God because of his glory shining in the Heavens; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Howsoever the glory of the Lord doth shine in all his works, yet there are degrees of the shining of it, and the chiefest glory is from celestial creatures, and from the consideration of what is in heaven: <hi>Praise ye the Lord, praise ye the Lord from the Heavens.</hi> 2. As God is praised in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the blessed spirits that are there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so the true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:50629:194"/>
should joyne with those that praise him there: <hi>Praise him in the heights,</hi> or high places. 3. Albeit the Angels have the first place in the song of Gods praise, and need not to be stirred to the work of praise by us, yet it is a part of our praising of God, to consent unto their song, and account their work well bestowed on the Lord their M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord hath at his hand swift servants not a few, to go in what message he pleaseth to direct them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they are ministring spirits for the good of his Church; <hi>Praise ye him, all ye his Angels,</hi> or his messengers. 5. The Lord is also well furnished with soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for all his creatures are ready at his command, to fight in Gods quarrel, in defence of his friends, and pursuit of his foes: <hi>Praise ye him all his hostes.</hi> 6. The Lords armies are not idle, but are still on their work of praising, doing the works of peace even in the midst of warre: <hi>Praise him all his hostes.</hi> 7. Beside the common song of praise, which all things have as they are creatures, every one of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have their own proper parts in the Song: The Sun in his particular vertue and motion, the Moon in hers, and the stars in theirs, every one by themselves, and these also joyntly make up a sweet and harmonious melody, to the praise of God; <hi>Praise ye him Sun and Moon, praise him all ye star: of light.</hi> 8. The variety and difference of place and distance from the earth, of Sun, Moon and Starres, some of them being lower, some of them higher, as the Eclipses of Sun and Moon, and the diverse positions of the starres do shew, are all matters of Gods praise: for the lowest region of the aire is here called <hi>Heaven</hi>; and the place where the Sun, Moon and Starres are set, is called <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the Heaven of Heavens, the third Heaven, where Angels and spirits of just men made perfect do remain, each and all of them do serve fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The bottles of waters in the clouds, flying above the lowest region of the aire, ready to be dissolved here and there, as God pleaseth to water the earth, do serve as matter, both of wondering at Gods work, and praising of him: <hi>Praise him ye waters that be above the Heavens.</hi> 10. Praise is due to God, not only for the making of the Heavens, but also for the making them of nothing, by the sole word of command, which did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, by saying; <hi>Let them be: let them praise the Name of the Lord; for he commanded, and they were created.</hi> 11.

speechlesse creatures have their own way of praising God, and men have their way of praising: speechlesse creatures praise God in their own kinde, when they hold forth, as in a table, the matter and reason of praising God, and men do praise God, when they do observe and acknowledge, and proclaim one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the reasons of Gods praise, and these exhortations do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port both; <hi>Let them praise the Name of the Lord.</hi> 12.

The changes which are made in the clouds or in the aire, by stormes or tempests, or whatsoever way, come not by chance, but are all directed forth by God, for some intent of his: and in what work he doth employ them, they faile not to execute his will: <hi>Fire and haile, snow and vapour, stormie winde fulfilling his Word</hi>: and out of those changes praises do arise unto God. 4.

of the face thereof with trees, some taller, some lower and smaller, some barren, some fruitful, contributeth much to the praise of God: <hi>Mountaines and all hills, fruitful trees and all Cedars.</hi> 5.

            <p>From the third and fourth exhortation; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the Lords command, that his people rejoyce in himselfe, with a joy above all the joy which they can have in the creatures, which God hath given to them, that they may the more chearfully praise him: <hi>Let Israel rejoyce in him.</hi> 2. The Church of the elect and renewed Saints, is the special workmanship of Gods grace, not only as his creatures, but also as his new creatures, created in Christ Jesus unto good works: <hi>Let Israel rejoyce in him that made him.</hi> 3. The Church is a peculiar Kingdome by it selfe, whereof God is King in a peculiar way, able to govern his people by his Word, discipline and Spirit, and to defend his Church, and all his own ordinances therein, to the comfort of all the true members thereof: <hi>Let the children of Sion be joyful in their King.</hi>

The joy of the believer, is a great and growing joy, arising from rejoycing, in the former verse, to exulting, in this verse, signified by <hi>dancing: Let them praise his Name in the dance.</hi> 2.

            <p>Of these exhortations he giveth two reasons. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord loveth believers and repenteth not, but resteth in his love, and taketh pleasure in his workmanship upon them: <hi>The Lord taketh pleasure in his people.</hi> 2.

Whatsoever matter of joy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers or true Saints have in God, yet they are acquainted with as much affliction in the world, as emptieth them of rejoycing in themselves; humbleth them, and subdueth their spirits, and maketh them to aime and endeavour without fretting or grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to digest all the Lords dispensations toward them, and for this cause the believers, or Saints, are called <hi>meek.</hi> 4. Albeit the affliction wherewith the godly are acquainted, doth obscure their blessednesse, and hide the beauty thereof before the world, yet God in love to them, oft-times wipeth off the black and blemish of affliction, by giving them glorious deliveries, and at length he giveth to them full salvation: <hi>He will beautifie the meek with salvation.</hi>

The believers are in a fort executioners of this vengeance, because they as doomsters, do take the sentence from the mouth of God, the just Judge, and pronounce doom on them, whereupon, in the set time followeth execution; the Word of God falling on them in effect, as a sharp sword to cut them asunder: thus the truth and justice of God, with his other attributes, all being parts of his praise, <hi>Are a two-edged sword in their hands, to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the people.</hi> 4. The greatest Monarchs, Rulers and Judges among men, are subjected unto the Word of God, and must be bound either to the beliefe and obedience of it, or unto the punishment and vengeance pronounced against the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors thereof, so fast as if they were bound in strongest fetters: for the praise of God in the mouth of his Saint, are, <hi>To binde their kings with chaines, and their nobles with fetters of iron.</hi> 5. The Lords children and Saints must not do wrong to Kings or Nobles, or to any man else; they must neither pronounce nor execute judgement according as they please, but as the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:50629:198"/>
Word of God prescribeth or alloweth: for here they are tied, <hi>To execute nothing upon them, save the judgement written.</hi> 6. These priviledges are spirituall and common to all believers, who according to their places and callings, whether publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, may for their own comfort, and for others edification, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly apply the Word of God to themselves, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their enemies: for, <hi>This honour have all his Saints,</hi> and therefore they ought in a special manner to blesse God for their priviledges: <hi>Praise ye the Lord.</hi>

The first and the last exhortation is to all, to praise God absolutely, without giving any motive more then his very Name importeth, which indeed is a sufficient reason: for seeing the Lord is God, who hath his being of himself: and all the creatures have their being of him, and dependance on him, it followeth of necessity, that he is praise worthy in himself, and deserveth to be praised by all his creatures. The second, third, fourth and fifth exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have reasons and motives annexed unto them, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his praise, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.

            </q>
            <p>From these exhortations which have motives annexed to them; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The holinesse of God, (which is the unstained clearness and untainted glory of all his attributes, such as are his wisdom, power, justice, mercy, and all the rest of his properties mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture) is the subject of the Saints praising of God in the Church, and of Spirits praising of him in heaven; for the word in the Original doth bear, <hi>Praise the Lord in his holinesse, in hls Sanctuary, in heaven his holy place.</hi> 2. The holinesse of God should be mainly looked unto by all men, who are about to praise him, that our hearts and mouthes may be rightly framed for so high a service, and we may beware to take his Name in vain: for he will be sanctified of all that draw near unto him, especially in the work of praise: <hi>Praise God in his holinesse.</hi> 3. Matter of praise is furnished to us, in the wisdom and power of God, which is to be seen in the creatures, and particularly in the frame of the stories of heaven; in the first whereof, his power supports the huge weight of waters in the clouds; in the second, the stars and planets move, and make their circles constantly; and in the third, Heavens, Angels, and Spirits of just men made perfect do praise God; <hi>Praise him in the firmament of his power.</hi> 4. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of praising God is furnished by his manifold mighty acts, to be seen in the powerful sustaining, ruling and employing of all his creatures, as he seeth fittest for his own glory, for the building of his Church, delivering of her from dangers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing of her enemies; <hi>Praise the Lord for his mighty acts.</hi> 5. Matter of praising God is furnished in his wonderful great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and in the rayes of excellency, shining in all his dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and manner of governing the world, sustaining some indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual creatures, which are still the same, from the Creation, and multiplying others in their kinde, to the astonishment of a serious beholder; <hi>Praise him according to his excellent great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>

            <p>Here are other six exhorrations, teaching the manner of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God under the shadow of typical musick, appointed in the Ceremonial Law. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Albeit the typical Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of musical instruments in Gods publick worship, belonging to the paedagogie of the Church, in her minority before Christ, be now abolished with the rest of the Ceremonies: yet the moral duties shadowed forth by them, are still to be studied, because this duty of praising God, and praising him with all our minde, strength and soule is moral, whereunto we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually obliged. 2. The variety of musical instruments, some of them made use of in the Campe, as trumpets; some of them more suitable to a peaceable condition, as Psalteries and Harps; some of them sounding by blowing winde in them; some of them sounding by lighter touching of them, as string<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed instruments; some of them by beating on them more sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Tabrets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Drums and Cymbals; some of them sounding, by touching and blowing also, as Organs: all of them giving some certain sound, some more quiet, and some making more noise: some of them having a harmonie by themselves; some of them making a Consort with other instruments, or with the motions of the body in dancings, some of them serving for one use, some of them serving for another, and all of them serving to set forth Gods glory, and to shadow forth the duty of worshippers, and the priviledges of the Saints: The plurality and variety, (I say) of these instruments, were fit to represent divers conditions of the spiritual man, and of the greatnesse of the joy to be found in God, and to teach what stirring up should be of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and powers of our soul, and one of another, unto Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; what harmonie should be among worshippers of God, what melodie each should make in himself, singing to God with grace in his heart, and to shew the excellency of Gods praise, which no meanes nor instrument, nor any expression of the body joyned thereto, could sufficiently set forth: and thus much is figured forth in these exhortations to praise God with

               <hi>Ver. 6.</hi> Let every thing that hath breath, praise the LORD: Praise ye the LORD.</q>
            <p>In the twelfth exhortation, pointing at the party called upon to praise God; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Living creatures, which draw breath and give unto, and take from God their life afresh every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their breathing, do above all visible creatures speak most to the praise of Gods wisdom &amp; power in framing and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them: <hi>Let every thing that hath breath, praise the Lord.</hi> 2. Of all living creatures, men are most bound to praise God, as they in whom God in the Creation, and in their several ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, from age to age, did and doth breath the Spirit of life, and of all men those are most bound to praise God, on whom he hath bestowed his holy Spirit: and howsoever the Lords works in all men shall speak to his praise, how wicked soever men shall be, yet only renewed souls, in whom God hath breathed his Spirit, as the word <hi>breath</hi> in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal may bear, shall voluntarily and sincerely praise God: <hi>Let every thing that hath breath, praise the Lord.</hi> 3. The Spirit of the Lord, when he gave the Psalmes to the Church of the Jewes, had an eye toward the rest of the world, of whom he was in his appointed time to exact this Song of praise: and so we who are Gentiles, brought unto the society of the Church, are bound to joyne in the work with them; and when we are joyned, and when all who are to be converted are joyned, yet are we all too few, to bear up this Song of Gods praise; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to shew this, it is said, <hi>Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord.</hi> 4. When we have said all we are able to say for Gods praise, we are but to begin again anew; for this are we taught by the renewing of the exhortation, in the close of sundry Psalmes, and here also, at the end of all the Psalms: <hi>Praise ye the Lord.</hi> And after us must all the creatures come in their own kinde and order, to offer up praise also, as we are taught, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 12. where after that elect Angels and Saints, whose number was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, had sung their Song, saying, <hi>With a loud voice, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

is the Lamb, that was slaine, to receive power and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. Then it followeth,</hi> v. 13. <hi>And every creature which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory and Power, be unto him that sitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lambe for ever and ever.</hi>
