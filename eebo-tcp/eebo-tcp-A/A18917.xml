            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Christ Iesus, I answere:<note n="*" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>The liuing God is a Sauiour of all
men, specially of them that beleeue.</hi> His mercie is vpon all the
creatures. Not the vilest Barbarian, but he suffreth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Sunne and Ayre to shine and breath vpon. When
the mercies of God are called into question, euery mouth
shall be stopped. But howsoeuer he is a Sauiour of all men,
yet he hath a speciall saluation for the faithfull, as <hi>S. Paul</hi>
teacheth <hi>Timothie.</hi> Howsoeuer he affordeth blessings to all,
yet in a speciall forme he blesseth the Beleeuer. For as they
call for his sauing fauour in the vse of all his creatures, so
they haue it in their much and little, in their health and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
in their life and death. These vse the Creature, with
assurance of a peculiar blessing, when the other eate, drinke,
and apply it with a peculiar curse; Now, we are not to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for the temporary blessing sauced onely with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
mercie, (for then we goe no further then the dogge in
his eating of grasse, for easing his stomacke) but to labour
with the Lord by prayer for his speciall blessing our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
in the vse of these creatures: leauing the issue tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potarie
to his will, which is holy in all things.</p>
            <p>A true Christian walketh thus in common diet, and
vsuall infirmities, how much more doth it stand him in
hand, to looke to his carriage towards God, in respect of
this Pest or Pestilence? A theists, meere Naturians and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant persons, do hold it to be a natural disease, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from naturall causes onely: as from corruption of
ayre, caused by vnseasonable Planets aboue, or else from
carrionly stinking smelles here belowe. Who while they
looke not higher then the earth, or not higher then the
Planets, do sticke in the Creature, forgetting the Creator
(called the<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 84 1.</note> 
               <hi>Lord of hostes</hi>) who commaunds or forbids,

                  <hi>GAlenistes]</hi> So called of <hi>Galen</hi> a Gréek Heathen Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
This kind of Plague or Pestilence is of him tearmed
<hi>Loimos,</hi> respecting onely Bodies bursting out in corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which may be cause sometimes of corrupting other bodies:
specially such as are inclinable <hi>to</hi> and capable <hi>of</hi> such corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And this is it, that some Christians vnderstand, when they
say, that the Pestilence is as a <hi>Candle,</hi> and bodies as <hi>strawe,</hi>
some wet, some dry, more or lesse capable of taking fire. And
this is true, but not all the truth, nor yet in the first sence which
is Diuine, whereof I shall speake somewhat after. To stick
therfore in this consideration, is to speake rather after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Naturalls then of Diuines. And who dare speake rather
after the maner of man, then after the vncontrowlable forme of
the Holy Ghost?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The dead creature can giue to him no life:]</hi> Because
the dead creature cannot of it selfe vinifie the bodie, therefore the
Christian is taught to looke vp to God the Author of life: who,
as he hath promised to euerie Belieuer the thing that is good
calling for it by prayer; so, such a praying belieuer ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the veritie of his promise, séeing he is faithfull that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised:
for, <hi>Godlines is profitable to all things, which hath
promise of the life present and of that is to come, 1 Tim. 4,
8.</hi> without Godlines, many are partakers of some Spiritual
and all sorts of Corporall giuings, without diuine direct
promise, and therefore such giuings do finally turne into bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
vexation of spirit, and the iust heaping vp of iudgement.</p>

            <head>SECTION. II.</head>
            <p>THe word <hi>Plague,</hi> is originally a Greeke word: for <hi>Plege</hi>
it is termed in <hi>Reuelation.</hi> 16. 9. and of the Latines
<hi>Plaga,</hi> in English valuing a <hi>blowe</hi> or stripe. Which, as it may
haue a more generall vse, so, it is not applyed to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
disease of the Pest, otherwise, then because it is a blowe
or stripe inflicted on mankind. By whom? By God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
mediately by spirit, or corruption, or both. The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of God &amp; <hi>Adam</hi> in the old Testament, doth terme it
<hi>Deber</hi> (as in <hi>Exod. 3. 3. Deu. 28 21. Psal 91. 36 2. Sam</hi> 24. 13.) of
<hi>Dabar</hi> to speake, whether it be a speech of life or death. And
so it is termed I doubt not because it is an effect of the Lords
<hi>Word</hi> for sinne, according to his threatning in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 21.</p>
            <p>Let the word be so considered in the two sacred lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
of the old and new Testament, and the Plague is
no other maladie, then a speciall blowe inflicted on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
for sinne. I speake not of it, as it seizeth on beasts, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it commeth to them by Mankindes sinne. Sinne is the
cause why the Lord (according to his word) <hi>smiteth</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
whether corruption be in the way or not. Doth
God send out a Spirit to smite (as <hi>Dauids</hi> people in 2. <hi>Sam.
24.</hi> were smit by a good Angell, but <hi>Iob</hi> before with a bad)
the Spirit smiteth not but vpon the Lords word, <hi>smite</hi> or
<hi>touch:</hi> in which respect it is called <hi>Negagn</hi> in <hi>Psal</hi> 91. 10. of
<hi>Nagagn</hi> to touch: Although the terme <hi>Negagn</hi> may well
imply a plague or stripe lesse piercing and killing.</p>
            <p>The stroke of God, it is for sinne. And smiteth he with
his owne finger immediately, or mediately as by the hand
of an other?<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 29. 29.</note> 
               <hi>The secret things belong vnto the Lord,</hi> nor
will I meddle with what hee doth beyond the words reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
In <hi>Leuiticus</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. hee threatneth varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of plagues for sin; but concealeth the particular meanes
which hee will vse for accomplishing that word. In other
places we read of his Angell smiting people til the Lord did
<pb facs="tcp:15498:5"/>
stay, but that euer he made Corruption his messenger I
read not: and yet I doubt not but God may haue vsed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in the ministry of his Angell, for correcting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
the corrupt creature. But why in such discourse,
hath the spirit of God still mentioned only God for Agent,
and the Angell for Instrument? Because we should in such
cases, looke first to God, as he that is all in all: secondly, to
the ministrie of his Angels, who are appointed to preserue
such from the plague as commit themselues<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 91. 1. 11.</note> in <hi>their wayes
to the protection of God all sufficient.</hi> A doctrine full opposite
to our practise, who cast our eye more to acryall corruption,
then vnto God and his Angell smiting.</p>

to the second Sestion.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe word plague]</hi> Séeing there can be no true dispute
where the thing to be disputed vpon is vncertainlie or
doubtfully vnderstoode, I therefore in the second Section,
haue laboured to cleare <hi>what the Plague may be. Plague</hi> (and
so Pestilence) is a word of large vse, but in this dispute applied
to a certaine disease extraordinarily mortall and deadly: yea, a
disease now amongst vs, confessed by our Physitians, to excéed
the compasse and reache of all their naturall reason and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
No maruell, séeing that which is primordiall and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
in it, is spirituall and inuisible. What that is, the Diuine
Scriptures do teach, when not only they shewe that <hi>Sinne</hi> is
the prouoking cause (and specially, sinne vniversall) but also do
shewe that it is a <hi>stroke</hi> inflicted from without, and that by the
ministrie of an Angell, appointed so by <hi>Iehouahs</hi> expresse
<hi>word:</hi> for which the Hebrewes do vse the very same letters
<hi>(Deber)</hi> for <hi>word</hi> and <hi>Pestilence.</hi> And herevpon it is, that the
Hebrues turne the word <hi>Deber</hi> by <hi>Logos,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. so well

the scriptures to teach vs the former Super-naturall stroke,
but also diuerse so smitten, haue felt and heard the noyse of a
blow; and some of them haue vpon such a blow found the plain

of sundrie such, I my selfe this sicknes time haue preached.
Such a stroke, was to put vs in mind of <hi>Iehouahs</hi> Angell smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;

            <p>SInne being the cause for which he smiteth a people with
Pestilence (sinne poisoning earth, ayre and all) some will
demaund, if so it cannot be preuented or cured with
change of place and vse of Physicke? By changing place
they thinke they may,<note place="margin">Pron. 22. 3. &amp; 27. 12.</note> because it is written, <hi>A prudent man se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the plague and hideth himselfe.</hi> And by physicke they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they may, because that sundry (of their knowledge)
haue so escaped.</p>
            <p>For the diuine prouerbe, they abuse it two waies. Once in
vnderstading the word <hi>Plague</hi> for Pestilence. Though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
pestilence be a plague, yet euery plague is not a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
Nor doth the originall word properly signifie the
one or the other. It is <hi>Ragnah,</hi> valuing the Latine <hi>Malum,</hi>
in English <hi>Euill,</hi> as in an other forme it is aptly turned into:
<hi>Prou.</hi> 14. 16. For the Translator, howsoeuer hee leaue the
proper signification of the word, hee yet speaketh to good
purpose, seeing the holy Ghost there speaketh of such an
<note n="*" place="margin">Amos 3. 6.</note> euill in the citie as the Lord doth: that is, of such a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as the Lord inflicteth; called an euill of mankinde,
though properly a correction or punishment of euill And
secondly, such Excepters abuse the Prouerbe, in saying, they
may flye from the place with the prudent man. <hi>Salomon</hi>
saith not that such a one flyeth, but that <hi>he hideth himselfe.</hi>
A man may <hi>couer</hi> or hyde himselfe without flying. If thou
say that a man cannot hide himselfe from the plague, I say
likewise that thou cannot any more flye from the plague:
Goe where thou wilt and his right hand shal finde thee out:
If thou wert with <hi>Ionas</hi> first vnder the hatches, and after
with the Whale in the bottome of the Sea, he will finde thee
out. The wings of the morning cannot carrie thee beyond
his reach. What is this hiding or couering thy selfe then? It
is no couer corporeall, but spirituall: euen the same that is
spoken of in <hi>Psal.</hi> 61. 4. where safetie is assured to him that
<pb facs="tcp:15498:7"/>
coucheth vnder the Lords winges.</p>
            <p>The prudent hearted seeth a plague or iudgement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
towards a people for sinne; what doth he then? Hee
commits himselfe <hi>in his Christian way,</hi> to the protection of
the Almightie, who hath promised to be a shield to such as
put their trust in him:<note place="margin">Psal. 91. 6.</note> that such a one shall not need to feare
that pestilence that walketh in darknesse, nor the plague
that destroyeth at noone-day. For walking <hi>in his way,</hi> that is,
in the way God hath called him vnto, and leaning vpon the
Lords promise, what neede is there of locall flight or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer?</p>
            <p>Secondly, for their phisicall experience, I thereto make
this answere: Sinne being the cause of the maladie, (as also
of euery maladie) it is for none to make physick their staffe,
nor yet their first meane, lest they sinne the sinne of<note n="*" place="margin">2. Chro. 16 12.</note> 
               <hi>Asa:</hi>
much lesse seeke to Idol-wizards, which was the sinne
of<note n="*" place="margin">2. King. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Achaziah.</hi> Besides, they see many preserued in the midst
of the plague, who haue vsed no phisicall meanes: what
will they make the cause of their deliuerance? No other
thing, but the diuine pleasure of God, who hath forbid his
Angell to smite them. Is Phisicke then in this and all other
plagues to be auoyded? No: as<note n="*" place="margin">Isai. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (howsoeuer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
promise of recouerie) did meane time suffer a lumpe of
drie figs to be applied to his boyle (hauing in nature to heat,
mature, and digest) so we are not to neglect such naturall
means as reason and experience haue found out to auaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
naturall infirmitie <hi>[Deo non obstante]</hi> the Lord not
crossing nature. Otherwise, we shalbe found te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pters of God,
leauing our way: rather then faithfull keepers of our way.</p>
            <p>Reason of vsing naturall meanes (where God barres
them not vp) is this: Whether the ayre be infected without
vs, there neuer wanteth infection within vs, which is readie
to take an head against our heart, if the Lord do not bridle
it. As God smiting vs with other maladies (threatned in the
lawe so wel as Pestilence) doth not only say, <hi>Let it be,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
the maladie growes, but also hath that his word wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:15498:7"/>
vpon preiacent corruption effected by our sinne: so,
hee looketh that his word be satisfied by humbling our
selues in prayer and fasting, and that naturall corruption
haue the power preuented or destroyed by naturall means,
he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffording them. To say, I shall liue so long as God hath
appointed, though I neuer vse phisicke, it is as good as this,
I shall liue so long as God hath appointed, though I neuer
eate nor drinke. As meate and drinke is for the hungry, so is
phisicke for the diseased: for to the necessitie of naturall phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
our Sauiour alludeth, when as for establishing his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
phisicke, he saith:<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 5. 31.</note> 
               <hi>They that are sicke need the Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
God hath created the Word, Prayer and Fasting for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
and killing sinne, the <hi>Materiall cause</hi> of Gods anger:
and he hath created phisicall creatures for preuenting and
curing naturall corruption, the <hi>materiall cause</hi> of our mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and naturall sicknesse. So both be the good creatures of
God, and both to be vsed to his glory. The first for helping
and healing our soule: the second, for helping and healing
the body. God sometimes blesseth the first without the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
to shewe that he is not tyed to meanes. And he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
blesseth the second without the first, to shew that we
ought not neglect the meanes. But as we haue both sinfull
soules and corrupt bodies, so we should vse both, for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting
both.</p>

should neuer therefore promise or insinuate health and life by
<pb facs="tcp:15498:8"/>
the second, but by putting people in the minde, that they must
labour with God for satisfaction for the first. That this is our
Churches iudgement also, let it be considered, first, in that the
Magistrates and Ministers haue appointed publike and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall

for sinne: secondly, in that also they haue published naturall

            <p>BVt seeing the Lord<note n="*" place="margin">In Psal. 91.</note> promiseth deliuerance from the
plague, to all such as rest vnder his wings and walke in
his way, it may be asked, how comes it to passe that some
Beleeuers die of the pestilence, and some vnbeleeuers scape
it? I answere, the Lords promise being euer fast to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer
(for he is faithfull that hath promised) there is in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers
so dying, a want of faith for apprehending this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
deliuerance, this temporary mercy. Though they
haue not lacked faith for their eternall iustification &amp; finall
saluation, by vertue whereof their flesh resteth in hope of
an happie resurrection, and their spirit is gone in comfort
to God that gaue it: yet hath euerie one perishing on the
pestilence bene found, not to apprehend this particular
promise. To say that the psalme speaketh only of a spirituall
plague and a spirituall promise, is to conclude the same of
<hi>Leuit. 26. &amp; Deut.</hi> 28. and of all the like places. Then the
which, what can be more absurd? vnder literall promises
and mercies, menacies and curses, spirituall things are <hi>also</hi>
entended, but not <hi>onely.</hi> The first shadoweth out and leadeth
to the second. And because still there is the same vse, the
outward euils so well as the second are still abiding. When
we haue receiued Christ by faith, we haue promise of<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> 
               <hi>all
<pb facs="tcp:15498:8"/>
things also:</hi> (promises of this world &amp; of the world to come.)
But when by faith we haue apprehended the greater, loe we
are often found to doubt of the lesser. In not doubting of
the eternall, we should not doubt of the temporarie. But
doubting of the lesser and loosing it by doubting: we see
what we should do in the greater, if God should leaue vs to
our owne standing.</p>
            <p>That manie wicked escape in midst of strongest pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
first, it is not because they haue any promise, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it pleaseth God both to them and vs to be in manie
things, manie times, better then his promise: teaching them
and vs therein, how good he would be to vs in all things
walking in his way, and vndoubting the promise.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the wicked so escaping, are ordinarily such as
haue walked boldly through the sicknes, bragging of their
faith in God, touching deliuerance from pestilence: shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plainly that they had a faith in God for apprehending
promise of deliuerance. Though they haue not had faith
for apprehending things spirituall and eternall, yet for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hold on this particular temporarie. And such a faith, is
ordinarily countenanced with such a mercie, as that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary

with particular flitting mercies. God teaching such therein,
how much more he would draw neare vnto them in all

                  <hi>THere is in belieuers so dying, a want of faith.]</hi> That is,
some want in faith. <hi>S. Iames</hi> willing vs in she want of

telleth vs that we must not waner; for if we do, he concludeth,
that we are not to thinke that we shall receiue any thing of the
<pb facs="tcp:15498:9"/>
Lord. From whence I gather, that lack of faith is cause we
are denied any thing necessarie our life here. Some will
obiect, There is some want of faith, some doubting, some wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
in the best child of God, therefore none can assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
of receiuing any good of God, whether corporall, or spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.
I answere, it is one thing what we <hi>ought</hi> to do, another
thing <hi>what</hi> we do. Secondly, it is enioyned vs in <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26.
and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. that as we would haue blessings temporary,
and auoid cursings temporarie, we should obey the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
and the best are found daily to breake the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
haue they therefore no assurance of blessing? If they
looke into the measure of obedience (literall or spirituall) as it is
in themselues only, they haue cause to looke for no good thing.
This want then in all things, is to driue them vnto the Lord
by Christ Iesus in all things. <hi>Obiection.</hi> God will not exact
such obedience, such faith, except we could so obey, so belieue.
<hi>Answere.</hi> The Romanists indéede say so, but they and others
must remember, that it is equall for him so to exact, séeing (as
we were set out of his hands in <hi>Adam</hi>) we were enabled so to
belieue and obey. Thirdly, as there is no promise of God but
it is deliuered vnder condition, and there is no condition kept
fullie of our part, and therefore no flesh that may be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
in Gods sight: so, it pleaseth him sometimes not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the want in faith and obedience to his children (for if he
should, we could not breath one day) but to accept them as

<hi>S. Iames</hi> should leaue vs litle or no hope of receiuing any
thing of God by prayer. Fourthly, in case of temporary bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
it pleaseth God to giue an extraordinarie strength of
faith, by the which deuils and mountaines of difficulties are
often remoued: so well as vnto his children he besides giueth

I speake of some certaine wicked. Héere some say I speake

promise: secondly, that some such haue a faith or beliefe in
God touching such deliuerance. I see a <hi>diuerse</hi> thing in these
wicked-ones, but no <hi>contrary</hi> thing deliuered. That they haue
no promise of hauing good by so much as a bit of bread, my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuolent
brethren graunt, that some of them haue beliefe in
God for temporary blessings, yea, and sometimes of eternall
happines, who can doubt, except all wicked should alwayes
dispaire of all things? If I had said, they haue iustifying or
sauing faith, I had spoken contraries, séeing promises of this
life, and that to come is made directlie and properlie vnto
them. What kind of faith I spoke of, it may appeare when I
terme it a <hi>bragging</hi> faith, that is, a presumptuous beliefe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ground of promise. These that come to our Sauiour
in the last day, saying, <hi>Haue we not prophecied in thy name,
cast out Deuils, &amp;c.</hi> had they no faith touching temporaries?
Tis very sillie. They had (as Schollers vsually speake) <hi>a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie
faith,</hi> and perswasion: and my writing can no way
entend any other. And thus men crow before the victorie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That temporary repentance of <hi>Ahab, Manasses, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> A
great quarell ariseth from the poore word <hi>Manasses,</hi> that I
should number him with the temporarie repentant. If they
had not liked the word, they might easily haue wiped it out,
<pb facs="tcp:15498:10"/>
and so haue kept peace with the booke.</p>
               <p>That I vnderstand so of his repentance, obserue what I
haue to say. In the 2. <hi>King.</hi> 21. the historie of his life and death
is set downe, and no speech of any repentance. And thereto is
annexed, that <hi>Amon <hi>his sonne did euill in the sight of the
Lord, as did his father</hi> Manasses.</hi> And <hi>Amon</hi> is neither there
nor elsewhere noted repentant, but caried out of the world in
iudgement. This connexure of Father and Sonne, causeth me
to thinke that the repentance spoken of in 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. (in
which respect he is preferred to his sonne) to haue bene of the
Prophets then held but as temporarie, and fitted to time. If it
be a good argument of <hi>Salomons</hi> true repentance, that <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam
<hi>and his people are said to haue walked three yeares in
the way of</hi> Dauid <hi>and</hi> Salomon, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi>

<hi>Salomon</hi> should not so haue bene matched with <hi>Dauid,</hi> if he
had not died well to the Church-ward, as did <hi>Dauid</hi>) if I say,
that be good for prouing his <hi>true</hi> repentance; then I sée not why
<hi>Manasses</hi> his repentance may not be held as no true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
when he comes to be so conioyned with <hi>Amon,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
truly repented to the Church-ward. I say <hi>to the Church-ward,</hi>
because it is possible for a man to vnsatisfie the Church,
&amp; yet of God be saued: as also to dye innocent to the Church-ward,
&amp; yet of God condemned for some secret abhomination
vnrepented of. But if any hereafter will <hi>logomachein,</hi> contend

(Famine and Pestilentiall death) he chooseth the latter;
why? Some thinke, because himselfe might be relieued of
Famine, and so not die: and he coueting to die with the
people, would therefore choose the pestilence which would
as well seize vpon him. This is somewhat, but I see it not in
this scripture. After he had seene a fearfull fall of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he coueted Gods hand to be turned against him: but
that he was of such mind before that Fall, it should not
seeme; first, because his heart (before <hi>Gad</hi> the prophet came

he repented: secondly, because in his option of the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,

is a more lingring torturing death. And herein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<hi>Dauids Charitie.</hi> The second ayming at the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
enriching with necessaries alreadie possessed: for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
would haue deuoured vp all her maintenance. And
herein was both <hi>loue and policie. Dauid</hi> being a Prophet,
he could not haue fewer godlie respects in his option.</p>
            <p>Of all these three plagues, Sword, Famine, and Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
I conclude the last to bring with it the most mercie.
If the Aduersaries sword destroy, ô the mockings, proud
insultings, filthie prostitutions, cruell oppressions, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
that sword? The sword of Romish Babilonians
was prest to haue beene drawen within and without vs.
How great was the Lords mercie to shut that vp in the
scaberd? Famine was threatned vpon the death of our late
soueraigne <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> for the Rascalitie of our land hoped,
as Drone-bees, to haue spoiled our Hyues, as an vnsatiable
Hell or graue to swallow vp all. How mercifull was God
<pb facs="tcp:15498:11"/>
vnto vs, that with a crosse-wynd did rather take them vnto
Tyburne, or consume them in warres without vs? Yea, how
was his mercie great vnto vs, in putting farre from vs both
the former plagues, and in smiting, to smite vs with this
pestilence: that so falling, we fall before his hand that is a
mercifull Father, in the midst of iudgement remembring
mercie; leauing vs not to lingring deaths, whereby we
might be more pained; and giuing that we haue possessed
to his Church, whereof we haue bene members. Yea, where
in three dayes the Lords Angell did smite to death 70. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of <hi>Dauids</hi> people: loe his great mercie to vs ward, he
hath not so smitten yet one thousand in full three dayes.
O that the liuing would lay it to heart, and praise God
for his mercies.</p>

            <p>And the Lords mercies to vs, should force vs to be more
mercifull one to another. It should teach Magistrate and
Minister (with <hi>Dauid</hi>) to bide by their charge, and to intreat
mercie for the sheepe of his pasture, till the Angell put vp
his viall of pestilence. To augment our spirituall deuotions
in the openest places, as did <hi>Dauid,</hi> who built an alter in<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24. 48. &amp;c. 2. Chro. 3. 1.</note>

threshing floore on mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> the place chosen
of God for putting his name there, whereon after the
Temple was builded. Yea, to put our sacrifices betweene
the plague and the Church, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did betweene the falne
of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that so the plague may not creepe
any further. Yea, the mercie of God to vs, should teach vs all
<pb facs="tcp:15498:11"/>
to be helping one to an other, not to please our selues in all
things, to lay downe our liues for the brethren, liuing and
dying in good workes, to the sicke and needie. The ninetie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine
are to be left that stand not in such need, and the sheepe
that is readie to perish, we ought to seeke vp. Happie is the
soule, who (when his maister commeth) is found so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
and thrise happie is the soule, that hath the body cut
downe in such a worke of mercie.</p>
            <p>True it is, that for certaine<note n="*" place="margin">Leuit. 11. &amp; 12. &amp; 13. &amp; 14. &amp; 15. Chapters.</note> bodily vncleannesses and
maladies, people vnder the lawe of <hi>Moses</hi> were to be seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the Church, more or lesse: and yet now no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
vnto vs; why? For that they were a part of
the Ceremonial law. This may appeare, first from the <hi>rites,</hi>
secondly, from their <hi>significations.</hi> In certaine vncleannes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
they were to wash themselues with water, and then (not
before) to be held cleane for company. For the Leprosie, it
was censured onely by the Ecclesiasticall Minister; and
this hee did not till hee sawe it, and sometimes not till
he had made some fourteene dayes triall; and speciall rules
he had for the triall. Who will say that these rites were not
ceremoniall and abolished, besides that the Priest had no
feare of the leprous-plague during all the time of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation?
For their signification, it respected the degrees of
exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication for Soules vncleanenesse. Which not only
appeareth by many<note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 17. Coloss. 2. 21. Tit. 1. 15. Iude 23. Reuel. 3. 4.</note> speeches in the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, alluding
to such vncleannesses, but also, for that the new Testaments
church hath power only to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate for defects in the
soule; as the auntient Synagogue did for wants in the body.
These then that will maintaine their flight from the Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
lawe, do in their fact pronounce all they flie from to be
Excommunicate; yea, with the <hi>black Kerem or Maranatha</hi>
to be excommunicate to the death, for not louing the Lord
Iesus; for to them such a censure only belongeth, 1. Cor. 16.
22. Thus such Fleers are left of God to belie scripture, and
to abuse their brethren; which is a worse plague then that
they flie from<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>FOr the Leprosie, it was censured only by the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

            <p>THe Pestilence being in scripture phrase, an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
stroke of God by the ministrie of his Angell,
whereupon often-times visible corruption ariseth, and
all for sinne: it leadeth you (Beloued)</p>
            <p>First, to cast your eye vp vnto God the first Mouer whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

behold the Angel of God appointed to keep vs in our way;
and that specially in respect of our bodies good: seeing since
the consummation of the Testament in Christs blood, our
soules are specially to be tended of true Pastors, called of <hi>S.
Iohn,</hi> the Angels of the Churches. For now, no lesse then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>they be ministring Spirits sent forth to Minister for their
sakes, which shall be Heires of Saluation, Heb.</hi> 1. 14. And yet
(as before) they are appointed of God sometimes to punish
man for going out of his way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we are called to repent sinne, which did moue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
God so to send out his Angell to smite vs, euen to the raising
vp of the mudde in our nature. The truth of which repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
will appeare in our better care of setting right steps to
to our feet, and in being more carefull of performing holy
duties of Charitie one to another.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, seeing it seizeth vpon old and yong, rich and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
poore, of all complexions whatsoeuer, so well as some of all
sorts are spared, we are lead to acknowledge that all sorts
haue sinned (though not after the same manner of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14.) and therefore the dutie of all to be
humbled, least the Niuinites condemne vs.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the Angels of the Church (from the like in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Angels of heauen) are to comfort and cheare vp such as be
in their Christian way, as also to reproue and sharply cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
such as be out of that way. The first they are to do with
the voyce of the glorious Gospell or glad tidings of Christ
Iesus who hath taken away the sting of death to them. The
<pb facs="tcp:15498:13"/>
second they are to doe, by the terror of <hi>Moses</hi> lawe, which
bringeth with it to the infidelious &amp; vnrepentant, curse and
condemnation. Andin so doing, they may with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicnece
make that prayer, <hi>Thy will be don in the earth</hi> (that is,
of people in the earth) <hi>as it is done in heauen,</hi> that is of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

            <p>And thus with my heartie prayer vnto God, first, for the
remission of all our sinnes: and secondly, for his grace to
stablish vs in euery good worke for the glory of his name, I
commend you vnto him that is able to present our bodies
