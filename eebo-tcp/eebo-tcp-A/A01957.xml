            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But nowe for the eaſye readynge, and Redye expreſſynge orderlye of anye ſumme propoſed you ſhall practiſe this maner, folowing.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N multiplication there are thre numbers to bee noted, that is to ſaie the numbre whiche is to bee multiplied, the whiche wee will call the multiplicande: and the numbre by the whiche we multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, we call the multiplier, or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicator. And the third numbre is that which commeth of the multiplication of the one by the other, which is called the product. As when I would knowe how much mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth. 10. multiplied by 9. y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is to ſaie how much are. 10. tymes 9. I find that thei ar worth 90. tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 10. is the multiplica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o. 9. is the multipter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4753:17"/>
And 90. is called the producte: Then for to multiplye, is none other thinge, but to fynde a nombre whiche conteineth the multiplicande ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes, as the multiplyer contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnities. As 10. multiplyed by 9. do make 90. as before ſaid. And 90. conteyneth 10. ſo manye tymes, as 9. conteineth vnities, that is to ſaye nyne times.</p>
               <p>In multiplycation, it forceth not muche whiche of the twoo nombers by the multiplicande, nor whiche be the multiplier. For 10. multiplyed by 9. maketh as manye as 9. multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by. 10. yet neuertheles it ſhalbe more commodious that the leſſer nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber be alwayes the multiplier.</p>
               <p>And for that, that the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of fygures the one by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the moſte chiefe and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryeſt kynde, whereby to knowe howe to worke in the multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of compounde nombers, and that euery man hath it not at the fingers

ende: I wyll therfore gyue you heare certein eaſye wayes of multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diget nombers. When you woulde multiplye twoo ſimple fygu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, or digits the one by the other, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate eche of thoſe diget nombers from 10. Then multiplye the twoo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the one by the other. And if the ſumme doe excede 10. writte onely the firſte fygure, and kepe the other to be added to the nexte operation, whiche is thus. Adde your two ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple figures togither: And of the which reſulteth of that addicion, take one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the fyrſte fygure, vnto the whiche you muſte adde the vnitye whiche you kept before. And that ſhalbe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde fygure of the ſumme which you do ſeeke. Example, I woulde multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply 7. by 6. I take 7. from 10. and there reſteth 3. likewiſe I abate 6. from 10. &amp; there reſteth 4. then I ſaye thus 3. ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes 4. make 12. I writte 2. for my firſt fygure, &amp; I kepe 1. in my minde, then I adde 6. with 7. and they are 13. of the
<pb facs="tcp:4753:18"/>
whiche I caſte awaie the ſeconde fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. 1. and I take onelie the firſte fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. 3. vnto the whiche I adde the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie whiche I kepte, and they make 4. whiche I wryte in the ſeconde place after. 2. And thus I finde. 42. whiche is the valuer of 7. multiplied by. 6.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe, and all commeth to one effecte, ſette doiune youre two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e numbers the one right ouer the other, and right againſt euery or them towarde the right hande wryt &amp; hys owne diſtaunce from. 10. Then mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie the two differences together, the figure whiche commeth thereof, ſhall you ſet doune vnder both the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But if there be two fygures ſette doune but the fyrſte, and keepe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in youre mynde, afterwardes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate (from one of the two digit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) the difference of the other digite number that is to ſaie, croſwiſe. And vnto the remayne adde the fygure whiche you kepte, and that ſhall bée

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the like figures, that is to ſaie, of 7. multiplied by. 6. the diſtaunce of. 7. vnto. 10. is. 3. And the diſtaunce of. 6. from. 10. is. 4. I ſette them doune croſſewaies, as you ſee: <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> And then I ſaie. 3. ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. 4. are. 12. I ſette doune. 2. and keepe one in my mynde, then I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. 4. from. 7. or els. 3. from. 6. it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not from whiche of theim: and there reſteth alwaies. 3. vnto the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I adde the vnitie, whiche I kepte in my mynde, and thei are fower, whiche ſhall bee the ſeconde figure of the multiplication. And thus I finde that ſeuen, multiplied by ſixe, maketh fowertle and twoo, as in the other operation. This practiſe hath no place where the twoo digette noum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (dooe not exceade tenne) by addyng theim together, and then is

multiplication eaſye ynoughe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rule.</p>
               <p>An other waye to knowe the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of ſymple numbers, is by this table folowyng: the vſe whereof is thus.</p>
               <p>Fyrſte you ſhall vnderſtande, that the nombers from 1. and ſo downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to 9. ſet in the left part or han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging margin of this table do betoken the multipliers of all ſimple nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

To come nowe vnto the practiſe of multiplication, when you woulde multiplye twoo nombers, the one by the other, you muſte ſet them downe after the ſame maner as you dyd in addicion, and in ſubſtraction. That is to ſaye, the firſt fygure of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplier, vnder the firſte figure of the multiplicande, the ſecond vnder the ſeconde, and the third vnder the third, yf there be ſo manye, and then drawe a ryghte lyne vnder them, as in the other operations goynge before.</p>
               <p>After you ſhall multiplie all the fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the multiplicande by the multiplyer, and ſet downe the fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures (commynge of any ſuche mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication) vnder the lyne euery one in order.</p>
               <p>Example, I woulde multiplye 123. by. 3. that is to ſaye, I woulde knowe howe muche amounteth iij. tymes one hundreth, twentie and three. The twoo nombers beynge placed in ſuche order as is before
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4753:21"/>
ſaied, you muſte beginne towardes the right hande: and ſay thus three ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes thrée are nine, wryte downe 9. vnder the line right againſte 3. for the firſte figure: <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſecondlye by the ſame thrée you muſte multiplie the ſeconde fygure 2. and they make 6: putte downe 6. after the 9. vnder the line: Thirdly by the ſame 3. you ſhall multiplie the laſt figure. 1. and they are but 3. ſet doune 3 after 6. for the thirde and laſte figure. And thus is that worke ended: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſhal finde, that 123. being mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by 3. maketh 369.</p>
               <p>But when that of the multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one figure by an other: The ſum whiche commeth thereof ſhal be of two figures, as it happeneth moſte often, then ſhall you wryte downe the firſte figure, and kepe the other figure to bee added vnto the multiplication of the next figure.</p>

Whan the multiplier is of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie figures you muſte multiplie al the whole multiplycande by euerye one of thoſe figures, &amp; wryte the productes euerie one vnder his owne figure.</p>

I ſette 0. vnder the lyne for the ſeconde fygure, and I keepe. 3. to bee added to the next multiplication, thirdlie I ſay 5. tymes. 5. are. 25. The whiche with 3. that I keepe are. 28. I ſette doune 8. and keepe. 2. to bée added with the next multiplication. Then comming vnto the fourth and laſt fygure, I ſaie fiue tymes. 1. are. 5. the whiche with 2. that I reſerued are 7. I putte 7. for the laſte fygure of thys fyrſte operation
<pb facs="tcp:4753:23"/>
by the figure. 5. with the which figure we haue no more to doe. And therfore I cancel theſame. 8. with a little ſtrik through it, to ſignifie that wée haue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with that figure. And for as muche that in multiplication there is alwaies as manie ſimple operations, as the multiplier conteineth figures. There reſteth yet twoo operations to be made. I come then vnto the ſeconde operation, whiche is by the fygure 6. by the whiche I muſte againe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all the figures of the multiplicand as I did by 5 and the firſt figure, which ſhalbe produced, you muſte putte one ranke more lower then the figures of the operation euen nowe made by fiue: not right vnder the firſte fygure of the multiplier fiue, but vnder ſixe: that is to ſay: one place more forward then the fiue towarde the left hande, and one rancke more lower then the firſte operation: and you ſhall put af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde euerie of the other figures whiche commeth of the ſame multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4753:23"/>
in their order: thirdlye you muſte make the multiplication by the thirde figure and that whiche ſhall come thereof you muſte ſette in hys rancke, as here vnder you ſee. And nowe wee néede make no further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hereof, becauſe that hee whiche canne doe the firſte multiplication by fiue, may as eaſely doe all the others.

               <p>Nowe, if you will knowe howe muche the operations thus placed doe amount vnto, which in value are but one number: you muſt adde thoſe thre numbers together, but not after the ſame maner as wee haue done in the chapiter of addition, the firſt figure of the firſt ranck with the firſte figure of the ſecond ranck, and of the thirde: but

you muſte adde them in the ſame ſort as you ſhall finde them ſituated or placed: that is to ſaie, the firſte figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the fyrſte rancke alone by it ſelfe the ſeconde of that ranck with the firſt of the ſeconde rancke.

                     <pb facs="tcp:4753:30"/>
But here is to bee noted, that if it happen that the figure beyng laſte founde, whiche is put in the quotient, doe produce or bryng for the a greater number (in multipliyng al the diuiſor by the ſame) then that whiche is ouer the ſaied diuiſor: you muſt then make the ſame figure of your quotient (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che you dooe put doune) leſſer by one. and after that you haue cancelled the firſte multiplication, you muſte make a newe. And the ſame muſt be ſo doen as often tymes: as (in decreaſyng the ſame) it produceth a leſſer number, or at the leaſte, a number egall to that, whiche is ouer it. As in the laſte work for becauſe that the diuiſour, beyng multiplied by. 3. bryngeth for the 135. whiche amounteth more then 121. the ſame producte muſt be cancelled.

I muſt multiplie the diuiſor. 45. &amp; therof commeth 90. the whiche I abate from

Then marke what ſummes bee leſſer, then that common nomber, and whiche bee greater, and wyth a draught of your penne, euermore lynke two nombers togither, ſo that the one be leſſer then that common nomber, and the other greater then he. For 2 greater nor twoo ſmaller nombers maye not bee linked together, for they wyll eyther be leſſer, or els greater then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nomber: but one greater nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and one ſmaller maye be ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed, that they will make the common nomber.

                  <p>After that you haue thus lynked them, then make howe muche eche of the leſſer nombers is ſmaller then the common nomber, and that difference ſhall you ſet againſt the greater nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whiche bee linked with thoſe ſmaller, eche of them with his matche ſtyll on the righte hande.

                  <p>Here in this former example, you ſee that I haue ſet downe the ſeuerall prices, whiche be 30, 36. 42. 45, and haue linked together 30, with 45. &amp; 36. with 42. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon price 40, I haue ſet on the lefte ſyde, and the difference of it from euerye ſeuerall price, I haue ſet on the ryght hande, agaynſte that ſumme wyth the whiche it is lynked.

40 is 10, whiche I ſet againſt 45, that he is lynked wythall, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of 45, aboue 40 is 5. whiche I haue ſet againſt 30.</p>
                  <p>So lykewayes, the differences of 42 aboue 40, is 2, that I haue ſette a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte 36. And the difference betwen 36 and 40 (whiche is 4) I haue ſette againſte 42. Then I adde all thoſe differences togither and they make 21, whiche I make the fyrſte nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Rule of three, and 6 the ſeconde nomber, which is the weyght of the Scepter of Golde, and the thyrde nomber ſhall bee euerye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler difference.

               <p>THe Rule of falſehod is ſo named not for that it teacheth any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte of falſehode, but that by fayned nombers taken at all aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it teacheth to finde out the true no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that is demaunded. And this (of all the vulgare Rules whiche are in practiſe) is the moſt excellent: this rule hath two parts, the one is of one falſe poſition alone: the other is of two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions as here after ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:4753:156"/>
Thoſe queſtions whiche are done by falſe poſitions, haue theyr opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in a maner like vnto that of the rule of three, but onely that in the rule of three, we haue three nombers knowen, and here in this rule wee haue but one (I meane that commeth in operation) vnto the likenes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we muſte diuiſe two other, the one multiplying, and the other diuidyng, as by example.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I haue deliuered to a banker a certein ſumme of pounds in money, to haue of him by the yeare 6 li. vpon the 100 li. And at the ende of 10 yeres he payed me 500 pounde for all bothe principall an gaine. I demaund howe muche was the principall ſumme that I deliuered at the fyrſte. Here you ſee that there are diuers termes: but the chiefe to worke with all is 500 li. whiche commeth of the other nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that is to ſaye, of 10, and 100 for of them is compounde the tenour
<pb facs="tcp:4753:157"/>
of the queſtion, the practiſe whereof is thus.</p>
               <p>Let vs faine a nomber at pleaſure, and with the ſame let vs make oure diſcourſe, euen as though it were the principalll ſumme that we ſeke for. As by Example. Suppoſe that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered hym at the firſte 200 pounde, the whiche were worthe to me in 10 yeares 120 pounde after the rate of 6 vpon the hundred pound. Then 120 pounde added with 200 pounde. Do make but 320 li. and I muſt haue 500 li. Thus you ſee that I haue three termes for the rule of three: the one which ſhall conteine the Queſtion the other two, which I haue 200, &amp; 320: in ſuch ſorte, that 320, ought ta haue ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the proporcion to 200, as 500 hat vnto the nomber that I ſeeke: that is to ſay, vnto the true principal ſumme, then muſt I haue recourſe vnto the rule of three, after this ſorte, ſaying.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:4753:157"/>
If 320. pound become of 200. pounde of howe muche ſhall come 500. pound Multiply 500: by 200. and thei are 100000. the whiche you ſhall diuide by 320. pounde and thereof commeth 312. pounde. ½ whiche is the ſumme that I deliuered at the firſte, and thus, this rule hath ſome congruence with the double rule of three.</p>
