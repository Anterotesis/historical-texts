         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>THe cause mouing the Lord to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to <hi>Iacob,</hi> was the hard estate wherein his seruant stood at this time.

His hope leanes on the word of God, who promised to be with him, and prosper him: his feare is conceiued of the words of <hi>Esau,</hi> who had vowed to slay him, and is now wakened againe, and augmented by the report of his seruants, who tolde him, that <hi>Esau</hi> was comming against<note place="margin">Iacobs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie.</note> him with an army. Thus did he walk staggering vpon feet, not vnlike the

                        <hi>Iacob</hi> by word onely, nor by sending secretly patience and comfort vnto his troubled spirit (which way many a time he answeres the prayers of his owne) but he confirmes him by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vision. For he appeares to <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the forme of a man, and wrestles with him, he assayes him not with a superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our strength which he was not able to withstand, but applies himselfe to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> weaknesse, and disposes the wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in such a manner, that <hi>Iacob</hi> gets the victory, albeit not without a wound, for his thigh-bone is disjoynted, and

                        <hi>He commanded light to shine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Hee formed the body of man, his most excellent earthly creature, of the basest matter dust and clay; of the vilest

                     <p>AS to the first, the circumstance of<note place="margin">1</note> time is noted by <hi>Moses, when</hi> Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob (sayth he) <hi>was left alone.</hi> Amongst many reasons that might moue <hi>Iacob</hi> to bee alone, I encline to none more then this: he sought to be solitary, to the end he might haue the fitter occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to pray, and poure out his griefe the more freely and homely into the Lords bosome. For we know that the presence of men is oftentimes a great impediment of the free communing of our soules with God, and that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God will boldly communicate

those secrets to the Lord, which they<note place="margin">Solitarines conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for prayer.</note> will not vtter to their dearest friends.

most familiarly to shew himselfe vnto vs, when wee are best content to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our selues from all other pleasures, that we may get conference with the Lord: whereas by the contrary, when we neglect to seeke him, and will not doe so much as redeeme a time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to speake with him, by forgoing for a while, the company of men, the Lord accounts that hee is dishonoured<note place="margin">Neglect of prayer is a conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of God.</note> of vs, that we are such, as haue little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Lord, yea, preferres euery thing before him: and therfore also it is, that the Lord delights not to be home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with vs, and to acquaint vs with his familiar presence, because we doe not carefully waite vpon him.</p>

                        <hi>est, non ex nuncupatione, sed natura:</hi> hee it is, who in this combat is the wrestler with <hi>Iacob.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where first it is to bee demanded,<note place="margin">How as ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ appeared to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation.</note> how it is that Iesus Christ appeared to the Fathers vnder the law, in forme and shape of a man, hee not being yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate and made man indeede. The answere is, that appearing of Christ in forme of a man, was as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:17702:18"/>
calleth it, <hi>praeludiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> humanitatis,</hi> a presig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his manifestation after in the flesh: but there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the appearing &amp; his incarnation that followed, <hi>in the fulnesse of time.</hi> For<note place="margin">Gal.</note> first, albeit christ before his incarnation tooke on verely the body of man, yet<note place="margin">Difference betweene Christs apparition and his manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after in the flesh.</note> was he not then a man indeede, he was not then <hi>of the seed the woman,</hi> but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fulnesse of time came, God sent his son into the world made of a woman, <hi>then the word was made flesh:</hi> then tooke he on the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; became <hi>in al things man like vnto vs except sin:</hi> then hee assumed our nature, and joyned it into one subsistance vvith his diuine nature, that is, into one personall vnion, for the straitnesse of the which conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it is sayd, and most truely, that Christ Iesus Man is God, and Christ Iesus God is Man: vvhich before his incarnation could not be said of him. Secondly, vvhereby Christ vnder the lavv tooke on the body of man, was but temporall, and for the doing of some particular errand, vvhich so soone as he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17702:18"/>
had finished, he laid away againe. But Christ Iesus hath now assumed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, neuer to be laid away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: as hee hath joyned our nature vvith his diuine nature in a personall vnion, so also in an euerlasting vnion; so that there shall neuer be a separation betweene them.</p>
                     <p>Alway in this manner of Christs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing<note place="margin">Christs loue is seene in his familiar apparition to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law.</note> vnto <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp; other of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants before the law: let vs take vp the loue of Iesus toward his owne, that for their sake hee is content to abase his majestie, and appeare to his seruants, not in a shape answerable to his glory, but in such a forme as their weakenes might best comport vvith: for vvhat kind of more homely and familiar ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition can God vse to man, than to appeare as a man, in the shape most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to man? Not as God clad with glory and Majestie, for that way no flesh might abide him. In this O Lord thou hast shewed thy goodnes to man: in this our father <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> had a proofe of thy louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The third Circumstance, the manner of the wrestling, corporall, spirituall, or mixt.</head>
                     <p>IN the third roome wee promised to speake of the manner of this wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whether it bee corporall onely, or spirituall onely, or mixed. Now that it is mixt, and so partly corporall, and partly spirituall will appeare, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> together. That the wrestling was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall it is cleare, of the disjoynting of <hi>Iacobs</hi> thigh, whereof <hi>Moses</hi> makes mention: and that it was also spirituall appeares, partly of that which <hi>Moses</hi> saith, that <hi>Iacob</hi> straue for the blessing, and partly of that which <hi>Hosca</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Hos. 12. 4.</note> that hee preuailed by wrestling and praying.</p>
                     <p>These are the sorest kinde of wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, when the Lord at one time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises his children, both in body and

This is indeede a very hard estate: for as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith, <hi>the spirit of a man will sustaine his infirmitie, but a wounded spirit who can beare it?</hi> and yet with both those at one time hath the Lord exercised his dearest seruants so hardly, that the vehemency of their trouble, hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to poure out most lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble complaints; <hi>My heart</hi> (saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>)<note place="margin">Ps. 109. 22</note>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17702:29"/>
singular: I haue therefore marked this, that none of them should think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues marrowlesse, when the Lord deales with them after this manner; <hi>For no tentation hath ouertaken you, but</hi>

As for example, the Lord hath promised, that if I repent, hee will forgiue; if I mourne for my sinnes, he will comfort me; if I aske from him, hee will giue vnto mee, so sayes he in his word: Yet I finde in his working with mee, the contrary (will the troubled conscience of the Childe of God say) I doe repent from mine heart of my sinnes, and am sorrowful that euer I offended my God, but I cannot feele the Remission of them: I mourne, but <hi>the Comforter who should refresh my soule commeth not.</hi> I
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17702:29"/>
call and cry night &amp; day, but the Lord heareth mee not. Vnto this estate I know that oftentimes the dearest of Gods children are brought, <hi>as if the Lord had forgot to bee mercifuli vnto them, and shut vp his tender mercies in displeasure, they can finde no promised rest to their soule,</hi> nor peace to their troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mindes.</p>

                     <p>THou therefore whose heart is set to seeke the Lord, &amp; in this perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wouldst know what to doe and how to behaue thy selfe, I can no better way resolue thee, then to send thee to looke vnto <hi>Abraham, Iacob, Iob,</hi> and the rest of these, who haue been exercised with the like tentations before thee. Marke therefore, and consider how the Lord commanded <hi>Iacob</hi> to go backe againe vnto <hi>Canaan,</hi> and promised to be with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17702:30"/>
him; yet now in the iourney (as it would seeme) he comes against him. He bad him goe forward and yet disioynts his thigh bone, &amp; so vnables him to goe as he was wont. Notwithstanding <hi>Iacob</hi> still cleaues fast to the promise of the<note place="margin">1 By Iacob.</note> Lord, being perswaded that the Lord could not faile him; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his present sence and feeling, trusting still on the word of the Lord, for all the appearing contrarietie of his working, he craues a blessing from him that wrestles vvith him.</p>
                     <p>Againe, will ye looke vnto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 By Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> our father? the Lord made him a promise, that in <hi>Isaac,</hi> his seed should be blessed, and yet hee commands him to slay him. A wonderfull tentation, that the Lord commands him to slay that child, in whom hee had promised the multiplication and blessing of his posteritie: for here the promise of God &amp; his commandement seemes to fight together. Yet <hi>Abraham</hi> strengthned in the faith, as he receiued <hi>Isaac</hi> from the dead wombe of <hi>Sara,</hi> doth not doubt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17702:30"/>
but God was able to raise him from the dead againe; and therefore resting on the Lords promise, he spares not to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <hi>Isaac,</hi> being fully assured that the Lordes apparant contrary working, could no way be prejudiciall to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his word. O strong! O rare! O wonderfull Faith! Therefore the Lord who giueth no vaine stiles to his seruants, honoureth <hi>Abraham</hi> with this name, <hi>the father of the faithfull.</hi> For by his example, our weakenes is strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue credit to the Lord, when he speaketh to vs.</p>
                     <p>And the same lesson of Faith, is in<note place="margin">3 By Iacob.</note> like manner taught vnto vs, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of patient <hi>Iob</hi> (for many school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters and examples haue wee on whom the ends of the world are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.) No doubt he had laid vp the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God in his heart, whereupon he dependeth: yet doth the Lord han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle him sohardly, both in body and minde, as if hee were determinate to keepe no promise vnto him. Yet <hi>Iob</hi> for all this distrusts not the truth of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17702:31"/>
Gods promise, but gripes them so sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in his greatest extremitie he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solues, <hi>O Lord, albeit thou shouldest slay me, yet will I trust in thee.</hi> That is albeit Lord thou shouldst deale hardlier with me then thou hast done, yet will I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinke but thou wilt bee mercifull to me according to thy promise: there is a heart knit to the Lord; there is a soule cleaning to God without separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that thus concludes. O Lord, none of thy workes shall make me to misbeleeue thy word: though thou cast me downe to hell, my eye shall bee vpward towards thee, &amp; my soule shall loue thee, euen when it appeares thou saist that thou hast no delight in me.</p>

his children; it augments in them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of mercie, and a more earnest care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to seeke the Lord.

                     <p>We haue yet more narrowly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider<note place="margin">There is a striuing with God acceptable to him, &amp; namely, when wee will take no refusall of that that God hath promised.</note> this answere that <hi>Iacob</hi> giues to the Lord: <hi>I will not</hi> (saith hee) <hi>let thee goe,</hi> Is this a seemely answere for a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to giue vnto his Lord? when the Lord sayes let mee goe, becomes it <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> to answere I vvill not let thee goe? Is this good religion, in any thing to striue with the Lord? Yea indeede, ther are some things wherein the Lord is very well content that thou striue vvith him; as namely, when the Lord hath promised any thing vnto thee, and thou hast his word for thy warrant, to seeke it in sort, that albeit the Lord say thee nay, yet thou wilt receiue no refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall at his hands: this is a strife, which pleaseth the Lord, for in effect it is no other thing but a constant affirmation, that his truth is inuiolable. After this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17702:45"/>
manner, that woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> stroue with him, she would take no deniall of that which he had promised: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, here also <hi>Iacob</hi> striues with him, hee will not be denied of a blessing. And <hi>Moses</hi> also stroue with the Lord, protesting he would not go forward one foote, vnlesse the Lord went with him; because the Lord had so promised. But farre be it from vs to striue with the Lord, as the wicked do, grieuing him dayly with our murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and rebellions, still liuing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie tearmes with the Lord. <hi>Woe bee to him, that striueth with his maker, doe yee prouoke the Lord vnto anger? or are yee stronger then hee?</hi> The end of this strife to them wil be horrible confusion</p>
                     <p>There is yet farther to be considered in these words of <hi>Iacob,</hi> how hee saith to the Lord, <hi>I will not let thee goe;</hi> by what meane is this, that <hi>Iacob</hi> is able to hold, and detaine the Lord? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hosea</hi> will resolue this: It was<note place="margin">Nothing in the world so strong as the prayer of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for they are the bands vvhereby the Lord is holden &amp; detained.</note> (saith hee) by mourning, and weeping that <hi>Iacob</hi> preuailed, and helde the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17702:46"/>
Angel, whilst he got the blessing. Ther is nothing so strong in the world, as the prayers of the godly, they are the onely bands, by which the Lord is holden, and detained: the Lord will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by all the powers of the earth, neither will he cease to doe any worke, that he is about to doe, for the cries of all the men in the world: yet the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his children are able to constrain him, to power downe an vndeserued blessing, and turne away a iust deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued punishment. When the people of <hi>Israell</hi> had fallen from God by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the golden Calfe, the Lords anger was highly incensed, and kindled against them, which moued <hi>Moses</hi> to fall downe on his face before the Lord, beseeching him to bee appeased to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, for the glory of his name. This prayer did in such sort constraine the Lord in the midst of his anger, that he is compelled to say vnto <hi>Moses, Let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, for I will consume them.</hi> This manner of speach vsed by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17702:46"/>
the Lord, declares that the prayer of <hi>Moses</hi> did bind and hold in the wrath of God, that it brake not out vpon this people.

Finally, such an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of his whole desires, for a change of his whole inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward disposion, as the childe of God feeles better than hee is able to vtter. Which if we obtaine not in prayer (as many times it falles out) let vs receiue it as a checke of our coldnesse, as a spurre to further humiliation, that so with a new blessing wee may fall to seeke the Lord and his blessing.</p>

how sayes <hi>Iacob</hi> he saw the face of god;<note place="margin">In what sense saith Iacob, hee saw the face of God.</note> seeing the Lord gaue <hi>Moses</hi> this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere when hee sought a sight of his face? <hi>No man can see me and liue:</hi> and we know that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist saith, <hi>No man hath seene God at any time, but the sonne, who is come from the bosome of the Father he hath reuealed him.</hi> How is it then I say, that <hi>Iacob</hi> here saith, <hi>I haue seene God face to face.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answere, that this is spoken in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of other visions and reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made to <hi>Iacob</hi> before: his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is no other but that hee had now seene the Lord, by a more excellent and notable manner of apparition, then euer he had seene before. And where <hi>Moses</hi> is said to haue seene the Lord face to face, this is only spoken in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of <hi>Moses</hi> with other Prophets, who had not so cleare a reuelation of the Majestie of God, as <hi>Moses</hi> had: this is euident out of the Lords owne words. <hi>If there be a Prophet of the Lord among you, I will be knowne to him by a vision, and speake to him by a dreame: my</hi>

Yea wee cannot see a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man as he is; and how then shall wee see the Lord, as hee is? If the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had seene the Lord as he is, then all the fathers had seene him one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way; because God in himselfe, is one, simple, and vndiuided essence: but they saw him many manner of wayes, in diuers so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

such manner of manifestation, as the Lord thought most expedient for the time.</p>
                     <p>But what speake I of the sight of<note place="margin">Neither shall wee see the Lord in the heauen as he is, and why?</note> GOD on the earth? wee shall not see him as hee is in the heauens. For euen those holy Angles which stand about his Throne, are described vnto vs, couering their faces with their two wings, witnessing thereby, that there is a God, of a more infinite glory; then they are able to comprehend. And no meruaile: for euery Creature, Man or Angell, is finite: a vessell of limited and definite bounds. Now sure it is, that no finite thing can comprehend that which is infinite, that <hi>peace of God,</hi> promised vnto vs, <hi>passeth all vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and these things prepared for vs, are such, as the heart of man cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</hi> What then shall wee thinke of him who prepared them?

                     <p>YEt I speake not this to take away that sight of God, which wee shall haue in the heauens. It must bee true which the Apostle saith, <hi>Wee shall see him as he is,</hi> it being vnderstood with these restrictions: First, the sight of God vvhich vve shall haue in heauen, shall bee perfect in respect of vs; the Lord shall dwell in vs fully, and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish euery power and facultie of soule and body, vvith his joyfull presence. Hee shall fill my whole minde with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>is light, no darknesse shall bee left in it: he shall quicken my whole heart, no more deadnesse shall bee in it; and the whole affections shall bee replenished with his peace and joy. Now the Lord<note place="margin">1</note> dwels in vs, but he fils vs not. Wee are yet hungry and thirstie: <hi>Wee know</hi> but in part, but in the heauens wee shall
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17702:73"/>
be filled perfectly with that presence,<note place="margin">It shall be a perfect sight in respect of vs.</note> 
                        <hi>wherein is the fulnesse of ioy:</hi> the Lord shall then be <hi>all things, in all vnto vs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the greatest measure of the sence of mercy, is called by the holy spirit <hi>a tasting, tast and consider how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the Lord is:</hi> but there is promised vnto vs a full satisfaction; <hi>ye shall bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: Inebriabor ab vbertate domus tuae,</hi> I call this sight perfect in respect of vs, the Lord shall fill all that is in vs, wee shall desire no more, but we shall not be able to comprehend all that is in the Lord. <hi>Augustine</hi> expresseth this by a proper similitude: for he compares the godly in the heauens, to vessels cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea, were they neuer so large they shall be filled full of water; and yet that which they containe is nothing, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of that great aboundance which is about them. So euery godly man glorified in heauen, shall be fully filled with gods comfortable presence, so that hee shall know no want, and yet shall he not be able to comprehend that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit majestie, and peace, and joy, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17702:74"/>
glory of the incomprehensible God. Therefore said I, that in respect of vs, wee shall haue in the heauens a perfect sight of God, that is, so farre as we can bee capable of him, <hi>Mensuram plenam, &amp; superfluentem tunc dabit in sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Secondly, that sight of God, that in<note place="margin">2 It shall be an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate sight.</note> heauen wee shall injoy, shall bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, and this is such a sight, as none can vnderstand till wee get it. Yet to make it as plaine as we may, let vs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with that which we haue here in earth. The sight that now we haue of God, is as <hi>through a glasse or a vaile,</hi> that is, by mediate reuelations. Now vvee know him, by seeing him in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: wee know him, by hearing him in his word: we know him also euen in the earth, by spirituall meditation, that begetteth some secret sense of his mercy: yet al these are a <hi>walking by faith, not by sight,</hi> at the least, but a dark sight of God, and through couerings: but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17702:74"/>
in the heauen we shall see him, not by halues, but by an immediate sight, which wee shall then best vnderstand (as I sayd) when we shall attaine vnto it. The Lord of his mercy purge and prepare vs in time, and then hasten<note place="margin">No sight of God in heauen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept first we see him in earth. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto there things are required.</note> that day wherein we shall see him.</p>
                     <p>And yet because eternall life must be begunne on the earth, and that it is not possible wee can see God in the heauen, vnles wee haue first seene him in the earth; let vs take heed vnto those three things whereby wee may attaine vnto the sight of God. First remember that God without his own light cannot<note place="margin">The light of his word.</note> beseen: the eye suppose it be an organe of sight, were it neuer so quicke, seeth nothing in the darke; the Sunne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sunne cannot bee seene: farre lesse can the Lord be seene without the Lord. <hi>In light</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>shall we see light.</hi> If therefore we would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin<note place="margin">Psal.</note> to see the Lord, <hi>let vs walke in his light,</hi> making his word a lanthorne to our feete in all our wayes, taking heede vnto it, as vnto <hi>a most sure word,</hi> and a

light <hi>shining in darknesse,</hi> therewithall<note place="margin">Pet.</note> joyning to the Lords prayer, <hi>Open my eyes, that I may see the wonders of thy law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, we must remember, that<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formitie with God.</note> wee cannot see God without some si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude and conformitie with him. Therefore saith Christ. <hi>Blessed are the poore in spirit for they shall see God.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the members of the body none can see the Sunne but the eye, because of some similitude that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. For as God hath set <gap reason="foreign">

from going forward in the journey, which was enjoyned him by the Lord. We haue shewed you before, how the children of God in their wrestlings do in such sort preuaile, that they get no victory without a wound; who is able to say, that hee hath in such sort fought against Sathan and sin, but oftentimes hee hath beene buffeted by Sathan, and<note place="margin">And the wounds which the Godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all combat make them stronger, and more circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spect.</note> wounded by sinne. Yet such is the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious dispensation of the Lord, that as <hi>Iacobs</hi> hurt made him not giue ouer the journey, but rather confirmes him to go forward with greater boldnesse, now halting on one thigh, then before when hee went straight vpon both: so the Lord doth so dispence the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all battailes of his Children, that out of their manifold falles, buffets, and wounds, which they receiue in this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, hee workes in them a greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of sinne, and loue of righteousnes; a greater attention and circumspection in all their wayes, and a greater feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and zeale to run out the race which is set before them, and to renue the

Thus the Lord by some one sinne, wherein hee susse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his children to haue experience of their weakenesse, wakeneth them to a narrower inquisition of their sins; for a light paine in the head men runne not to the Phisitian, nor to the water for a light spot in their garments: but if the

                     <p>Where wee are not to thinke that this commeth of any goodnesse that is in vs, or in sin which we haue brought forth, but of the excellent wisdome and goodnesse of God: <hi>Deus etiam sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>

And it doth (saith the same Father) more aduance the glory of Gods goodnesse, <hi>etiam de malis bene facere, quam mala esse non sinere,</hi> euen to draw good out of euill, rather then that he should suffer euill not to be.

our bodyes seeme to bee consumed, yet are they but sowne like graines of Wheate, into the field and husbandry of the Lord, which must dye before they be quickned; but in the day of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest, shall spring vp againe most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and shall be restored by the same holy spirit, who now dwels in them: and as to our soules they are releeued our of this house of seruitude, and that they may depart and turne to him from whom they came: therefore haue I<note place="margin">Death compared to the red sea, wherin the Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were drowned, and the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t through to Canaan.

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> How the plots and imaginations of men worke for the best to the Christian.</head>
                     <p>NOw in the last roome concerning, the imaginations of men against vs, wee shall haue cause to say of them in the end, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> said to his brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, <hi>You did it vnto mee for euill but the Lord turned it vnto good.</hi> The whole Historie of Gods Booke, is as a cloude of manifold witnesses, concurring alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to confirme this truth: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my selfe therefore for all, to bring one. When <hi>Dauid</hi> was going forward in the battaile against <hi>Israel,</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chish</hi> King of <hi>Gath,</hi> vnder whom hee soiourned for a while, in the time of his banishment) the remnant Princes of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> commanded him to goe backe; and this they did for the worse to disgrace him, because they distrusted him: but the Lord turned it to him <hi>for the best:</hi> Consider <hi>Dauids</hi>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:17702:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
estate now, and ye shall see him set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt too great extreamities. If he had gone backe of his owne accord, the <hi>Philistines</hi> might haue blamed him &amp; handled him as an enimie: if hee had come forward, hee should haue beene guiltie of the bloud of <hi>Israell,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Saul</hi> the Lords annointed; who was slaine in that battaile.</p>
                     <p>In this strait the wit of man can find him no out-gate, but the prouident mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God deliuers him in such sort, that no occasion of offence is giuen to <hi>Saul</hi> and his people, because <hi>Dauid</hi> came not against them: neither yet could the Philistines condemne him, because hee went back by their commaund. So no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a benefit did <hi>Dauid</hi> receiue euen by that same deede, wherein his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thought they had done him a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table shame: and it should learne vs in our straitest extreamities whereunto men can driue vs, to depend on the Lord, and euer then to hope for an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, when we see none. For such is thy prouidence O Lord, whereby in mercy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17702:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou watchest ouer those euils that are intended against them, that by thee they are turned into good to them.</p>
                     <p>And here we haue further to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">If this comfort belong to euery member, much more to the whole body and state of the Church.</note> that seeing this is the priuiledge of euery one that loues the Lord; much more must it appertaine to the whole Church of God.

                     <p>When the Lord concluded to bring his Church from Canaan, to sojourne in <hi>Aegipt,</hi> he sent such a famine in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, as compelled them to forsake it: but made plenty in <hi>Aegipt</hi> by the hand of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> whom the Lord sent before as a prouider for his Church? and by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17702:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was made so fauourable to <hi>Iacob,</hi> that he was allowed to dwell in Goshen: but when such time came that hee would translate his Church from Aegypt to Canaan, then hee alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Pharaohs</hi> countenance; hee raised vp a new king which knew not <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and turned the Aegyptians harts away from Israell, so that they vexed Israell, and caused them to serue by cruelty: and all this the Lord did, to the end his people should become weary of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, and inforced by violence to make forward to Canaan, whereas otherwise (as it well appeares) if they had beene dandled as in the beginning, they would haue neglected the promised land, and contented themselues with <hi>Onions and Flesh-pots of Aegipt.</hi> Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by his obstinacy brings on himselfe, his iust deserued punishment; &amp; the Lord workes to his people their vndeserued deliuerance: and afterward, when the sins of his people drew to that ripenes, that they had caused their dayes to draw neere, and were come to their

                     <p>THe last lesson wee obserue in this part of the verse, is this: as <hi>All things worke for the best, to them that loue the Lord,</hi> so all things worke for the worst to the wicked: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so cleane, which they defile not, nothing so excellent which they abuse

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17702:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
containing a discription of the persons to whom this priuiledge appertaineth, together with a reason of the former comfort. Of force <hi>all things must worke for the best</hi> (namely to saluation) <hi>to them that loue God,</hi> because <hi>they are called</hi> (namely to saluation) <hi>according to Gods purpose.</hi> The strength of this reason, stands in the necessitie and immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the purpose of God, more sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the decree of the Medes and Persians, for what hee hath decreede cannot be reuoked, anulled or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It is that supreame cause of all, which orders all inferiour causes and incidents whatsoeuer, in such sort, that they must worke to the aduancement of that most high purpose of God.<note place="margin">Our calling comes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and carries vs to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined glory.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This reason is made clearer in the subsequent Verse, where the Apostle lets vs see how the links of the golden Chaine of our Saluation are knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inseperably by the hand of God, that no power in heauen or earth can sunder them: whereof it comes, that he that is sure of one, is sure of all. And
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17702:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now let vs take a short view of it, for confirming of the Apostles Reason. <hi>Election</hi> is the first, and it is the most auncient Charter of the right of Gods Children, to their Fathers inheritance. <hi>Calling</hi> is the second, and it is that gift of God, whereby wee are knowne the sonnes of God, and our <hi>Election</hi> secret in it selfe, is made manifest to our selues and others. <hi>Iustification</hi> is the third, and it is the grace of God, whereby we are infeoft in Iesus Christ, in such sort, that wee are made one with him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of all that is his. <hi>Glorification</hi> is the last, and it is that grace of GOD, whereby vvee shall bee entred in the due time, full Heyres to our heauenly Father.</p>
                     <p>No King on earth can produce so auncient a right to his crowne, as the Christian, effectually called. No man on earth can bee knowne his fathers heire vpon such sufficient warrant, as the Christian: for in his <hi>Regeneration,</hi> the Father communicates to him his Image, his Nature, and his Spirit,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17702:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whereby he begins from feeling to call God his father: and in life and manners resembleth him. No Free-holder so surely infeoft in his Lands, hauing so many confirmations of his right as hath the justified Christian, who vpon his guift, hath receiued the earnest, the Pledge, the Seale, and the Witnesse of the great King: and last of all, the Christian shall be entred to the ful fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of his inheritance, with such joy and triumph in the glorious assembly of the Saints, as the like was neuer seene in the world, no not in Ierusalem that day when <hi>Salomon</hi> sate downe in<note place="margin">1 Kin 1. 14</note> his fathers Throne; then their joy was so great, <hi>That the earth rang with the sound of them,</hi> but nothing comparable to this. And herein stands the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Christian, and certaintie of his saluation.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> How the Christian is made sure of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Glorification.</head>
                     <p>FOr this Chaine of our Saluation, reacheth (as I may say) from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to eternitie: the beginning of it (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit before beginning) is our Election: the end of it (albeit without end) is our glorification: and these two ends of the Chaine, the Lord keepes them sure &amp; secret in his owne hand: but the two middle links of the Chaine, to wit <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and <hi>Iustification,</hi> the Lord hath let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them downe from the Heauen to earth, that we should gripe and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them: that being sure of the two middle Links, wee might also bee sure of the two ends; because the Lord hath knit them inseparably together. Then thou, who wouldest be comforted with the assurance of thy Saluation, take heed of this, making it knowne to thine owne Conscience by a holy life, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17702:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God hath called thee, and iustified thee: Gripe sure, as it were with one hand, the linke of <hi>Calling,</hi> and with the other hand, the linke of <hi>Iustification;</hi> then maist thou know assuredly, Election before the world is thine; <hi>Glorification</hi> after this, shall also be thine. To make this yet more plaine, we are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, this mortall life of ours, is a short interiected point of Time, betwixt two Eternities (if so I may call it:) or like a stepping stone, betwixt two Gulphes, whereupon some in feare and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling worke out their Saluation; and so steps from Gods eternall Election to endlesse glorification.</p>
                     <p>Others againe, in wantonnesse and carelesse securitie drinkes in iniquitie with greedinesse, and so steps from the<note place="margin">By your disposition in this life, each man hath to consider of his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting weale or woe.</note> decree of Reprobation, that most iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they procure their euerlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: So that euery man is to consider of his euerlasting weale or woe, by his present disposition in this life. Oh that wee had sanctified memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to remember this so long as wee
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17702:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are here. If of weaknesse wee fall, wee may rise againe: and if wee haue not learned well to repent in one day, wee haue leaue of the Lords patience to learne it better another day, his name bee praysed therefore, who hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a doore of mercie to sinners, and with long suffering waits for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. But he who in the day of his transmigration steps the wrong step, will neuer get leaue to amend it. Where the tree falles, it shal lie there; the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked dies in their sinnes, and so steps downeward to the deep pit and gulph, out of which there is no redemption. Let vs therefore be wel aduised before wee leape. Let vs fasten our feete in the borders of that <hi>Canaan</hi> in time, which shalbe done, if wee make our whole life a proceeding from <hi>Election</hi> to <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification,</hi> and that through <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Iustification;</hi> which two, hath insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly following them, the Sanctification and Renouation of the whole man.</p>
                     <p>The Lord make vs wise in time, that we may consider our course, and think

of the end wherevnto it leades vs, for there is but one of two, as <hi>Moses</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested to the Israelites, so doe I vnto you: <hi>I haue laid this day, life and death before you:</hi> the Lord giue you grace to make choise of the best.</p>
                     <p>But now to returne to the words of this discription of the persons to whom this priuiledge appertaineth, wee haue these things. First, the <hi>Purpose of God:</hi> Secondly, his Calling <hi>according to his purpose:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>the euident token</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods calling, which is <hi>the loue of God.</hi> The <hi>purpose of God,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thy saluation, thou maist know by thy calling: and if againe thou wilt <hi>try thy calling,</hi> try it by <hi>the loue of God,</hi> which thou finds in thee.

These are Christs little flocke, the fewe cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, the communion of saints, the Lords <hi>third part,</hi> so to speake with <hi>Zacharic;</hi>

                     <p>THen wee see this excellent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge is restrained to them who are called inwardly, and therefore let vs yet a little consider it. This inward Calling is the Communication of Christs sauing grace, vvhereby the minde is inlightened, the heart purified by faith, the affections sanctified, and the whole man reformed. For as the Lord by his Gospell offers to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren righteousnesse and life, so by his holy spirit he giues them that iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, and openeth their hearts to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17702:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
receiue that Grace which is preached and proclaimed to them in the Gospel, So then this worke of our Calling, is altogether the Lords: It is his praise<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> that hee cals things which are not, and makes them to be: the Lord that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded light to shine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, hath giuen to our mindes the light of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Christ Iesus: hee it is that creates in vs a new heart, and putteth<note place="margin">Psal. 41.</note> a new spirit into our bowels, that vvee may walke in his statutes. The Lord promised that hee would call many of the Gentiles to the spiritual Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Ez. 11. 19.</note> to suck out the milke of the breasts of her consolation, and be delighted with the brightnesse of his glory: shall I<note place="margin">Esa. 66.</note> cause others to bee fruitfull (saith the Lord) and remaine barren my selfe? and this his gracious promise hath he most abundantly performed in our dayes; his name be praised therefore.</p>
                     <p>As this worke is onely the Lords,<note place="margin">This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the arme of God, choosing out in the world his own elect.</note> so he restraines it onely to them who are his owne. The outward Calling is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17702:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
extended to all; but the inward calling makes a particular seperation of a few from the remnant: where it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to see the distinction which is made betwixt man and man in all rankes and estates, by this effectuall calling of two Brethren, as <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau:</hi> of two Prophets, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Balaam:</hi> of two Kings, as <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Saul:</hi> of two Apostles, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iudas:</hi> of two theeues, the one is taken, the other reiected, and thus the arme of the grace of God, goes through to euerie corner of the earth, according to his pleasure, culling out by his word, from among the remnant of the world, those who belong to his Election.</p>
                     <p>This grace of God, it enters in a Land, and not into euery Cittie: it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into a Cittie, but not into euery Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie: yea it will enter into a Familie, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Gospell is preached to many, but the blessing brought by the Gospell, lights onely vpon the children of grace: And hereof ariseth this day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinction, which we see betweene man and man, all heare alike, but all haue not Faith, all are not edified alike: Some forsake their sins, and followes the Lord, others forsaking the Lord, walkes on in their sinnes. As the Lord gouerneth the raine, and makes it fall vpon one Cittie, and not vpon another: so hee dispenseth the dew of his grace, that hee makes it droppe downe vpon one heart, and not vpon another. And of this I would wish that so many of you as yet are strangers from Grace, should learne to know your miserable state: What a fearefull thing is this,

If the Lord should do to you as hee did to <hi>Israel,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Achab,</hi> causing it to raine for three yeares &amp; a halfe on all the lands about you, but not vpon your Land, would you not conceiue in it a sensible curse of God vpon you? O Hypocrite, thou that canst discerne the face of the skie, and take vp the tokens of Gods anger in the creature, canst thou not discerne the state of thine owne soule, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this for a sensible curse, that thirty or forty yeares, the showers of sauing and renewing grace, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended vpon the people round about thee, but neuer vpon thy selfe? thou possessest thy old sins and keepest still a hard, a barren, and a fruitlesse heart.

The one is the Spirit of God: the other the Word of God. As to the first, man by nature is so blinded with selfe Loue, that hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts his owne deformitie, beauty, and his bondage libertie: what viler bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage then the Seruitude of sinne? <hi>O quam multos Dominos habet, qui vnum non habet</hi> (said <hi>Ambrose</hi>) and yet man vnregenerate counteth it his libertie to liue vncontrolled in the seruice of his lusts, to doe what hee will: what liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie againe so excellent as to be the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of God; <hi>Seruire Deo est regnare:</hi> and yet foolish man, accounts the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Gods Law (which is the law of libertie) a seruitude, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements

                        <hi>Ezechiel</hi> could not see the abhominable<note place="margin">Ezec. 8. 9.</note> idolatries of the house of Israell, till the Lord taught him to digge through the wall: but we shall be farre lesse able to see the vile abhominations that are in our owne hearts, vntill the spirit of the Lord digge through &amp; demolish that thick and hard wall of induration, that naturallie hideth vs from the sight of our sins, and keepeth vs in blindnesse vnder Sathans bondage.</p>
                     <p>The other thing whereby we are to proceede in this tryall, is the word of God; for euery thing that is imperfect, must be tryed by another not by it self: gold is tryed by the fire &amp; touch stone, the weight of a thing is tryed by the ballance, and the spots of the face are tryed by the glasse. Thus euery imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<note place="margin">Euerie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect thing must be tried by an other then it selfe.</note> thing that is tryed, is tryed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother not by it selfe.

then hee, for hee came to the temple, humble, and penitent, and went home to his house iustified, whereas the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie puft vp with a conceit of his own righteousnesse, and iustifying himselfe, went away out of the Temple more guiltie then he came.

Thinke it not therefore enough albeit vnchallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of man, thou maiest sit downe at the Lords table.

therefore try thou thy selfe, how thou commest to this holy table, whether as <hi>Iohn</hi> louing Iesus, and beloued of him, or as <hi>Iudas</hi> betraying Christ, and accursed of him: for as Christ fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde them, that one of them was a Diuell, so the Apostle hath foretolde vs, that many will eate and drinke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnworthily at this holy table; who they are, wee know not, yet are they known to the Lord; let euery one of vs striue to purge one, euerie man trie himselfe, and wash his hart from his wickednes,<note place="margin">Let euery man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aske for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: is it I Lord.</note> and so shall we be all cleane; let euery man aske for himselfe with the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is it I Lord? am I one of them that comes to betray thee? to crucifie thee againe, &amp; to tread the blood of the new Testament vnder my feete? let vs neuer rest til we haue gotten the Lords certificate in our consciences, and that after due triall of our selues, wee come not as Hypocrites, vnpenitent and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing Atheists, but as diseased and poore sinners, to seeke the Lord Iesus, the Sauiour of the world: for if wee doe so, then shall we get that answere

                     <p>I graunt indeed it is a poynt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duty to admonish our brethren of their sinnes, if it bee done in Loue: for so vvee are commaunded, <hi>Thou shalt</hi>
