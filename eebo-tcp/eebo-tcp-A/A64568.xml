            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WILLIAM THOMAS
his speech in Parliament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have heretofore delivered the
reasons, that induced me, to yeeld
my severall votes touching the
corruption and unsoundnes of the
present Episcopacie and Church
government, so for their unlawfulnesse of their
intermedling in secular affaires; and using civill
power, as also the harme and noxiousnesse of
their sitting as members in the Lords house, and
Iudges in that most honourable and high Court:
Now I crave leave to doe the like in showing the
reasons of my vote concerning Deanes and their
office: I say that my opinion then was and now is
that as the office is unnecessary, them selves use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
so the subsistance of the one and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the other needlesse; nay rather, as I will
declare, most hurtfull, therefore may be easily

are these, that the office of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

tend or conduce (as some have alledged)
to the honour of God, the propagation of piety,
the advancement of learning, or benefit of the
Common-weale, but <hi>

the dishonour and disservice of God, the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
if not destruction of piety, the suppression
and discouragement of learning and learned
men, and the detriment and prejudice of Church
and Common weale; this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> conceive I shall
make most apparent, if time and your patience
will permit: But first I humbly crave leave
(and I thinke it will not be impertinent) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what Deanes were originally in their first
birth; secondly, what in their increase and further
growth; and lastly, their present condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at their full, and, as I thinke, their finall
period.</p>
            <p>As to their originall, it is not to be denyed but
themselves and office are of great antiquity,
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> declaring both; but I doe not say
that it is an ancient office in the church, but what
Officers Deanes then were, be pleased to heare

who carrying that office, quickly hoorded
up a great treasure; at last falling into a deadly
disease past recovery, he was exhorted by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and great men to receive the Sacrament of
Christs body and blood, which he trembling at
refused to doe; whereupon the King admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and commanded him to doe it, hee promised
him thereupon to doe it the next day. Being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
to make his will, hee commanded all
to voyd the roome but one Scribe. Who begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to write his Will in the accustomed formes,
In the name of the Father, of the Sonne, &amp;c. the
Deane perceiving it, commanded him in a rage
to blot it out, and these words onely to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
I bequeath all my goods to my Lord the
King, my body to the grave, and my soule to the
Devils; which being uttered, hee gave up the
ghost. The King hereupon commanded his
carcase to be carried into a cart, and drowned in
the River. Good God, what a change is this
from being humble servants to poore Monkes, to
become proud Prelates, Peers to Princes, Quan|

following.</p>
            <p>1. To rule and order the Church, and to look
to the repaire, and for the decoration thereof,
as is also elsewhere enjoyned.</p>
            <p>2. To preserve discipline and holy rites.</p>
            <p>3. To bee adjuments or assistants to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in Cathedrals, as bee the Archdeacons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p>Part of which assistance is, as seemeth, to
preach for them, but the Bishops will excuse
them that service as too painfull, nay forbid
it as too dangerous; but though they will not
busie themselves in preaching, yet have they
leisure to bee inventive and operative in poore
beggerly toyes and trifles, which neither bring
honour to God nor good to the Church and
people; their preaching and godly life did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
win the peoples hearts to love God, and
them as his Ministers, whom they received as
Angels of God, Embassadors from heaven:
Humilitie, piety and industrie laide the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all those magnificent structures, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
titles, places, revenewes and priviledges
wherewith the Church-men were antiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed,
what hath or is likely to wast and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molish
them is easie to conjecture; King <hi>Iames</hi>
hath delivered it in these words. The naturall
sicknesse that hath ever troubled and beene
the decay of all Churches since the beginning
<pb facs="tcp:96514:6"/>
of the world, hath beene pride, ambition, and
avarice, and these infirmities wrought the
overthrow of the popish Church, in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
and diverse others; but the reformation
of Religion in Scotland was extraordinarily
wrought by God, though many things were
inordinatly done by such as blindly were doing
the worke of God. Thus farre that wife and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Prince.</p>
            <p>But lest I should forget a principall part of
the office, Church Musick, it shall have here the
first place, the rather, for that as I reade the first
comming in thereof was to usher Antichrist, for
Idoe finde in my reading that <hi>Anno 666.</hi> the
yeare that was designed or computed, for the
comming of Antichrist, <hi>Vitalian</hi> Bishop of Rome
brought to the Chirch singing of service and the
use of Organs, &amp;c. as we reade in <hi>Plas, Baleus,</hi>
and others, in the life of <hi>Vitalian,</hi> who therefore
was called the musicall Pope, although at that
time there was greater occasion of sorrow, the
Longobards having entred and wasted Italy,
and therefore fasting and praying had beene
more proper then musicke and melodious sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Here upon (saith mine Author) ignorance
arose among the people, lulled, (as it were)
asleepe by the confused noixe of many voices.
This carried colour of advancing devotion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was no better (as the case then stood)
then the Altar erected to the unknowne God,
<pb facs="tcp:96514:7"/>
               <hi>Acts 17.</hi> Hereby the key of knowledge was hid,
<hi>Luke 11.</hi> When the common people understood
not what was sung. and the heat of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
quenched in men of understanding whose eares
were tickled, but hearts not touched, whilst (at
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> complaineth of himselfe) so most
were more moved by the sweetnesse of the long
then by the sense of the matter, which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ung
unto them, working their bane, like the deadly

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which doth infatuate
and lull asleepe and then devoureth; if Service
in the Latine or unknowne tongue, whereof the
simplest people understood somewhat, was just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
censured, certainly this manner of singing
Psalmes and Service, whereof the most learned
can understand nothing, is to be condemned:
I dislike not singing, though by musick of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
and other instruments, but I wish that what

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> sung may be understood; and as <hi>Iustinian</hi> the

praises of God, so wish I, that Service and
Psalmes may be so read and sung that they may
be understood, and so edifie the mind as well as
please the eare.</p>
            <p>Now I am to declare that this office doth
neither tend to the honour of God, the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
