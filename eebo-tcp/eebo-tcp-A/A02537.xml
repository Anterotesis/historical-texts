            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know where I am; in one of the famous Phrontiſteries of Law, and Iuſtice: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerues Law and Iuſtice, but for the preuention or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of fraud and wickedneſſe? Giue me leaue therefore to bring before you, Students, Maſters, Fathers, Oracles of Law and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the greateſt Cheator and Malefactor in the world, our owne Heart. It is a great word that I haue ſaid, in promiſing to bring him before you; for this is one of the greateſt aduantages of his fraud, that he cannot be ſeene: That as that old Iugler <hi>Apollonius Thyanaeus,</hi> when he was brought before the Iudge, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of ſight; ſo this great Impoſtor, in his very preſenting before you, diſpeareth and is gone; yea ſo cunningly, that he doth it with our owne conſent, and we would be loth that he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17102:4"/>
could be ſeene: Therefore as an Epiphonema to this iuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of deceitfulneſſe, is added <hi>Who can know it?</hi> It is eaſie to know that it is deceitfull, and in what it deceiues, though the deceits themſelues cannot bee knowne, till too late; As wee may ſee the ſhip, and the ſea, and the ſhip going on the ſea, yet the way of a ſhip in the ſea (as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> obſerues) wee know not: God askes, and God ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; What he askes by <hi>Ieremie,</hi> he ſhall anſwer by <hi>S. Paul, Who knowes the heart of man?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>Euen the ſpirit of man that is in him.</hi> If then the heart haue but eyes enow to ſee it ſelfe by the reflection of thoughts, it is enough: Ye ſhall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17102:5"/>
eaſily ſee and heare enough (out of the analogie and reſemblance of hearts) to make you both aſtoniſhed and aſhamed.</p>
            <p>The heart of man lies in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row roome, yet all the world cannot fill it; but that which may be ſaid of the heart, would more than fill a world: Here is a double ſtile giuen it; of deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe; of wickedneſſe; either of which knowes no end, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of being, or of diſcourſe. I ſpend my houre, and might doe my life, in treating of the firſt.</p>
            <p>See then, I beſeech you, the <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> and the <hi>Impoſture</hi>; The Impoſtor himſelfe, <hi>The heart of man</hi>; The Impoſture, <hi>Deceitfull aboue all things.</hi>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:17102:5"/>As deceitfull perſons are wont euer to goe vnder many names, and ambiguous, and muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with an [<hi>aliàs</hi>] ſo doth the heart of man; Neither man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nor any part of man hath ſo many names, as the heart alone; For euery facultie that it hath, and euery action it doth, it hath a ſeuerall name: Neither is there more multiplicitie, than doubt in this name; Not ſo many termes are vſed to ſignifie the heart, as the heart ſignifies many things.</p>
            <p>When ye heare of the heart, ye thinke ſtraight of that fleſhie part in the center of the body which liues firſt, and dies laſt; and whoſe beatings you finde
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17102:6"/>
to keepe time all the body ouer; That is not it which is ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Alas, that is a poore harmeleſſe peece; meerely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue; and if it doe any thing, as the ſubminiſtration of Vitall ſpirits, to the maintenance of the whole frame, it is but good; no, it is the ſpirituall part that lurkes in this fleſh, which is guilty of ſuch deceit. We muſt learne of witty Idolatry to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſtocke and the inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble powers that dwell in it. It is not for me to be a ſticklor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Hebrewes, and the Greeke Philoſophers, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, in a queſtion of naturall learning, concerning the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

reaſons why the ſpirit of God rather places all the ſpirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in the heart, than in the braine; Doubtleſſe in reſpect of the affections there reſident, whereby all thoſe ſpeculatiue abilities are drawne to practiſe; It ſhall ſuffice vs to take things as we finde them, and to hold it for granted, that this Monoſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable (for ſo it is in many lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages) compriſes all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectiue and affectiue world which concerneth man; and in plaine termes to ſay, that when God ſaies <hi>The heart is deceitfull,</hi> he meanes, the vnderſtanding, will, affections are deceitfull.</p>
            <p>The vnderſtanding is doubly deceitfull; It makes vs beleeue
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17102:7"/>
it knowes thoſe things which it doth not; and that it knowes not thoſe things which it doth: As ſome fooliſh Mountebanke, that holds it a great glory to ſeeme to know all things; or ſome preſuming Phyſitian, that thinkes it a ſhame not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe skill in any ſtate of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or diſeaſe; ſo doth our vaine vnderſtanding; therein framing it ſelfe according to the ſpirits it meets withall; if they be proud and curious, it perſwades them, they know euery thing; if careleſſe, that they know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>In the firſt kinde; What hath not the fond heart of man da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to arrogate to it ſelfe? It
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17102:7"/>
knowes all the ſtarres by their names; Tuſh, that is nothing; It knowes what the ſtars meane by their verie lookes, what the birds meane by their chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, as <hi>Apollonius</hi> did; What the heart meanes, by the features of the face; it knowes the euents of life by the lines of the hand: the ſecrets of Art, the ſecrets of Nature, the ſecrets of State, the ſecrets of others hearts, yea the ſecrets of God in the cloſet of heauen; Yea, not only what God hath done, but what he will doe: This is (<hi>Sapiens ſtultitia</hi>) a wiſe folly, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaid of his <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians</hi>; All Figure-caſters, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſters, Phyſiognomers, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-tellers, Alchymiſts, fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17102:8"/>
and ſparkling, the Moone horned, the Planets equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, the Sunne ſometimes red, pale other ſome: ſo doth alſo our vnderſtanding erre, in miſ-opinion of diuine things; It thinkes it knowes God, when it is but an Idoll of fancy, as <hi>Sauls</hi> meſſengers, when they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the roome, thought they had the true <hi>Dauid,</hi> when it was but a Wiſpe; it knowes the will of God, when it is nothing but groſſe miſ-conſtruction: ſo as the common knowledge of men, though they thinke it a Torch, is but an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> to leade them to a ditch: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand Aſſyrians thinke they are in the way to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17102:9"/>
when they are in the midſt of <hi>Samaria?</hi> How many milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thinke they walke fairely on to heauen, when indeed they are in the broad way that leads to deſtruction? Oh poore blind Pagans, halfe-ſighted Turkes, bleare-eied Iewes, blind-folded Papiſts, Squint-eied Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, purblind ignorants, how well doe they finde themſelues pleaſed with their deuotion, and thinke God ſhould bee ſo too; when it is nothing but a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of meſpriſon, ſuperſtition, conceitedneſſe; and (according to the ſeldome-reuerently-vſed prouerb) whiles they thinke they haue God by the finger, they hold a deuill by the toe;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17102:9"/>
and all this, becauſe their heart deceiues them. If careleſſe, and loth to bee at the paines of knowing more, it perſwades them they know enough; that they cry out of more, as he did on the ointment, (<hi>Vt quid perditio haec?</hi>) What needs all this waſte? and makes them as conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for knowledge, as <hi>Eſau</hi> was for cattle, <hi>I haue enough, my brother, keepe that thou haſt to thy ſelfe</hi>; or as contentedly-reſolute, as the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> in the Goſpell: <hi>Soule take thy eaſe, thou haſt knowledge enough laid vp for many yeeres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence it is, that too many reſt ſimply (yea wilfully) in their owne meaſure, not ſo much as wiſhing more skill in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17102:10"/>
Soule-matters; applauding their owne ſafe mediocritie; like the credulous blinde man that thought he now ſaw a ſhimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Sunne-beames, when indeed his backe was towards it: Hence it is that they ſcoffe at the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, ſcorne the forward bookiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of others, fearing nothing but a ſurfet of Manna, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to know more than their neighbours, than their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; &amp; thus are led on muffled vp in an vnfelt ignorance, to their graue, yea, (without the mercy of God) to their hell.</p>
            <p>And as in theſe things there is a preſumption of knowing what we doe not; ſo contrarily,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17102:10"/>
a diſſimulation and conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the knowledge of what we doe vnderſtand; The heart of man is a great lier to it ſelfe this way; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies that of Pagans, which I may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay of Chriſtians, they haue the effect of the law written in their hearts; yet many of them will not bee acknowne of one letter ingrauen there by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God: Certaine common principles there are (together with this law) interlinearily writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the tables of the heart, as that we muſt doe as we would be done to; That there is a God; That this God is infinite in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and truth, and muſt be ſerued like himſelfe; theſe they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17102:11"/>
either blot out, or lay their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on, that they may not bee ſeene, purpoſely, that they may ſinne freely; and faine would perſwade themſelues they neuer had any ſuch euidence from God: ſo putting off the checks of conſcience with bold deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls; like the harlot of <hi>Iericho,</hi> (but worſe than ſhe) that hath hid the Spies, and now out-faces their entertainment: Wherein the heart doth to it ſelfe, that which <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the Ammonite, would haue done to Iſrael, put out his owne right eie, that it may not ſee that law whereby it might be conuinced, and finde it ſelfe miſerable. Thus the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of man is euery

way deceitfull in ouerknowing, miſ-knowing, diſſembling; in all which it is like an euill and vnfaithfull eye, that either will be ſeeing by a falſe glaſſe, or a falſe light, or with diſtortion; or elſe wilfully cloſes the lids that it may not ſee at all; and in all this deceiues vs.</p>
            <p>The will is no leſſe cunning; which though it make faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of a generall inclination to good, yet (<hi>hîc &amp; nunc</hi>) in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, hangs towards a pleaſing euill; Yea though the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding haue ſufficiently infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it of the worthineſſe of good, and the turpitude of euill, yet being ouercome with the falſe delectableneſſe of ſinne, it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17102:12"/>
yeelds to a miſſe-aſſent; Reaſon being (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeakes) either ſwallowed vp by ſome paſſion, or held downe by ſome vicious habit: It is true, ſtill the Will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the Reaſon, neither can doe otherwiſe; but therefore, if Reaſon miſ-led be contrary to Reaſon, and a ſchiſme ariſe in the ſoule, it muſt follow that the Will muſt needs be contrary to Will and Reaſon; Wherein it is like a Planet, which though it be carried about perpetually by the firſt mouer, yet ſlily creepes on his owne way, contrary to that ſtrong circumuolution: And though the minde be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conuinced of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or profit of a good act, yet
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17102:12"/>
for the tediouſneſſe annexed to it, in a dangerous ſpirituall ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, it inſenſibly ſlips away from it, and is content to let it fall; As ſome idle, or fearfull Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, that could be glad to haue gold, if it would come with eaſe, but will not either take the paines, or hazard the aduenture to fetch it: Thus commonly the Will (in both reſpects) Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like lookes forward, and rowes backward; and vnder good pretences doth nothing but deceiue.</p>
            <p>The affections are as deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as either; whether in miſſe-placing, meaſure, or manner.</p>
            <p>Miſ-placing: They are fiery where they ſhould be coole; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17102:13"/>
where they ſhould burne, freeze; Our heart makes vs beleeue it loues God, and giues him pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of affection; whiles it ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doats vpon the world; like ſome falſe ſtrumpet, that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines her husband with her eyes, and in the meane time treads vpon the toe of an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer vnder the board: That it loues iuſtice, when it is but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge; That it grieues for the miſſing of Chriſt, when indeed it is but for the loaues and fiſhes; That it feares God, when indeed it is but afraid of our owne tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; That it hates the ſinne, when it is the perſon; That it hates the world, when it thruſts God out of doores to lodge it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:17102:13"/>Meaſure: That we loue God enough, and the world but enough, when as indeed the one loue is but as the cold fit of an ague, the other an hot; we chill in the one, no leſſe than we glow in the other; when wee make God only a ſtale to draw on the world; That wee doe enough hate our corruptions, when (at our ſharpeſt) we doe but gently ſneape them, as <hi>Hely</hi> did his ſons; or as ſome indulgent parent doth an vnthriftie darling, whom he chides, and yet feeds with the fewell of his exceſſe; That we haue grieued enough for our ſinnes, when they haue not coſt vs ſo much as one teare, nothing but a little faſhionable
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17102:14"/>
winde, that neuer came further than the roots of our tongue; That we doe enough compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate the afflictions of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> when we drinke wine in bowles; That wee feare God more than men, when wee are aſhamed to doe that in preſence of a childe, which wee care not to doe in the face of God.</p>
            <p>Manner: That our heart loues, and hates, and feares, and ioyes, and grieues truly, when it is an hypocrite in all; That it delights conſtantly in God, and holy things, when it is but an <hi>Ephraims</hi> morning dew; That our anger is zealous, when it is but a flaſh of perſonall malice, or a ſuperſtitious furie; That we
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17102:14"/>
feare as ſonnes, when it is as cowards, or ſlaues; That we grieue as Gods patients, when we fret, and repine, and ſtruggle like franticks againſt the hand of our Maker. Thus (to ſumme vp all) the heart of man is wholly ſet vpon cozenage; the vnderſtanding ouer-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, miſ-knowing, diſſembling; The will pretending, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning contrarily; The affections mocking vs in the obiect, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, manner; and in all of them the heart of man is deceitfull.</p>
            <p>Ye haue ſeene the face of this Cheater; looke now at his hand; and now ye ſee who this Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is, ſee alſo the ſleights of his deceit; and therein, the faſhion,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17102:15"/>
the ſubiect, the ſequell of it; from whence we will deſcend to our Demeanure towards ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an Impoſtor.</p>
            <p>The faſhion of his deceit is the ſame with our ordinary Iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; either cunning conueyance, or falſe ſemblance. Cunning conueyance, whether into vs, in vs, from vs.</p>
            <p>The heart admits ſinne, as Paradiſe did the Serpent; There it is, but by what chinkes or cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it entered, we know not; ſo as we may ſay of ſinne as the Maſter of the feaſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell ſaid to his ſlouenly gueſt, <hi>Quomodo intraſti? How cameſt thou in hither?</hi> Corruption doth not eat into the heart as our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17102:15"/>
did into the apple, ſo as the print of their teeth might bee ſeene, but as the worme eats into the core, inſenſibly; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there leſſe cloſeneſſe when it is entered; I would it were as vntrue a word, as it is an harſh one, that many a profeſſedly-Chriſtian heart, lodges a deuill in the blinde roomes of it, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowes it not, or will not be acknowne of it; euery one that harbours a willing ſinne in his breſt, doth ſo: The malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man hath a furious deuill; the wanton an vncleane deuill, a <hi>Beelphegor,</hi> or a <hi>Tammuz</hi>; the proud man a <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous a <hi>Mammon</hi>; Certainly, theſe foule ſpirits are not more truly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17102:16"/>
in hell, than in a wicked heart; there they are, but ſo cloſely, that I know not if the heart it ſelfe know it; it being verified of this citadell of the heart, which was ſaid of that vaſt <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niue,</hi> that the enemie had taken ſome parts of it, long ere the other knew it: What ſhould I ſpeake of the moſt common, and yet moſt dangerous gueſt, that lodges in this Inne of the heart, Infidelity? Call at the doore, and aske if ſuch a one hoſt not there; They within make ſtrange of it, deny it, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare it; Call the officers, make priuy ſearch, you ſhall hardly finde him: Like ſome Ieſuite in a Popiſh dames chamber, he is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17102:16"/>
ſo cloſely contriued into falſe floores, and double walls, that his preſence is not more eaſily knowne, than hardly conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, confeſſed. How eaſie is it to ſay, that if infidelity did not lurke in the hearts of men, they durſt not doe as they doe; they could not but doe, what they doe not? Durſt they ſin if they were perſwaded of an hell? durſt they buy a minute of pleaſure with euerlaſting torments? Could they ſo ſleight heauen if they beleeued it? Could they be ſo loth to poſſeſſe it? Could they thinke much of a little painfull goodneſſe to purchaſe an eternity of happineſſe? No, no, men, fathers, and brethren;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17102:17"/>
if the heart were not Infidell, whiles the face is Chriſtian, this could not bee. Neither doth the heart of man more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly conuey ſinne into, and in it ſelfe, than from it; The ſin that ye ſaw euen now openly in the hands, is ſo ſwiftly paſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the board, that it is now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; Looke for it in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, there it is not; looke for it vnder his tongue, there is none; looke for it in his conſcience, ye finde nothing; and all this by the <hi>legier-de-maine</hi> of the heart: Thus <hi>Achan</hi> hath hid his wedge, and now he dares ſtand out to a lot; Thus <hi>Salomons</hi> Harlot hath wip't her mouth, and it was not ſhe: Thus <hi>Saul</hi> will lie-out his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17102:17"/>
ſacriledge, vntill the very beaſts out-bleat, and out-bellow him; Thus the ſwearer ſweares, and when he hath done, ſweares that hee ſwore not; Thus the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane fornicator bribes off his ſinne, and his ſhame, and now makes challenges to the world of his honeſty. It cannot be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken how peeuiſhly witty the heart of man is this way; neither doubt I but this wilineſſe is ſome of the poyſon that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſerpent infected vs with in that fatall morſell: They were three cunning ſhifts which the Scripture recordeth of three wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (as that ſex hath beene euer noted for more ſudden preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie of wit) <hi>Rachel, Rahab,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17102:18"/>
the good wife of <hi>Bahurim</hi>; The firſt hiding the Teraphim with a modeſt ſeat, the ſecond, the ſpics with flaxe-ſtalkes, and the third <hi>Dauids</hi> ſcouts with corne ſpred ouer the Well; but theſe are nothing to the deuices that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath wont to vſe for the cloaking of ſinne; <hi>God made man vpright,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, but he ſought many inuentions</hi>: Is <hi>Adam</hi> challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for ſinne? Behold all on the ſudden it is paſſed from his hand, to Gods; <hi>The woman that thou gaueſt me</hi>: Is <hi>Saul</hi> challenged for a couetous and diſobedient remiſſeneſſe? the ſinne is ſtraight paſſed from the field to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; <hi>I ſaued the fatteſt for a ſacrifice to the Lord thy God</hi>; So the one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17102:18"/>
begins his ſinne in God, and the other ends it in him: Is <hi>Dauid</hi> bewitched with luſt to abuſe the Wife? the Husband muſt bee ſent home drunke, to hide it, or if not that, to his long home, in a pretended fauour of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: Is a griping Vſurer diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to put his money together to breed a monſter? hee hath a thouſand quirks to cozen both law and conſcience: Is a Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacall Patron diſpoſed to make a good match of his peoples ſoules? it ſhall be no bargaine, but a gift: hee hath a liuing to giue, but an horſe to ſell. And ſure I thinke in this wiſe age of the world, Vſurers and Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts ſtriue who ſhall finde the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17102:19"/>
wittieſt way to hell: What ſhould I ſpeake of the ſecret frauds in contracts, booties in matches, ſubornation of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hiring of oathes, feeing of officers, equiuocations of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, and ten thouſand other tricks that the heart of man hath deuiſed for the conueiances of ſinne; in all which it too well approues it ſelfe incomparably deceitfull.</p>
            <p>The falſe ſemblance of the heart is yet worſe; for the former is moſt-what for the ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of euill; this is for the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of euill, or the diſgrace of good; In theſe two doth this act of falſhood chiefly conſiſt; in making euill good, or good
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17102:19"/>
euill. For the firſt; The naturall man knowes well how filthy all his brood is, and therefore will not let them come forth, but diſguiſed with the colours and dreſſes of good; ſo as now euery one of natures birds is a Swan; Pride is handſomneſſe, deſperate fury, valour; lauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is noble munificence, drunkenneſſe ciuility, flattery complement, murderous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, iuſtice; the Curtizan is <hi>bona foemina,</hi> the Sorcerer a wiſe man, the oppreſſor a good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; <hi>Abſolom</hi> will goe pay his vowes; <hi>Herod</hi> will worſhip the Babe. For the ſecond; ſuch is the enuy of nature, that where ſhee ſees a better face than her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17102:20"/>
owne, ſhe is ready to ſcratch it, or caſt dirt in it; and therefore knowing that all vertue hath a natiue beauty in it, ſhe labours to deforme it by the fouleſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations. Would the Iſraelites be deuout? they are idle; Doth <hi>Dauid</hi> daunce for ioy before the Arke? he is a foole in a Morris: Doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſe of his heauenly Viſion? too much learning hath made him mad. Doe the Diſciples miraculouſly ſpeake all the tongues of Babel? They are full of new wine: Doe they preach Chriſts Kingdome? they are ſeditious; The reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? they are bablers. Is a man conſcionable? he is an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite: Is he conformable? he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17102:20"/>
is vnconſcionable: Is he plaine dealing? he is rudely vnciuill: Is he wiſely inſinuatiue? he is a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer: In ſhort, ſuch is the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked craft of the heart, that it would let vs ſee nothing in it owne forme; but faine would ſhew vs euill faire, that we might be inamored of it, and vertue vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we might abhorre it; and as it doth for the way, ſo doth it for the end; hiding from vs the glory of heauen, that is laid vp for ouer-commers, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs nothing but the pleaſant cloſure of wickedneſſe; making vs beleeue that hell is a palace, and heauen a dungeon, that ſo we might be in loue with death; and thus both in cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17102:21"/>
and falſe ſemblance, <hi>The heart of man is deceitfull aboue all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye haue ſeene the faſhion of this deceit; caſt now your eies vpon the ſubiect: And whom doth it then deceiue? It doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue others, it can deceiue it ſelfe, it would deceiue Sathan, yea God himſelfe. Others, firſt: How many doe we take for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſound Chriſtians, who yet are but errant hypocrites? Theſe Apes of Sathan haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to transforme themſelues into Angels of light; The heart bids the eies looke vpward to heauen, when they are full of adultery; It bids the hands to raiſe vp themſelues towards
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17102:21"/>
their Maker, when they are full of bloud; It bids the tongue wagge holily, when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the boſome but Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous profaneneſſe; It bids the knee to bow like a Camel, when the heart is ſtiffe as an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; yea if need bee it can bid a teare fall from the eie, or an almes or iuſt action fall from the hand, and all to gull the world with a good opinion; In all which, falſe chapmen and horſe-courſers doe not more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily deceiue their buyers in ſhops and faires, than wee doe one another in our conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Yea, ſo crafty is the heart that it can deceiue it ſelfe; By ouer-weening his own powers,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17102:22"/>
as the proud man; by vnder-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing his graces, as the modeſt; by miſ-taking his eſtate, as the ignorant; How many hearts doe thus groſſely beguile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? The firſt thinkes hee is rich, and fine, when hee is beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly and naked; ſo did the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of Laodicea: The ſecond is poore in his owne ſpirit, when he is rich of Gods ſpirit: The third thinkes that he is a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorite of heauen, when he is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branded for an out-caſt; that he is truly noble, when he is a ſlaue to that, which is baſer than the worſt of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſinne: Let the proud and ignorant worldling therefore know, that though others may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17102:22"/>
mocke him with applauſes, yet that all the world cannot make him ſo much a foole as his owne heart.</p>
            <p>Yea, ſo cunning is the heart, that it thinkes to goe beyond the deuill himſelfe: I can (thinks it) ſwallow his bait, and yet auoid his hooke; I can ſinne, and liue; I can repent of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and defeat my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by repenting; I can runne vpon the ſcore, and take vp the ſweet and rich commodities of ſinfull pleaſure; and when I haue done, I can put my ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of a Sauiour, and eſcape the arreſt: Oh the world of ſoules that periſh by this fraud, fondly beguiling
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17102:23"/>
themſelues, whiles they would beguile the Tempter.</p>
            <p>Yet higher: Laſtly, as Satan went about to deceiue the Son of God; ſo this fooliſh conſort and client of his goes about to deceiue God himſelfe: The firſt paire of hearts that euer was, were thus credulous, to thinke they ſhould now meet with a meanes of knowledge and Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, which God either knew not of, or grudged them, and therefore they would be ſtealing it out of the ſide of the apple, without God, yea againſt him: Tuſh, none eye ſhall ſee vs; <hi>Is there knowledge in the moſt high,</hi> ſaith the ſottiſh Atheiſt? <hi>Lord, haue not we heard thee preach in out
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17102:23"/>
ſtreets? haue not we caſt out Deuils in thy name?</hi> ſayes the ſmoothing hypocrite; as if he could fetch God ouer for an admiſſion into heauen. <hi>Thou haſt not lied to man, but to God,</hi> ſaith <hi>S.

               <hi>Oh yee fooles, when will ye vnderſtand? He

            </p>
            <p>Ye haue ſeene the faſhion and the ſubiect of this deceit: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell, or effect followes; euery way lamentable; For hence it comes to paſſe that many a one hath had his heart in keeping fortie, fiftie, threeſcore yeeres, and more, and yet is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it; and all becauſe this craft hath kept it at the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcillianiſts locke, <hi>Tu omnes, te ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi>;
