         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A Manifestation of the Spirits of some Envious
Professors, who are ready to prefer the Hireling

Revelation and Coming of Christ in Spirit, as their Fore-Fathers
Works of Cruelty and Murder were against him in
the Dayes of his Flesh, as may be seen at large in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Truth.</p>
            <p>This was chiefly occasioned by some Nonconformists
promoting the Works of Darkness of a Conformist (or
Chief Priest of <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> called, <hi>Thomas Willson,</hi> in

its like to the Hard-hearted, Stubborn and Rebellious (like

            <head>The Wisdom of the Earthly Wise
CONFOUNDED, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WE, whom the heavenly Day-spring of God from
on High hath visited, who were once in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and the Shadow of Death, as well as
others: I say, We do not marvel to see (the Literal Outside
Professors of this Generation, of all Sorts and Perswasions (out
of the Truth) as well as <hi>Chief-Priests</hi> (the Old Enemies of Christ)
though they so much differ and disagree amongst themselves)
how ready they are to joyn Hand in Hand against the Lord and
his blessed Heritage, whom he hath blessed, and will bless above
all the Families of the Earth: Yea, how ready are you to
catch up and imbrace any piece of Darkness and Confusion that
ariseth out of the Bottomles. Pit of the <hi>Deceived, Envious</hi> and
<hi>Babylonish Hearts</hi> of such as hate the Witness or Light of Christ
in their own Consciences; and also envy such, who by <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
in the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Christ within are Witnesses</hi> of his <hi>Spiritual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</hi>
So all you Malicious <hi>Papists, Chief-Priests, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,
Independents,</hi> and <hi>Baptists</hi> of all sorts; &amp;c. that do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in <hi>Christ, the true Light, who lighteth every one that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World,</hi> according to <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. &amp; 8. 12. &amp; 9. 5. are all
wrong in the Ground, and you are all against us, and we are
against you all, till you come out of Deceit, Envy and Unbelief;
we know your Spirits will concur against us, as did your <hi>Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors</hi>
(the <hi>chief-Priests,</hi> the hard-hearted <hi>Iews, Scribes, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,
Saduces, &amp;c.</hi>) against Christ and his Followers in the
days of his Coming in the Flesh, who as Christ told them, they did
<hi>Err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God,</hi> Mat. 22. 29.
And even so do ye, who will not abide his Spiritual Appearance
in your selves, nor in such as are Witnesses of it. So in this
State you are all from the Highest to the Lowest, of all sorts, both
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58439:3"/>
Priests, Teachers aad People far from the true Interpretations
of holy Scriptures; and if ever you come truly to it, you must
come down from climbing up another way, to Christ the Door
and Light of the World, <hi>who lighteth every man that cometh into
the World.</hi> And also, if you will be true Followers of him, that
you may have Life and Treasure in Heaven, you must with the
Young man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. (which I believe will be as hard for
many of you Rich Ones in your Natural Wisdoms, as for him)
<hi>Sell all</hi> your great Possessions of that Wisdom which is from
below, which is <hi>Earthly, Sensual</hi> and <hi>Devilish,</hi> in which you
have given false Interpretation upon the holy Scriptures, and
thereby wofully wrested them to Justifie or Indulge your selves
in a continuance in sin to the end of your days; <hi>the Wages of which
is Death,</hi> as faith the Apostle, <hi>But the Spirit gives Life,</hi> and leads
to true Interpretations of holy Scriptures; though Contrary to
your Natural, Dark Conceptions and Imaginations: <hi>The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, they are
Foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are
Spiritually discerned;</hi> see 1 Cor. 2.</p>
            <p>Now, I would have all you Outside, Literal Imitaters of all
sorts (that are not too high &amp; too swelled with your vain Notions
and Imaginations) to lay them by a while, and consider Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
since there is but <hi>One <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay</hi> to God, and <hi>One Truth, One
Lord, One Faith, One Baptism,</hi> (which is Spiritual, and only
known to the true <hi>Spiritual Worshippers</hi>) Mark, <hi>One God and
Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all,</hi>
Ephes. 4. 5. and a Mystery to you all, and ever will be while
strangers to the Light of Christ within, which will give a right
Understanding of Scriptures to them that believe in it and follows
it, and will lead to a right use of them, &amp;c. But how many <hi>Ways,
Worships, Faiths, Baptisms,</hi> &amp;c. are there amongst you, every
one Crying up his own Way and Form, pretending to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
for it: Oh! what Distractions and Confusions are here!
And where must they be charged, upon the Scriptures or upon
you, with your many <hi>Lo here's</hi> and <hi>Lo there's?</hi> Every one for
his own Way, in Opposition to the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is but <hi>One</hi>
and his <hi>People One</hi> in it. Now look upon your selves and among
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58439:3"/>
your selves, and behold the Fruits of your Interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
Is it not to make the World or People like a Wilderness?
<hi>Lo here, Lo there; See here, See there!</hi> But what saith Christ?
<hi>Believe them not, go not after them, nor follow them; for behold the
Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> Luke. 17. 21. Thus saith our Lord
Christ Jesus, and we have believed him, and in our measures
have Infallibly found it so.</p>
            <p>And if this should seem strange Doctrine to any, to whose hands
these may come, though of the many Ways, Forms and Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
since you all profess the Scriptures to be your Rule; I
would know how you Interpret these following Scriptures.</p>
            <p>God is a Spirit, <hi>(as Christ said)</hi> and is to be Worshipped in the
Spirit and in the Truth. God is Light, and in him there is no
Darkness at all. If we say, that we have fellowship with him, and
walk in Darkness, we Lye, and do not the Truth; but if we walk
in the Light, as he is in the Light, then have we fellowship one with
another, and the Blood of Iesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all
Sin. <hi>Christ said,</hi> I am the Light of the World, he that follows
me shall not walk in Darkness, but he shall have the Light of Life:
<hi>and said,</hi> Believe in the Light, that ye may be the Children of the
Light. The Grace of God which bringeth Salvation hath appeared
to all men, teaching us that denying Vngodliness &amp; Worldly Lusts,
we should live Godly, Righteously, &amp;c. in this present World: <hi>This
Grace appearing unto all, is, that all might believe therein,
and obey it, and be saved; but some of Old</hi> did dispight unto the
Spirit of Grace <hi>(as many do now) against whom the Apostle
testified, and</hi> Iude <hi>in his Epistle witnesses against such. The
Apostle said unto the Saints,</hi> By Grace ye are saved, through
Faith, <hi>&amp;c. and said,</hi> Its a good thing that the Heart be established
with Grace: <hi>And the Lord said to</hi> Paul, My Grace is sufficient
for thee, &amp;c. <hi>Christ in his Parable of the Talents, and of the
Pearl, and of the Field, and of the Sower, and of the good Seed,
which fell upon the divers Grounds, doth clearly hold forth
the Universal Love of God unto all People. God said by the
Prophet,</hi> Look unto me, O all the Ends of the Earth, and be ye
Saved, &amp;c. As many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58439:4"/>
Sons of God. The Spirit of Truth, which doth lead the Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all Truth, the same doth Convince the World of Sin, <hi>as Christ
hath promised. Christ said,</hi> This is the Condemnation, that Light
is come into the World, and men loved Darkness rather than Light,
because their Deeds were Evil; for every one that doth Evil, hateth
the Light, neither cometh to the Light, lest his Deeds should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;
but he that doth Truth, cometh to the Light, that his Deeds
may be made manifest that they are wrought in God: <hi>See John 3.
19, 20, 21. &amp; 1. 9. &amp; 8. 12.</hi> First Epistle of <hi>John 1. 5, 6, 7.
John 16. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Jer. 17. 10. Psal. 7. 10.
Mal. 3. 5. 1 John 5. 10. Isa. 55. 4. Rom. 8. 13, 14. Psal.
50. 16, to the End. Acts 13. 47. &amp; 26. 17, 18. 2 Cor. 4. 6, 7.
Let us hear what Interpretations you will give to these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Again, the Apostle</hi> Iohn <hi>saith,</hi> God is Love, he that dwelleth in
Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. <hi>Again,</hi> He that hateth
his Brother is a Murtherer, and no Murtherer hath Eternal Life
abiding in him. <hi>Again, Christ said unto the Saints,</hi> I and my
Father will come, and make our abode with you. <hi>And God hath
promised,</hi> That he will dwell in his People, and that he will
write his Law in their Hearts, and put his Spirit in their Minds,
<hi>&amp;c. Let us see how skilful you are in Interpreting these heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comfortable Sayings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord God said by the Mouth of the true Prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the false, <hi>Wo unto the Foolish Prophets, who follow their
own Spirit, and have seen nothing,</hi> Eccles. 13. 11. But the true
Apostle said, <hi>The Spirit it self beareth Witness with our Spirit,
that we are the Children of God.</hi> This Spirit was and is all the
true <hi>Christians</hi> Guide: this did of old, and now doth bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with, or unto the Spirits of all true Believers, that they are
the Children of God, who are led thereby; for it leads them
to do those things which please God. The Apostle saith, <hi>The
Scriptures came not in Old Time by the Will of man, but holy men
of God spoke them as they were moved by the holy Ghost, or Spirit;</hi>
and he saith, <hi>they are of no private Interpretation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So you who deny Immediate Revelation, and deny and hate
the Universal, Infallible Spirit of God and Christ, you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Interpret the Scriptures with or by, but your own fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58439:4"/>
private Spirits, and the wicked Spirit, <hi>The Prince of the
Power of the Air, which works in the Hearts of the Children of
Disobedience,</hi> as saith the Apostle, and with these joynt workers
in Wickedness you cannot rightly Interpret the holy Scriptures;
but by the help of this dark Spirit you are taught to wrest them
to your own Destruction: The Lord in mercy deliver you from
this false Teacher.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a man that gave to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
Talents, <hi>&amp;c. Matth. 25. 14.</hi> A manifestation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is given to every man to profit withal, <hi>1 Cor. 12. 7.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
makes manifest is Light, and Christ is that Light, <hi>Ephes. 5.
13.</hi> He that declareth to man his Thoughts, the Lord the God of
Hosts is his Name, <hi>Amos 4. 13. Elihu</hi> was constrained by the
Spirit within, <hi>Job 32. 18.</hi> The Word of God is within, <hi>Deut.
30. 14. Psal. 119. 11.</hi> The Law and the Covenant of Life is
within, <hi>Jer. 31. 33.</hi> The Word of Faith that purifieth the

Iesus Christ is in you, except you be Reprobates, <hi>2 Cor. 13. 5.</hi> The
Mystery that hath been hid from Ages and Generations is Christ
within, <hi>Col. 1. 26.</hi> The Anointing the true Teacher that shall never
be removed into a Corner is within, <hi>1 John 2. 27. Isa. 30. 20.</hi> That
which may be known of God is manifest within, <hi>Rom. 1. 19.</hi> I thank
thee, O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid
these things from the Wise and Prudent, and hast revealed them
unto Babes, <hi>Matth. 11. 25. see 1</hi> Cor. <hi>1. 26.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not led by our own Conceivings nor Imaginations
(as the Carnal-minded out-side Professors are) to interpret the
holy Scriptures but by a measure of the same Spirit of Truth,
from which they were given forth, in and by which they can
be only and alone truly read and known, by which Spirit we are
made living Witnesses to the Truth of them, and can read
them within, which is far more then the bare outward reading.
<hi>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
understanding that we may know him that is true,</hi> John 5. 20. <hi>And
greater is he that is in us</hi> (that teaches true Reading and right
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58439:5"/>
Interpretations of holy Scriptures) <hi>then he thats in the World,</hi>
1 John 4. 4. <hi>And hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in
us, because he hath given us of his Spirit,</hi> 1 John 14. 13. <hi>And
we are sure it is he, for he hath done that in us and for us that none
other could do. And he that believeth, hath the Witness in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> 1 John 5. 10.</p>
            <p>So our God is a God at hand, a Just, Righteous and a Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
God, who in his everlasting love hath committed a Talent or
Measure of his Grace (and giveth his Light for a Witness and
a Leader, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 4.) to every Man and Woman that cometh
into the World, and according to their improving or not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of it, believing or not believing in it, is the Salvation
or Condemnation of all mankind. Now to speak comparatively
after the manner of men, if a man should demand a sum of Money
with Usury of another, that never had any of him, and condemn
him for want of it, would it not be altogether Unjust? But the
true God is Just and Righteous in all his wayes, and man's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
is of himself. And further we say, that God in his
endless love hath offered a Day or Time of Visitation to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and that by his secret Reproofs at times in their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for Self-Righteousness, as well as their other Ungodliness,
that they might turn to his Grace, (which hath appeared to all
men) Light or Witness within them, and live.</p>
            <p>And all you confused Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> with your many <hi>Lo
here's</hi> and <hi>Lo there's,</hi> you have rejected the Head or chief Corner-Stone
and true Foundation; and if you will be truly Wise, that
you may know him, you must first become Fools that you may
be Wise, and then you will throw down and lay waste all your
lofty Buildings of Self Righteousness, and dig deeper then ever
you have done yet to the true Rock and Foundation, and whoso
Bui'ds truly thereupon shall be safe.</p>
            <p>But all you talkative Letter-wise People and Professors of all
sorts, that have no other Ru'e to try Spirits and Doctrines but
the Scriptures, [in your Natural Carnal Reasons, and fallen
Degenerated Wisdoms] though you neither know them nor the
Power of God, but are putting Darkness for Light, and Light for
Darkness, justifying the Wicked and condemning the Righteous,
as did they whose steps you follow: What! did you never read
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58439:5"/>
or take notice of the Fruits of trying Spirits and Doctrines by
the Scriptures in their Carnal Reasons &amp; Degenerate Wisdoms
(being out of the <hi>spirit</hi> which gives a right understanding of them)
Was it not to Condemn the Saviour of the World, and his blessed
Followers to Death? Oh! Outside, Literal Professors of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration!
take heed ye be not found spiritually in the same steps:
The holy Scriptures we more dearly &amp; truly own, in their places,
than you do, and do esteem them above all other Outward Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
because of the great plenty and variety of sweet, sound, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Sayings, uttered by God in and through Christ Jesus, who
was filled with the Spirit without measure, <hi>and anointed with the
Oyl of Gladness above his Fellows,</hi> as its written of him; and
also uttered through <hi>Moses,</hi> and the rest of the holy Prophets &amp;
Apostles: but we cannot set them above the <hi>Spirit:</hi> We say,
they are a Testimony or Declaration of what the Primitive Saints
were made Living Witnesses of, by the working of the mighty
Power of <hi>God</hi> in them, whereby they came to put off the old Man
with his Deeds, and put no that New Man, <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> which is
after God created in Righteousness and true Holiness, in whom
ONLY was and is the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Saints:</hi> And without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
of more or less of this Spirit that wrought in them, that
gave forth the Scriptures, there is no saving Benefit nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to be had from them; for they, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scriptures do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the Witness of God, or Light within People; and they
are given forth to be read and believed, and only can be rightly
understood in a measure of the same Spirit that gave them forth;
and they testifie how, where and by what means people may
attain to that <hi>Infallible Spirit,</hi> that always was &amp; is the Saints chief
Rule, Guide &amp; Leader, who leads in the same Path they were
in, that gave them forth; and these only are the truly learned, that
can read them without wresting, and to such they are profitable
for Doctrine, for Reproof, &amp;c. but they were not given forth
[to be set above the Spirit of God] they were not given forth
to be wrested by Covetous, Carnal-minded men to uphold their
Carnal Sects, Opinions, Judgments and Religions, to War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the true Spiritual Worshippers, <hi>whom the Father seeks to
Worship him in the Spirit &amp; in the Truth.</hi> And inasmuch as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58439:6"/>
Wise God, Creator of all things, is to be honoured and
esteemed above any Visible created thing, so is his Holy Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirit to be honoured and esteemed above the Scriptures;
are not all holy Declarations made by the holy Spirit of
Truth? And who dare say, <hi>That the Maker is not Greater,
and more to be looked at and esteemed, than the Thing made?</hi> How
now Porfessors (that in your Natural Reasons set your selves as
Judges, both of Scriptures and the Spirit that gave them forth)
and in setting the Scriptures above the Spirit of God, your Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is largely Manifest: And may you not be justly compared to
those that built the Tombs of the Prophets, and garnished the
Sepulchers of the Righteous, and were the Children of them
that killed them? The Scripture saith, <hi>Believe not every Spirit,
but try the Spirits whether they be of God; because many false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are gone out into the World,</hi> 1 John 4. 1. I say, the <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Spirit of God</hi> must Try all Spirits, and without that none
can try them: Come Professors, what say you, have you that
<hi>Infallible Spirit</hi> to try the Fallible with? If you say, <hi>Nay, but
we have the Scriptures to try them by</hi> (I never yet heard any of you
say otherwise) I hope you will not deny, but that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>Infallible;</hi> and the Scriptures say, <hi>He that hath not
the Spirit of Christ is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. <hi>And he that's spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
judgeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 15. So you Fallible-spirited
Natural men, what have you to do with the Scriptures, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Unlearned men, who have not learned of Christ, you do
but Wrest them to your own Destruction, because you have no
true Judgment in your goings, and make to your selves crooked
Paths, <hi>Lo here, Lo there!</hi> and in your own private Spirits give
your corrupt Meanings to the Scriptures &amp; oppose the Spirit that
gave them forth. The Apostle saith, <hi>He that keepeth his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
dwelleth in him, and he in him:</hi> And hereby we know that he
dwelled in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 24.
The Lord God said by the true Prophet, concerning the false,
<hi>Wo unto the Foolish-Prophets, who follow their own Spirit, and
have seen nothing,</hi> Ezek. 13. 3. And these are the true Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of Christ come in the Flesh, [and in the <hi>Spirit</hi>] whatever
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58439:6"/>
Fallible-spirited men (that are rending and wresting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
may judge of them.</p>
            <p>And whereas some Envious Dark Spirits (seeing their glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Literal Knowledge so hard beset) may suggest,
<hi>That I Design to possess People against (or would beget them into a
Low esteem of) the Scriptures.</hi> God knoweth, if any such there
be, they greatly Wrong themselves and me, and all those who
believe their <hi>False Suggestions;</hi> for my only End is, That People
might be possessed with the <hi>Spirit of Truth, that leads into all
Truth,</hi> and teaches the true Knowledge of Scriptures, and to set
them in their places, and not to be <hi>ever Learning, and never able
to come to the Knowledge of the Truth;</hi> so that you all might come
to Christ, and learn of him, that you may have Life, is the Desire
of your Friend</p>

            <p>HAving considered that some Dark Spirits, like this Priest's
may take Occasion at my so much judging his Works to
be <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Darkness,</hi> without any plain Proof made thereof, to
Answer my present Business at this time, is not so much to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
my self with his Darkness (it is so palpably Gross, to all that
have the least spiritual discerning) as to shew the Confusion and
Darkness of such Professors that separate from such Priests,
as not owning them to be Ministers of Christ, and yet in Envy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and promote their Works in Opposition to the Truth of
God.</p>
            <p>Now since his works, <hi>viz.</hi> the Priest's, seems to be chiefly
about <hi>True</hi> and <hi>False Interpretations</hi> of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I may compare
them, and see which he most resembles: The <hi>True Interpreters</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:58439:7"/>
do it by the <hi>Spiritual Vnderstanding</hi> received by the <hi>Inspiration</hi>
of the <hi>Almighty:</hi> The <hi>False Interpreters</hi> do it by <hi>Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
or <hi>Earthly Wisdom</hi> of <hi>Fallen Degenerate Man.</hi> I may touch
at a Passage or two in his Book (passing by many such like) with
the ground of his Matter in General (with as much brevity as I
can, because I would not be tedious to the Reader) from which
I can prove his whole heap of Confusion and Darkness of One
Hundred Sixty and Six pages to be founded upon a Shadow, and
down must it tumble and vanish away like Smoak before the
Wind. So having perused His tedious Tautologies, or rather
bundle of Dark Impertenent Cavils against <hi>God's Truth</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi>
I find the Scope and Drift of his Matter is to make void or
cry down (as now ceased) <hi>Immediate Revelation, Inspiration,
Vision and the Truth in the Inward Parts,</hi> or the <hi>Spiritual In-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ in the Hearts and Souls of his People</hi> (there to
<hi>Work</hi> their <hi>Salvation</hi>) all which is still continued and truly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
by the true Spiritual Worshippers, without which,
we affirm, there is no true Interpretations of holy Scriptures.
Oh! all People, that have the least Spiritual Understanding,
behold the Darkness of such Priests and Professors, <hi>Where there
is no Revelation, there is no True Saving Knowledge of God;</hi> see
<hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But we have it by the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>I prove by the Scriptures that it must be</hi> Immediate
<hi>from the Son</hi> Christ Iesus, <hi>or you have no Life;</hi> Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for in them you think ye have Eternal Life; they testifie of
me, but ye will not come unto me that ye may have Life, Iohn 5. 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[See page 74, &amp; 75. of this Priest's Book]</hi> We <hi>(saith he)</hi>
like Honest Men, have no Vision, pretend none; if we were Knaves
we might pretend Inspiration as well as others.</p>
            <p>Ah! Poor Blind Guides indeed! then you Perish, and have
no heavenly Understanding; <hi>Where there is no Vision the People
Perish,</hi> Prov. 29. 18. <hi>There is a Spirit in man, and the Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Almighty giveth them Vnderstanding,</hi> Job 32. 8. <hi>When
it pleased God to reveal his Son in me, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 1. 15. <hi>I was not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58439:7"/>
Disobedient to the heavenly Vision,</hi> Acts 26. 19. <hi>I will come to
Visions and Revelations of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 1. And also,
<hi>Paul</hi> prayed, <hi>That the People might receive the Spirit of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Revelation:</hi> What was <hi>Paul</hi> a Knave for this? And
how often doth <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>be ye Followers of me, even as I also am
of Christ?</hi> And if we do so, and in our measures witness the
same Spirit of Wisdom, Revelation, Inspiration and Vision, must
we therefore be <hi>Knaves</hi> for that? Oh Darkness! who is so
Blind that they cannot see it! We say, All holy Scripture is given
by the <hi>Inspiration</hi> of God, and can never be rightly known nor
understood, but by the <hi>Inspiration</hi> of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> which gives
an Understanding to know them, without which they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be truly known nor interpreted. <hi>And in the Latter Dayes</hi>
(saith God) <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh; Sons and
Daughters shall</hi> Prophesie, <hi>Young Men shall see</hi> Visions, <hi>and Old
Men shall dream</hi> Dreams, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 17. Many more
Scriptures might have been instanced, as full and pertinent to
this purpose; but these are sufficient to Manifest the <hi>Ignorance,
Darkness</hi> and <hi>Blindness</hi> of such Priests and Professors: And
who have believed in Christ <hi>as a Light within them</hi> know him to
be the same to his People Yesterday, to Day, and forever. So
all Honour, Praises and Thanks forever be given to him who
hath hid these things from the <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Prudent</hi> of this World,
and revealed them to <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Sucklings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to Christ's Spiritual being within, it is before suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
proved; but I perceive such Priests, and Professors do only
or chiefly talk of Christ without them, which is Well-pleasing
to the Devil, that so he may do his Work within them without
Disturbance, while He that is stronger then he may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to cast him out and spoil his Works: and such Ministers
or Teachers, of what sort soever, are not of Christ, but of
Anti-christ, as well as the Pope.</p>
            <p>Now I charge all, or any one of the blind Guides, of all sorts in
the whole World (to whom the Spirit of true Wisdom, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
Inspiration and Vision is ceased) to give one plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that it ever was, is, or ever will be ceased to the People of
God (who did and do fear and obey him) while upon Earth. Why
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58439:8"/>
did the chief Priests and outward Professors of the Letter in days
past slight and set at nought Christ Jesus, in his outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to them? because he reproved their Self-Righteousness, and
said, <hi>he was the Son of God and Light of the World,</hi> and said,
<hi>his Kingdom was not of this World, neither was it to be found in
Observations,</hi> where they were seeking it, but it was to be found
within in the Spirit: so making clean the out-side of Cup and
Platter would not serve them then, neither will it now. And
why do the chief Priests and outward Professors of the Letter in
this day slight and reject him in his inward appearance, as Light
within in their Consciences? because he condemned their Self-Righteousness,
which they are also getting in the outward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
and many of them see that if they should hearken or
lend an Ear to him or his Light within, he would break their
false Peace, and bring Spiritual War, Division and a Sword with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to spoil and cut down their Self-Righteousness, as well as the
rest of their. Ungodliness, and that which would not that he
should Reign in his Kingdom within, to subject Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to himself, who will admit of no Righteousness but his
own, and therefore the Hypocrites and Formal Professors will
not abide him, but love the Darkness rather then Light, and in
their Darkness Judge his Light within to be a <hi>Spirit of
Delusion,</hi> and what not, as their fore-Fathers did of Old; yet
he that is the Searcher of Hearts and Tryer of Reins, hath not
left himself without a Witness in you, to which I now appeal,
what any of you from the highest to the lowest know more by
your long Professing of the true God (mark) <hi>whom to know is Life
Eternal,</hi> (John 17. 3) then you did at your first beginning to
profess him? O! Friends and People, that have any regard to
your Immortal Souls, this is of great weight for you all deeply
to ponder, and let Gods Witness speak in you, that will deal
plainly with you, and tell you the Truth.</p>
            <p>And since the Life of Man and Woman here is full of trouble,
short and uncertain, attended with Temptations, Oh! how doth
it concern all that truly desire a better and more durable inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to weigh &amp; consider that great and double caution of Christ
&amp; his Apostles, <hi>Take heed that no man deceive you;</hi> and let no man
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58439:8"/>
deceive himself, in which deceit all men are (how conceited
and confident soever they may be) till they come out of their vain
and dead Faiths into the living Faith in God &amp; Christ, which is to
believe in (as sufficient for the Salvation of man) his Spirit,
Grace, Talent, Light or Kingdom within, which is likeed to
a Grain of Mustard-seed; indeed too low and too small a thing
for the lofty Professors of this Generation to find or receive, as
was his outward appearance to your fore-Fathers, when he
was found in the Manger: I know your Inns are taken up with
other Guests, and there is yet no room for him; so full of vain
Imaginations and high Conceits are you, that you will not bow
down so low as to receive &amp; own him as a Reprover in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
for whoso do come to have their Understandings open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and to be enlightned with the Light of Life; so that they
come to see the blind Guides of all sorts, that are boasting in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens Lines, of things made ready to their Hands, and how
they strive to keep People from believing in this Heavenly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
within, lest they with their chargeable unprofitable
Preaching should be discovered, and their running unsent, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of themselves, seek their own Glory, the Praise of Men,
Self-Interest, their Gain from their Quarter, &amp;c. all which
with much more the Light within doth discover, judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
and that makes such Hireling Teachers of all sorts to
hate it, and prejudice their People against it. Oh! People of all
sorts beware of such Teachers, for they make a Prey upon you, &amp;
Deceive you; Therefore no longer spend your Money for that
which is not Bread, nor your Labour for that which satisfieth
not your hungry pined Souls, but come home to your Teacher
within, to the Law, Testimony, Commandment or Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you, which made <hi>David</hi> wiser then all his Teachers; and
so it will you, if you can receive it, believe in it, and follow
it.</p>
