            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THIS Narrative had never been expos'd to publick view, had not two notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> of Lies, more than once most falsly, and with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable impudence published two late accidents at <hi>Chichester</hi>; The one concerning the Bishops horse, or horses, as kill'd by the Dissenters there; and as to one of them, to try a strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of experiment with respect to <hi>Fire-balls.</hi> But whether one or both of them be so killed, it must be judg'd as a malicious Massacring (to use the <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators</hi> term) of the Bishop in <hi>Effigie.</hi> I must confess I never heard of a horse, or any brute creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be said to be Massacred; But I have heard and read of the <hi>Parisian</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Massacre; and it is neither improbable, nor incredible, that that <hi>strange</hi> and Monstrous Lier, who was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not long since to abscond when credible Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses were ready to prove before a Parliament, that he is a Papist, and imprest with deep and indelible <hi>Roman</hi> Sanguinary Characters, should use no other word than that, to express the killing of beasts by;
<pb facs="tcp:51459:3"/>
When men of that stamp, make no more conscience of Massacring Protestants, and those that profess the pure Reformed Christian Religion, than of killing of brute creatures; and so he thinks it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually applicable to both. And likely 'tis, he was, and continues to be so much a favourer of the Popish-Plot to Massacre Protestants, and that this hath been so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and for so long a time revolv'd in his thoughts, that no other word but this could occur to him, when most falsly he would declare to the World that they were kill'd by such a sort of people.</p>
            <p>As for the man that sent into the World, the <hi>Loyal Protestant, &amp;c.</hi> I shall say no more concerning him, but this; That if the Bishops horse had stood at the same time as a convicted forger of lies, in the Pillory, as he did, he would through shame (as a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous creature, having a deep resentment of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour), so pined away, and grown so meagre and lean in a little time, that no grease would have been found in his belly, if the <hi>Chichester</hi> Dissenters had ript it open. And it is no absurdity, according to the most deservedly stigmatized mans sense, to assert, that a beast might have undergone the Pillory-punishment with him as a legally convicted Criminal or Malefactor, seeing he makes so happy and witty (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of before) a conjunction and connection of the killing of the Bishops horse, with that of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures; as if horses were of the same Species, and capable of Government by the same Laws, that rational Beings in this World, are.</p>
            <p>Had we not read and heard of, and known many grand and shameless lyars besides these two, I should have concluded them to be the first begotten of him
<pb facs="tcp:51459:3"/>
who is a <hi>Lyar,</hi> as well as a <hi>Murderer</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>I will not now trouble my self, nor spend my time, to take all their audacious and false reports asunder, and make an Answer to every part thereof. But this I will offer to them, and to all the World, as a most fair and inexceptionable thing, That whereas these two <hi>bundles</hi> of <hi>Lies,</hi> brag and boast much of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick and credible Intelligence from <hi>Chichester,</hi> as the ground and Warrant of what they Print concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the killing of the Bishops Horse, or Horses, and the pretended bloody Murder of the Informer <hi>Habin</hi>; That if they will publish the Names of them that send it to them, I will produce, <hi>side digni,</hi> many more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who upon Oath either before the King and his Council, or in any Court of Judicature where His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty shall be pleased to appoint the Examination of this matter, shall make good and prove the verity of the ensuing Relation.</p>
            <p>The Reason why it way published no sooner, is, That I, to whom it was sent, judg'd it was most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to see how far these two Enemies to Truth would proceed in their lying Relations; that so a plenary and complete Answer thereto might be made at once, to undeceive and satisfie all sober and honest men, of what perswasion soever, in whom they have been so industrious to create a belief of the truth of that which is most false.</p>
            <p>I would have the Reader to observe some things remarkable concerning this <hi>Habin: First,</hi> That he was so profligate a wretch, and so prodigiously wicked, that he made no Conscience of committing the sin of Perjury: For he swore, That two or three
<pb facs="tcp:51459:4"/>
persons brake Captain <hi>Bicklies</hi> Windows in <hi>Chichester,</hi> that never were among the young men that brought the Pope before his door; by vertue whereof they were Convicted as Rioters, and brought into great trouble. And 'tis said, and (if I mistake not) can be proved, That he was the man that broke them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he, with his brother <hi>Hasted,</hi> swore, That a Minister Preached at <hi>Stockbridg,</hi> near <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> where the Dissenters meet every Lords-day; when I dare be bold to affirm, That they were never nearer to the place, than it is from the <hi>Exchange</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> to the <hi>Bridge</hi>: and so could not possibly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther see, or hear a Minister Preach: Upon which a Conviction was made. And this they continued to swear, in order to such Convictions for several Lords-days, till Divine Justice arrested and seised him in the very same day wherein for a long time he had acted so wickedly and villanously. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whereas <hi>N. T.</hi> stiles him a Gentleman; he was so far from that, that no man upon earth can be more infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and farther from one. I despise no man for his poverty; but when deep poverty, and high ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity meet in one man, it renders him most infamous and despicable. I know there are many true Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not only by their Birth (whom I always rank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the most inferior of that kind, when abstracted and separate from what follows) but by their Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Education, which doth truly enoble their minds, by the innate generosity of their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. But none of these can be predicated of this <hi>Subject,</hi> he being but the sink, the scum, and excres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene, or if I may so speak, the very Excrement of Humane Nature. By his Employment he was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:51459:4"/>
Bayliff, before he was an Informer; and so grand a Rogue in the management thereof, that none in the Country was thought to equalize him, but his brother (in all Villany and iniquity) <hi>Hasted</hi>: And had not Death prevented, he would e're long have been made so to appear to the World, he being put into the <hi>Crown-Office</hi> for many prodigious Enormities and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueries, and would certainly have been prosecuted for the above-mention'd Perjury, when a convenient time should have happen'd for it.</p>
            <p>I will not undertake to be a bold and infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Gods Providences (they being a Deep that the short line of Humane Reason cannot sound the bottom of, and fathom); yet as we are reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures, falling under the Conduct and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, so we are bound to observe them, and keeping within the bounds of modesty, endeavour to pick out the sense and meaning of them, and to know what they point at. And it is not unworthy of our observation, That as this Hellish Miscreant, and Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of all impiety, had perjur'd himself concerning the breaking of Captain <hi>Bickleys</hi> Glass-Windows, so his real breaking of the Windows of another person (that ne're injur'd or did him wrong), should prove the occasion of his Death, and that Death should hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him into Eternity, and to Judgment, on the Lords-day, which he so much prophan'd, and particularly, by being so much in the Ale-house, when he should have been in Gods-house; and disturbing those that would serve and worship God, while he did so much neglect the same. He was unexpectedly driven away that day, by Death, in his wickedness, and had no time given him to repent. Let <hi>Hasted,</hi> his brother, beware, left
<pb facs="tcp:51459:5"/>
Divine Vengeance do not speedily overtake him, and Death suddenly, as a grim and inexorable <hi>Serjeant,</hi> arrest him, and irresistibly drag his reluctating wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed guilty Soul before the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of Gods severest Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE unhappy Accident which lately fell out in this place, and the more unhappy improvement that we perceive some virulent Minds and Pens make thereof, puts us under a necessity thus to publish to the World the naked and impartial Truth of that whole matter.</p>
            <p>About Nine or Ten Weeks since, for the more effectual sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of the Conve<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ticles here, two persons were imployed as <hi>Informers,</hi> the one called <hi>Richard Habin,</hi> the other <hi>Henry Hasted.</hi> These persons posted themselves every Sunday upon a publick Road, which leads by the Door of one of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and took the Names of such as they thought fit that passed upon that Road, and that were either going to, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the place where the Conventicle was kept; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward did carry their Lists to some Justices, and make Oath,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51459:6"/>
That such persons were at the Conventicle; and Warrants is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued out, by Virtue of that Conviction, to the Constables, to levy the distress, which accordingly they have done on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But our business is not to accuse the Methods of their Proceedings, tho somewhat extraordinary, and what the Law it self doth not command. We only wish, That persons not so notoriously scandalous, and such as had been less subject to exceptions, had been imployed in this work.</p>
            <p>But to keep to our matter: This Trade they continued till Sunday the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> on which day <hi>Hasted</hi> wore a Sword, and drew it on some Boys as they were going on the Road, struck at them, and cut their Cloaths. But upon the Boys taking up stones, and threatning to stone him, if he sheathed not his Sword again, he did return his Sword into its Scabbard: At which <hi>Habin</hi> was so angry, that he would have had the Sword from <hi>Hasted,</hi> swearing he would hew the Boys in pieces with it: but <hi>Hasted</hi> would not let him have it, tho he, as well as <hi>Habin,</hi> were both most miserably drunk with <hi>Brandy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Boys seeing this savage and barbarous fierceness of <hi>Habin,</hi> threw some stones at him, and with one of them hit him, and break his head: Upon which, <hi>Habin</hi> entring in at the Gate of the City, next to which Mr. <hi>Farington</hi> dwelleth, upp'd with his stick, and cried out, <hi>Farington</hi> should pay for all; and with that saying, struck, and brake his Parlor Window, Mr. <hi>Farington</hi> and Three other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen being in the Room. But Mr. <hi>Farington</hi> knowing there were many that sought occasion to ensnare him, and believing this affront was done him on purpose to provoke him to repay it with some passionate Behaviour, would not so much as open his Window, or wag out of the Room.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Farington</hi>'s Coach-man being unhappily abroad in the street, and seeing this abuse to his Masters House, went to <hi>Habin,</hi> and asked what he mean'd by it? who answer'd him only by holding up, and shaking his Cudgel at the Coach-man. Whereupon the Coachman immediately clapp'd within <hi>Habin,</hi> struck up his heels, took away his stick, and with it hit him Four or Five blows over the Pate, and so left him. After which, <hi>Habin</hi> rose up, and went away to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51459:6"/>
               <hi>Mayor</hi>'s, and missing the <hi>Mayor,</hi> to another Justice, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and then to the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Palace; where, it is said, he mended his Draught; and after his Head was dressed, was carried by the Bishop's Servants, and laid in the Stable, where in two hours time he either died, or was so dead drunk, that he was taken for dead. However, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently laid on a Bier, carried up to the High Cross, and from thence to the <hi>Town-Hall</hi>; where a <hi>Coroner</hi>'s Inquest was immediately impannell'd, and found <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bin</hi> Murdered, and the Coach-man the Murtherer, before ever (as many do believe) <hi>Habin</hi> was quite dead.</p>
            <p>Nay, It is the universal opinion of this City, That if his Lordships Servants had not used this poor Wretch more like a Beast than a Man; but had, instead of lugging him into a cold Stable, laid him in a warm Bed, got him to be let Blood, and to have had other Remedies applied proper to his Condition, <hi>Habin</hi> might, for any Mortal hurt he had, have been alive at this day. But to expose him in this manner was enough to make him die, whether he would or no. And pray God all this hasty dispatch was not done with a design to do more mischief by his Death, than e're they could by his Life. For this is not the first Attempt that hath been made upon the Life and Fortune of Mr. <hi>Farington.</hi> But to return to our Relation: The Coach-man fled: And whether <hi>Habin</hi> was dead or no, we are sure he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
            <p>Thus matters continued till the end of the Week, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man was so convinc'd (from the multitude of Witnesses that saw the Fact), That instead of Murther, all men jugd'd the poor Coach-man would have <hi>Summum jus</hi> to be found guilty of Man-slaughter. For, for a Servant, upon so high a provocation as the breaking his Masters House, to run up to the doer of the Injury, and in a passion to snatch away his stick, and lay it Four or Five times over his Ears, and it happening so that Death doth follow; to find such a Servant guilty of so much as Man-slaughter, inclines cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly rather towards severity, than clemency. But to talk of Murder, is such Non-sense, as you may as well call at Blasphemy as Murder: for it hath no one ingredient of Murder in it. For Murder must have malice sore-thought:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51459:7"/>
Then a lying in wait, or seeking all occasions to execute the Malice: and then Weapons or Instruments fit to set home that Malice to the Death of him to whom 'tis born. Neither of which can so much as pretended<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y be fastened upon this poor unfortunate Coach-man. And yet in the Proof of this matter, you will see, that not the Coach-man only, but his <hi>Master</hi> too, was strongly endeavour'd to be brought in guilty of Murder.</p>
            <p>For on <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, the Recorder (who had been all this while absent from the City) returned; and then the Lord Bishop and he, caused <hi>Habin</hi>'s Grave to be opened, the Coroners Inquest to be new summoned to the Bishops Palace, and to be new sworn again, <hi>super visum Corporis,</hi> with a higher aim now, and not so much to make the Man as the Master the Murderer, for commanding his Man to do it. In order hereunto, one <hi>Cressingham</hi> was gotten to swear, That he saw Mr <hi>Faringt<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

But the <hi>Iury</hi> on inquiry could not find any body that saw <hi>Cressingham</hi> so much as in the street where the Fact was committed. Nor could <hi>Cressingham</hi> name any person that he saw there, tho the street was full of people, save only one, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so far from being in the street, that unluckily he did not so much as rise fro<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> her Confession as much as she could. And <hi>Cressingham</hi>'s Mothers House is at utterly out of sight of any thing done at Mr. <hi>Farington</hi>'s Door, as if it stood in <hi>Cheapside.</hi> Wherefore after they had lock'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51459:7"/>
up the Inquest in the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Palace from Eleven of the Clock till Four, and none permitted to go to them but whom the Bishop pleased; nay some of the <hi>Iury</hi> threatned by the Bishop, that if they did not find <hi>Farington</hi> Guilty, he would have them before the King and Council: Yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Inquest</hi> were of opinion to acquit Mr. <hi>Farington,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Cressingham</hi>'s Testimony was supported by some other. The Cause being thus just ready to fall, they desired the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to Adjourn till Eight of the Clock on Monday, which accordingly they did, and by that time further Evidence should be gotten.</p>
            <p>To have Evidence to get on <hi>Saturday</hi> night, that must be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, one would think requires great dexterity to gain them; and yet that Night a little Prentice-Boy, of about 13 or 14 years old, was haled away from his Masters House by two <hi>Publicans</hi> before the <hi>Mayor</hi> and the <hi>City-Iustices,</hi> where we will not say by what Arts he was made, and made to Swear that he saw both Mr. <hi>Farington</hi> and <hi>Cressingham</hi> too, when <hi>Habin</hi> was Beat. But of this we are sure, that when the Boy was called before the Inquest, he better remembred himself, and did upon his Oath deny that he saw Mr. <hi>Faring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> there, or <hi>Cressingham</hi> either; and yet afterwards the Boy was prevailed upon to unswear that; and to swear that he saw <hi>Cressingham</hi> there, but not Mr. <hi>Farington</hi>: Some honest-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded people bid the Lad as he went by them, to consider what he Swore, and to be sure to Swear the truth; which made his Mother run up and down like one mad, raving and crying, <hi>My Son shall Swear for the Lord Bishop, My Son shall Swear for the Lord Bishop; I would not for</hi> ten pound <hi>but he should Swear for my Lord bishop: For I have the most part of my Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood from my Lord.</hi> Which furious passion in the Woman made People stare and wonder at her, and the Bishop both; and raised more doubts in mens minds, than it is convenient to mention. For if <hi>English</hi> Ears hear any Body to Swear upon such occasions for any others but for the King and Truth, they straight grow jealous, and fear foul play.</p>
            <p>The Inquest being greatly dissatisfied in their Judgments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Evidence that <hi>Cressingham</hi> and the Boy had given, as disagreeing with each other, and neither of them well agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with themselves; and having a Cloud of other Credible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51459:8"/>
and Unsuspected Witnesses, that saw all the Action from first to last, whose Testimony seemed more Concurrent and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Reasons. The Jury like discreet Men, and such as were willing to search every thing to find out the Truth, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved they would go and view the place themselves where this accident happened; which accordingly they did, and found that in the place where <hi>Cressingham</hi> Swore he stood when he saw Mr. <hi>Farington</hi> look out at the Window, and commanded his men to bear <hi>Habin,</hi> it was utterly impossible for <hi>Cressing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> or any Man else to see Mr. <hi>Farington</hi> (or any other) look out at the Window. So that returning to the Town-hall, (where the Jury that day sate) fully satisfied, they would not hear any more Witnesses (though a great many more were present, and offered themselves to Swear), but immediately gave in their Verdict, wherein every man did acquit Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington.</hi> It appearing to them by the Oaths of Persons (against whom there was no exception) that Mr. <hi>Farington</hi> was so far from commanding his man to beat <hi>Habin,</hi> that he was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly angry with his man for doing of i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Thus ended this matter.</p>
            <p>The next day this young Apprentice was taken from his Master, by the Bishop, into his House; Whether for fear the Boy should blab the Threats and Arts that have been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised on him, to draw him to do what he did; or to be better instructed in the new and modish science now in fashion, they best know that did it; tho the Boys Mother doth give out already, that her Son shall yet Swear for my Lord Bishop against Mr. <hi>Farington</hi> for all this: We only can say, that this we are sure of from several honest Persons, that the Child did nothing but Cry, and say he was threatned to Swear what he did, till Mr. <hi>Farington</hi> was acquitted; and that then he did nothing but leap and express an high passion of joy for it; and if upon his coming under his Lordships Roof, the Boy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed another nature, 'tis only a proof, that miracles are not ceased.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cressingham</hi> the Witness was formerly a Chorister; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not honesty enough to continue in the Office (which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally doth not require over-much) he was expell'd the Quire, and is now so indigent and Infamous, that his Credit will not pass for <hi>Twelve pence</hi>; whether he be to be restored on this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51459:8"/>
or that he is to succeed <hi>Habin</hi> in the Office of an Informer; Or that some other way is to be found out to reward his merit in this matter, time must shew.</p>
            <p>In the mean while all Wise and Sober Men wonder exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, that my Lord Bishop would meddle (with such eager and vehement concern) in a Sanguinary Case, from which by Law that great Dignity is Exempted; and do think that his Lordship had better consulted the honour of the Church, and his own Reputation also, if he had shewed himself more cool and temperate in this matter. For though my Lord hath a very great kindness for Sir <hi>Iohn Farington</hi> (Mr. <hi>Farington</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) yet to shew it so mightily upon such odd occasions, hath done no great Service to his Lordship, nor Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> neither. For people do publickly say, That <hi>sub dio,</hi> or, in the Church Porch whitherto all persons might freely resort, had been a much more proper place for a Coroners Inquest to have sate, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Lock and Key in a Bishops Palace; especially too in such a Palace where the Bishop and his Predecessors have denied themselves to be within the Liberty of the City, and refused to pay their Poors Tax; whereupon many Suits and Differences have arose.</p>
            <p>Wherefore upon the whole, we judg all men will see at little reason to lay this Accident on Mr. <hi>Farington,</hi> as some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen had to lay the wounding of his Lordships Coach horses, on our Dissenters. For the Horses were at Grass seven Miles distant from this City, and in all probability were Goared by some of the fatting Cattel among which they fed. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that it is contrary to the common Charity which Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity obligeth us to have for all men, to believe so ill of any without some proof: So is it also manifestly opposite to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to credit, that if any mans Rage and Malice should have carried him so many Miles to have mischiefed his Lordships Horses, that he would not have done it throughly, and kill'd them on the spot, rather than to have given them such slight wounds as every silly Smith could Cure; for be it known to the World, his Lordships Horses are alive again, and as well as ever, and the Persons that wrought their Cure would think themselves jeered to be called by so much as the Name of <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51459:9"/>'Tis true, there was an Oath about to have been made by a Right <hi>Irish</hi> Evidence, That one Mr. <hi>Nevill</hi> had wounded his Lordships Horses. But just then hearing that the Gentleman was above Fifty Miles distant from the place, he held his blow, and we have unluckily miss'd that able Testimony; yet we are so far from having that uncharitable thought, that this person had any particular Malice in his Oath against Mr. <hi>Nevill,</hi> that we do believe in our Consciences that for a <hi>Guinney</hi> more he would have Swore the <hi>Morocco Embassador</hi> had done it; and we do also believe that if he had Sworn so, he had said as much Truth, as any of those Gentlemen that have published that matter. And so much for the Horses.</p>
            <p>But lest any should think that we speak this in favour of <hi>Dissenters,</hi> we must crave leave to say, That we are, and are known to be for the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and could heartily wish that Dissenters would leave off Conventicling, and come to Church; as on the other hand we could also wish that there were less bitterness in our Pulpits to invite them thither; and that our little dapper <hi>Clergy-Wights</hi> would not keep such a Whigling, nor give them so just occasion from their ill prating and worse living, to keep from thence: For this we may say for our Dissenters, That abate their fault of not coming to Church, they are dutiful and peaceable to the Government, and friendly and neighbourly to their fellow Subjects; and in the general conduct of their Conversation, of very good Morals.</p>
            <p>This is the true and candid Account of this Matter; to all which if you add the Bishops displeasure against Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington</hi> for Managing the Suits of his Parish against him, and the Recorders rage for his being chosen a Parliament-man for this City, and the mighty dearness that is beween both them and Sir <hi>Iohn Farington,</hi> and you will be so far from wondering that so industrious a Venom was laid out against him, that you will rather admire that any Innocency could preserve him. But God be thanked, to the great joy of this City, we can apply the Words of the Royal Prophet, <hi>The Snare is broken, and he is delivered.</hi>
