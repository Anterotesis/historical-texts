            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe Petitions which have bin now read, they are all Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of the generall and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers that are now in the State and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church and Common-wealth, and they are not them alone: But his Majeſties gratious Expreſſions the firſt day
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157480:3"/>
of Parliament, that calls me up to ſpeake at this preſent, contrary to my owne Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, his Majeſty, who is the head of the body politique, and the Father of the Common-wealth, hath complained firſt, declaring his ſenſibleneſſe of our ſufferings, and amongſt other things, hath put us in mind of our grievances, and hath freely left it to our ſelves (for our redreſſe and repaire therein) to begin and end, as we ſhall thinke fit. And this drawes me on with much cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and zeale to contribute my poore indeavours to ſo great a worke.</p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I conceive it will not be altogether impertinent for your direction and guidance in that great place, which by the favour of his Majeſty, and this Houſe you now poſſeſſe, a little to recollect our ſelves in the remembrance of what was done the laſt Parliament, and where we ended.</p>
            <p>It will likewiſe be very conſiderable what hath bin done ſince that Parliament, and who they are that have bin the Authors and Cauſers of all our miſeries and diſtractions, both before and ſithence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:157480:3"/>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the laſt Parliament, as ſoone as the Houſe was ſetled, a Subſidiary aid and ſupply was propounded, and many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed to give the precedencie before all other matters and Conſiderations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, a multitude of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Grievances of all ſorts; aſwell concerning our Eternall as our Temporall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates were preſented and put in the other ballance: The wiſedome of that great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell waighing both indifferently, and looking not onely upon the dangers then threatned from SCOTLAND (which are now upon us) but likewiſe taking into their conſideration the Condition and Conſtitution of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government here at home, concluded that they were in no capacity to give, unleſſe their grievances were firſt redreſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> it then was, and ſtill is, moſt manifeſt and apparent, that by ſome judgements lately obtained in Court of Juſtice, and by ſome new wayes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment lately ſtarted up amongſt us; the Law of property is ſo much ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that no man can ſay he is maſter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:157480:4"/>
of any thing: But all that we have, we hold as Tenants by courteſie, and at will, and may be ſtripped of it at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Yet Mr. Speaker, deſirous to give his Majeſty all poſſible ſatisfaction and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, aſwell in the manner of ſupply for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, as in the ſubſtance and matter of it, we confined and limitted our ſelves but to three particulars onely, and to ſuch matters as properly and naturally ſhould have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and relation to thoſe 3. heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The firſt was the priviledges of Parliament.</item>
               <item>2. The ſecond mattees of Religion.</item>
               <item>3. The third, the propriety of our goods and Eſtates.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And we began with the firſt, as the great Arke, in which the other two, Religion and property are included and preſerved.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the violations complained of the laſt Parliament, touching our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, were of two ſorts; either ſuch as had bin done out of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Concerning the violations of the firſt ſort, it was reſolved by vote, that the <hi>Speaker</hi> refuſing to put a queſtion, being thereunto required by the Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:157480:4"/>Or to adjourne the houſe upon any command whatſoever, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and approbation of the Houſe it ſelfe; were breaches and violations that highly impeached our priviledges.</p>
            <p>And having paſſed the vote, J conceive it were fit we ſhould now proceed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further, and conſider of a way how to be repaired againſt them that have beene the violators: For Execution does <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare Legem.</hi> The putting of an old Law in Execution, you know Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> does oftentimes doe more good then the making of a new one.</p>
            <p>As concerning the violations of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort, done out of Parliament in Courts of Juſtice, and at the Counſell board, where neither our perſons nor our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ought to have bin controlled or medled withall; And as concerning matters of Religion, and the property of our goods and eſtates, there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things then likewiſe agreed upon by vote, whereupon a conference was deſired to have beene had with the Lords:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:157480:5"/>
But what interjections and rubs we met withall by the way, and how the Lords counter voted the precedency of our grievances. And how our Speaker was taken away from amongſt vs, and what an vnhappy concluſion we had at the laſt. The remembrance of it were a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject too ſad to begin another Parliament withall.</p>
            <p>Therefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Speaker, I ſhall paſſe from what was done the laſt Parliament and come to what hath beene done ſince that Parliament ended.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Speaker, there are ſome worthy Gentlemen now of this houſe that were members of the laſt Parliament, that carried themſelves in the matters and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes then and there agitated and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with great Wiſedome and vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled moderation. But what had they at laſt for all their paines in attending the publique ſtrince of the Common-wealth, As ſoone as ever the Parliament was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, their ſtudies and pockets were ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as if they had beene Fellones and Traytors, and they committed to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:157480:5"/>
Goales with an intention J am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of their vtter ruine and deſtruction, had they not fore-ſeene a danger approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; For Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> if J be truely informed an information was drawne, or at leaſt, directions given for the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, againſt them in the Starre-Chamber.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, there hath beene ſince the laſt Parliament a Synod, and in that Synod a new Oath hath beene made and framed, and enjoyned to be taken.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> they might as well have made a new Law, and enjoyned the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that, as enjoyned and vrged the taking of the other, not being eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament and in point of miſchiefe, the ſafety of the Common-wealth, and the freedome and liberties of the Subject are more concerned in the doing of the one then if they had done the other.</p>
            <p>The next exception J ſhall take to it, is to the matter contained in the oath it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:157480:6"/>Mr. Speaker, they would have us at the very firſt daſh ſweare in a damnable Hereſie, that matters neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are contained in the Diſcipline of our Church.</p>
            <p>Whereas Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> it hath ever bin the tenet of our Church, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are comprehended and contained in the Doctrine of our Church onely; And that hath alwaies been vſed as an Argument vntill this very preſent, againſt <hi>Antidiſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians,</hi> to ſtop their mouthes withall; And therefore that for that reaſon they might with the leſſe regret and offence conforme and ſubmit themſelves to the Diſcipline of our Church.</p>
            <p>And Mr. Speaker, for prevention in caſe the Wiſedome of the ſtate in this great Counſell, ſhould at any time think fit to alter any thing in the government of our Church, they would anticipate and foreſtall our judgements, by making vs ſweare before-hand, that we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give our conſent to any alteration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:157480:6"/>Nay Mr. Speaker, they goe a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for they would have vs ſweare that the government of the Church by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Biſhops, Deanes, Archdeacons, &amp;c. is <hi>Iure divino,</hi> Their words are, <hi>as of right it ought to ſtand</hi>; Whereas Mr. Speaker, we meet not with the name of an Archbiſhop, or a Deane, or an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon in all the new Teſtament; And whatſoever may be ſaid of the Function of Biſhops it is one thing: But for their Juriſdiction it is meerely <hi>Humana inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutione,</hi> and they muſt thanke the King for it.</p>
            <p>As for their groſſe, abſurd, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they would have men ſweare they know neither what, nor how many fathome deepe: There is neither Divinity nor charity in it, and yet they would put that upon vs.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, what they meant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by this new Oath, and their booke of Canons, and their booke of Articles, which they would have our Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens ſworne unto, to enquire of, and to preſent thereupon, J muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I know not, unleſſe they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:157480:7"/>
had a purpoſe therein to blow up the Proteſtant Religion and all the faithfull profeſſors of it, and to advance their Hierarchie a ſtep higher which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe wee all feare is high enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, they have likewiſe in this Synod granted a benevolence, but the nature of the things agrees not with the name, for in plaine Engliſh it is ſixe Subſidies to be paid by the Clergie in ſixe yeares: And the penalty they have impoſed upon the refuſers, for non pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to be deprived of their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be ſtripped of their free-hold, and to be excommunicated, and this Act of their Synod is not publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their Canons, for which they might have ſome colourable ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming authority: But it comes out, in a Booke alone by it ſelfe in the Latine tongue, ſuppoſing as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Lay-men are as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as they would have them; And thus they thinke they dance in a Net</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:157480:7"/>And as in this, ſo in moſt of their new Canons if they be throughly conſidered, any Judicious man may eaſily diſcerne and perceive, that they doe therein like <hi>Water-men</hi> that looke one way and rowe another, they pretend one thing but intend nothing leſſe; And certainly Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> in this they have flowne a high pitch; For a Synod cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together upon pretence of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſetling Controverſies and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Religion to take upon them the boldneſſe thus out of Parliament to grant Subſidies and to meddle with mens freeholds, I dare ſay the like was never heard of before, and they that durſt doe this will doe worſe if the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of their raging Tyranny be not ſtopped in time.</p>
            <p>Who are they (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) that have countenanced and cheriſhed Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Arminianiſme to that growth and heigth it is now come to, in this Kingdome?</p>
            <p>Who are they (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) that have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:157480:8"/>
given incouragement to thoſe that have boldly preached thoſe damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in our Pulpits.</p>
            <p>Who are they (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) that have given authority and licence to them that have publiſhed thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies in print?</p>
            <p>Who are they (Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) that of late dayes have beene advanced to any dignity or preferment in the Church, but ſuch as have beene noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſuſpitious, in their Diſciplines, corrupt in their Doctrines, and for the moſt part, vitious in their lives?</p>
            <p>And who are they (Mr. Speaker) that have overthrowne our two great Charters <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta de Forreſta?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What impoſition hath bin laid down or what Monopolie hath bin damned in any Court of Juſtice ſince the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:157480:8"/>Hath not ſhip-money, Coale and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct money, and money for other milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry charges, bin collected and leavied, with as great violence as ever they were, in violation of our liberties, confirmed unto us in our Petition of Right; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all our ſupplications and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints the laſt Parliament.</p>
            <p>And who are they Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that have cauſed all thoſe dangerous Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and all the deſperate unnaturall bloudy diſtempers, that are now in our body politique?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> J will tell you a paſſage: J heard from a Judge in the Kings-Bench. There was a poore man committed by the Lords, for refuſing to ſubmit unto a project, and having attended a long time at the Kings-Bench barre, upon his <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus</hi>; and at laſt preſſing very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to be bailed. The Judge ſaid to the reſt of his brethren, come Brothers (ſaid he) let us baile him, for they begin to ſay in the Towne, that the Judges have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne the Law, and the Biſhops the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:157480:9"/>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I would not be miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in what J have ſaid; for rhere are ſome of both, functions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, that J highly honour &amp; reverence in my heart, for their wiſedomes and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grities. But Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> J may ſay it; for I am ſure we have all felt it, that there are ſome of both functions and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that have bin the Authors and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of all the Miſeries, Ruines, and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that are now upon us.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> This is the Age; This is the Age (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) that hath produced and brought forth <hi>Achitophells, Hammans Woolſies, Empſons, and Dudlies, Tricilians, and Belknapps</hi> Vipers and Monſters of all ſorts. And J doubt not, but when his Majeſty ſhall be truely informed of ſuch matters, as wee are able to charge them withall; we ſhall have the ſame Juſtice againſt theſe, which heretofore hath been againſt their Predeceſſours, in whoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſteps they have trodden.</p>
            <p>And therefore Mr. Speaker, to put our ſelves into a way for our redreſſe and reliefe, J conceive it were fit that a Committee might be named to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:157480:9"/>
take theſe Petitions, that have now beene read, and all others of the like nature into their conſiderations, to the end, that the parties grieved, may have juſt repaire for their grievances; and that out of them, Lawes may be contrived, and framed for the preventing of the like miſchiefes, for the future.</p>
