            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Lord, I confeſs my Caſe is different; for <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Father of the Faithful; but I am not worthy to be reckoned among his Children: He had the Honour to be called thy Friend; but my Sins have been ſuch, that (unleſs thy Mercy interveen) may make thee look upon me as thine Enemy. He prayed unto thee for a People, of whoſe Sins he was no Partaker; But my Addreſs is to thee, for them, in whoſe Iniquities I am involved, and have ſome way or other deeply contributed to the haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and bringing down thoſe terrible Judgments of thine, which now lye ſo heavy upon us: So that alas! I am unworthy to appear before thee, for my ſelf; and how ſhall I dare to ſupplicate thee for others.</p>

               <q>O Lord, behold our Afflictions: For the Enemy hath magnified himſelf.</q>

<q>O Lord, behold our Afflictions; for the Enemy hath magnified himſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thou art become our Enemy, thou haſt deſtroyed our ſtrong Holds, thou haſt encreaſed among us Mourning and Lamentation, becauſe thou haſt deſpiſed in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of thine Anger, the King and the Prieſt.</p>
               <q>See, O Lord, and conſider; for we are become very vile.</q>
               <p>The Yoak of our Tranſgreſſions is bound by thy hand, they are wreathed and come upon our Necks; thou haſt made our Strength to fail, thou haſt delivered us into their Hands, from whom we are not able to riſe up: Thou haſt trodden under Foot our mighty Men, in the midſt of us: Thou haſt called an Aſſembly to cruſh our young Men: Thou haſt trodden us as in a Wine-preſs: Our Enemies hear of our Trouble, and they are glad that thou haſt done it.</p>
               <p>Behold, O Lord, for we are in Diſtreſs! Our Bowels are troubled, our Heart is turned within us; for we have grivouſly rebelled; abroad the Sword devoureth, at home there is Death; our Enemies have opened their Mouths againſt us, they hiſs and gnaſh their Teeth; they ſay we have ſwallowed them up; certainly, this is the Day that we looked for, we have found it, we have ſeen it. Thus are we in Deriſion all the Day long, we are become their Song, and their Muſick:
<q>O Lord, behold our Afflictions; for the Enemy hath magnified himſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They have cried unto us, depart ye, ye are unclean; depart, depart, touch not; yea, theſe Men have ſaid, they ſhall no more ſojourn here:
<q>O Lord, behold our Afflictions; for the Enemy hath magnified himſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Breath of our Noſtrils, the Anointed of the Lord is fallen into their Pits, and ſlaughtered by their Hands;

               <p>Thus do we call to mind our Afflictions, and our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; the Wormwood and the Gall, our Souls have them in Remembrance, and they are humbled in us; and therefore have we hope, it is of the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed; becauſe his Compaſſions fails not: They are new every Morning; great is his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; for the Lord will not caſt us off for ever, but tho' he cauſe Grief, yet will he have Compaſſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Multitude of his Mercies; for he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men:

                  <p n="3">3. And Abſalom ſaid unto him, See, thy matters <hi>are</hi> good and right, but <hi>there is</hi> no Man <hi>deputed</hi> of the King to hear thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Abſalom ſaid moreover, oh that I were made Judge in the Land, that every Man which hath any Suit or Cauſe might come unto me, and I would do him Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And it was ſo, that when any Man came nigh to him, to do him obeyſance, he put forth his Hand, and took him and kiſſed him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And on this manner did Abſalom to all Iſrael that came to the King for Judgment: So Abſalom ſtole the Hearts of the Men of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And it came to paſs after forty years, that Abſalom ſaid to the King, I pray thee, let me go pay my Vow, which I have vowed unto the Lord in Hebron.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:45555:19"/>8. For thy Servant vowed a Vow while I abode in Geſhur in Syria, ſaying, if the Lord ſhall bring me again indeed to Jeruſalem, then I will ſerve the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And the King ſaid unto him, Go in Peace. So he aroſe and went to Hebron.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But Abſalom ſent Spies throughout all the Tribes of Iſrael, ſaying, as ſoon as ye hear the Sound of the Trumpet, then ye ſhall ſay, Abſalom reigneth in Hebron.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And with Abſalom went two hundred Men out of Jeruſalem, <hi>that were</hi> called, and they went in their Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and they knew not any thing.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And Abſalom ſent for Ahitophel the Gilonite, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Counſellor, from his City, <hi>even</hi> from Giloh, while he offered Sacrifices: And the Conſpiracy was ſtrong; for the People increaſed continually with Abſalom.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And there came a Meſſenger to David, ſaying, the Hearts of the Men of Iſrael are after Abſalom.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And David ſaid unto all his Servants that <hi>were</hi> with him at Jeruſalem, ariſe, and let us flee; for we ſhall not <hi>elſe</hi> eſcape from Abſalom: Make ſpeed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, leſt he overtake us ſuddenly, and bring evil upon us, and ſmite the City with the edge of the Sword.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And the Kings Servants ſaid unto the King, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy Servants <hi>are ready to do</hi> whatſoever my Lord the King ſhall appoint.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And the King went forth, and all his Houſhold after him, and the King left Ten Women, <hi>which were</hi> Concubines, to keep the Houſe.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And the King went forth, and all the People after him, and tarried in a Place that was far off.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And all his Servants paſſed on beſide him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, Six Hundred Men which came after him from Gath, paſſed on before the King.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Then ſaid the King to Ittai the Gittite, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goeſt thou alſo with us? Return to thy Place, and abide with the King: For thou <hi>art</hi> a Stranger, and alſo an Exile.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Whereas thou cameſt <hi>but</hi> yeſterday, ſhould I this Day make thee go up and down with us; ſeeing I go whether I may, return thou, and take back thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Mercy and Truth be with thee.</p>
                  <p n="21">
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:45555:20"/>21. And Ittai anſwered the King, and ſaid, <hi>as</hi> the Lord liveth, and <hi>as</hi> my Lord the King liveth, ſurely in what Place my Lord the King ſhall be, whether in Death or Life, even there alſo will thy Servant be.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And David ſaid to Ittai go and paſs over. And Ittai the Gittite paſſed over, and all his Men, and all the little ones that were with him.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And all the Country wept with a loud Voice, and all the People paſſed over: The King alſo himſelf paſſed over the Brook Kidion, and all the People paſſed over, towards the way of the Wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And lo, Zadok alſo, and all the Levites <hi>were</hi> with him, bearing the Ark of the Covenant of God, and they ſet down the Ark of God; and Abiathar went up until all the People had done paſſing out of the City.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And the King ſaid unto Zadok, carry back the Ark of God into the City: If I ſhall find favour in the Eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ſhew me <hi>both</hi> it, and his Habitation.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. But if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <hi>here am I,</hi> let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. The King ſaid alſo unto Zadok the Prieſt, <hi>Art not</hi> thou a Seer? Return into the City in Peace, and your Two Sons with you, Ahimaaz thy Son and Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than the Son of Abiathar.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. See, I will tarry in the Plain of the Wilderneſs, until there come Word from you to certify me.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the Ark of God again to Jeruſalem; and they tarried there.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And David went up by the Aſcent of <hi>Mount</hi> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his Head co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and he went bare-foot: And all the People that <hi>was</hi> with him, covered every Man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And <hi>one</hi> told David, ſaying, Ahitophel <hi>is</hi> among the Conſpirators with Abſalom. And David ſaid, O Lord, I pray thee, turn the Counſel of Ahitophel into Fooliſhneſs.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. And it came to paſs, that <hi>when</hi> David was come to the top of <hi>the mount,</hi> where he worſhipped God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Huſhai the Archite came to meet him, with his Coat rent, and Earth upon his Head.</p>

                  <p n="34">34. But if thou return to the City, and ſay unto Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom, I will be thy Servant, O King; <hi>as I have been</hi> thy Fathers Servant hitherto, ſo <hi>will</hi> I now alſo <hi>be</hi> thy Servant: Then mayeſt thou for me defeat the Counſel of Ahitophel.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. And <hi>haſt thou</hi> not there with thee Zadok and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athar the Prieſts? Therefore it ſhall be that what thing ſoever thou ſhalt hear out of the Kings Houſe, thou ſhalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the Prieſts.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>NOW in the Eighteenth Year of King Jeroboam, began Abijah to reign over Judah.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He reigned Three Years in Jeruſalem (his Mothers Name was Michaiah the Daughter of Uriel, of Gibea:) and there was War between Abijah and Jeroboam.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And Abijah ſet the Battel in array with an Army of valiant Men of War, even four hundred thouſand choſen Men: Jeroboam alſo ſet the Battel in array a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and with eight hundred thouſand choſen Men, being mighty Men of Valour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And Abijah ſtood up upon Zemaraim, which <hi>is</hi> in Mount Ephraim, and ſaid, hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Iſrael:</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Ought ye not to know, that the Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael gave the Kingdom over Iſrael to David for ever, even to him and to his Sons by a Covenant of Salt?</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:45555:21"/>6. Yet Jeroboam the Son of Nebat, the Servant of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon the Son of David is riſen up, and hath rebelled againſt his Lord.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And there are gathered unto him vain Men, the Children of Belial, and have ſtrengthned themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Rehoboam the Son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withſtand them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And now ye think to withſtand the Kingdom of the Lord in the Hand of the Sons of David, and ye be a great Multitude, and there are with you golden Calves, which Jeroboam made you for Gods.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Have ye not caſt out the Prieſts of the Lord, the Sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you Prieſts after the manner of the Nations of other Lands? So that whoſoever cometh to conſecrate himſelf with a young Bullock, and ſeven Rams, the ſame may be a Prieſt of them that are no Gods.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forſaken him, and the Prieſts which miniſter unto the Lord, are the Sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And they burn unto the Lord every Morning, and every Evening, burnt Sacrifices, and ſweet Incenſe: the Shew-bread alſo ſet they in order upon the pure Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the Candleſtick of gold with the Lamps there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to burn every Evening; for we keep the charge of the Lord our God, but ye have forſaken him.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And behold, God himſelf is with us for our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and his Prieſts with ſounding Trumpets to cry alarm againſt you: O Children of Iſrael, fight ye not againſt the Lord God of your Fathers, for you ſhall not proſper.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But Jeroboam cauſed an Ambuſhment to come about behind them, ſo they were before Judah, and the Ambuſhment was behind them.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And when Judah looked back, behold the Battel was before and behind; and they cryed unto the Lord, and the Prieſts ſounded with the Trumpets.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Then the Men of Judah gave a ſhout; and as the Men of Judah ſhouted, it came to paſs that God ſmote Jeroboam and all Iſrael, before Abijah and Judah.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And the Children of Iſrael fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their Hands.</p>
                  <p n="17">
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:45555:21"/>17. And Abijah and his People ſlew them with a great ſlaughter; ſo there fell down ſlain of Iſrael Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand choſen Men.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Thus the Children of Iſrael were brought under at that time, and the Children of Judah prevailed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they relied upon the Lord God of their Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And Abijah purſued after Jeroboam, and took Cities from him, Bethel with the Towns thereof, and Jeſhanah with the Towns thereof, and Ephraim with the Towns thereof.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Neither did Jeroboam recover ſtrength again in the Days of Abijah; and the Lord ſtruck him and he died.</p>

                  <head>The Second Leſſon proper for this Occaſion is, XXIV. Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>1.</hi> Chriſt foretelleth the Deſtruction of the Temple: What and how great Calamities ſhall be before it. <hi>29.</hi> The Signs of his coming to Judgment. <hi>36.</hi> And becauſe that Day and Hour is unknown. <hi>42.</hi> We ought to watch like good Servants, expecting every moment our Maſters coming.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AND Jeſus went out, and departed from the Temple, and his Diſciples came to <hi>him</hi> for to ſhew him the Buildings of the Temple.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, ſee ye not all theſe Things? verily I ſay unto you, there ſhall not be left here one Stone upon another, that ſhall not be thrown down.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And as he ſate upon the Mount of Olives, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples came unto him privately, ſaying, tell us when ſhall theſe Things be? and what <hi>ſhall be</hi> the Sign of thy coming, and of the end of the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, take heed that no Man deceive you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For many ſhall come in my Name, ſaying, I am Chriſt; and ſhall deceive many.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And ye ſhall hear of Wars, and rumours of Wars: See that ye be not troubled: For all <hi>theſe things</hi> muſt come to paſs, but the End is not yet.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For Nation ſhall riſe againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom, and there ſhall be Famines, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, and Earthquakes in divers Places.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. All theſe are the beginning of Sorrows.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Then ſhall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and ſhall kill you: And ye ſhall be hated of all Nations for my Names ſake.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And then ſhall many be offended, and betray one another, and ſhall hate one another.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And many falſe Prophets ſhall riſe, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And becauſe Iniquity ſhall abound, the Love of many ſhall wax cold.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But he that ſhall endure unto the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45555:24"/>14. And this Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be preached in all the World, for a Witneſs unto all Nations, and then ſhall the end come.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. When ye therefore ſhall ſee the Abomination of Deſolation, ſpoken of by Daniel the Prophet, ſtand in the holy Place, (whoſo readeth, let him underſtand)</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Then let them which be in Judea, flee into the Mountains.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Let him, which is on the Houſe top, not come down, to take any thing out of his Houſe.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Neither let him, which is in the Field, return back to take his Cloths.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And wo unto them that are with Child, and to them that give ſuck in thoſe Days.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. But pray ye that your Flight be not in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, neither on the Sabbath Day.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For then ſhall be great Tribulation, ſuch as was not ſince the beginning of the World to this time, no, nor ever ſhall be.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And except thoſe Days ſhould be ſhortned, there ſhould no Fleſh be ſaved: But for elects ſake thoſe Days ſhall be ſhortned.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Then if any Man ſhall ſay unto you, lo, here is Chriſt, or there; believe it not.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſhall ſhew great Signs and Wonders, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very elect.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Behold, I have told you before.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Wherefore if they ſhall ſay unto you, Behold, he is in the Deſert, go not forth: Behold, <hi>he is</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Chambers, believe it not.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. For as the Lightning cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the Weſt: So ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of Man be.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. For whereſoever the Carcaſe is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Immediately after the Tribulation of thoſe Days, ſhall the Sun be darkned, and the Moon ſhall not give her Light, and the Stars ſhall fall from Heaven, and the Powers of the Heaven ſhall be ſhaken.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And then ſhall appear the Sign of the Son of Man in Heaven: And then ſhall all the Tribes of the Earth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45555:25"/>
mourn, and they ſhall ſee the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven, with Power and great Glory.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And he ſhall ſend his Angels with a great Sound of a Trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four Winds, from one end of Heaven to the other.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Now learn a Parable of the Fig-tree: When his Branch is yet tender, and putteth forth Leaves, ye know that Summer <hi>is</hi> nigh.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. So likewiſe ye, when ye ſhall ſee all theſe things, know that it is near, <hi>even</hi> at the Doors.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Verily, I ſay unto you, this Generation ſhall not paſs, till all theſe Things be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my Words ſhall not paſs away.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. But of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man, no, not the Angels of Heaven, but my Father only.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. But as the Days of Noe <hi>were,</hi> ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of Man be.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. For as in the Days that were before the Flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the Day that Noe entred into the Ark.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. And knew not when the Flood came, and took them all away; ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of Man be.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. Then ſhall two be in the Field, the one ſhall be taken, and the other left.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. Two Women ſhall be grinding at the Mill, the one ſhall be taken, and the other left.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Watch therefore, for ye know not what Hour your Lord doth come.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. But know this, that if the good Man of the Houſe had known in what watch the Thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have ſuffered his Houſe to be broken up.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Therefore be ye alſo ready, for in ſuch an Hour as you think not, the Son of Man cometh.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. Who then is a faithful and wiſe Servant, whom his Lord hath made Ruler over his Houſhold, to give them Meat in due Seaſon.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. Bleſſed <hi>is</hi> that Servant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. Verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall make him Ruler over all his Goods.</p>
                  <p n="48">
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:45555:25"/>48. But and if that evil Servant ſhall ſay in his Heart, <hi>My</hi> Lord delayeth his coming.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. And ſhall begin to ſmite <hi>his</hi> Fellow Servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken:</p>
                  <p n="50">50. The Lord of that Servant ſhall come in a Day when he looketh not for him, and in an Hour that he is not aware of;</p>
                  <p n="51">51. And ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint <hi>him</hi> his Portion with the Hypocrites: There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</p>

            <head>A proper Prayer for the Thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> the Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of <hi>England</hi>'s Captivity, and Tyrants Liberty.</head>
            <p>O Bleſſed Lord God, who by thy Wiſdom guideſt and ordereſt all things moſt ſuitable to thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and performeſt thy Pleaſure, always in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to us, that thou canſt alſo appeal to us, whether thy ways be not equal: we, thy poor afflicted People, fall down before thee, acknowledging the juſtice of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with us, and that the amazing Judgment, which as this Day befel us, in thy permitting cruel Men, Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> to execute their fury of their Rebellions upon Our late Gracious Soveraign, and to imbrew their Hands in the Blood and Murder of the Lords Anointed, that was drawn down by the great and long Provocations of this Nation ſins againſt thee: For all which and our own parts, in which, we ſinful wretches here met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deſire to humble our ſelves before thee, and to tremble at thy preſence in this Days ſore Vengeance, the effect as well as the defect of our Impieties, the work of our own Hands upon our ſelves, thy heavy Judgment, but our own moſt horrible Sin; for which alone (did not multitude of other Sins cry out againſt us) thou mighteſt juſtly deſcend down upon us all, as thou didſt in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and leave us no other memorial than to be the frightful Monuments of thine Indignation and Fury to all Poſterity. Gracious is the Lord, and merciful, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45555:28"/>
it is that we are not conſumed! O let thy long-ſuffering and patience lead us to Repentance: And now, O Lord, looking on this particular ſignal Judgment, and thy laſt Trump warning us to flie from the Wrath to come; We come forth to meet our God, mourning in our Prayers before thee, and begging the averſion of thy further diſpleaſure, and the removal of theſe Plagues of long continuance from us; for the all-ſufficient merits of the Death and Sufferings of our bleſſed Saviour. O for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our great and manifold Tranſgreſſions, and for his bloody Paſſion ſake, deliver this Nation from Blood-guiltineſs, that of this Day eſpecially; O God of our Salvation. Let not our crying Sins intercept our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or thy Bleſſings; but hear the Voice of our Tears; and hearing forgive and heal us: retire not quite from us into thine own Place, Laugh not at our Calamities, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mock in this Day of our Viſitation: Vindicate thy own Cauſe, and thine own Providence, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto Men, that thou beareſt up the Pillars of the Earth; and that by thee Kings do Reign. And though thou haſt ſuffered our Enemies to proceed to that high pitch of Violence againſt our late King, even to kill and take poſſeſſion of his Throne and Revenews: Yet fruſtrate now at length their bold Hopes and Deſires; let not their miſchievous imaginations Proſper, leaſt they be too Proud; let them not be able to eſtabliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that proſperity and greatneſs they have Fancied; let them not ſay of his Family, God hath forſaken them, let us perſecute them: Shew ſome Token on his ſeed for Good, that their Enemies may ſee it, and be aſhamed; becauſe thou, Lord, haſt Holpen and Comforted them. Bow the Hearts of the Subjects of this Land, as thou didſt thoſe of Iſrael to <hi>David,</hi> that they acknowledge and receive joyfully the Heir of theſe three Kingdoms; and faſten thou him as a Nail in a ſure Place; behold his Injuries, and have compaſſion on his Innocency; and let the deſire of his Enemies periſh like that of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; but bring him, maugre all their Oppoſitions, to a peaceable poſſeſſion of that Throne to which by Birth-light thou haſt deſigned him, and eſtabliſh him in the Juſt Rights of his Family. O Lord, we wait on thee this Day for this Bleſſing; make no longer tarrying, but according to the time thou haſt Plagued us ſend us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. Snatch the prey out of the Lyons Teeth, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45555:28"/>
pull us out of the Burnings like a Fire-brand: We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, that this Day, we may ſpread before thee the Words of <hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> the Proud railing, and Scornful reproach of our (Enemies) Behold this Day their Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and our Mourning: O Lord, our Eyes are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee! For whom nothing is hard; let it not ſeem a ſmall thing to thee, that we ſuffer, but concenter our Prayers with the many Thouſands that call on thee; that Salvation may come to our King, and through him thy bleſſing of Peace unto thy People. Think upon thoſe that are peaceable, and faithful in the Land, and deal thou with us according to thy Word, wherein thou haſt cauſed us to put our truſt: Let the World ſee that there is a God that judgeth the Earth, and will ſend deliverance to his People in their needful time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But whatſoever is, let us not behave our ſelves frowardly, but with all Chriſtian Humility, run the race thou ſetteſt before us, and patiently bear the Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, becauſe we have ſinned againſt him. And we meekly beſeech thee, that if the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of thy Juſtice withſtand our Petitions, our Prayers may return unto our own Boſoms; and that thou wilt make thy Judgments temporal and not ſpiritual upon us; but aſſiſt us with ſtrength proportionable to our temptations; that we be not delivered to evil: but that in well-doing we may commit our ſelves unto thee our God, as unto a faithful Creator; and that both our King and we may ſay with a Chriſtian ſubmiſſion and cheerfulneſs: It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good; to whom we deſire to aſcribe Honour, Praiſe, Dominion and Thankſgiving, now and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. <hi>Amen.</hi>
