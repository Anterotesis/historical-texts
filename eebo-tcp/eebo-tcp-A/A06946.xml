         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But this part of which I intend now <note place="margin">The profit of this Worke.</note> to treat, bath a higher aime, and shootes much more neere to the marke of commoditie: For the former sheweth how to make the fruitfull more fruitfull; this, how to make the Barren most plentifull: euery good ground will of it selfe bring forth (for Nature was euer a hater of Idlenesse) But the Barren and Sterrill Earth, to make it full of increase and plentie, is <hi>Gratum opus Agricolis,</hi> and such a generall benefit to all good men, that the concealement can be no lesse an offence then theft, robbing a mans Country of that treasure (by negligence) which no other industry, in him, can after restore. I haue formerly written, how by Art to keepe good Grounds good, and to strengthen the weake: But now I shew how to make ill Grounds excellent, and to conuert that which is Barren and vnfruitfull, to become rich in store and plentie: whence shall ensue to all men, these particular profits following: First, plenty of Corne and Pulse, because all grounds being made able and apt for Tillage, the Kingdome may afford to sowe for one Bushell that is now, hereafter fiue hundred, so mightie great are the vnfruitfull and vntilled wastes of Heathes, Downes, Mores, and such like, which at this day lye
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12399:7"/>
vntilled and vnoccupied: and to this abundance of Corne, will redound an equall, or greater abundance of Grasse and Pasture; for besides that, those men and Masters of many grounds, may conuert all their best and most fruitfull Earth to Pasture and Medow, and only keepe the Barren for tillage: yet also this barren earth after it hath done bearing of Corne, which will be in fiue or sixe yeares, shall for as many yeares more, beare as good Medow or Pasture either for breeding or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as can any way be reasonably required, and then being newly made againe, shall newly begin and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in his first Profit, as shall be at large shewed and set forth hereafter; as I haue seene with mine owne eies, to my no small pleasure and amazement, not in one, butin diuers and sundry most vntruitfull and hard Countries.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas through the most parts of this Kingdome, there is euery yeare a third or fourth part of all Corne grounds lost in the fallow or tylthe fields, one field of three, or one of foure, continually lying at rest; now by the vse of the Husbandry following, you shall neuer keepe any fallow field at all, but haue all your ground to beare you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually either Corne or Grasse in good aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>Lastly, whereas in all the generall best parts of this Nation, you cannot haue any Graine of price, as Wheat, Barley, Rye, and such like, vnder two, three, foure, fiue, and some sixe times plowing; now you shall not plow aboue twice at the most for the tenderest and richest graine that is to be reaped, whereby there shall be much paines eased in the Husbandman, great trauell saued from the Cattell, and a much larger

them straight and euen, according as the nature of the ground shall requier, which euery simple plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will soone finde out in turning vp two or three fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes; for according to the cutting of the earth, so must the Husband man fashion the temper of his Plow.</p>
               <p>Now for the maner of plowing this bad and barren <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of plowing.</note> earth, if the ground lye free from water (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly all euill barren earths doe) you shall then throw down your furrowes flat, and betwixt euery furrow you shall leaue a balke of earth halfe as broad as the furrow, and so goe ouer and plow your whole earth vp, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any difference or distinction of lands: but if you feare any annoyance of water, then you shall lay your furro was more high, neere and close together, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the ground into feuerall lands, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning euery land to lye the highest in the midst, so that the water may haue a descent or passage on either side.</p>
               <p>Now so soone as you haue thus plowed vp your <note place="margin">Hacking of Ground:</note> land, and turned all the swarth inward vnto the earth, you shall then take hacks of yron well steeled and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable sharpe, such a competent number, as or your purse of power can compasse, or the greatnesse your ground requireth; for you shall vnderstand that one good hacker, being a lusty labourer, will at good ease hacke and cut more then halfe an Aker of ground in a day; and with these hacks, you shall hew and cut to pieces, all the earth formerly plowed vp, furrow, by furrow, and not the furrowes onely, but also each seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall balke that was left betweene, and any other greene swarth whatsoeuer the Plow bad escaped, and it shall be cut into as small pieces as conueniently you can, for thereby is your mould made much more mellow and

weedes and bad things which would sprout from the Earth, and giuing strength, vigour, and comfort to all kinde of Graine or Pulse, or any fruit of better na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>When you haue thus sanded your earth, you shall <note place="margin">Lyming of Ground.</note> then, if you haue any Limestone about your Grounds, (as barren earths are seldome without) or if you haue any quarries of stone (which are seldome vnaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Lymestone) gather such Lymestone together, and make a Kylne in the most conuenientest place you haue, as well for the carriage of the Lime, as for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the Stone, and bauing burnt your Lyme, the manner whereof is so generally well knowne through the whole Kingdome, that in this place it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth little or no repetition; you shall then on euery aker so formerly plowed, hackt, and sanded, bestow at least forty, or else fiftie bushels of Lyme, spreading and mixing it exceedingly well with the other sand and earth; and heerein is to be noted, that the stronger and sharper the Lime is, the better the earth will be made thereby, and the greater increase and profit will issue from the same; neither shall you neede to respect the colour and complexion of the Lime, as whether it be purely white (as that which is made from chalke) or gray (as that which is made from the smal Lymestone) or else blackish browne (as that which is made from the great stone and maine Quarrie) since it is the strength and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Lyme, not the beautie and colour which brings forth the profits.</p>
               <p>Now, when you haue thus lymed your ground, you <note place="margin">Meanuring of ground.</note> shall then take off the best meanure you haue, as Oxe, Cow, or Horse dung, straw rotted either by the lyttering of Beasts, or by casting vpon the High-waies; the mud

of Lakes, Ponds or Ditches; the soyle of yong Cattell made in the Winter time by feeding at stand Heakes, or any such like kinde of Ordure; and this meanure or compasse, you shall carry forth either on Horsebacke, or in Carts or Tumbrels (according as the Countrie will afford) and you shall lay it and spread it vpon your ground so formerly plowed, hackt, sanded, and lymed, in very plentifull manner, so farre forth as your proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion will extend: for it is to be vnderstood, that barren and hard earths can neuer be ouerladen with good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure or compasse, since it is only the want of warmth and fatnesse which meanure breedeth, that causeth all manner of vnfruitfulnesse.</p>
               <p>After you haue thus meanured all your ground, it is <note place="margin">Times for all labours.</note> to be supposed that the season of the yeare will be well shot on, for the labour of sanding will take little lesse then two Months, your ground being of any indifferent great quantitie, except you haue the assistance and helpe of many of your friends, which is a curtesie that euery Husbandman may imbrace, but not trust vnto; for I would not wish any man that hath not Tenants to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to presume on other friends, lest they fayle him, and so his worke lye halfe done, halfe vndone, which is a great Charracter of negligence and improuidence: but let euery one proportion their labours according to their owne strengths, and the number of their ordinary families. The lyming of your ground, will take at least halfe so much time as the sanding; and the meanuring rather more then lesse then the lyming; so that by any reasonable computatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time, beginning to Plow your ground at the beginning of May, ere it be hackt, sanded, lymed, and meanured, Michaelmas will be come, which is the last of September: for I allow the Month of May
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12399:12"/>
to plowing and backing, Iune and Iuly, for sanding; August, for lyming; and September, for meanuring. So then to proceede on with your Labour, at Michal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, or from that time to the end of October, you shall <note place="margin">Second plowing.</note> begin to Plow ouer that ground againc which formerly you had plowed, hackt, sanded, lymed and manured; and at this later plowing, you shall plow the ground somewhat deeper then you did before; and taking a good stitch (as they call it in Husbandry) you shall be sure to raise vp the quick earth which had not beene stirred vp with the Plow before, making your furrowes greater and deeper then formerly they were, and laying them closer and rounder together then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and in this ardor or later earing, you shall be carefull to Plow your ground as cleane as you can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out balkes or other escapes in Husbandrie, and as you thus plow your ground, you shall haue certaine Hackers, <note place="margin">Second Hacking.</note> with their hacks to follow the Plow, and to cut the Earth and furrowes into very small pieces, as was formerly shewed in the hacking and cutting of the first Ardor: then so soone as your ground is thus plowed &amp; hackt `you shal take a paire or two of very strong &amp; good yron Harrows, <note place="margin">First Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing.</note> and with them you shail goe ouer your ground, tearing that which was formerly plowed and hackt into more smaller pieces then before, and raising vp the mould in much greater abundance then was formerly seene: which work once finished, you shall then take your Seed, which <note place="margin">Of fowing the Seede</note> would be the finest, cleanest, and best Wheate you can prouide, and after the manner of good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, you shall sowe it on the ground very plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not staruing the ground for want or Seede (which were a tyranous penury) nor yet choking it with too much (which were as lauish a foolery) but

Now I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that some easie grounds of light and temperate nature, will mixe very well and sufficiently by the helpe of the Plough onley; but this barren hard earth of which I now write, must only be broken by this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and extreme labour, or else there will neither be mould, earth, nor any other couerture for the seede, but only foule, great, and disorderly clots and lumps, through which the graine can neuer passe, and that which lyeth vncouered will be made a prey to foule and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which will howerly destroy it.</p>
               <p>After you haue sowen and harrowed the ground, you <note place="margin">Ofclotting grounds.</note> shall then see if there remaine any clots or hard lumps of earth vnbroken, which the teeth of the Harrowes are not able to teare in pieces (as it is very likely you shall perceiue many) for these hard barren earthes which are ploughed vp in their greene swarthes, are nothing neere so easily broken and brought to mould, as are the mellow soft earths which haue beene formerly plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many times before, because the hard and intricate rootes of the Grasse, Mosse, and other quick substances growing vpon the same, doth binde and hold the mould so close and fast together, besides the naturall strength and hardnesse of the earth, that without much industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and painefull labour, it is impossible to bring it to that finenesse of mould which Art and good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry requireth; therefore, as soone as you behold those clots and lumps to lye vndisseuered and vnbroken, you

               <figure/>
               <p>And with these flat mauls and beetles, you shall break all the vnbroken clots and lumps of earth which shall trouble or annoy your ground, making your Lands as plaine and smooth as is possible, so that the graine may haue easie passage forth; which labour as soone as you haue finished, you shall then referre the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and prosperitie thereof vnto the mercies of God, who no doubt will giue his blessings according to thy labour and thankfulnesse.</p>
               <p>As touching the trimming and weeding of this Corne, after it is sprung a foote aboue the earth, or there abouts, you shall vnderstand, that these hard barren grounds are very seldome troubled with weedes; for weedes, especially great, strong, and offensiue weedes are the issues of rich and fertile soyles; yet, if through the trimming and making of this earth (which is not commonly seene) you doe perceiue any s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

which shall make an amends for your charge; as for your toyles, yours shall be much the lesse, by a iust computation; for though you haue many labours, yet they are but Somer labours, and neither hurt your owne body, nor your Cattell: whereas the Master of the rich soyle is in continuall worke both Winter and Somer, labouring twice so much to confound the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous growth of weedes as you doe to beget the increase of Corne; and whereas he must euer keepe a third or fourth part of his Corne-ground without fruit, you shall not keepe any which shall not yeeld you a sufficient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie.</p>
               <p>Now me thinkes I heare, in this place, to be obiected <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> vnto me, that whereas I doe prescribe the sanding of these barren Earths with the salt Sea-sand, and no other (as it is true, for all other fresh sand is vnauaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) what if the ground doe lye so farre within the Land, that there is no salt sand within many score of miles of it, how then shall I make good my barren earth; sure to fetch sand so farre, will neuer equall the cost, or it may be this experience hath no further li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits then to such hard and barren earths as lye alongst the Sea coast only.</p>

               <p>Therefore if your ground lye much within the Land, and farre from the Sea, so that this commoditie of sand

thereof caused all the Wheate which was so wet to be sowen by it selfe in a parucular place, and vpon the worst ground which he had, (as much dispairing in the increase thereof) and it is most infallibly true, that of that wet Seede, he receiued at least fiue-fold more profit then of any other, and from thence it came, that this experiment of Bryne and the sowing of salt hath taken place; from which the painfull hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man hath found such infinite increase to arise, that the vse thereof will neuer be layed downe in this Kingdome, neither is the thing in it selfe, without good and strong probabilitie of much increase and strength for the bettering of all manner of earable grounds; for there is nothing which killeth weedes, quicks, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offences of the ground so much as saltnesse: for what makes your Pigeons dung and your Pullens dung to be better for earable grounds then any other dung or meanure whatsoeuer, but by reason of the saltnesse thereof, by which saltnesse also, you may iudge the strength and heate thereof, insomuch that the propper taste of fier, or any hot thing is euer salt; also we say in Phylosiphie, that blood which carryeth the vitall heate and warmth of the body, is in taste salt, and so a nourisher, maintainer, and increaser of all the strength and vigor of the inward faculties; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Fleame, Chollar, and Melancholly, which are the hurts and confounders of the vitall spirits; the first, is in taste sweete; the second bitter; and the last, of an earthy and dry taste, full of much loathsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12399:17"/>
being a reasonable good fewell, either for Baking, Brewing, or diuers other sudden and necessary vses; yet, in as much as the profit being compared with the great quantitie of earth which they couer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, and which with good husbandry might be brought to great fruitfulnesse, is indeede no profit at all; it shall not be amisse for euery good Husband-man that is pestered and ouer-laden with such ground, to seeke by way of good husbandry how to reduce and bring it to that perfection and excellencie which may bec best for his one particular commoditie, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good of the kingdome wherein he liueth.</p>
               <p>Then is there another kinde of soyle which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all differing from this, but is euery way as barren and sterryll, which is that ground which is ouer runne with Broome (which is as noysome a weede as the former) and though it haue not such sharpe prickles as the other, whereby to hinder the grazing of Cattell; yet doth it grow so close and thick together, and is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally so poysonous and offensiue to grasse, that you shall seldome see any grow where this Broome prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, besides the bittrrnesse thereof is so vnpleasant and distastefull to all kinde of Cattell, that not any will euer crop or bite vpon the same, only it is of some necessary vse for the poore Husbandman, in respect that it serueth him both for fuell, for thatching and the couering of his houses (being for that purpose, of all, the longest lasting) and also for the making of Beesomes for clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the house and Barnes, or else for sale and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity in the Market; all which profits (as before I said) being compared with the losse of the ground and the goodnesse that might be reaped from the same, are indeede truly no profits but hinderances.</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:12399:18"/>
Therefore I would wish euery man that is Master of such grounds, whether they be ouerrunne with Gorse, Furres, Broome, or any such kinde of grose, woody, or substantiall weede: first, to cut vp the iweede (of what <note place="margin">Destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of weedes.</note> sort so euer it be) whether Gorse, Furres, or Broome) as close and neere vnto the ground as you can possibly, and then making them vp into sheafes or bigge Faggots, carry them home and stack them vp very dry, so as no raine may enter or peirce into them, for the smallest wet will rot and consume them to dirt and filthinesse; which done, you shall make Labourers with hacks, picks, and such like tooles to stub vp ail the rootes which you left in the ground, euen to the very bottome of the same; and these rootes you shall be very carefull to haue stubbed vp exceeding cleane, by no meanes lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (so neere as you'can) any part or parcell of the rootes behinde you; then these rootes thus stubbed vp, you shall diligently gather together into little heaps as bigge as moale-hils, and place them vpon the ground a pretie distance one from another, and so let them lye till the Sunne and Winde haue dryed them (for it is to be intended, that this labour must begin about the latter end of Aprill and beginning of May.</p>

               <p>Now touching the weeding of this earth; after the <note place="margin">Of wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> Corne beginneth to grow aboue the ground, there is no feare to be had either of Thistles, Tares, Cockles, Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell Docks, and such like strong weedes, which indeed are the issues of good groundsill ordered and handled: But the weeds which you shall most feare in this place, is yong Gorse, or Furs, or else yong Broome, which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to grow from the leaft part or parcell of roots that shall be left behind; nay, the very nature of those bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren earths is such, that of the one accord it will bring forth those weedes, the cold sharpnesse of the ayre mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the fterrility and roughnesse of the earth, being the cause that it will giue life to no other bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plants; therefore so soone as you shall behold any of them to appeare aboue the earth, though they be not halfe a singer high, you shall presently, with all diligence, pull them vp by the rootes and cast them away, or lay them in heapes that they may be afterwards burnt, and the ashes sprinkled vpon the ground, and heerein is to be obserued, that the yonger and the sooner that you doe pull vp these weedes, the better it is and the easilier they will come from the earth, and the sooner be destroyed: for all those mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures where with already you haue beene taught to mixe your earth, are in themselues such naturall enemies to all these kinde of barren weedes, that should you omit the manuall labour of destroying them (which no good husband willingly will do) yet in time the earth of it selfe, and the often plowing of the same would leaue no such

               </argument>
               <p>NExtvnto this barren Clay which is ouerrunnewith Furres, Broome and such like, I will place that barren and vnfertill carth, being also a Clay, wether sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or compound, which is ouerrunne onely with Whinnes, as indeede bearing little or no other burthen, or if it doe beare any other burthen, as some little short, moffie grasse, yet is that grasse so couered ouer with these sharpe Whinnes, that not any beast dare put his nose to the ground, or bire vpon the same; and indeed, this kind of earth is not any whit at all lesse barren then those of which I haue already written: but rather more, in that the malignant qualities thereof are not so soone cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, nor yet the vertues so soone restored.</p>
               <p>To speake then first what these Whinnes are, you shall <note place="margin">What Whinnes are:</note> vnderstand that they be a certaine kinde of rough dry weedes which growe bushie and thick together, very short and close vnto theground, being of a darke browne collour, and of crooked growth, thick and confused, and full of knots, and those knots armed with hard, long, sharpe pricks, like thornes or bryars, they haue little browne leaues which shadow the pricks, and doe winde their branch so one into another, that they can hardly be seperated, yet is their growth at any time little more then a handfull aboue the earth, only they spread ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and will runne and couer ouer a whole field, choaking vp all sorts of good plants whatsoeuer, and

turning the best grasse that is to mosse, and filthinesse; <note place="margin">Paring of Grounds.</note> wherefore if at any time you be Master of any such naughtie and barren ground, and would haue it redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto goodnesse and fertillitie, you shall first take a fine thinne paring-shouell made of the best yron and well steeled and hardned round about the edges, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme of this figure following:</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>And with this paring-shouell, you shall first pare vp all <note place="margin">Making of Baites.</note> the vpper swarth of the ground, about two inches or an inch and a halfe thick at the least, and euery paring would be some three foote in length at the least, and so broad as the shouell will conueniently giue it leaue, and; this swarth thus pared vp, you shall first turne the whinny or grasse side downeward, and the earth side vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and so let it lye two or three daies in the Sunne to dry (for this worke is intended to begin in the month of May) and when that side is well dryed you shall turne the other side, and dry it also; then when all the swarth is dryed, you shall gather fixe or seuen pieces together, and turning the whinny or grasse side inward and the earth side outward, you shall make round, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low little hils thereof much what according to the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this figure following:</p>
               <p>

               <p>And the inward hollownes like vnto the hollownes of an Ouen, butmuch lesse in compasse, which done, you shall fill the hollownesse with dry chips, or else small sticks, or Furres and straw mixed together, which you shall put in at the vent-hole which shall be left on one side of the hill, and then kindling it with fier, you shall burne all that swarth in such sort as you burnt the roots of your Furres and Broome before; for this is also called a burning of Baite, as well as the former; for it is a most principall nurrisher of the earth, and a very sudden destroyer of all malignant weedes whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
               <p>After the burning of your hils, as soon as the fier <note place="margin">Breaking of Baites.</note> is vtterly quenched and gone out, and no heate at all left in the hils, you shall then with clotting beetles beate them all downeto dust, and then with shouels you shall spread the ashes quite ouer all the ground, as was before declared in the former Chapter: and heerein is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12399:22"/>
that you must place these hils as thick and close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as by any meanes possibly you can, making your hils so much the lesse and lower, that they may stand thicker and neerer together, and so couer more ground, and thereby the heate and strength of the fier to disperse it selfe ouer all that peice of ground; for the fier bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon the ground, doth as much good for the inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the earth and destroying of the weedes, as the ashes doth which are spread vpon the same.</p>
               <p>Now after your Baite is in this manner burned and <note place="margin">Plowing.</note> spread, you shall then (as was before shewed) plow vp your ground in good large furrowes, then hack it very small, sand it, limeit, and meanure it; and of all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, there is not any better for this ground then Oxe dung and ashes well mixt together; of which ashes, those of Beane-straw, Pease-straw, or any other straw, are best; those of Wood or Ferne next, those of Charcoale next, &amp; those of Seacoale or pitcoale are the worst of all; Swines dung is not much amisse for this ground; for though it be a great breeder of weedes and thystles in good or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile grounds, yet in this cold hard and barren earth it worketh no such effect, but is a great comforter and warme moistner of the same.</p>
               <p>After you haue thus made your ground; as soone as wheate seede-time cometh, which is the latter end of September and beginning of October, you shall then with great care plow ouer your ground againe, and take great respect that you turne vp your furrowes much deeper then before, and that for two especiall causes; the first, that the new earth may the better mixe with the old earth and those helpes which are added thereunto; and secondly, that yow may be surer to teare vp the rootes of all the Whinnes from the very
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12399:23"/>
bottome of the earth, not suffring any part of them to remaine behinde, and for this purpose it shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to haue an idle Boy or two to follow your Plow, and to gather away all the rootes that shall be torne vp or any way else left bare aboue ground, which rootes shall be layd on heapes in conuenient places, and then after burnt, and the ashes thereofspread vpon the ground, which will be a very great comfort vnto the seede, being a speedy helpe vnto the sprouting thereof, and a very warme comforter of the roote after the stemme is spind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led aboue ground, for in these cold barren earthes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth so much spoile and flay the Corne, as the dead coldnesse which lyeth at the roote thereof; for in many of these vnfertill places, you shall see Corne at the first sowing (whilest there is a little strength in the ground) sprout in great abundance, promising much hope of the profit; but when it should spindle and come to much better perfection, that poore strength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spent and consumed, and the cold and drinesse of the soile, hauing as it were ourcome all matter of comfort then presently you shall sec the blade of the Corne turne yellow, the stemme or stalke to wither, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put forth no eare at all, or else a very poore lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle empty one, being laden with nothing but a most dry chaffie huske without substance: But to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to our purpose, after you haue thus plowed vp your ground the second time, you shall then hack it againe, and harrow it, as was declared in the other former Chapters; then you shall take your seede-wheate which hath beene steept either in brine or Sea water, and to enery bushell of that seede, you shall adde a bushell of Bay salt and mixe them very well together in your Hopper or Sydlop, and so sowe them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

vpon the ground, obseruing to double your casts so ost, that you may not faile to cast that true quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of seede into the earth which otherwise you would haue done if so be there had beene no mixture at all, for to doe otherwise were to deceiue the ground, and a handfull of seede so saued, would be the losse of a peck in the time of Haruest; therefore haue great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that your ground haue his due, for it is no more cost though it be a little labour.</p>
               <p>When your seede is sowen, you shall harrow it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <note place="margin">Harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> the second time, clot it, smooth it, and sleight it, as was before declared in the former Chapters.</p>
               <p>As touching the weeding of this ground, it is the leaft <note place="margin">Weeding.</note> labour of all other, for the earth being so corrected as is before shewed, it will naturally of it selfe put forth no weedes, especially if you remember to plow it deepe, and be sure to teare vp and gather away all the quick rootes, otherwise if that labour be any thing neglected, then will it put forth both Whinnes and great store of other rough weedes, which as soone as you shall perceiue to appeare, you shall presently with your wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Nyppers pull them vp by the rootes, as was at large declared in the fore-going Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now for the generall profit of this ground thus <note place="margin">Profits.</note> made and prepared, it is the same that the two former are, that is to say, it will beare you good and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Wheate, in plentifull abundance for the space of two or three years, then Barley a yeare after; then Oates three yeares together after the Barley; and Pease or Beanes a yeare after the Oates; then lastly, very good Meadow or Pasture, for the space of three or foure yeares after, and then you shall begin and dresse it againe, as was formerly declared, and thus much touching the

                  <p>Of the Ordering, Tylling, and Dressing of all barren Clayes, whether simple or else compound, which are ouer-runne with Lynge, or Heath.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>There followeth now successiuely, another sort of barren Earth, which indeede is much more sterryll and barren then any of the other formerly written vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because they, out of their owne natures, doe beare a certaine kinde of grasse or foode which will relieue ordinary, hard, store-Cattel, whether it be sheepe, goats, or yong beasts. But this earth of which I am now to intreate, beareth no grasse at all, but only a vilde, filthie, black-browne weede, which we call Lynge or Heath, the tender tops whereof Cattell and wilde Deere will sometimes crop, yet it is to them but little reliefe, and only maintaineth life and no more. Now al-be some may obiect vnto me, that this kinde of soyle is euer a sandy soile and no Clay, as may be seene in most Chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Forrests, and Downes: yet I answere, that al-be it hold so in generall; yet there are diuers Clayes, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in mountainous Countries, that are pestered with these kinde of weedes, as may be seene in the North and North-West parts of Deuonshire, in some parts of Cornewall, and in many parts both of North and South Wales; and these Clay grounds which are thus offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with these weedes of Lyng or Heath, are much more barren and vnfruitfull then the sands, because of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12399:24"/>
their much more coldnesse; yet those Clayes which are mixed with either blacke sand, dun sande, or yellow sand, and ouerrunne thus with Heath or Lynge, are the most barren of all: to make any further discription of this Heath or Lyng, being a thing so notoriously knowne ouer all this Kingdome, I hold it meerely needlesse, only to say it is a rough browne weedo, shooting out abundance of stalkes from one roote, with little darke leaues, and flowers on the toppe, of a pale reddish colour, much inclyning vnto Peach colour at the first, but being full blowne, they are then a little more whitish.</p>
               <p>You therefore that haue any such ground, and desier <note place="margin">Destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of heath.</note> to bring it to fruitfulnesse and the bearing of good Corne and grasse in a reasonable abundance; you shall first with sythes or sharpe hookes (but old sythes are the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) cut downe all the Heath, or Lynge which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon the earth, you intend to conuert to goodnesse so neere the ground as possibly you can; then when it is cut downe (which would euer be at the beginning of the Month of May) you shall let it lye vpon the ground, daily tossing and turning it till it become very dry, then spreading it all ouer the ground, and mixing or couering it with dry straw of any kinde whatsoeuer you shall presently set it on fier in so many seuerall corners of the field, that all the seuerall fiers in the end may meete in one point, and not leaue any part of the mowen Heath or Lyng vnburnt, or any part of the ground vnscortched; after this is done and the ground cooled, you shall with your flat clotting beetles beate the ashes hard into the ground, then you shall take a strong plow, with a broad-winged share, and an euen colture, and you shall plow vp all this ground thus
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12399:25"/>
burnt, in very large and deepe furrowes, by no meanes picking out any of the quicke rootes which shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the furrowes so turned vp, but letting them rest in the earth still, then with your hacks and the help of your yron paring-shouell, you shall cut vp the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, formerly turned vp, into short pieces of three foote or three foote and a halfe long, and some lesse, as occasion shall serue; then with these pieces, you shall build little hollow hils, such as in the former Chapter you made of the vpper swarth of the ground only; and then filling the hollownesse with dry heath and dry straw mixt together, you shall set euery hill on fier, <note place="margin">Another Burning of Baite.</note> and so burne the very substance of the earth into ashes, which will soone be done by reason of the infinite number of rootes and small strings which lie mixt in the earth, and the drynesse thereof occasioned by the former burning: And this is another kind of burning of Baite much different from all the former, and yet to as great end and profit as any whatsoeuer, and these hils must as the former be placed one as neere ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as is possible, so as they may spread and couer ouer the greatest part of the ground, and leauiug no more then a good reasonable path to passe betweene hill and hill.</p>
               <p>Now as soone as you haue thus burned all your Baite, and that your hils are cold, you shall then as was before shewed in the former Chapters with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels and Shouels breake downe the hils and spread the earth and ashes ouer all the ground; which done, you shall sand it (if the situation of the ground be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thereunto) and lime it in such sort as was shewed in the second Chapter; then when it is lymed, and the lime equally spread, not more in one place then in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:12399:25"/>
you shall then meanure it with the best mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure you can prouide, of which there is none better or more propper for this ground then mans ordure, and the rubbish, sweepings, parings and spytlings of houses mixt together, or for want of this (because it may not be in so great plenty as other meanures) you may take either old Oxe dung, or Horse dung, or for want of them, the old rotten and mouldy staddels or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of Corne-stacks, or reedes; especially Pease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacks, or Beane-stacks, prouided that it be thorowly rotten, for the lesse rotten it is, the worse it is: Also the scowrings of common Sewers, and especially those through which much of mans vrine doth passe, is a most wonderfull and beneficiail meanure for these grounds, so are also the scow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>After your ground is thus perfectly made and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured, and that Wheat-seede time doth draw on, which (as before was shewed) is euer at the latter end of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, you shall then plow vp your ground againe in that manner as was shewed for the former earths; to wit, much deeper then before: for you are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that this ground being drest as is before declared, there will remaine nothing of the furrowes which were first plowed vp but the as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s, which being couered with sand, lime, and meanure, the earth will lye plaine and leuell, so that of necessitie you must raise vp new furrowes of new earth, which being done, you shall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12399:26"/>
then with your hacks, cut all the new earth into very small pieces; mixing them well with the other mould made of sand, lyme, meanure and ashes, then as was before said, you shall harrow it to make the mixture so much the better, and the mould so much the finer; and then if it haue beene sanded, you may sowe your Seede-Wheate simply of it selfe, without any doubt of the plentifull increase thereof; but if it haue not beene sanded, then as in the fore going Chapter, you shall not only steepe your Seede in Brine (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewed) but also you shall mixe your Seede with Bay-salt, and so sowe it into the ground; or if at the time of sowing (after it is plowed, hackt and harro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed) youbestow or Pigeons dung, or Pullens dung, or sheepes dung vpon the Land, it will be much better, and the Corne will giue a much greater increase. Now as soone as your Land is sowen, you shall then forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with harrow it againe and couer the Seede very close, then you shall clot it, smooth it, and sleight it (as was before shewed.)</p>
               <p>As touching the weeding and cleansing of this earth <note place="margin">Of Wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> after the Corne is sprung vp, you shall vnderstand that there is great care to be had thereunto, for this ground is much subiect vnto weedes, and those of the worst kinde: fot although for the most part it will be free from all manner of soft and tender weedes, as thy stels, cockell, darnell, ketlocks, docks, rape, and such like herball stuffe; yet is it much subiect to twitch Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, which grow at both ends, lyng, wilde time, `and such like, any of which as soone as you shall see appeare or peepe aboue the earth, you shall presently with your Nippers pull them vp by the rootes, and not suffer them in any wise to looke a handfull aboue the ground, for if
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12399:26"/>
you doe, their hardnesse is so great, and their rootes so large and fast fixt in the mould, that you can by no meanes pull them away without great losse and hurt to the graine, pulling vp with them all such rootes of Corne, as shall be fixed neere about them, for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weake and superfluous things which shall grow from the Land, you may with ordinary weeding hooks cut them away; as for long grasse, whether it be soft or segy, or any other such like stuffe, you shall not stirre it but let it grow, for it keepeth warme the roots of your Corne, and giueth nourishment and increase thereunto: Now for the profit of this soyle thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and husbanded it is equall with any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and will beare Wheate very plentifully for the space of the three first yeares, good Barley; the fourth yeare with the helpe of the sheepe folde (as was before said;) and good Oates the sift, sixt, and seuenth yeares; and very good small Pease the eight yeare (for Beanes this Soyle will very hardly beare at all) and the ninth, tenth, and eleuenth yeare it will beare very good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow (though not altogether very fine pure grasse, yet very good feeding and wholesome grasse) or so good pasture as a man can reasonably require for any hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Cattell whatsoeuer; nay; it will also indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well feede, and fat Cattell, though peraduenture it requireth a little longer time then other finer grounds will.

of tenne or eleuen, for the second yeare he shall assoone as he hath gathered his Wheate off, which will be in August, and finisht other parts of his haruest, he shall presently put his Plow into the same Wheate-ground againe and Plow it vp, hack it, harrow it, sowe it, her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it againe, clot it, and weede it, as in the former yeare, and so consequently of all the yeares following, whereby you perceiue that all labours and charges are saued more then once plowing and sowing.</p>
               <p>This then considered, it necessarily now followeth, that I speake of the bettering and bringing into perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all manner of barren Sand-grounds, being sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of themselues, without any mixture of other earths, except one and the same kind, as sand with sand, though peraduenture the colours of the sands may alter; as red with white, yellow with blacke, &amp;c. which in as much as the whole substance is sand without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary mixture, therefore it may well be called simple and not compound: and of these sands, I purpose to intreate, as formerly I did of the Clayes; that is to say, by their outward faces and Charracters, which are those burthens and increases which of their owne prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per natures without any help or compulsion they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and bring forth into the World. And first of that naughtie cold and barren sand, which lying vpon high, stony &amp; mountainous Rocky places, or else vpon low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cold bleak Plaines, subiect to the North and North-East windes and tempests, or bordering vpon the Seas, doth not bring forth any thing but a short mossie grasse which the Sunne makes bitter, and the cold dewes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some &amp; vnsauorie in taste.

First, at the beginning of the Spring, as about midd <note place="margin">Plowing:</note> Aprill or earlyer, with a strong Plow answerable to the soyle, yet somewhat lesse both in timbers and yrons then that wherewith you plow your Clay grounds: you shall Plow so much of that earth vp as you may conueniently compasse to sowe and dresse exactly and perfectly; for to vndertake more, were to make all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and to cast away much labour and charge without any profit, this ground you shall plow of an indifferent depth, though not so deepe as the Clayes, and you shall lay the furrowes though flat, yet close one one to another, without leauing any balke betweene, but plowing all very cleane; yet not so very cleane and close together, that you may lay the greene swarth to the new plowed or quick earth; but rather turne one swarth against another, so as the furrowes may lye, and no more but touch the edges one of another: This when you haue done, you shall then with your hacks cut and breake all the earth so turned vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to very small peices, and not only the earth so turned vp: but also all other greene swarth which was left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plowed; prouided, that before this labour of hacking, you let the ground lye certaine daies in the furrowes, that one swarth heating and scalding the other, they may both equally rot and grow mellow together, which once perceiued by the blacknesse thereof, you may then at your pleasure hack it and cut it as is before declared.</p>
               <p>Now some may in this place obiect vnto me, that this <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> labour of hacking should be needlesse, in as much as all sand grounds whatsoeuer are out of their owne natures so light, loose, and willing to disseuer, that this toile might very well and to good purpose be saued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:12399:28"/>
To this I answere, that true it is, most sands in their <note place="margin">Answere.</note> owne natures are loose, and light, and willing to disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into fine mold without any extremity, especially rich and fruitfull sands whose predominant qualitie of warmth giueth nourishment and increase; but these barren and cold sands, in which is a certaine flegmatique toughnesse and most vnwholesome dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, are of a cleane contrary nature, and through the stony hardnesse thereof, they are as vnapt to break and disseuer as any Clay whatsoeuer: besides, the swarth being of a tough mossie substance (which euer carryeth a hard strong roote answerable with the cold in which it is ingendred) doth so constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly binde, fetter, and hold the mold together, that it is inpossible for any harrow to breake it in pieces, or to gather from it so much mould as may serue to couer the Corne and giue it roote when it is sowen into the same; and therefore then this worke of hacking, there can be none more necessary, or to the Husband-man can bring more ease or profit.</p>
               <p>When therefore you haue thus hackt your Land, <note place="margin">OfMarling</note> and distributed the mold into many small pieces, you shall then with all expedition marle it; which forasmuch as it is no generall or common practise in euery part of this Kingdome, I will first tell you what Marle is, and then how to finde it, digge it, and vse it for your best behoofe.</p>
               <p>Marle you shall then vnderstand, is a certaine rich, stiffe <note place="margin">What Marle is.</note> &amp; tough Clay of a blewish colour, and full of many red veines like Porphery or Marble, it is of a tough &amp; glewie substance, apt to worke and hold together like waxe, and chiefly when it is any thing moist, but being dryed, it mouldereth and breaketh as small as cynders; and by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12399:29"/>
these three Carracters, colour, toughnesse, and loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, being dryed, you shall neuer faile certainely to know it. Some are of opinion, that this Marle was first found out in Germanie, and there put in practise, and found of most notable vse, calling it by the name of Pytch, or a certaine Clay like pitch: others that we found it out first heere in England, as indeed is most probable, because we haue the greatest store, and make the greatest vse thereof: others, that the first knowledge came out of France, but that is least credible, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it there in much vse, nor much mentioned in any of the French Authors, especially the antientest or any that writ out of present memory; howsoeuer, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that not any meanure that is in vse with the Husband-man is of more vertue or perfection, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for these loose, sandy, barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earths, neither of so much goodnesse and continuance; for it is hard for any one single and simple meanure to continue aboue three or foure years; yet this Marle is knowne to haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the ground good for the space of a dozen yeares at the least.</p>

good for you to make proofe of all the most likely parts of your ground to finde out this Marle; and as soone as you haue found it out, you shall with Mattocks and Spades digge it vp and carry it to your land, there laying it in bigge round heapes, and setting them within a yard or two one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; thus when you haue filled ouer all your ground (which would be done with as great speede as might be, for the ancient custome of this Kingdome was, when any man went about to Marle his ground, all his Tenants, Neighbours and friends would come and helpe him to haften on the Worke) you shall then spread all those heapes, and mixing the Clay well with the Sand, you shall lay all smooth and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell together; and heerein is to be obserued, that if the land you thus marle shall lye against the side of any great Hill or Mountaine, whereby there will be much desent in the ground, then you shall (by all meanes lay double as much marle, sand, or other compasse on the toppe of the Hill as on the bottome, because the raine and showers which shall fall will euer wash the fatnesse of the earth downe to the lowest parts thereof; when your ground is thus marled (if you be neere to the Sea-side) you shall then also sand it with salt Sea-sand, in such sort as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared, only you may forbeare to lay altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so much vpon this sand ground as you did on the Clay ground, because an halfe part is fully suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.

a wearer out of the ground, and maketh a rich father yet a poore sonne, in this stile it doth not so hold, for as it fretteth and wasteth away the goodnesse that is in Clay grounds, so it comforteth &amp; much strengtheneth these sand earths, and this chalke you shall lay in the same manner as you did your marle, and in the same manner spread it and leuell it, which done you shall then lime it as was before shewed in the Clay grounds, yet not so abundantly, because also a halfe part will be sufficient; after your lyming, you shall then mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure it with the best meanure that you haue, whether it be dung of Cattell, Horse, Sheepe, Goates, straw, or other rubbish, and that being done and Seede-time drawing on, you shall then plow vp your ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, mixing the new quick earth and the former soyles so well together, that there may be little distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishment betweene them, then you shall hack it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, then harrow it, and lastly sowe it with good sound and perfit seed, and of seedes though Wheate will very well grow vpon this earth; yet Rye is the more naturall and certaine in the increase, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the strength of the ground, you may vse your discretion, obseruing that if you sowe Wheate, then to steepe it before in brine or salt-Sea-water, as was before described; but if you sowe Rye, then you shall sowe it simply without any helpe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be Pigeons dung, or Bay-salt simple of it selfe in such manner as hath beene before declared; either sowing the salt with the Corne or before the Corne, as shall seeme best in your owne discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NExt vnto this plaine, cold, barren Sand, which beareth no other burthen but a short mossie grasse; I will place that Sand which is laden and ouer runne with Braken, Ferne, or Heath, as being by many degrees more barren then the former, both in respect that it is more loose and lesse substantiall, as also in that it is more dry and harsh, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without nutriment, more then an extroame sterryll coldnesse, as appeareth by the burthen it bringeth forth, which is Braken or Ferne, a hard, rough, tough weede, good for nothing but to burne, or else to lytter store-beasts with for the breeding of meanure, or if you strow it in the High-waies where many Trauellers passe, it will also thereturne to good reasonable compasse.</p>
               <p>Of this kinde of ground if you be Master, and <note place="margin">Of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Braken.</note> would reduce it vnto fertilitie and goodnesse, you shall first, whether the Braken be tall and high (as I haue seene some as high as a Man on Horse-back) or short and low (as indeed most commonly these barren earths are, for tall Ferne or Braken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

plowing after the Marle was spread vpon the ground, the new, quick, and vnstirred fresh earth might as well be stirred vp to mixe with the Marle, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead earth and ashes formerly receaued, whereby a fresh comfort should be brought to the ground and an equall mixture without too much drynesse, and this second Ardor or plowing would begin about the latter ende of Iune.</p>
               <p>After your ground hath beene thus marled, and <note place="margin">Sanding and lyming</note> the second time plowed, you shall then sand it with salt Sea-sand, lime it and meanure it as was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the foregoing Chapter: and of all meanures for this soile, there is not any so exceeding good as sheepes meanure, which although of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man it be esteemed a meanure but of one yeare, yet by experience in this ground it hapneth otherwise, and is as durable, and as long lasting a compasse as any that can be vsed, and besides it is a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of thystles, to which this ground is very much subiect, because vpon the alteration of the ground the Ferne is also naturally apt to alter vnto Thystell as we daily see.</p>
               <p>When your ground is thus amply drest and well <note place="margin">Plowing and sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> ordered, and that Seede-time commeth on, you shall then plow it againe in such manner as you did the second time, that is to say, very deepe, cleane, and after the manner of good Husbandry, without any rest balkes or other disorders: then shall you hack it very well, then harrow it, and then sowe it; but by mine aduice, in any case, I would not haue you to bestow any Wheate vpon this soyle (except it be two or three bushels on the best part thereof
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12399:32"/>
for experience sake, or prouision for your houshold) for it is a great enemy vnto Wheate, and more then the marle hath no nourishment in it for the same, because all that commeth from the salt sand, lime and meanure it little enough to take away the naturall sterrilitie of the earth it selfe, and giue it strength to beare Rye, which it will doe very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully; and therefore I would wish you for the three first yeares only, to sowe the best Rye you can get into this ground; the fourth yeare to sowe Barley; the sift, sixt and seuenth Oates; and of Oates, the bigge blacke Oate is the best for this ground, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the best and kindlyest Oat-malt, and feedeth Horse or Cattell the soundest; as also it is of the hardest constitution, and endureth either cold or drynesse much better then either the white Oate, the cut Oate, or any Oate whatsoeuer; the eight yeare, you shall only sowe Lupyns or Fetches; and three yeares after, you shall let it lye for grasse, and then dresse it againe as before said; for it is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that in all the following yeares (after the first yeare) you shall bestow no labour vpon this ground more then plowing sowing, hacking and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing at Seede-time only.</p>
               <p>But to proccede to the orderly labour of this <note place="margin">Labours after sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> ground, after you haue sowen your Rye, you shall then harrow it againe, clot it, smooth it and sleight it as was before shewed in the second Chapter of this Booke. And although a man would imagine that the sandy loosenesse of this soyle would not neede much clotting or sleighting of the Earth, yet by reason of the mixture thereof with the Marle

               <p>After your ground is thus sufficiently drest with <note place="margin">Harrowing and other labours.</note> these soiles and meanures, you shal then plow it againe the second time which would bee after <hi>Michaelmas;</hi> after the plowing you shall then hack it againe, and be sure to mixe the earth and the meanures very well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then you shall breake it in gentle manner with your Harrowes, and then sowe it; which done you shall harrow it againe, but then you shall harrow it much more painefully, and not leaue any clots or hard earth vnbroken that the Harrow can pull in pieces: as touching the seede which is fittest for this earth, it is the same that is spoken of in the next foregoing Chapter: as namely, the best Rye or the best Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sline, which is Rye and Wheate equally mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or if there bee two parts Rye, and but one Wheate, the seede will bee so much the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and surer holding, and this seede you may sowe on this ground three yeares together, then Barley, then Oates, and so foorth, as is formerly writ of the grounds forgoing. After your ground is sowne and harrowed, you shall then clotte it, sleight it, and smooth it as you did the other groundes before, and then lastly with your backe Harrowes, that

               <p>Lastly touching the weeding of this soyle, you shall <note place="margin">Weeding.</note> vnderstand the weeds which are most incident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, are all the same you first went about to destroy: as namely, Twich, rough wilde Grasse, and yong woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vndergrowth, besides Thistles, Hare bottles, and Gipsie flowers; therefore you shall haue a great care at the first appearance or springing vp of the Corne, to see what weeds ariseth with it, (for these weeds are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerfully as hasty as the Corne) and assoone as you see them appeare, both your selfe and your people with your hands shall pull them vp by the roots, and so weed your land as you would weed a garden, or Woad ground.

them neuer so close in the Spring, yet they will againe ouermount the Corne before haruest, and by reason of their greatnesse, roughnesse, and much hardnesse choake and slay much Corne that shall grow about them, and therefore by all meanes you shall pull these weeds vp by the roots whilst they are tender, (if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly you can,) or otherwise in their stronger growth, sith their sufferance breedeth great losse and distructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And thus much touching the plowing, ordering, dressing and inriching of all barraine sands that are laden and ouer-runne with Twitch, wilde Bryar, or woody vndergrowth.</p>

in this case this ground can hardly be made for corne, because euery ouerflow putteth the Graine in danger, yet may it be well conuerted to excellent pasture or medow, by finding out the heads of the Springs, and by opening and cleansing them, and then drawing from those cleansed heads, narrow draines or furrows through which the waters may passe to the neighbour ditches, and so be conueied downe to the lower Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers; leauing all the rest of the ground dry, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no moistures to passe, but what goeth through these small deepe channels, then as soone as Sommer commeth, and the ground begins to harden, ifyou see any of the water stand in any part of the ground, you shall forth with mend the draine, and helpe the water to passe away, which done (as the ground hardeneth) you shall with hacks and spades lay the swarth smooth and plaine, and as early in the yeere as you can conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, you shall sow vpon the ground good store of hay seeds, and if also you doe meanure it with the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten staddels or bottomes of haystacks, it will be much the better, and this staddell you shall not spread very thicke but rather of a reasonable thinnesse, that it may the sooner rot and consume vpon the same.</p>

all which shall fall into the former deepe draines, and so make the ground as constant and firme as may be, then hauing an intent to imploy it for Corne, you shall bring your Plow into the ground, being a very strong one, and not much differing in Timber - worke or Irons from that which turneth vppe the clay grounds, and laying before the Plow long wades or roules of the straw ofLupyns, Pease, or else Fetches, (but Lupynsis the best) you shall turne the furrowes of earth with the Plow vpon the waddes, and so couer or bury them in the mould, and thus do vnto euery furrow, or at least vnto most of the furrowes you turne vppe, and so let it lie a little time to rotte, as by the space of a fortnight or three weekes, in which space, if the ground receiue not raine and moysture enough to rotte the strawe thus formerly buried, you shall then by stopping the draynes, and making the Springs ouerflow, gently washe the ground all ouer and no more, and then presently draine it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; which done, assoone as the earth is dry, you shall hacke it and breake it into small peeces, then you shall also Sande it, Lyme it and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nureit.</p>

               <p>This done, about the latter ende of <hi>luly</hi> you shall plow vp the ground againe with somewhat a better and deeper stytch then you did before, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the straw be vnrotted or vnconsumed, it may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be raisd vp with the new moist earth &amp; so made to

               <p>Now as soone as your seed wheat is sowne, you shal <note place="margin">Harrowing.</note> then harrow the ground againe, and be sure to couer the wheate both deepe and closse, as for the clots which shall arise from this soile, it shall not matter whether you break them, or no, for by reason of their moysture, they will be plyant and easie for the wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to passe thorow, so that you shall not care how rough your land lye, so it lye cleane, and the Corne well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, but for all other seeds, you shall break the clots to dust, and lay the land as smooth as may be.</p>
               <p>Now for the weeding of this soyle, you will not be much troubled there with, because this ground natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of it owne accord, putteth forth no weeds, more then these which are ingendred by the new-made

and if it be a flat leuel ground; if you let the water thus couering it to lie vpon the same the space of 4. or. 5. daies or a week, it shall not be amisse; &amp; then you may water it the seldomer, But if it lie against the side of a hill, so that the water cannot rest vpon the same, then you shall wash it all ouer, leauing no part vnmoystned, &amp; this you shal do the ofner, according as the weather shalfal out, &amp; your water grow more or lesse plentiful.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12399:42"/>
is euer the most flat and leuell, and there you may let the water remaine so long as you thinke good (as was before shewed) and then let it out into other waste ditches or riuers. And here you shall know that this lowest ground will euer be the most fruitfull, as well because it lyeth the warmest, moystest, and safest from stormes and tempests, as also because what soyle or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goodnesse this ouerflow of water, or the raine washeth from other grounds, it leaueth vpon this, and so daily increaseth the fertility, from whence you shall gather, that at the first making of these medow grounds you may bestow lesse cost of meanure and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charges vpon this lowest, flat, leuell ground, then on the higher; and so by that rule also obserue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on the highest ground, and the highest part of the highest ground euer the greatest abundance of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, and so as you shall descend lower &amp; lower, to lay your meanure thinner and thinner, yet not any part vtterly vnfurnished &amp; voyd of compasse, yet as before I said you are to remember that these medow grounds need not this much vse of meanure (hauing this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of water, and the first yeares dressing as was shewed in the beginning of this Chapter) aboue once in twenty yeares; nay it may be not aboue once in a mans life time.</p>
               <p>And here also is to be considered, that the water which commeth from clay or marle grounds, being thicke, muddy and pudly, is much better and richer then that which commeth from sand, grauell or pib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and so runneth cleare and smooth, for that rather doth washe away and consume the goodnesse of the ground, then any way adde strength thereunto.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12399:43"/>
barren ground, which by reason of the climat wherein it lyes, is so exceeding sterrile and vnfruitfull that it wil neither beare these seeds nor any other good seed; and of these two soyles onely I purpose in this place to intreate, for with such soiles as will naturally and commodiously beare these seeds, I haue nothing to doe in that I haue sufficiently written of them in mine <hi>English Husbandman,</hi> and <hi>English Huswife,</hi> which are books onely for good grounds, but this for all such grounds as are vtterly held without cure.</p>
               <p>To begin then with the stiffe blacke clay, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, be very rich for Corne, is most poore for these <note place="margin">Blaoke clay for Hempe, &amp;c,</note> seeds, when you would reduce and bring it to beare Hempe or Flaxe, which neare vnto the sea-coaste, is of greater price and commodity then Corne any way can be, especially adioyning vnto any place of fishing, in respect of Nettes and other Engines, which is to be made of the same, and which being daily washed and consumed, must likewise be daily replenished: You must first with astrong plow, fit for the nature of such land, plow vppe so much ground as you intend to sow Hempe or Flaxe vpon, about the middest of May, if the weather be seasonable, and the ground not o hard: if otherwise, you must stay till a shower doe fall, and that the earth be moystened, then shall you hacke it and breake the clottes in small pieces, then with the salt Sea sand, you shall sand it very plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but if that be not to be gotten, and that you be very well assured of the naturall richaesse of the earth, you shall then sand it with the best red sand you can get or find neare vnto you, and vpon euery aker of ground you thus sand with fresh sand, you shall sow three bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shels of Bay-salt, and then plow vp againe the earth,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12399:43"/>
sand and salt together, which would be done about thelatter end of the yeare, as after Michaelmas and so let the ground rest till seed time; at which time you shall first before you plow it, goe downe to the low rockes on which the sea beats, and from thence with dragges and other Engines, gather those broad leaued blacke weeds, which are called Orewood, and grow in great tufcs and abundance about the shoare, and these weeds you shall bring to your Hemp-land, and couer it all ouer with the same, and then you shall plow it againe, burying the weeds within the earth: And herein is to be obserued, that in any wise you must lay these weeds as wet vpon the land, as when you bring them out of the Sea, prouided still that you adde no other wet vnto them but the salt water, for so they are of all soiles or meanures whatsoeuer, the only best and most fruitfullest, and most especially for these seeds, and breed an increase beyond expectation.</p>
               <p>When you haue thus plowed ouer the ground you shall then back it againe, then sow it with either Hemp or Flaxe seed, which you please, and after it is so sown, you shall then harrow it (and not before) and you shall be carefull to harrow it into as fine mould as you can, and this mould is likely to runne fine enough, as well by reason of the fertility, as also of the mixture; yet what clottes you cannot breake with your Harrowes, those you shall breake with your clotting beetles, and such like Tooles, then after the first great shower which shall fall after your sowing, you shall runne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your Land thus sowne with your backe harrowes, that is with a paire of large Harrowes, the wrong side turned vpward, to wit, the teeth turned from the earth, and the backe towards the earth, and if need

be, you shall lay vpon the harrowes some indifferent heauy piece of wood which may keepe the backe of the harrowes closer to the ground, and so goe ouer all the earth, and lay it as smooth and light as is possible, without leauing the smallest clot that may be vnbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>Now if the ground be sowne with Hempe, you <note place="margin">

laying it so smooth as possible you can, vsing the help both of the clotting beetles and all other tooles which may be auaileable for the breaking of the earth, and making the mould as fine as any ashes, then after the first great shower of raine, perceiuing the ground to be well moystned, you shall insteed of the backe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes (which vpon this earth may be to light) take the great rouler which is discribed in the booke of the <hi>English Husbandman,</hi> being a great round peece of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of many squares, drawne either by Horse or Oxen but a single Horse is the best, both in respect of much treading the ground, as also for the swift going away or drawing of the same; for the swifter it is drawne, the better it breaketh the ground, and the lighter it leaueth the mould: and with this Rouler you shall run ouer and smooth your ground very well, leauing no clot vnbroken, and so let it rest.</p>
               <p>As for the weeding of this ground, you shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <note place="margin">Weeding.</note> it at all, for naturally it will put vp no weed, the very ground of it selfe being a very great enemy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, nor shall you need to dresse this ground in the forme beforesaid, aboue once in eight or ten yeeres; onely euery seed-time when you plow it, (as you shall not need to plow it at any time, but seed-time onely) you shall before the plowing, couer or meanure the land with the sea weed before spoken of, which will giue strength enough to the ground, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther assistance.</p>

               <p>The cure or preuention against these kind of fowle, <note place="margin">The cure.</note> when the Corne is going into the ground, is the same formerly shewed for Crowes or Chouges, without altering any circumstance, onely if instead of the bow and arrow, you doe vse a musket, harquebush, or fowling peece, the report or noise where of is more terrible and fearfull, you shall find the profit thereof a great deale more, and that a shot or two of Powder wil saue more Corne, then a whole weekes hooping and showting; onely you must obserue by all meanes that your field-keeper shoot neither bullet nor haileshot, for so he may turne scaring vnto killing, and that may breed vnkindnesse from, and iniury to your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: Now touching the destruction that they make of Corne after it is stackt vp, by tearing of the thatche, and digging hoales and pits therein, you shall obserue that as your Thatcher thatcheth the same, that forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he throw great store of ashes of any kinde, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of wood or coale, vpon the thatch, orinstead of ashes to sprinkle all the thatch ouer with Lyme, that as the foule (whether it be Pygeon, Crow or any other) teareth vp the straw, the lyme or ashes may sparkle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>Now to conclude, for the generall offence of these birds or any other whatsoeuer, if you want ability to maintaine a field-keeper, or thinke his labour might be better imploid in other seruices, then the onely way to rid you of the losse and annoyance, which come by these dcuouring birds, is to take long lynes of pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred, and in them to knit diuers feathers, especially white ones, and with little stakes so to fasten them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Corne you would saue, that with euery breath of winde the feathers may dance, turne and moue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and the nearer that these blinks or strawes come to the ground, when the Corne is new sowne, so much the better it is least the foule finding away to creepe vnderthem, begin not to respect them, so that a hand or two from the ground is sufficient, prouided that the feathers, and scarres haue liberty to play.</p>

Yet it is to be obserued in this rule of wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Of Rye not to be wet.</note> your seed Corne, that by no means you must wet your seed Rye, for it is a graine so warme and tender that it will neither endure cold, wet, nor stiffe ground insomuch that the plowman hath a prouerbe, that Rie wil drownd in the hopper, that is to say, it must neither be sown on wet ground, nor in a wet day, since present shewers are apt to destroy it; lastly, it is thoght that oft plowing of your ground in the wane of the mooneis a very good meanes to destroy wormes, touching that practise which many vse, to gather the wormes from their lands at Sun-rise, &amp; sun-set in bright dewy mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings when the worms coople aboue the earth, I hold it more fit for small gardens then large Corne-fields.</p>

               <p>Now the cure or preuention for these Creatures <note place="margin">The cure.</note> is according to the opinion of some Husband-men to take Wormewood and boyle it well in water, 'till the strength of the Wormwood be gone thereinto, and then with that water in the month of May to sprinckell all your Corne ouer when the Sunne is rising or setting: and not any Grashopper will come neare or anoy the same.

                  </gap>als on corn-fields, is that which proceedeth from blasting, or (as some
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12399:55"/>
call it) planet strooke; This blasting is diuersly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, as proceeding from diuers occasions, as sometimes from the euill aspects of the Starres, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the rotten corruptions of the ayre, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the contagion and infection of the winds, and sometimes from the cuill habits of dewes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pestifferous serenes which fall vpon the earth; of all or any of which, if a man be desirous to read, let him looke into <hi>Plinie,</hi> in the first booke of his naturall history, and he shall finde them set downe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphered at large, with an abstract of all such Stars and Planets as are most propitious and helpfull to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of grain, as it were guarding and defending it from the casuall malladies which doe come from the skie; so that in this place to enter into the large field of so well written a discourse, were much needlesse, and a good mans worke much worse repeated.</p>
               <p>Touching the cure and preuention of those euils <note place="margin">The cure.</note> which happen vnto corne by blasting, they are sundry according to the sundry opinions of husbandmen, yet the best and most approued, are these two onely, of which I meane to write in this place; the first, to take the right or farre horne of an oxe, and mixing it with a good quantity of his dung, adde fire vnto it, so as the horne and dung may make a great smoke or smother, &amp; this do in diuers parts of your corn-field, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or vertue where of, is, that this smoake will purge and dissolue the euill qualities of the ayre and other influences, and reduce them to their proper good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vertue: The second, is to take the boughes or branches of the Bay-tree, and to plant them in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places of the Corne-field, so as they may stand a pretty distance or space aboue the height of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12399:56"/>
standing corne, for it is held a maxime amongst the best husbandmen, that all blastings will fall vpon those boughes and branches, and the corne wil remaine safe and vnstriken or blemished.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude the diseases and infirmities which <note place="margin">Corne reapt wet.</note> happen to corn, whilst it is in the field, there is not any formerly spoken of more dangerous or of vilder qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity then the reaping, mowing or gathering in of corn, wet or too greene, and vnhardened, for such moysture when the corne is either sheaffed vp close together, or stackt or mowed vp, forthwith gathereth heat, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther setteth the corne on fire, or else the moysture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of lesse quantity, and not apt to flame, yet it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth the graine and straw, and breedeth a stinking mouldinesse or rottennesse about it, so that the graine either becomes dung and durt, or at least so stinking and vnsauory that it is good for no vse or purpose as is daily seene where carelesse husbands gather in their graine without respect or gouerment, making the old prouerbe good, that hast euer brings waste.</p>
               <p>The cure and preuention of this euill, is the well <note place="margin">The cure.</note> husbanding and managing of the haruest, as first with a carefull and well iudging eye to looke vpon your corne, and to know by the hanging downeward of the eare (looking as it were backe to the ground) and by the hardnesse of the graine, whether it be rype or no; then to looke into the cleannesse of the corne, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be full of greenes, as grasse, weeds, and such like or cleane of it selfe without any mixture, if you finde there be many weeds mixt with it, then you may reap it so much the sooner, though the kernell be not so well hardned as you would wish, and aboue all things haue a care neuer to sheare corne in the raine or wet,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12399:56"/>
no not so much as with the mornings or euenings dew vpon it, but euen in the heat and brightnesse of the day; then hauing reapt your corne so full of grasse and weeds, you shal by no meanes sheafe it, but sprca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it thin in the Sun, let the grasse wyther all that day, which when you perceiu to change color &amp; grow dry, then bind it vp in sheaffes, and let it lye single a day that the winde and Sunne may get into it, and dry the greenes more sufficiently, then lay it in stuckes of sixe and eight sheafes a piece, and turne the cares so inward that the other bigger ends may defend them from all raine, wet or dew that may fall vpon them; then a day or two after lay them in stoucks of twenty or foure and twenty sheaues a piece, and in those stoucks let them take a sweate, then breake them open in a bright Sunne-shine day, and letting the ayre passe thorow them to dry them, forthwith lead the grain home, and house it or stacke in such sortas was shewed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter, and be sure the graine thus ordered and dryed can neuer take hurt, but if the season of the yere fall out so extraordinariy euil, &amp; ful of wet, that by no meanes you can get your corne dry home (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be seldome seen, yet it is possible to be seen) in this case you must bring it home as well as you can, and hauing your kilne well ordered and bedded, you shall lay as many sheaues thereon, as it can containe, and turning and tossing them ouer a very gentle fire, by slow degrees dry them very perfectly as neare as you can, with no greater a heate then that which the Sunne giueth, and then moow and stacke them vp at your pleasure, for the ayre will sweeten them againe and take all smell of smoake or other annoyance one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserue not to stacke them vp-whilst the fire or

the corne is as seruiceable as any other, onely for seed it will by no meanes serue, both by meanes of the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting which makes the kernell imperfit at both ends, where it should sprout, as also the too much drying thereof, by which it is so much hardened that the ground hath not strengh to resolue it, therefore it is the offence of euery Husbandman when he chuseth his seed corn, to eschew by all meanes this washt corne as a graine that is lost in the earth, and will by no meanes grow.</p>

               <p>But if you find it look whiter at the ends then in any other part of the Corne, and that the whitenesse is blacke and not shining, so that there is a changeable colour in the Corne, then be assured that the Corne is washt, and then by no meanes apt for seede or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12399:59"/>
this is an Arte and skill right good and necessary.</p>
               <p>To proceed then to the keeping and preseruing of <note place="margin">Keeping of corne two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> Corne and Graine, it is to be vnderstood that it is to be done two seuerall waies; that is to say, in the eare and out of the eare, in the Stack when it is ioyned with the Strawe and Chaffe, or in the Garner when it is cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nfed and dressed.</p>
               <p>Touching the keeping of Corne in the Eare or <note place="margin">Keeping corne in the eare or in chaffe.</note> in the Stacke, there is no better or safer way then that already described in the twelfth Chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from all offences whatsoeuer that can come to hurt it.</p>
               <p>Now, there be others that cut off the eares of their Corne, and then put them into great Chests or Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of wood, (such as are very frequent and much in vse in Ireland and other Countries where warre ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth) and so keep it sweet and good many yeares: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vse to beate it out of the Eare, but not separate it from the Chaffe, and then laying a leare of Strawe more then a foote thicke, to lay a good thicke leare of the thresht Corne, then another leare of Staw, and so a leare of thresht Corne, and thus lay leare vpon leare, till you haue made vp your Stacke, in such proportion as you shall thinke conuenient; and this will keepe all kinde of Corne, or Graine, or other seeds, sound, sweet, and fit for any purpose, at least a dozen yeare, or more as some haue supposed, without either too much drying, whithering, moystening or moulding; and sure this is a very excellent way for the storing vp of much Corne in a very little roome, and may as well be done with Corne as with Srtawe; onely it is not to be done in Barne nor House, because Mice, Rats and other kinde of Vermine will worke much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12399:59"/>
thereupon, but on a Stacke or Houell made and proportioned in such forme as was shewed before in the twelfe Chapter, and so it will stand in safe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alannoyance, as long as it shal please the owner to keepe it; sure I am it will last thus fully twelue yeares, yet some Authors affirme it will last fifty yeares, but that is a space of yeares beyond my tryall.</p>
               <p>Touching the keeping of Corne after it is thrasht <note place="margin">Keeping of corne out of the eare or drest.</note> and drest, it is diuers wayes to be done, as by stoage or place of leare, as garners, hutches, and such like: by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and industry, as with the shouel, or else by deuice or medicine.</p>
               <p>For Garners they be made diuers wayes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Of Garners.</note> to the nature of the Country and custome of the people.</p>
               <p>Some are made with clay and lome troden with haire, straw chopt, and such like: but these are the worst and doe soonest corrupt Corne, for although they are warme, which is a great preseruation to Corne, yet they yeeld dust, and from that dust is bred fleas, mytes, weauels, and other vermine which spoyle Corne, and make it easily rot.</p>
               <p>Others are made of stone and lyme, but they are subiect against wet weather, to yeeld fourth a moyst dew which corrupteth and rotteth corne.</p>
               <p>Others are made of bricke and lyme, and they are very good against the weauell and other small ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but the lime is sharpe and so consequently very vnwholesome for all manner of Graine. The best Garner then that can be made to keepe all manner of graine in, is made of plaster burnt &amp; brought into mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so raising it vp with the helpe of small stones hidden and placed in the middest of the wall to make
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12399:60"/>
both the inside and the outside of the Garner of smooth plaster, no stone being seen but hidden at least two fingers thicke on each side, and all the bottome also must be made of plaster for no floore keepeth corne so well, of what kind soeuer it be, and these Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would be placed as neare as you can to the backs or sides of chimneys, or as neare the ayre of the fire as you can conueniently, for as there is nothing more cold then plaster, yet is it euer so dry and free from moysture, that with no change of the ayre or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it relenteth, but keepeth the corne euer in one state of goodnesse, whilst the warme standing thereof is such a comfort in the Winter, and the naturall cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the thing so soueraigne in Sommer that the graine euer abideth in one state without alteration.</p>
               <p>Now for hutches or great chests, byngs, dry-fats <note place="margin">Of hutches.</note> and such like, they are made of old dry and well seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned oake-bords, plained smooth and close ioyned and glewed together, with couers and lids made also very close whereby little or no ayre can come in; Some of these great byngs or hutches made of dry boards are made open and without couers, but they are not so good for the ayre cooling the vpper part of the corne, and the middle part sweating, breedeth corruption, or mustinesse, which hurteth and spoileth the corne; besides they are somewhat too warme, and thereby make any greene corne apt to corrupt and smell.</p>
               <p>Touching the vse of Garners and Hutches, they are <note place="margin">The vse of Garners and hutches for malt,</note> principally to keepe malt after it is dryed, or Barley which is for the vse of bread or meale; &amp; here is to be noted that the best maner of keeping malt, is to keepe it in the come, that is to say in the dust and other filth which commeth with it from the kilne, as thus, when
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12399:60"/>
first you lay your malt on the kilne to be dryed you know there is at one end a certaine sprout or small trids which growes from the corne, and is called the come, which by the rubbing and drying of the malt falles away and leaues the corne cleane and snugge of it selfe, and when you trim and dresse vp your malt for the mill, is windowed and cleansed away; this you shall preserue and put altogether into your garner or hutch, which will so mellow and ripen your malt, that in the spending thereof a pecke will goe further then a pecke and a halfe kept of a contrary fashion, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some are perswaded that this come or malt dust, is a great breeder of the worme or weeuell, by reason of the much heate thereof, being indeed of the purest of the hart of the corne; yet it is not so vnlesse some danknesse or moysture do get to the corne, and then it breeds weeuels in infinite abundance, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by all meanes be sure that your garners and hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do stand exceeding dry, and then there is no feare of the losse of corne, nor shall you need to dresse or window your malt but as you spend it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, here is to be noted, that although I heare ioyne garners, hutches, chests and byngs together, yet I make them not all of equall goodnes, for the plaster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garner is absolutely the best of all, the close hutch or chest next, and the open bing last; yet any or all suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enough to keepe malt, barley, or small seeds, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers yeares without imperfection.</p>
               <p>It is written by some of the ancientest Authors that wheat hath been kept in these close hutches or chests sweet, the space of fifty yeres, yet I hold the rule some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfull, both because wheat of it selfe lying so close packt together, is apt to heat and sweat, and that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12399:61"/>
heat commonly turneth to faughtinesse, and the sweat to corruption; but that it may thus be preserued from wormes, weauels, mytes and other vermine, breeding in corne: it is doubtlesse and infallible, there be other husbandmen, which for the preseruation of their corne, take a land Toade and tye it fast by the hinder leg, and hang it before the dore or entrance of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and by the vertue thereof, suppose that no hurt can come to their corne; tye venome of the best, as it were drawing away all other venome or euill that may come to the corne; many other experiments there are, but none so certaine as these, and therefore these for malt or barley, shall suffice in this place.</p>
               <p>Now for the preseruation of wheat, which is the <note place="margin">To preserue wheat.</note> most principall graine, of greatest vse, and greatest price, and therewithall most tender, and aptest to take hurt: the experiments are diuers as mens fancies and practises haue found out, for some husbandmen hold opinion, especially the French and Spanish, that if you take the lees of common oyle (so it be sweet) and sprinkle it vpon your wheate as it lyes, either in the garner or vpon the floore that it will preserue it from all corruption and annoyance whatsoeuer, not doth it saue wheat only, but all other manner of graine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer; nor doth preserue corne alone from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, but if corne by casualty be tainted or hurt, it doth recouer it againe and brings it to the first sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and if either wormes or weauels be bred in it, the oyle presently kils them, and makes the corne free from that mischiefe: as for smaller feeds as hemp, lyne and rape, this oyle doth not onely keepe them long and sound, but also feeds &amp; nourishes them, and makes them better, either for the ground, or for vse

either in the mill or in medecine, there be others that vse to take chalke, and beat it to pouder, and then scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it amongst their wheat, when they put it into the garner, and haue found that thereby their graine hath been wonderfully preserued from all imperfection and surely there is great reason for the same, because the drynesse of the chalke drinketh vp the moisture which sweateth from the graine, and is the first breeder of all putrifaction: also it cooleth and asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the immoderate heate which is ingendred in the Corne by reason of the packe and close lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

               <p>Againe, I haue for mine owne part seene in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of the Axores, which lie lowest from Spain (and it is a great practisealso in Spaine) certaine very great and large caues or pits made vnder the earth, of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of a Spanish earthen Iarre, that is to say,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12399:62"/>
great and spacious in the midst, and narrow both at the top and bottome, like a brasse pot or great glasse viall, and made as smooth within as may be, &amp; in these caues or pits, they first lay chasse, and then their thrasht wheat filling it vp full to the top, or within a handfull thereof, which they fill againe with chaffe, and then closing the top with a broad stone, they couer it ouer with earth so close and vnperceiueable, that you may walke or trauell ouer it without any suspition; and for mine owne part, I haue my selfe digged vp many of these pits, and found great store of wheate, both in the high wayes, and other most in suspicious places, and surely it is thought, and experience in those places makes it good that in these caues or pits you may keep wheat as long if you please as <hi>Plinie</hi> speaketh of, which is an hundred or an hundred and twenty yeares with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurt or putrefaction either of heate, moysture, wormes, weauels or any other vermine whatsoeuer which consumeth or deuoureth Corne; yet how I may recommend this experiment to our nation I am vncertaine, because the much moysture of our climat, and the cold rawnesse thereof promisseth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect for the great enemies vnto graine, are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent cold and moysture, and with vs it is very difficult to make any cauerns vnder the earth but they must bee subiect; vnto both; therefore onely to those which liue in hot sandy countreys high and free from springs or waters, or in dry and rocky grounds, where these mines or hollow places may be hewed out, as in a maine and firme quarry, I recommend the tryall of this practise, with this assurance, that where the ground is fit for this purpose, as in any of your sand grounds or grauelly earthes, as in Norfolke,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12399:62"/>
Middlesexe, Kent, and many other sandy climats; or in rocky situations as in Nottingham, Bathe, Bristol, and such like, you may keep your wheat, good, sound, firme and free from all annoyances, euen as long as you shall please to keep it, both without putrifaction in it self, or waste made by other deuoring worms &amp; vermin: but if in a more moyst place, as in a clay or other mixt earth which euer is vomiting wet and dewish humours, you are forced to approue this experiment: then you must necessarily lime all your caue or hallow mine within, at least halfe a foot thicke with tyle shred and plaster laid wall-like together, and then the plaster dawbde at least three fingers thicke aboue all, and so you may keepe your corne as safe and as sound as in any hot soile whatsoeuer, but without it your corne will not indure a weeke without rottennesse, faughtinesse, mouldinesse and stinking. To conclude, hauing shewed you all the most approued &amp; best experiments, for the keeping and preferuing of wheat, there is not any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or so good as this last poore silly plaine one, which I will heare deliuer; &amp; that is, first (as neere as you can) reape your wheat at the change of the Moone, for wheat which is so reaped, is sedome or neuer subiect to losse or putrifaction (being gotten dry and in hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandly maner ordred &amp; handled) because that celestial body hath such a power and influence in the growth of corne and seeds, that as she groweth, so they grow, and as she waneth, so they abate and wither, and truely for mine owne part in my poore husbandry, I haue made this obseruation, that I haue reaped corne at the beginning of the wane (to mine eye and iudgement) great, full and bold, (as the Plowman cals it) and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few dayes after when it came to thrashing, I haue

for this stirring and moouing of graine, is not a drying of it, but rather a great comforter and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thener of it dispersing backe into the Corne, those wholesome vapours which should doe it good (by way of communication and fellowship with the Graine) and expelling those ill humours which swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of it would otherwise confound and hurt it, so that in conclusion for the true and long keeping of wheat, sweet, sound and perfit without losse or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, there is no way more safe or easie then this last expressed, being of all other the best, although in shew it appeare sleight and triuiall, as for the most part things of greatest moment in this nature doe; but to the iudiciall Husbandman I referrc it, whose ayme is at the worth and substance not at the words and curious glosse, set foorth in strange ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>

together, but put forth their increase one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for you shall see vpon one Stake, bloomes, swads, and ripe cods; so likewise in the gathering of Pulse (when it is reaped from the ground) you shall see some dry and withered, some ripe, some halfe ripe, some absolutely greene, and as but new in growing.</p>
               <p>Now all these must be reapt together, and if you stay them in the field till all be of like drinesse, questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse the oldest will shake &amp; shed vpon the ground before the yongest be ripned, and what that losse will redound to, euery husbandman can iudge; so also to howse and moow vp in closse moow, the dry pulse with the greene, surely the greene cannot chuse but inflame and heat the dry, and the dry so heated, giue fire to the greene till both be either rotted or consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and hence it came, that expert husbandmen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised to lay their pulse for the most part euer without dores in Stacks, Reeks and Houels, that the Sun and wind passing thorow them might bring all the graine to an equall drinesse and hardnesse.</p>
               <p>Againe, Pulse being of all Graine the coursest and fullest of substance in it selfe, and the Straw euer big and substantiall, and full of broad thicke leaues euer moyst and sappy; it must needs follow that this Graine must euer be most apt to sweat in the moow, and so necessarily craueth the greatest store of ayre, and the longest time in drying; so that to returne to my first purpose, it must needs follow, that no Beanes or Pease can be fully ripe or seasoned in the moow, til it be mid March at the least; for it is an old saying amongst the best husbands, <hi>I hat March wind is a salt which seasoneth all Pulse:</hi> And if vse or necessity compell men to thrash their Pulse before that time the graine is so imperfect,

that of force it must be kilne dried, or els it is fit nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the vse of bread nor prouender.</p>
               <p>Now herein is to be vnderstood that Pease or Beanes which are kiln dried may be kept sound, sweet and good, either on plaster floores, boarded floores, or earthy floores, the space of many yeares without turning or tossing; nor need you to respect how thick the heape lye, since Beanes after they are once dried on the kilne, or in the Sunne, neuer after will thawe, giue againe or relent, butremaine in their first sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But if you preserue your Beanes for other vses, as to boyle in your pot and feed your seruants withal, as is vsed in Somersetshire, and many other Westerly parts of this Kingdome, then it shall be good for you to take oyle Barrels, oyle Caske that is sweet, and first chalke them all ouer within and without with ashes, and then put your Beanes therein, and close vp the heads, and as it is affirmed by diuers great Authors of Husbandry, it will keepe Beanes sound, sweet, and good, twenty yeares: nay, some giue instances of Beanes which haue bene thus kept and preserued the space of one hundred and twenty yeares; and surely I am perswaded that if Beanes be well and dry got, and thrasht at a seasonable time of the yeare, as in March or Aprill, that then thus kept, they will last the vttermost of a mans pleasure.</p>

               <p>And herein is to be noted, that as Pease are of more generall vse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And first there is nothing better for the long and well keeping of Peasse, then the very well dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, either in the Sunne or on the kilne, especially those which you vse for bread, prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or feeding of Swine, and although some Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands vse to feed their Swine with vndryed pease, nay many times both vndryed and vndrest, that is to say the pulse or chaffe not taken away, and are of opinion that the Graine so giuen sooner fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and puffeth vp Swine then the other, yet they are deceiued; for albeit it swel and puffe vp a beast, yet is the flesh and fatte neither so good sound and long lasting, as that which is gotten with dry foode, nor
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:12399:66"/>
doth it make a Swine so thirsty, and the Husbandman is euer assured that when his Swine drinks not well, he feeds not well; therefore what Pease you keepe for bread or feeding of Cattle, by all meanes dry them well, and lay them either in Garners or Floores, and they wil last sound and good without breeding worms or weauils, as long time as you please. But those which you keepe for foode at your owne table, as in pottage, or other vses, which must by no means be two much dryed, because then they aske a double time in boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and spend a double quantity of fuell in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring. Some vse after they be cleane thrasht and drest to lay them in a coole close Garnor, either of Plaster, earth or boards, of which, Plaster is the best; as for any thing that relenteth or yeeldeth moysture, as Lime, stone walles, or such like, it is most hurtful, and immediatly maketh pease mould and rot: also it is good to lay your pease in thicke heapes in you garner, for that will preserue them moyst the longest time, but to spread them thin vpon the floore by which meanes the Sunne, Ayre, and Winde may passe thorow them is not so good, for it drieth them too so are, and taketh from them much of their sweetnesse and goodnesse, which ought most carefully to be preserued. There be others which preserue these tender meat Pease by thrashing them vp, and then letting them lye in their owne pulsse or chaffe, and not dressing them but as they haue occasion to vse them, and questionlesse this is a very good &amp; laudable way, for the pulsse or chaffe doth mainetaine th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12399:66"/>
by all meanes you must let them lie vpon a dry earth floare, so long as they are in the chaffe, rather then on the boards or on plaster, and yet in this case the boards are better then plaster.</p>
               <p>Lastly, and which indeed is the best experiment of all other, if you intend to keepe Pease any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary long time, you shall take Barrels or dry Caske, wel and strongly bound, and pitch them within excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well, with the best pitch or bytumen that you can get, and then sprinkle the pitch al ouer with strong vinegar; then take your Pease, being cleane and well drest, and put them into the Barrels, pressing them downe closse and hard, then head vp the Barrels, and let them stand dry and coole, and they will preserue your Pease sonnd, sweet and good for any vse whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer as long as you please, be it for ten, twenty, or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares, according to the opinions of ancient Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen and other prouant masters that haue liued and commanded in townes besieged, and townes of Garrison; neither shall any worme, mite or weauell, euer breed in it or offend it, nay if any haue in former time been bred in them, this manner of keeping the Graine, killeth them and destroyeth them for euer.</p>
               <p>Now there is another sort of Pulse which are called <note place="margin">Preseruing of Lentils or Lupins.</note> Lentils or Lupins, which albeit they are not so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vsed for the food or sustenance of man, yet they are for horse, swine, and other cattell as much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest as any Graine whatsoeuer, and indeed doe feed fatter and sooner then other ordinary Pulse, and the flesh so fed is sweeter and pleasanter both to the eye and to the taste, then that which is fed with Beanes or Pease; also they are a Pulse very Physical and good for many; medicines, as may appeare by the workes of

many learned Phisitians; &amp; these the longer they are kept, the better they are, and fuller of profit. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue them then in good and sound estate, it is meet to reape them in very faire weather, and to Stacke them vp exceeding dry, &amp; if they be laid in the Barne, or any close house, it is not amisse, for they wil endure houssing better then any other pulse, yet the sooner you beat them out of the straw or thrash them vp, the better it is, for husbandmen suppose there is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hurt to this kind of Graine, then the long keeping it in the straw, for it is of such ranknesse, that the very straw and cods breed in it much putrifaction; and I my selse obserued both in Spaine and in the neighbor Islands, where is great abundance of this kind of graine, that they do no sooner gather it and bring it home, but immediatly they thrash it; nay, some thrash it in the fields vpon the lands where it growes, and so bring it home, then spread it on faire boarded floores in very great heapes, or else lay it vp in close hutches, or bings, such as wheate and other white graine is to be kept in: If you dry this kind of Pulse in the Sun, or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a kilne, with a very moderate and soft fire, and then lay it vp either in close garner, or close hutch, it will last many yeare sound, good, and without corruption; there be other husbandmen which mixe with this graine when it is thrasht, a halfe part of hot, dry, white sand, or at least couer the whole heape of Pulse with the sand, and do find that it keepes the graine very sound &amp; good many yeres together.

               <p>And here is also to be noted, that you should not presently assoon as your meale is ground, boult it from the bran, but rather let it lye a weeke or fortnight, in the branne in some closse bing or trough, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time boult or searse it, and you shall find it to afford you in euery bushell, more meale by at least halfe a pecke then if you should boult it presently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as it comes from the mylne, whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, that the cunning and skilfull Baker will euer haue a week or a fortnights prouision of meale before hand, which lying so long in the branne, paies double interest for the continuance.</p>
               <p>Now if it fall out so, that either by trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, or other occasion, you buy any meale by way of transsportation which is caskt vp (as much meale is should by the barrell) you shall then presently as soone as you haue bought it (if it be for your owne vse or expence) breake open the heads and empty the meale vpon faire sheets on a cleane floore, and then spreading it abroad, let the Sunne and Aire passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it which will dry vp the sweat, and if there be any taint or faughtinesse, take it away, and bring the meale to his first sweetnesse, and then immediatly boult out the course branne, and after as was before declared, tread it hard into freesh and sweet caske: and thus you may keepe your prouision of meale all the yere long;

               <p>It is to be vnderstood that the best and principallest Graine which is indeede both most sweete, most fresh, most pleasant in taste, and most long lasting, is Ryce, which although it grow not much in our <note place="margin">Of Rice, and the vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

at Sea, wholesome, good, and light of disiesture, and will be as much as foure reasonable men can well eate at a meale; for the nature of the Rice is such that it will swell in boyling and grow to that bignesse, that in an instant it will thicken a pottle; some vse the night before they boyle it, to steepe it in so much water as will onely couer the Rice all ouer, and then the next day boyle it in a pottle of water more, and the Rice so steeped will so swell, that all the first water will be drunke vp, and a great deale of lesse boyling will serue to make it ready, and sure then this a man cannot finde a cheaper way to feed men, since one pint of water and the fourth part of a quarter of a pound of Rice (which comes not to aboue a halfe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at the dearest reckoning) is a meele sufficient for a mans eating, hauing bisket and drinke proportionably. And this dish of meate being but thus thinne boyled, is called at Sea Lob-lolly, and after salt-feeding is wondrous wholsome and comfortable to any man, whether he be sicke, sound, or diseased, and both aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth infirmities &amp; hastneth the healing of all wounds. There be others that after they haue steeped this rice (as aforesaid) doe then boyle it in like manner, till it be so thick that a spoone may stand vpright in it, and no liquidnesse of the water perceiued, then put a good lumpe of butter into it, and boyle it with it, and stirre it about, and it wil make it come most clean out of the pot in which it is boyled; then season it with suger and a little Cynamon &amp; it wil be a dish of meat, right good and delicate, and meete for any man of what quallity soeuer, that is worth goodnes or preseruing, nor need the quantity exceed the proportion already descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Againe, if you haue meale in the Ship, if you
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12399:71"/>
take of this Rice steeped in water, and a little lightly boyled and seasoned with Suger, Cinamon and Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and a good quantity of butter, and then bake it in litle Bastics, you shal find it a most delicat, pleasant, and wholesome meat, and that a penny in it shall goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and giue better contentment then foure peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth of Beese, Bacon, Fish, or any other hard salt meat; yet do not wish any man on Shipboard to make this a continual feeding dish, for it is both too pleasant and too strong, and where cuacuation of some humors are wanting, may breede inconuenience in strong bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but rather to vse it once a weeke as a physicall nourisher, or for the comfort of sicke and diseased men, whose stomackes are tane away or else weakned; there may be also made of this Ryce in time of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitic (being ground to a fine mcale) an excellent good Bread or Ruske, which is pleasanter, sweeter and much longer lasting then any made of Wheate or any other graine, whatsoeuer, besides many other secdes which would in this place shew but too much curiosity to repeate.</p>
               <p>The next Graine vnto Rice which is of estimation <note place="margin">Wheate and the vse.</note> and great seruice at the Sea, is Wheate, of which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be diuers kinds; yet they are all alike for the sertling of this purpose; onely the large and thick huld Wheat (being well dryed) will last the longest, but the smaller and fine skinde Wheate, yeeldes the purer slowre and makes the better meate. Now of this wheat is to be made diuers dishes of meat, for some doe take it and bruse or beat it in a bagge, till the vpper skinne be beaten off, and then hauing drest and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed it, boyle it in cleane water till it burst and grow as thick as pap, then take it from the fire and being hot
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12399:71"/>
put it into seuerall dishes of wood or traies, so much in euery dish or tray as may serue foure men, and so let it coole; then giue it to the sicke or sound, as you shall be directed, and it is an excellent wholesom good meat either cold or els hot, and a little butter melted with it or being againe boild in fresh water, and seasoned with salt and a little suger, it makes an excellent grewell, or lob-lolly which is very soueraigne at Sea; also your parcht wheat is a very good food at Sea, and of much request &amp; estimation, being sprinkled with a little salt, and of this foode a little will serue a man at a time, by reason that the much sweetnesse thereof, soone silleth and cloieth the stomack, yet it is wondrous light of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion &amp; breeds great strength and much good bloud as we dayly finde by experience.</p>
               <p>The next Graine vnto this which is to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <note place="margin">Of Oate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale and the vse.</note> to the Sea (and which is indeed not any thing inseriour to either of the other going before, both for strength and lasting) is Otemeale, which by reason of the great drynesse and drying thereof feeles little or no imperfection at the Sea, as being vnapt to sucke or draw in any of the ill or moyst vapours thereof. Of this Oatemeale is made many good, fresh and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meats at Sea, as Grewell or loblolly by boyling it in fresh water and seasoning it with salt, and (if you haue it conueuiently) sometimes with suger and a few currants, and a little mace, which is meate of great strength and goodnesse; especially for such as are sick and weake, for it is a great restorer of nature and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the blood; also to stecpe the whole Grotts of Oatmeale a night in water, and then draining them, &amp; putting it vnto a bag boile it til the grotts break, then putting it out of the bag butter it with butter, &amp; it is an
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12399:72"/>
excellent foode; also boyling Oatmeale in fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with barme, or the dregges and hinder ends of your Beere barrels, makes an excellent good pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and is of great vse in all the parts of the West Countrie, especially, where Marryners or Sea-men liue, and are called by the name of drousson pottage. Also of Oatemeale is made that meate which is called in the West, Washbrew, and may be made at the Sea at you pleasure, being a meate of that great account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Deuonshire and Cornishmen, that they will allow it no paralell; and for my owne part I haue heard a most famous &amp; well learned Phisition in those parts allow it to be a meate of singular great strength, and goodnesse, and withall so light of disiestion, that a man can very hardly surfeit vpon it at any time; and I am the rather induced to beleeue the same, because I haue obserued and seene many of the laboring men of that Countrey to eate such an vnmeasurable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity thereof, that in mine eye one mans supper would haue serued a whole family.</p>
               <p>But you will say, hunger and labour, are such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sawces that they will disgest any thing: To that I answere, that I haue seene the best Gentlemen and Gentlewomen of that Countrey, of whom as much curiositie hath attended, as is lyable to the City, nay such as haue had sicknesse their best familiar, yet eate of this with great and sharpe appetite, and when health was most to be feared, then to boast of most soundnes: This washbrew is to looke vpon like Painters cyze, or new made Ielly, being nothing but the very heart of the oatmeale boyled and drayned to that height and thicknesse hauing neither hull nor branne in it but the pure meale and water, and it is to be eaten either with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12399:72"/>
wine, strong beare, orale, or with fine clarified hony, according to mens stomacks or abilities: Now this the eaters therof affirm, that by no means it must be chaw'd but rather swallowed by the spoonfuls whole because chawing like a pil makes it taste vnpleasantly; There is againe another meat to be made of oatmeale, which is called Gertbrew, and is somewhat more course, and lesse pleasant then wash-brew, hauing both the branne and huls in it, yet is accounted a food of a very good strength, and exceeding wholesome for mans body, and of my knowledge much vsed and much desired of all labouring persons that are acquainted with it, many other foods there are to be made of oatemeale, but these shall be at this time fully sufficient.</p>
               <p>The next graine to this I account Barley, which may <note place="margin">Of Barley and the vse.</note> be euery way vsed like vnto Wheate, either to make Grewell, to be creyed, parcht, or boyled; and of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley for this purpyse of food, the best is French Barley, the next is barley byg, or beare barley, and the worst are the spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And as Barley or Wheate, so you may vse you Buck <note place="margin">Bucke or the vse.</note> and your Indian <hi>Silligo,</hi> for they are of like nature, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aske a longer time in their beating, steeping, and boyling, because they are naturally more hard, &amp; more dry, by reason of the heate of the climat in which the best grow; and it is euer to be obserued for a rule, that the dryer you keepe your corne at Sea, the better it is, the sweeter and longer lasting.</p>
               <p>Now hauing shewed the vse of these lighter graines <note place="margin">Of Pulse and first of Beanes, the vse.</note> I will come to Pulse, and shew their vse and benefit at the Sea, or in besieged townes; and of Pulse, I will first speake of Beanes as a principall food, wholesome and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12399:73"/>
strong, and though not so fine and light of digestion as any of the former, yet exceeding harty and sound &amp; a great breeder of good bloud, they are for the most part to be boyled whole, till such time as they apeare soft and tender, or begin to breake, and then drained from the water, are serued in traies, and well salted and so eaten; a pottell whereof is thought a full proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for foure men; and of these Beanes there are diuers <note place="margin">The French Beane.</note> kinds: as the common garden Beane, or French beane, which is great, broad, and flat, and these are the best to boyle, either with meat, or by themselues, and aske the least labour, because their outer skinne is most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the inward substance most apt to be mollified, and softned: they may also be boiled both when they are yong and greene, and when they are old and dry, and the meat at both times is good and sauory.</p>
               <p>The next bean to these are the Kidney beane, which <note place="margin">The Kydney Beane.</note> is flatter, and lesser, and neerer the proportion of a kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney then the French Beane is, and this is also a garden beane, and whilest it is young &amp; green is to be eaten sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let wise after they are boild, both the cod and beane together, and it is certaine a better sallet cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted; for the cod or huske is euery way as excelent in taste as the beane is; but after they grow olde and dry and that the moisture is gone out of the cod, then it is meete to thrash them, and then boyle them like the French beane, and they are euery way as good meat and as soone boyld and as tender.</p>
               <p>The next Beane to these are your common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <note place="margin">Common Field beanes thevse.</note> Field beanes, which hauing tough and hard skins aske more boiling then the other beanes, &amp; are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what harder in taste, yet a good souud food also: there be many that parche them in the fire and thinke them

               <p>After this great sort of Pulse, I will speake of the <note place="margin">Of Pease and the vse.</note> smaller sort as Pease and their like: and of Pease there betwo kinds, the garden Pease and the field Pease, and for this vse (albeit both are good) yet the garden Pease are best, for they are soonest boyld, are most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and serue for most vse, as for pottage, boiling, parching or spelting; and of these garden Pease, there are diuers kinds; as white Pease, French Pease. hastings rounsiuals and such like; the first being the longest <note place="margin">Seueral sorts of garden Pease.</note> lasters, the second the pleasantest in taste, the third the earlyest and tenderest, and the last largest and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest.</p>
               <p>The field Pease are onely of two kinds, as the white Pease and the gray Pease, and they seldome make pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, because they are vnapt to breake, but are onely for boyling and making of leape Pease, or for pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, yet a good and a strong food also, and as we vse Pease, so in other countreyes they vse Lupins, Lentils, Tares, Fetches, and such like smaller Pulse, but they are neither so good, wholesome nor sauoury in taste, being a kind of Graine more ranke, fulsome and breeding of ill blood and infection within, these cases of Seafare and warrefare ought principally to be eschwed and shunned.</p>
               <p>Now it resteth after this long digression of these <note place="margin">Totransport Graine.</note> seuerall Graines, and their vses with the meates and profits which are made from them, that we come to the safe manner of keeping and preserning them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by land or water, for victuall or transportation, so as they may last &amp; indure without ill smel or rottennes.</p>

And first for transportation of Graine by Sea, it is two wayes to be done, as either in great quantities for trade and the victualing of other Nations, or in smaller quantitie for victualling the men in the ship, prepared for a long and tedious voyage.</p>
               <p>For the transporting of Graine for trade in great quantitics, it is to be intended the voyage is seldome <note place="margin">Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting graine for trade.</note> long, but from neighbour to neighbour, and therefore commonly they make closse decks in the ships to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receiue the Graine, faire and euen boarded, yet if such decks be matted and lined both vnder and on each side it is much the better, and this matting would be strong and thinne; there be some which make the decks one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of mats, and sure it is sweet but not so strong as the board, therefore the best way of transportation is to haue strong boarded decks wel matted, and then sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Corne of a reasonable thicknesse, to couer it with matting againe, and then to lay Corne on it again, and then mats againe, that betweene euery reasonable thicknesse of Graine a mat may lye, the profit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is that when the Corne with his owne heat and the working of the Sea shall begin to sweat; which sweat for want of ayre to dry it vp would turne to putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then these mats thus lying betweene, will not only exhall and sucke vp the sweat, but also keep the Corne so coole and dry that no imperfection shall come vnto it, and here is to be noted that these mats should rather be made of dry white bents, then of flags and bul-rush, for the bent is a firm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Now for transporting of Graine for victuall for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12399:74"/>
the ship which is in much smaller quantity, because it <note place="margin">Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting graine for victuall.</note> is but for the priuate vse offew within the ship; the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly best and safest way is to take salt fish barrels, or any caske in which any salt fish hath beene piled, as Cod, Herrings, Salmon, Sprats, or any other poudred fish; and whilst the vessels are sweet you shall calke them both within and without with plaster, daubing them all ouer, then into them put your Graine of what kind soeuer it be, and head them vp closse, and then stow them in such conuenient dry place of the ship as you shall thinke fit, and questionlesse, if beliefe may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the worthiest Authors which haue writ in this kinde, you may thus keepe your Graine sweet, sound, and in full perfection from one yeare to one hundred and twenty yeares, but certainely daily experience shewes vs, that all kinde of graine thus put vp and kept, will remaine sound and sweet, three, foure, and as some say, seuen yeares, for so farre hath lately beene tryed: and what here I speake of Ship-board, the like maybe done in any towne of Warre or Garrison, whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged or not besieged, or in any other place where any necessity shall compell; the proofe of this manner of piling or putting vp of graine, serueth as well for Land as Sea.</p>

               <p>Now for the particular labours of cattell, though it <note place="margin">Particular labours of cattell.</note> be already inclusiuely spoken of in that which is gone before, where I shew you how much a man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently plow in a day with one Teame or draught of cattell, yet for further satisfaction, you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that in your cattell, there are many things to be obserued, as the kind, the number &amp; the soile they labor in, for the kind which are Oxen, buls, or horses, the best for the draught, are Oxen, &amp; the reasons I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my former workes, the next are Horses, and the

worst Bulles, because they are most troublesome; the number fit for the plow is eight, sixe, or foure; for the Cart, fiue or foure, and for the Weine neuer vnder sixe, except in loading home of haruest, where loading easily, foure very good oxen are sufficient, for the soile of it be of the toughest and deepest earth, eight beasts can doe no more but fallow, or breake vp Pease earth, no nor sooner surre, if the season grow hard and dry, for soyling; winter rigging, and seed furrow, sixe beasts may dispatch that labour: if the soile be mixt and haffel, then sixe may fallow and sow Pease, and foure doe euery other ordure; but if it be light and easie sand, then foure is enow in euery season; for the quantity of their worke, an oxe plow may not doe so much as a horse plow, because they are not so swift, nor may be driuen out of their pace, being more apt to surfeit then horses be, so that for an oxe plow to do an aker, and a horse plow an aker and a rood, or an aker and a halfe in good ground is worke fully sufficient.

as the earth, the ayre, the much or little heat, moisture or cold doth increase or diminish, so must the skilful husbandman alter his seasons, labours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments; for in stiffe clayes, as are all the fruitfull Vales of this kingdome (of which I haue named most part in a Chapter before, as also Huntington-shire, Bedford-shire, Cambridge-shire, and many other of like nature, all manner of errable workes must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at early seasons, and betimes in the yeare, and the plowes and instruments must be of large size &amp; strong timbers, and the labour great and painfull; so also in mixt soiles that are good and fruitful, as Norhampton shire, Hartfortshire, most part of Kent, Essex, Barkshire and countries of like nature; all errable toyles would begin at latter seasons, and the plowes and instruments, would be of middle size and indifferent timbers, and the labour somewhat lesse then the other, but the light sandy grounds which haue also a certaine natural fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes in them, as in Norfolke, Suffolke, most part of Lincolneshire, Hampshire, Surry and countries of that nature, all errable toiles would begin at the latest sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and the plowes and instruments would be of the smallest and lightest size, and of the least timbers, and the labour of all other is most easie.</p>
               <p>Lastly, for the barren and vnfruitfull carthes (of which onely I haue written of in this booke) as is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonshire, Cornwall, many parts of Wales, Darbyshire Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkeshire, and many other like or worse then they; the errable toiles would haue certaine set time or sit season of the yeare, but onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the temperatnes of the yere, which if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen early, then you must begin your labors early, but if it fall lower in the yeere, then you must begin your

               <p>And hence it comes that the office and duty of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">The Carters office.</note> skilfull plowman or Carter, is first to looke to the nature of the earth, next to the seasons of the yere, then to the customes and fashions of the place wherein hee liueth: which customes although they be held as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond natures amongst vs, and that the best reasons of the best workemen commonly are, that thus I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thus they doe; yet would I wish no man to binde himselfe more strictly to custom, then the discourse of reason shal be his warrant, and as I would not haue him to preiudicat in his owne opinion, so I would not haue him too great a slaue to other mens traditions, but star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the ground of reason made good by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I would euer haue him profit in his owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12399:80"/>
shewed how he shall lay his furrowes, what depth he shall plow them, and how he shalbe able to raise and gaine the greatest store of mould, yet is there also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consideration to be had, no lesse profitable to the husbandman, then any of the former, and that is how to lay your lands best for your own profit &amp; ease, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the ease of your cattel, which shal draw within your draught, as thus for instance: if your erable land shall lie against the srde of any steepe or mountainous high hill (as for the most part all barren earthes do) if then you shall plow such land directly against the hill, beginning below, and so ascending straight vpright and so downe againe, and vp againe; this very labour and toyling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the hill wilbreed such a bitter wearisomnesse to the cattell, and such a discouragement, that you shal not be able to compasse one halfe part of your labour; besides, the danger of ouer-heating and surfetting of your beasts, whence will spring many mortal diseases. Therefore when you shal plow any such ground, be sure euer to plow it side-wayes ouerthwart the hil, where your beasts may euer tread on the leuel ground and neuer directly vp and downe, so shal your cattel be better able to endure the draught, and you with much case and comfort be able to compasse and finish your labors, Besides the compasse and meanure which you shall lay vpon the ground shall not be so soone washt away from the top or vpper part of the ground, because the furrowes not lying straight downe in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and direct discent, but turned crosse-wise vpward against the hil, it must necessarily hold the soyle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, and not let it wash away as it were through libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall channels, as I haue oft seene in diuers places where the corne hath been as ranke as might be at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
