            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Most Reverend Father in God, GILBERT, By Divine Providence, LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, HIS GRACE, Primate of all <hi>England,</hi> and Metropolitan, And One of His MAJESTIES most HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCIL.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it please Your <hi>GRACE,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is the Second Volume of that most Renowned Prelat's Sermons, Dr. <hi>Ralph Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig,</hi> sometimes Lord Bishop of <hi>Exeter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First,</hi> I had the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Honour to present to my Dread, and Dearest Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, King <hi>Charles the Second;</hi> Who was graciously pleased to condescend so low, as to receive it from me into His most Sacred Hands, while I was upon my knees before Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104362:4"/>This <hi>Second,</hi> I take the boldness to tender to Your <hi>Graces</hi> Acceptation; being confident, (with an assurance that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains to hope) that as the Former from that High and Mighty Monarch, the Father of the Country, so this Latter from You, the Great Metropolitan, and Father of the Church, will find a most ready, and welcome Entertainment.</p>
            <p>That, I styled the <hi>Sword of Goliah;</hi> by the help whereof (through the Blessing of Him, who is the <hi>Captain of our Salvation)</hi> the Christian Souldier may prove truly victorious and triumphant over that great <hi>Goliah</hi> of Hell, and all his accursed Agents and Adherents.</p>
            <p>This, I will call the <hi>Dagger of Ehud.</hi> For as that, <hi>Judg. iii. let the dirt out of the belly of Eglon;</hi> so will this, (if skilfully wielded, and with resolution, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage) that filthy Corruption <hi>(Satanae Excrementum)</hi> out of the Heart, with which it naturally abounds, as the Sea with Mire and Dirt.</p>
            <p>To Your <hi>Grace</hi> then, I humbly solicite, I may present, both the <hi>Person,</hi> and the <hi>Sermons</hi> of that good, and great <hi>Bishop.</hi> His <hi>Person</hi> to Your Memory; His <hi>Sermons</hi> to Your Eye, and Perusal.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Person,</hi> who was the Composer, I may not, I must not, pass over in silence; something I must say of Him: Not that thereby I can add so much as the least dram of real worth to Him; no more, then a curious Picture can Beauty, to that Face which it represents: But that thereby (according to my narrow measure) I may set forth, and declare to others that which was before. Which, whilst I shall endeavour to do, I beseech Your <hi>Grace,</hi> that that of <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> to his <hi>Antoninus</hi> may be remembred; <hi>Pictores pulchram, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutamque faciem, raro nisi in pejus effingunt;</hi> An exact face is very seldom drawn, but with great disadvantage; much more, when a Bungler hath it in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104362:4"/>His Lordship was one of a sweet nature, of a lovely disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of a pleasing off ability in his carriage, and conversation. He was endowed with a sharp wit, a quick apprehension, a strong mind, a piercing judgment, a faithful memory, and milder affections then ordinary.</p>
            <p>By Industry, and Art, every Faculty of his Soul was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, and fill'd with those Ornaments and Qualities, of which they were naturally capable, even to a very great perfection.</p>
            <p>He was admirable for the Profoundness, and Variety of his Knowledge; and enabled with such an universal Wisdom, as that he was thought worthy Employment, not onely in Affairs of <hi>State;</hi> but in the Direction, and Guidance of the <hi>House of God, which is the Church of the living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, These had been nothing (not any of them, not all of them) if there had not been the <hi>Salt</hi> of Grace to have sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned them, and the Life of Faith to have animated them. Without this, all those his other Accomplishments had been but as gay, and gorgeous Attire upon a leprous Body; as Iewels, and Bracelets upon a putrid, rotten Carkass. Oh his Religion, his Holiness! this was farr the fairest, and most orient Flower in the Garland of all his other Excellencies; and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly above all his Greatness, had he been advanced even to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, to the highest Pinacle of Church-Preferment, and Honour. For, what ever Prophane, and Worldly-wise men may think, without all Controversie, one Grain of Grace is infinitely more precious, and worthful, then the whole Earth, though turned into a Globe of Gold, or Center of Diamond. And yet, this <hi>Reverend Prelat,</hi> now in Glory, was inrich'd with a very great Proportion of it, even to Admiration.</p>
            <p>In short, He was a wonder to all, who had the happiness to know him, for his insight into all kinds of Learning, both
<pb facs="tcp:104362:5"/>
Ancient, and Modern; of Positive, Textual, Controverse, Case-Divinity: But above all, for his being sanctified with an Experimental Inspection into the Particularities of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Science of Saving Souls.</p>
            <p>Now (may it please Your Grace) these <hi>Sermons</hi> being the Compositions of so Learned, so Religious, so Wise a <hi>Person,</hi> they cannot but be most worthy Your <hi>Graces Patronage,</hi> and the Worlds highest. Esteem, and Valuation.</p>
            <p>They are <hi>Sermons,</hi> which deliver the Word in the Purity of it, without those humane Inventions, which might adulterate it; without that spiritual Treason of wit and fancy, or of Heresy and Contradiction, which (to use the Expression of a Learned Bishop) is wont to stamp the private Image and Superscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a man upon Gods own Coyn, and to torture the Scripture to confess that which was never in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sermons,</hi> that carry Authority with them; and so, able (by the Power of the most High) to humble the Imaginations, to non-plus fleshly Reasonings, and to subdue all things to the Obedience of <hi>Christ:</hi> God having stampt upon his Lordship more then ordinary Characters of <hi>Divinity;</hi> and (as it were) more glistring sparkles and degrees of Majesty, then upon many others; that so with greater power he might publish the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Heaven, and with more unresistableness and glory exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that highest Office of the Lords Embassadour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sermons,</hi> fraught with spiritual Prudence, with Christian, Religious Wisdom; (and such the World never had more need of.) How exactly are they accommodated to every mans tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? How wisely are the Lightnings of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> mingled with the Thunderings of the Law? Uses of Comfort, with those of Confusion? Cordials of Compassion, with Corrosives of Terrour? So that the Weak cannot be offended, nor the Mighty exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor the Beginners discouraged, nor those who are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:104362:5"/>
affrighted from coming in, and entring upon, the <hi>Path</hi> that is called <hi>Holy.</hi> Which wisdom, his Lordship neither received from flesh and blood, nor yet learned of men; but had it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired from above, <hi>From the Father of Lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which, I cannot but apprehend as very great Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements of me to this Dedication; and as sufficient Grounds to build my Confidence upon, that these <hi>Sermons</hi> will find Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with Your <hi>Grace;</hi> though (like precious Iewels from a Paralytick) they are tendred by a weak, and trembling hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The good will of Him, who dwelt in the Bush,</hi> make Your <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod to bud, nay to flourish more and more, to the Glory of his great Name, to the Advancement of the blessed Truth, to the Maintenance of the Honour of the Priesthood, to the furtherance of Your own everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation. This is the earnest Prayer of him, who is,</p>

               <p>And out of all these put together, arises a short, but yet full compleat definition of all <hi>Divinity;</hi> a compendious Epitome of all Religion. What is that profession which we <hi>Christians</hi> take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> upon us? What's the summe of all those lively Oracles, that we are, or should be conversant in? Here is a lively representation of it. Our Religion, our Faith, our Divinity, what is it?

               </p>
               <p>I. For the nature of it; 'tis <hi>Mysterium.</hi> 'Tis the title of the Gospel, <hi>Mark</hi> iv. 11. <hi>Unto you it is given to know the mysterie of the Kingdome of God;</hi> that's the Gospel. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 7. <hi>We speak the wisdom of God in a mysterie; a mysterie which was kept secret since the world began, Rom.</hi> xvi. 25.</p>

               <list>
                  <item>1. Piety, and Godliness; it is a <hi>mysterie.</hi>

                  </item>
                  <item>2. The piety of Religion, and the <hi>mysterie</hi> of Religion must be joyned together. We must possess our selves not onely with the <hi>mysterie</hi> of Religion, but also with the piety.</item>
               </list>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Piety, it is a <hi>mysterie;</hi> and therefore,</item>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The art of Godliness, the skill to live holily, it is an high, hidden, supernatural thing; a skill far beyond the reach and possibility of nature. 'Tis no endowment of nature; it is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and conceal'd to natural knowledge. By nature, we are utterly void of this gracious endowment. <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s speech is the voyce of nature, <hi>Exod.</hi> v. 2. <hi>Who is the Lord, that I should</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                           <hi>obey him? I know not the Lord.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> describes our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition; <hi>We are alienated from the life of God,</hi> Eph. iv. 18. <hi>without Christ, being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the Covenant of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world,</hi> Ephes. ii. 12. This <hi>David</hi> describes, <hi>Psal.</hi> xiv. 2, 3, 4. <hi>The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God; They are all gone aside, they are altogether become filthyâ€”and call not upon the Lord.</hi> We naturally know, There is a God; there is no man born an Atheist; we have some sense of a Deity; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we are all born prophane, and irreligious, without any sense of piety; utterly ignorant how to worship and serve him in true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. That knowledge of God, which by nature we have, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways breaks out into one of these two Extremes; either,</item>
                        <item>
                           <list>
                              <pb n="14" facs="tcp:104362:14"/>
                              <item>1. Into prophanation, and so we never worship him; or,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. Into superstition, and so we misplace his worship in things abominable to him. When we know God, we worship him not as God, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. His worship depends upon his own will and revelation. <hi>We know not with what we must serve the Lord, till we come thither, Exod.</hi> x. 26. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xvii. 26. <hi>They know not the manner of the God of this land.</hi> Holiness, it is no invention of nature, but a revelation of grace. Nature may lead us to civility, train us up to morality; but spiritual piety, and godliness, is beyond the reach of nature: This <hi>wisdom is from above, Iam.</hi> iii. 17. Hast thou nothing but what thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> broughtest with thee into the world? thou art utterly desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the life of godliness. Piety, it is a <hi>mysterie,</hi> it is a Secret to nature.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <p>It gives us a reason why godliness is so scarce, so few are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it. That, that is natural, is usual and common; but this is supernatural, beyond the reach of nature. It is more admirable that any are holy, then that all are not. Most men live short of the light of nature; wonder not that so few are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced beyond nature to the state of grace.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <p>Piety is a <hi>mysterie;</hi> therefore,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                           </p>
                           <p>2. To natural men, it is, and seems to be, a reasonless, uncouth, unlikely thing, a meer paradox. Tell a vulgar, unlearned man, of the <hi>mysteries</hi> of any Art, or Science, he thinks you speak non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense; he can see nothing in them, they seem unreasonable. As many <hi>mysteries</hi> as you acquaint him with, so many absurdities; he laughs at them. 'Tis so with all the <hi>mysteries of godliness.</hi> Propound them to a carnal man, he will laugh at them; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to them, he rejects them; enforce them upon him, he repels them. 'Tis that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> observes, <hi>Our Gospel is hid to them that perish,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 3. A natural man judges these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> spiritual truths stark foolishness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 14. Therefore the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi> of the Gospel are called <hi>the foolishness of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 25. God hath wrapt them all up in the vail of such mystical obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that, at first sight, they appear odd, and unlikely to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man. As the Ark, though it were within all of pure gold, yet the coverings were plain, and coorse; of hair, and goats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins, no outward beauty to be seen. Thus <hi>Christ,</hi> the great <hi>mysterie,</hi> is God vail'd up in weak flesh; <hi>How can this man save us?</hi> The meanness of his outside scandalized the Jews; <hi>Is not this the Carpenter?â€”They were offended at him, Mark</hi> vi. 3.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And <hi>Christ</hi> knew it, how easily men would stumble at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeliness of this <hi>mysterie,</hi> that he pronounceth him blessed <hi>that shall not be offended in him, Matth.</hi> xi. 6. <hi>Esay</hi> liii. This is the reason the Prophet gives, why so few believe in <hi>Christ,</hi> vers. 1.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104362:14"/>
                              <hi>Who hath believed our report? He is as a root,</hi> vers. 2. <hi>in a dry</hi>

                              <hi>ground; he hath no form, nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Yea, the Doctrine of godliness, how absurd seems it to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason? Regeneration, to be born again, become a new man, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> cannot conceive it, <hi>Iohn</hi> iii. To be nourish'd to life by <hi>Christ</hi>'s flesh; <hi>How can this man give us his flesh?</hi> 'Tis <hi>an hard saying,</hi> Joh. vi. Self-denial, and mortification, to be crucified to the world, to cross our own wils, and wrastle with our selves, and to beat down our own bodies; a <hi>mysterie</hi> of piety, a folly to nature. To hate father, mother, life it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> self for Religion-sake, how unreasonable? Not to live by sense, or reason, but by faith, nature abhorrs it. To love our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to rejoyce in afflictions, to know how to be in want, poverty, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                              </gap>, saith S. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> iv. 12. 'Tis more <hi>blessed to give then to receive;</hi> to part with all, in hope of gain at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, in another world; and, above all, to look for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a crucified Saviour; <hi>haec sunt stulta Dei, sed decus fidei;</hi> these are the <hi>mysteries</hi> of our piety, the follies and paradoxes of natural reason. No, saith the Psalmist, <hi>The King's daughter is</hi>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                              <hi>all glorious within, Psal.</hi> xlv. All the glory of Piety, and the Church, 'tis spiritual and heavenly. Worldly wisdom, that's in worldly beauty: As the Church of the wicked One is glorious with earthly beauty, a Crown of gold, a purple Robe, beset with Precious Stones, all earthly ornaments; so the Spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> she is Beautiful, but all Heavenly; Cloath'd with the Sun, Crown'd with the Stars, Treading on the Moon; all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Mystical.</p>
                           <p>Piety, it is a <hi>mysterie,</hi> high, and hidden; therefore,</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. The attaining of this heavenly Skill, and Art of holiness, is a matter of much difficulty; it requires much search and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> much learning and diligence, much exercise and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to attain unto it. Those Arts that have in them many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse <hi>mysteries,</hi> are long a learning. Oh! the Art of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Trade of piety, the Skill of living holily, 'tis no small matter, but very <hi>mysterious.</hi> The Philosopher could say of his Art, <hi>Ars longa, Vita brevis,</hi> a mans life was too short to attain to the perfection of it. How much more is this high Art of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>the mysterie of godliness?</hi> It makes <hi>David,</hi> for all his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to cry out still, <hi>Teach me, Instruct me, Make me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the way of godliness.</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that great Proficient, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> professes he fell short, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Brethren, I count not my self to have apprehended, I have not already attained, I am not already perfect, but I follow after, and press forward, if by any means I might attain;</hi> words of striving and contention.</item>

                           <p>How hard a thing is it to attain even to the knowledge of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                              <hi>godliness?</hi> Then how difficult must it be to mortifie thy lusts, to subdue thine appetite? 'Tis call'd <hi>a Crucifying.</hi> Consider it, you, who think seven years little enough to learn any Trade of life; but any little time, any poor pains, sufficient to learn that which the Saints were practising all their dayes. Try thy strength but with one Act, but with one Duty of godliness; and then tell me, If slubbering over a few prayers, or coming to Church, and yawning out an <hi>Amen,</hi> half asleep, half awake, be likely to make thee a skilful man in this Trade of piety.</p>
                           <p>That's the first; <hi>Religion is the mysterie of godliness.</hi>

We must take both to us; not onely content our selves with the <hi>mysterie</hi> of Christianity, but be sure we acquaint our selves with the <hi>piety.</hi> True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion joyns both together. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> describes Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, '<hi>Tis a Doctrine according to godliness,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 3. And <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 1. it is called, the <hi>Knowledge of the Truth according unto godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> We may as well separate light from heat in the fire, as the mysterie and knowledge of it from the piety.</item>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Indeed, first we must get the <hi>mysterie,</hi> then labour for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                  <hi>piety</hi> of it. First, God created light; so it is in mans soul. A man is sooner enlightned then sanctified: The Sun enlightens in an instant, but it begets heat in the Ayr by length of time; but they must never be a sunder. Blind Devotion, would have the <hi>piety</hi> without the <hi>mysterie.</hi> Oh! Zealous it would be, but not with knowledge. Oh! A good heart to God-wards; no matter for knowledge. And prophane Curiosity, that would have the <hi>mysterie</hi> without the <hi>piety;</hi> understand all secrets and mysteries, comprehend all Truths; but for the holiness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, they have no list to it. True Christianity joyns both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> True Religion is not like the tree of Knowledge, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>pleasant to the eye, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, Gen.</hi> iii. 6. but it must be to us as the tree of Life, for Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Practice. Religion is not placed in the upper region of the Brain; but in the Heart, the seat of affection, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of action. 'Tis a sanctifying Truth; <hi>Holy Father, sanctifie them through thy Truth,</hi> not enlighten them onely, <hi>Ioh.</hi> xvii. 17.</p>
               <p>There is not any Truth so mystical, and contemplative, but must be drawn into practice. There is no <hi>mysterie</hi> in Scripture, but hath its <hi>piety.</hi> As there is not any creature, but it is for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> some use; it is not onely beautiful, but useful; <hi>Non tantum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su delectat, sed usu prodest;</hi> so there's no Truth in Religion, but we may, and must extract from it Piety. Some Truths, at first sight, seem but dry as to this; but as the Licorish stick, at first,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104362:15"/>
looks like any weed, but chew it, and you suck sweetness; so,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> those <hi>mysteries</hi> that seem to be most remote from practice, have a juice and sap of <hi>piety</hi> to be suck'd out of them. <hi>If ye know these things, happy are ye, if ye do them,</hi> Joh. xiii. 17. <hi>This man shall be blessed in his deed, Iam.</hi> i. 25.</p>
               <p>See how <hi>Christ</hi> checks Curiosity, and turns all to Practice; <hi>Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate, Luk.</hi> xiii. 23, 24.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Piety,</hi> 'tis the end of Christianity. 'Tis <hi>mysterium practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</hi> Not a Science in contemplation, but an Art of doing; not to make us the wiser, but the holier.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Piety,</hi> 'tis the best keeper of this <hi>mysterie.</hi> The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Religion, 'tis a precious Jewel; see the Cabinet S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of, wherein it must be kept; <hi>Holding the mysterie of Faith in a pure Conscience,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 9. Wouldst thou not erre concerning the Faith? Take heed of making shipwrack of a good Conscience. Knowledge in this vessel, is like the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in the golden-pot; it is kept sweet. In a prophane heart, it is like Manna in other vessels, that stank and putrified. God takes away natural knowledge, if we abuse it, and live not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. When they knew God, and glorified him not as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> God, God gave them over to errour, and never would call them to the knowledge of the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 21, &amp;c. As we try vessels first with water; if they will hold, and keep it sweet, then we pour wine into them.

                  <item>3. 'Tis a fundamental Truth; the first Stone that is laid in the building of the Church; the main Rock upon which the whole Building rests.

               <p>1.

                  <item>
                     <p>1. <hi>Christ</hi> came not in the beginning, and morning of the world, presently after the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> but stayed, and deferr'd his coming for a season, for divers reasons:</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Differendo medicinam, aggravavit morbum.</hi> When the world had sinned, God did not presently dispatch our Saviour, that the fall and disease of sin might be more observable, and so the cure prove more gloriously remarkable. Were we present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, so soon as we complained, we should less esteem the danger of our disease. The long smart, and tediousness of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> misery, makes us to consider what it is to sin. <hi>Christ</hi> would not go at the first Call to cure <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but stayed <hi>three dayes,</hi> that he might be sick, and dye, and be buried, and putrified; that the case of <hi>Lazarus</hi> might seem more desperate: So, God let the world lye and continue in that ruine, that sin might appear out of measure sinful.</p>
                     <p>In the course of nature, a wound is sooner given, then it can be cured again: And in the dispensation of grace, God takes longer time for punishing, and pardoning, then we take for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: <hi>Numb.</hi> xiv. 34. <hi>After the number of the dayes, each day for</hi>

                        <hi>a year, shall ye bear your iniquities; even forty years, that ye may know my breach of promise.</hi> The sin of the Spies and People was but forty dayes continuance, but they felt the smart of that sin full forty years. This course God took with the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 33.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104362:19"/>
                        <hi>God hath shut up all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all:</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> first shut them up, and imprison'd them; before he pardon'd, and enlarg'd them. <hi>Miriam,</hi> for a word spoken amiss, must be shut out of the Camp seven dayes. <hi>Had her father but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven dayes?</hi> The sense of God's displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was to abide upon us.

After God had promised <hi>Christ,</hi> many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years were spent, ere he performed his promise. The Law came betwixt; and it was added <hi>because of transgression, till the Seed should come.</hi> The world was to look for a Saviour; but in the mean time, the Law was set over them, to convince them of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sin, to make them know it is an evil and a bitter thing to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God; and then comes the Saviour.</p>

                     <p>This made the Church, before <hi>Christ,</hi> long and expect, and be earnest, for his Comming. <hi>Abraham,</hi> he longed to see this day, <hi>Ioh.</hi> viii. <hi>Iacob</hi> on his death-bed, <hi>O Lord, I wait for thy Salvation.</hi> It made the Prophets enquire diligently, and search into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Promises.

Neither did he stay till the last period, and end of Time; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that so, in all differences of time, Faith might have an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Christ, yesterday, and to day, and the same for ever, Heb.</hi> xiii. 8. The Patriarchs, they believed, <hi>in Christum futurum,</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> afterwards to be exhibited: The Apostles, and the Saints of that Age, they believed, <hi>in Christum praesentem,</hi> they enjoyed his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily presence; they saw and believed on him, present amongst them. Christians now, they believe, <hi>in Christum praeteritum,</hi> come, and gone again into heaven. They that came before, and they that followed after, they all sung <hi>Hosanna.</hi> The Patriarchs, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> went before; the Christian Church, that follows after; both sing <hi>Hosanna, Blessed is he that comes to us in the name of the Lord.</hi> As Kings, when they go in State, have their Ushers before them, and their Attendants after them, both honour their appearance. <hi>Christ</hi> in this fulness of time, is as the Sun at noon-tide; East, and West are both enlightned by him. It shews us the efficacy of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of his bloud; it was effectual, not onely when it was shed, but before it was shed, and after it was shed. It sanctified, and saved the Primitive Saints; and the last upon earth shall be saved by it.</p>
               <p>That's the first fulness of time, in the natural consideration of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it. In the middle of Time, when the world was at the Zenith, then <hi>Christ</hi> came.</p>
               <p>II. There is another <hi>fulness of time,</hi> that's <hi>Constituta plenitudo temporis;</hi> that time that was set, and decreed, and appointed by God. For not onely <hi>Christ</hi>'s comming, but all the circumstances of Time and Place were forelaid, and determined; and <hi>Christ</hi>'s comming into the world, gave a <hi>fulness</hi> and accomplishment unto that Time.</p>
               <p>That we may conceive how our Saviour's Comming brought a <hi>fulness</hi> to Time, we must know, there were foregoing times, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which <hi>Christ</hi> was made known to the Church; but yet there was an emptiness in those times; His Birth and Incarnation gave a <hi>fulness</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>There were three Preparative foregoing Times, which <hi>Christ</hi>'s Comming fulfilled:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Was <hi>Tempus Promissionis;</hi> that Time and Age of the Church when the Promise of <hi>Christ</hi> was first made and publish'd; that was the time from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses.</hi> The Church of God lived, and supported it self with that Promise, That afterwards, in God's good time, <hi>Christ</hi> should be born. Now Promises, are all for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they bring nothing in present. Indeed <hi>Faith</hi> knows how to make use of them, but in themselves they are but empty, they exhibit nothing. They give good Assurance, but put us not into Possession. A man may be rich in Bills, and Bonds, and Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104362:21"/>
but yet be in actual want: as men lay up Evidences among <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their Treasures. But <hi>Christ</hi>'s comming fulfill'd those Promises, gave a <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> to them. The prayer of <hi>David,</hi> was the prayer of the whole Church, <hi>Think upon thy Servant, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Word, in which thou hast caused me to put my trust.</hi> It spread these Evidences before God, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did the Letter that was sent to him. Ey, but Promises turn'd into Performances, is a true <hi>fulness.</hi> That's the first; the time of Performance is a real <hi>fulness</hi> to the times of Promises.</item>
                  <item>2. A second Time was, <hi>Tempus Typorum,</hi> the time and age of the Church, furnish'd with Types and Prefigurations of him; that was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the time of the Church under <hi>Moses.</hi> It added to the former time. That had but a Promise of him; these Types resembled him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed him to them, seal'd up, and assured his comming to them. They were to the Faith of the Church, as Signs to represent him, as Tokens and Pledges to assure him to them: But yet this falls short of <hi>fulness.</hi> Seals and Pledges are good Assurances, but actual Possession is a great deal better. <hi>Annulus iste nihil valet, haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas est quam reposco.</hi> The Writing and Seal is not the thing we look for; the Estate and Inheritance is that we wait for. Now <hi>Christ</hi>'s comming fill'd up the imperfections, and emptiness of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> these Types. They had the emptiness of a shadow, He brings the substance and <hi>fulness</hi> of the Body. <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 17. <hi>They were but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of things to come, but the Body is of Christ.</hi> His comming fill'd the Temple, as the cloud fill'd the Tabernacle. He fill'd that house with glory, when <hi>Christ</hi> came into it.</item>
                  <item>3. A third Time was, <hi>Tempus Prophetiarum;</hi> the Age of the Prophets; that was yet a fuller Time: then there was a more clear and particular foretelling the very manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his Birth and Incarnation. <hi>Esay</hi> calculates, and foretels the time; At such a year, then the <hi>Messias</hi> shall come<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                     <hi>Micah</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the City where he shall be born<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> At <hi>Bethleem.</hi> They bring it nearer, and closer home; but all of them fail, and fall short of this <hi>fulness.</hi> They were but as Heralds and Ushers, forewarning, and preparing the way before him. <hi>The Testimony of Iesus, is the Spirit of Prophesie:</hi> His comming gives a being to all their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. They all sate like <hi>Ionas</hi> to see when their Prophesies should be fulfilled; like <hi>Elijah</hi> on mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> looking often, and often, for his blessed Appearance. His presence accomplish'd them, and gave them their <hi>fulness.</hi> Thus God dealt with his Church, as <hi>Boaz</hi> with <hi>Ruth;</hi> first he affords her some gleanings; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then lets fall handfuls to her; then fills her vail with a measure of clean corn dressed and winnowed; then at last marries himself to her in his Incarnation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>So then; Is <hi>Christ</hi>'s Comming the <hi>fulness of time?</hi> What
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104362:21"/>
improvement shall we make of this point for practice?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               </p>
               <p>1. It should teach us to take notice of our happiness, that were kept and reserved to live in those times that are <hi>fulfill</hi>'d by our Saviour's comming. It is a great Blessing of God to be born in good times, in dayes of Peace and Plenty. We pity our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, who lived in those Swording times, when all was in an uprore; and after-ages will do the like for us. And one bewail'd himself, that he was born, <hi>nec solo, nec coelo, nec seculo erudito,</hi> in barbarous times. How happy are Christians, who have all the Mysteries of our Redemption accomplish'd in these dayes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Gospel? What saith our Saviour to his Disciples? <hi>Luk.</hi> x. 23. <hi>Blessed are the eyes that see the things that ye see; for I tell you many Kings and Prophets have desired to see those things that ye see, and have not seen them. David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Iosiah,</hi> how would they have thrown down their Crowns at his feet, and adored him? Those Truths concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> which we count common and vulgar, and sleight and neglect them, how would they have ravished the spirits of those Saints that were before us? The My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the Trinity, what dark intimations of it to the Saints of old? That <hi>Christ</hi> was both God and Man, <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Son, it posed all the Doctors in <hi>Israel,</hi> how to conceive it; <hi>Matth.</hi> xxii. Our Saviours Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, we scorn to spend time to learn them our selves, and teach them others; and yet the Angels, and Arch-angels stand astonished at them. They before us received but the Promise, <hi>God providing a better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect, Heb.</hi> xi. 40. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xvi. <hi>Samuel</hi> would not sit down to the Sacrifice, till young <hi>David</hi> was b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ught from tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sheep. <hi>Christ</hi>'s Sacrifice was delayed, <hi>till the fulness of the Gentiles might come in.</hi> The Patriarchs were the eldest sons, and they were put off with a Kid; the fat Calf was kill'd for us; the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> best wine was kept last, till now, to entertain us<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </p>
               <p>2. This <hi>fulness</hi> on Gods part, doth challenge and require <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> on our part.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <p>1. <hi>Fulness</hi> of knowledge. On Gods part <hi>Christ</hi> is fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, all the Mysterie of Godliness laid open, and unfolded; tis our duty then, fully to know him. The dim, dark, imperfect knowledge of the Jewish Church will not suffice; the vail is now taken off, and we all with open face may see and behold him. <hi>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child;</hi> that was the condition of those times. Christians must be grown men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of a ripe age in understanding. <hi>The times of our former ignorance, God regarded not,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, but now he warns every man, Act.</hi> xvii. 30. The times of Christianity are foretold to be knowing times; <hi>Every man shall know me, from the least of them, to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:104362:22"/>
                        <hi>of them, Ier.</hi> xxxi. 34. <hi>The earth shall be filled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>

                        <hi>of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk;</hi> a Spring-tide of knowledge. <hi>Zachary</hi> foretels, that the feeblest Christian shall be as <hi>David. Iohn Baptist,</hi> a great enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prophet; yet the <hi>least in the kingdom of heaven may be greater then he,</hi> in the Mysteries of Religion.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>fulness</hi> on Gods part requires of us,</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Fulness</hi> of Faith, and of stedfast Assurance. We owe our Faith to Gods bare Promises; Shall we not fully believe his reall Performances? The Saints before <hi>Christ</hi> met with many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in believing: All of them are removed, that they cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our perswasion. There were four Difficulties that attended the Promise of <hi>Christ,</hi> as it was propounded to the Patriarchs:</item>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Was <hi>Obscuritas;</hi> They saw all in a dim light; all things were made known in much obscurity; they had but the light of a candle to discern by: the light of the Sun shines out to us.</item>
                        <item>2. Was <hi>Generalitas; Christ</hi> was promised to them in more general terms, not so distinctly and personally as he is to us. They heard of a blessed Seed to be born, that is all their Faith fastned on. We know who he is, <hi>Iesus the Son of Mary;</hi> he is pointed out to us <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                           </gap>, with special circumstances. <hi>Hic, &amp; Nunc,</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> breeds distinct knowledge.</item>
                        <item>3. Was <hi>Improbabilitas;</hi> The Promise was propounded to them with some Improbabilities. <hi>A Virgin shall conceive, and bring forth a Son: How can this thing be?</hi> Yes, we know it is performed; that holy <hi>Virgin</hi> hath conceived, and born him. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances confute all improbabilities. <hi>Can there come any good out of Nazareth? Come and see.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. Was <hi>Longinquitas;</hi> The Promise of <hi>Christ,</hi> made to the Fathers, was for a long time after; many hundred years to be spent ere <hi>Christ</hi> should come. Tell a man what shall happen a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thousand years hence, you can hardly perswade him. <hi>The Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie is for many dayes to come,</hi> said those mockers in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> We need not stretch our faith so far, the Promise is before us. With <hi>Thomas</hi> we may lay hold on him, and say, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Hath <hi>Christ</hi> brought a <hi>fulness</hi> with him? It must work in us <hi>fulness</hi> of content, and satisfaction; rest <hi>fully</hi> in him, and in his plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Redemption. The <hi>fulness</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is abundantly able to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and fill up all our desires; <hi>Fills the soul with marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> All other cravings of the soul may be quieted for a time, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they return again as eager as ever; 'tis like a <hi>dream of meat,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>and when he awakes, his soul is empty.</hi> This heavenly Manna, it breeds appetite, and yet it pinches not; it satisfies the soul, and yet it cloys not. Indeed <hi>Christ</hi> hath in him all that we need, or can possibly wish for. He is the poor mans Riches, the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104362:22"/>
despised mans Honour, the hungry mans Food, the sick mans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Health, and the dying mans Life. Hast thou gained him? Say, 'Tis enough, Lord; <hi>Return to thy rest, O my soul,</hi> the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish'd thee. When <hi>Simeon</hi> had <hi>Christ</hi> in his arms, he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, then willing to dye; he had seen his Saviour.</item>
                  <item>4. Hath God fulfilled his Promise to us? It requires we should fulfill our promises to him: Not <hi>fulness</hi> on Gods part, and <hi>emptiness</hi> on ours; fast on his part, loose on ours. The Son of God, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> was not <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 19. His comming to us, was not like the willing-unwilling son in the Gospel; first he would go, and then he would not. Not one word hath fallen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the ground of all that he promised us. And shall our promises to him be <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay?</hi> The Promises that have passed 'twixt God and us, are mutual; not simply free, but partional and foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; <hi>Do, ut des; Facio, ut facias;</hi> in the form of a Covenant, and by way of stipulation. <hi>Moses</hi> calls it a mutual Avouchment: We avouch him to be our God, he avoucheth us to be his people, and that's strong and binding, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvi. 17. Thus <hi>Ioshua</hi> exhorts the people to obedience, <hi>Ye know in all your hearts, and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good which the Lord</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>hath promised you; all is come to pass.</hi> Take heed of being false in his Covenant. He performs all, we just nothing.</item>
                  <item>5. At the <hi>fulness of time</hi> God made this great Promise good to his Church; It must have a double operation upon our <hi>Faith:</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. It must settle our <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. It must order our <hi>Faith,</hi> and reliance upon God.</item>
                        <item>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. It must settle our <hi>Faith</hi> in the hopeful expectance of all other Promises. This grand Promise of <hi>Christ,</hi> 'tis <hi>Matrix omnium promissionum,</hi> and, <hi>Pabulum Fidei;</hi> the foison that <hi>Faith</hi> feeds upon; it gives strength to all other promises; <hi>In him all</hi>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                                 <hi>are Yea, and Amen.</hi> He hath not spared his own Son, with him he can deny us nothing. <hi>Accessorium sequitur Principale;</hi> other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are accessories and appurtenances to this Promise. <hi>Manoah</hi>'s wife argued strongly, <hi>Would God destroy us, he would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised us a son.</hi> Hath God made good the Promise of his Son? He will fail us in nothing. <hi>All his wayes are Mercy and Truth;</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Promising, Truth in Performing. As it must settle our <hi>Faith,</hi> keep it from wavering; so,</item>
                              <item>2. It must order our <hi>Faith,</hi> keep it from precipitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; too much hastening. Our <hi>Faith</hi> must not antedate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in their due time they shall be accomplished. As to every thing God hath set a season, so he hath to his Promises. <hi>Luk.</hi> i. 20. See the date God sets to them, <hi>They shall be fulfill'd in their season.</hi> Thus the Prophet sets back the over-hasty expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <list>
                  <item>1. The Authour, <hi>God:</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. His Action, <hi>He sent:</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The Person who must effect and perform this Redemption for us, that's <hi>his Son.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I. The Authour of this great benefit of sending, is <hi>God.</hi> The Scripture still ascribes the sending of <hi>Christ,</hi> unto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This gracious action it is appropriated unto him. Hence he is called, <hi>the Gift of God, Ioh.</hi> iv. 10. So, <hi>Ioh.</hi> iii. 16. <hi>He gave his onely begotten Son.</hi> So, <hi>Ioh.</hi> xvii. 23. praying to his Father, he adds, <hi>They have believed, that Thou hast sent me.</hi> So, <hi>Acts</hi> iii. 26. S. <hi>Peter</hi> assures the Jews, <hi>God hath sent his Son to bless you, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away every one of you from your iniquities.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               </p>
               <p>And two Congruities there are, that God should send his Son to Redeem us:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Congruity is grounded upon that Order, and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is betwixt the Persons in the glorious Trinity. As is their Being, so is their Working. The Father hath his Being from himself, so he hath his Working. We never read that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was sent by the <hi>Son,</hi> or by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> He is <hi>Fons Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> the Fountain and Original of the Deity. He is of himself, and works of himself. But the <hi>Son</hi> hath his Being from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> by Eternal generation; and all his Operations and Actions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> flow from the <hi>Father, Ioh.</hi> v. 19. <hi>The Son can do nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but what he seeth the Father do.</hi> Thus <hi>Christ</hi> referrs all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of our salvation, to the sending of the Father. <hi>Ioh.</hi> iv. <hi>My meat is, to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:104362:23"/>
And again, <hi>Ioh.</hi> ix. 4. <hi>I must work the works of him that sent me.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God the <hi>Father</hi> communicates all these gracious works to his <hi>Son,</hi> and sent him to perform them.</item>
                  <item>2. A second Congruity, why God the <hi>Father</hi> must be the Authour of our Redemption, is, Because by special Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation he is the Authour of our Creation; and none other must Redeem us, but he who did Create us.</item>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The right of Redemption;</item>
                        <item>2. The glory of Redemption;</item>
                        <item>3. The duty of Redemption; all belong to him.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. We were his by right of Creation, and that was an indefeasable right. Though we by sin lost our right in God, yet God did not lose his right in us. Now Redemption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him, to whom belongs the original right of Possession. <hi>I am thine, O save me; thine hands have made me. Mine own I will bring again, as I did sometimes from the depth of the sea.</hi> The stray lost Sheep was the Shepherds still, he had the onely right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it. None but God could lay claim to us, and therefore none but God could Redeem us.</item>
                              <item>2. None must Redeem us, but he who Created us; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the glory of our Redemption must belong to none but to the Authour of our Creation. Had any but God atchieved our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, more glory had been due to a creature for Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, then to God for Creating us. The work of Redemption, 'tis far more glorious then the work of Creation. In it shines more glorious Wisdom, Goodness, Power. Now no creature must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual God in glory, much less exceed him. The most glorious work belongs to the most glorious God.</item>
                              <item>3. None must Redeem us, but God who Created us; the benefit of Redemption doth more deeply oblige us, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the benefit of Creation. We owe more for our Redemption, then for our Creation. Before he Made us, we were nothing; before he Redeem'd us, we were worse then nothing. We owe greater thanks to him who Redeem'd us by his <hi>Sons</hi> Blood<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> then to him who Created us only by his Breath<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> More Duties &amp; Services are to be performed to him as our Saviour, then as to our Maker. Should any but God Redeem us, we should be more deeply engaged to a Creature, then to our Creator, God blessed for evermore.</item>

Christ</hi> makes it the summ of our Christian Faith; <hi>That the world may believe that thou hast sent me, Ioh.</hi> xi.</p>
               <p>It is a pregnant expression, and affords us divers truths for our Observation.</p>

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:104362:24"/>
                  <item>1. <hi>Christs Incarnation</hi> was a <hi>Sending</hi> of him; that's <hi>Actus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berae</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>dispensationis,</hi> an Action of freedom, and voluntary dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. Not (as some erroneously conceived it) as if his <hi>Sending,</hi> had been his Making, and giving him his Being. It was <hi>Nestorius</hi> his Heresie, That the Person of <hi>Christ</hi> had no Being before his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi> but then had his beginning. No, his <hi>Sending</hi> was no natural production, but a gracious employment, and voluntary dispensation. He who was <hi>Sent,</hi> was before he was <hi>Sent, Ioh.</hi> xvi. 28. <hi>I came forth from the Father, and came into the world.</hi> Again, <hi>I leave the world, and go unto the Father. The Lord possessed me in</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>the beginning of his way before his works of old, Prov.</hi> viii. 22. There is his Eternal generation. <hi>But he rejoyced to be in the habitable parts of the earth, he delighted to be with the sonnes of men:</hi> There was his voluntary, and gracious <hi>Sending,</hi> in his Incarnation. Though he was born at <hi>Bethlem, Yet his goings forth, were from of old, from everlasting, Micah</hi> V. 2.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>Sent</hi> to work our Redemption: <hi>Sending,</hi> it is <hi>Actus specialis Intentionis;</hi> he came to be a Saviour to us, upon special Intention. It gives a great assurance to our <hi>faith,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> undertook this work, not occasionally, but purposely; it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was the errand he came about, it was the end and aym of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation.</hi> Not, as <hi>David</hi> saved <hi>Nabal's</hi> flock, while he was in the wilderness, for his own safety; onely while he was there, he did <hi>Nabal</hi> that kindness: Nor was he like the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> that travell'd upon his own occasions, and chanced upon the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, and so step'd out of his way to relieve, and succour him; but it was his only business. <hi>He came to seek, and to save that which was lost, Matth.</hi> xviii. 11. Now, surely, he will not frustrate the main end of his <hi>Nativity.</hi> He was separated to this work from his mothers womb; <hi>Sent from the bosom of his Father</hi> to accomplish it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Christ</hi> came, and yet his <hi>Father Sent him;</hi> it is <hi>Actus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui consensus:</hi> He came and so it was his own Act: and his <hi>Father Sent</hi> him, so it was his <hi>Father's</hi> Act. Both joyn'd, and agreed, in this work of our Salvation. Indeed the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> they always do the same things; but yet more expresly their consent is observable in our Redemption. The Scripture makes it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their counsel, and consultation; a matter of covenant, and compact, 'twixt the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, Psal.</hi> ii. <hi>In the volume of thy book it was written of me; then said I, Lo, I come; I delight to do thy</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>will, O my God, Psal.</hi> xl. 7. Both concurred; He came not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but his <hi>Father Sent</hi> him; <hi>Come, I will send thee to thy brethren,</hi> said <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Ioseph; Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with them.</hi> They both joyned in this work, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> did in the sacrificing of <hi>Isaac;</hi> no striving, or wrestling, or refusing,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104362:24"/>
but a joynt consent. The <hi>Father Sends</hi> him, and he came willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as <hi>Iephta's</hi> daughter to her father, <hi>Do as thou hast vowed.</hi> It was not the love of <hi>Christ</hi> onely, without, or against his <hi>Fathers</hi> liking: not like <hi>Ionathans</hi> kindness, sore against his father <hi>Sauls</hi> will<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> He undertook not our cause, nor vanquish'd our enemies, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> made his on-set on the <hi>Philistims,</hi> his father not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: nor did God part with him unwillingly, and upon much importunity, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did with <hi>Benjamin,</hi> to ransom his brother; no, God highly approved his <hi>Sons</hi> willingness in offering and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking this great Service; they both joyn'd in this work.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                  <item>
                     <p>4. <hi>God Sent his Son</hi> to Redeem us; it is <hi>Actus Autoritatis,</hi> it carries with it strength of full Warrant, and Authority. He came with an ample Commission to effect this work. And <hi>Christ</hi> publish'd this Commission at his first Preaching. <hi>Luk.</hi> iv. 17, 18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, he hath anointed me, he hath sent me to deliver the Captives.

                     <p>It makes much to the <hi>fulness</hi> of this work, That <hi>Christ</hi> steps not in, as a private mediating friend, but is employed by God, comes with full Authority to negotiate and transact the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> work of our Redemption.

               <p>Now for this recourse of <hi>Christ</hi> to Mountains, it was very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. He went up <hi>to a Mountain to Preach: Mat.</hi> v. 1. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

               <p>Why so? Is <hi>God the God of the Mountains, not of the Vallies?</hi> or, are the Prayers more acceptable that are there performed, then in other places? No surely. No place now commends our Prayers to God. In all places, prayers are alike acceptable.

               <list>
                  <item>1. His holy Disposition, and Action, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which he was conversant when he was Transfigured; <hi>As he prayed.</hi>
                  </item>

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:104362:34"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> his holy Disposition, and Action. In it, two things; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Consider it in the absolute Performance. <hi>QuÃ²d or avit;</hi> that he Prayed:</item>
                  <item>2. In the respective Accommodation of it to this Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; When he prayed, then he was Transfigured.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. Consider it absolutely; that <hi>Christ</hi> prayed. And the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation from hence, is thus much; That our blessed Saviour in the dayes of his flesh, was religiously conversant in this Duty of prayer. Many Instances of this, in Scripture: And this he did for divers Reasons:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Ut cultum, &amp; servitium Deo exhiberet;</hi> To do homage,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and honour to God his Father. <hi>Christ,</hi> as Man, was inferiour to Him; and so was to perform this recognition of his Father's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty. Adoration, is due from the most glorious Creatures to God. <hi>All knees must bow to him;</hi> and therefore <hi>Christ,</hi> the first of all the creatures of God, tenders this homage to him. <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is our Moral, and Real, and Spiritual Sacrifice, enjoyned us by the law of Nature, <hi>In recognitionem Universalis &amp; Supremi Dominii.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Christ</hi> was conversant in Prayer, <hi>Ut Orationem exemplo sanciret, &amp; dedicaret;</hi> And so to make it, by his performance, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> welcome and acceptable service to him. <hi>Christ</hi> was not sanctified by Prayer, but Prayer was sanctified by <hi>Christ.:</hi> As Baptism did not sanctifie him, but he sanctified and consecrated it. All God's Ordinances convey holiness into us in the performance of them; but they drew sanctity from <hi>Christ.</hi> He makes Word, Prayer, Sacraments, the holier for his performing of them. <hi>The Altar sanctifies the Gift.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Christ</hi> was conversant in Prayer; That so he might put himself into the exercise of all kind of graces. He prayed not out of absolute necessity, as we do; but to stir up, and beautifie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> himself with the practice of all kind of graces. As he said of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism, What though he needed not? <hi>Yet thus it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to fulfil all righteousness.</hi> The grace of Prayer is so holy a grace, the Art of Prayer so heavenly, that <hi>Christ</hi> would abound in this, as in all other endowments. The Saints, they are more plentiful in some gifts, and more scanty in others; but <hi>Christ</hi> was abundant in all.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Christ</hi> was conversant in Prayer; To testifie his state of Humiliation. Therefore he prayes, not onely by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, or Intimation, but by way of humble Petition, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Thereby acknowledging himself;</item>

                        <item>2. To be in a continual subjection, and dependance, from God.</item>

                           <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104362:34"/>3. That he had put himself into a state of want, and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and so craves a gracious supply from the hand of God.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Christ</hi> was conversant in Prayer, as a special performance of his office of Mediatour. He is our High-Priest; all his requests are meritorious for us. He was set up for us <hi>in the things of God.</hi> This is a special excellency in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Prayers. The best of our Prayers have but the virtue of Impetration, and the grace of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation; but <hi>Christ</hi>'s Prayers were of a Meritorious value. We know, that, besides the great Paschal Sacrifice, the daily Incense was to be offered; so, besides <hi>Christ</hi>'s Passion, his Prayer was to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be tendred for our Redemption.</item>
                  <item>6. <hi>Christ</hi> was conversant in Prayer for Spiritual Solace, and Consolation. The enjoying of the sweetness of Communication with God, it was to the spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> above all comforts. As to Preach, so to Pray, was meat that he fed upon, and Spiritual refection. We see when he was wearied with the multitudes, <hi>Matth.</hi> xiv. <hi>He went up to a mountain to pray,</hi> as the most ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refreshment he had. <hi>If any be afflicted,</hi> heavy, sorrowful, thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after joy and gladness, let them get into these holy parleys with God; suck honey out of this honey-comb, it will glad them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> presently.</item>

               <p>Well then;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Did <hi>Christ,</hi> the natural Son of God, carefully, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously tender up this honour to God? How should we be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduous in this homage, who are the lowest, and meanest, and unworthiest of his creatures? He, who in his Deity was equal to God, yet bowes, and prostrates himself; How should we humble our selves in this holy Adoration? Do Saints in heaven, and Angels, nay, did <hi>Christ</hi> himself offer up this Worship? It deeply concerns us to perform it to him.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Did <hi>Christ</hi> sollicit his Father for supply of Mercies? Why, he had right and title to all: All was his due. How then should we dare to usurp any of God's blessings, and not beg them by Prayer at his holy hands? Must the Son be a Petitioner, and shall the servant intermeddle, serve himself in his desires, without craving by Prayer? <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, Psal.</hi> ii. 8.</item>
                  <item>3. Did <hi>Christ</hi> abound in this grace of Prayer, though freed from all Infirmities, out of the reach of temptations, though full of all graces? How then should we, who are clogg'd with infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> incumbred with temptations, beset with corruptions; How should we abound in this grace, to draw supply and strength from heaven?</item>
                  <item>4. Did <hi>Christ</hi> sue by <hi>Prayer?</hi> He was most certain of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104362:35"/>
event of every thing; knew that all things were set and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his own Glory, his Churches Redemption: yet he would <hi>Pray.</hi> Then, earnest Prayers may be made for those things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there may be fullest assurance. We are told, If men may be certain of Grace and Glory, why do they pray for it? Certainty on God's part, doth not weaken, but strengthen the force of Prayer. <hi>Isaac</hi> had promise of a son, yet he begged him. <hi>Elijah</hi> was sure of rain, yet he pray'd for it. <hi>David</hi> was sure his house should be established, yet he prayed for it. <hi>Christ</hi> was sure of all, yet he abounds in this service of Prayer. <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is serviceable to God's Appointments.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>II. Consider our Saviour's Prayer here respectively to his glorious Transfiguration; <hi>While he prayed, he was Transfigured;</hi> and so it imports an efficacy in his Prayers, producing and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Transfiguration.</p>
               <p>Observe the admirable power and efficacy of devout Prayer; It is able to transport the soul, to ravish the spirit, to lift up the heart into an heavenly rapture, and to fill soul and body with unspeakable glory. A strange doctrine to our drowzy Petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; they never felt any such thing. Well, saith S. <hi>Chrysostom, Sancti intelligunt quid dico.</hi> They who abound in this Spiritual <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> exercise, give testimony to this Truth, and find it by experience. Thus <hi>David</hi> professes, that Prayer and Praise, was to him <hi>as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fatness. My mouth shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips, Psal.</hi> lxiii. 5. <hi>I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. They looked unto him, and were lightned, and their faces were not ashamed, Psal.</hi> xxxiv. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Prayer</hi> hath this power;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Because it raiseth the soul into heaven, far above all earthly vanities, or vexations. The soul lying groveling upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the earth, feels many incumbrances; Prayer mounts it above the clouds. And then, like the woman in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> if the Moon be under thy feet, thou shalt be cloathed with the Sun. These lower regions are dark and tempestuous; get up into heaven by Prayer, there is nothing but sere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>ity, and tranquillity. A devout and heavenly Prayer is like the Altar on <hi>Olympus,</hi> no blast of wind blows upon it. Say not in thine heart, Who shall go up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? <hi>Prayer</hi> will bring thee thither.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Prayer</hi> will breed those ravishing, and glorious joys, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it brings us into a communion with the fountain of joy and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> glory. It opens heaven to us, gives us approach unto that unacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable glory. See, <hi>Moses</hi> being in the Mount, in communion with God, his face was shining and glorious. As a man long conversant in some fragrant place, his very cloaths will carry those perfumes with him.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:104362:35"/>3. <hi>Prayer</hi> shews us the loving, and smiling, and gracious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> countenance of God; and the sight of that, is of a ravishing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy. <hi>In his face is life it self. The light of God's countenance gladded David more than oyl, and wine, Psal.</hi> iv. If He be angry, his frown is the message of death. <hi>Prayer</hi> pacifies him, and makes his countenance most amiable. If he turn away his countenance, we wither, our faces droop: if he shine upon us, we are refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 18. <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image from glory to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Prayer</hi> brings this rapture of joy, because it brings with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it a joyful assurance that our Prayers are accepted. Though our Prayers are not always succesful for Impetration, yet seldom but they seal up to us God's Acceptation, and so bring the fruit of sweet Consolation. It lays hold on the golden Scepter; breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us an heavenly tranquillity, peace of conscience, joy in the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> These secret cheerings, are like the fire from heaven that consumed the Sacrifice; and testifie, God is graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with thy Petitions. What joy like that of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to have Angels bring tidings of Gods Acceptation? <hi>Dan.</hi> v. 10. <hi>Fear not,</hi> Daniel, <hi>thy words are heard.</hi> Prayer encourages us, like <hi>Manoah</hi>'s <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wife, <hi>The Lord hath received a Burnt-offering, and a Meat-offering at our hand, he will not kill us,</hi> Judg. xiii. 23. Want of this made <hi>Cain</hi>'s countenance fall: This honour'd and encouraged <hi>Abel.</hi> Oh! those inward cheerings that a religious Prayer sheds into our souls; they are not inferiour to the tydings of Angels.</item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Prayer</hi> infuses these glorious joys, because it disburthens our grievances, all of them, into the bosom of God. If it be an ease to a troubled mind, to communicate its sorrow to some faithful friend, how much more comfortable is it, by Prayer, to unfold our sorrows into God's bosom, who pities our griefs, drys <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> up our tears? Thus <hi>David,</hi> in his sorrows, parleys with God, and his soul is refresh'd. See this in <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> i. 18. She was a woman of a sorrowful spirit: <hi>Elkanah</hi> could not comfort her: She prays in the bitterness of her soul, pours out her soul before the Lord; and see what comfort she finds in Prayer; <hi>Her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was no more sad.</hi> See it in <hi>David, Psal.</hi> vi. He was in much sickness and sorrow; <hi>Lord rebuke me not in thine ire.</hi> His soul was vexed, he was weary with groaning, beginning his Prayer with much anguish; but, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. he breaks out into a sudden joy, <hi>The Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping:</hi> vers. 9. <hi>The Lord hath heard</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>my Supplications, the Lord will receive my Prayer. Phil.</hi> iv. 6, 7. <hi>In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing by Prayer and Supplication with thanksgiving, let your request be made known unto God: And the Peace of God which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Iesus.</hi>

This duty religiously performed, even because it is an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> holy service, yields presently a sweet satisfaction and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the conscience: That, makes it ever applaud it self, and secretly to say to it self, <hi>I am glad I have done this holy duty.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 9. <hi>The people rejoyced when they offered willingly.</hi> So, at <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Sacrifice, the people went home with joy. As every sin leaves a sting after it; so, the duties of Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion calm the soul, and fill it with much joy and glory, even as if they heard an <hi>Euge</hi> from heaven.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now that this glorious effect may follow our Prayers, three conditions are required:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. They must be frequent. To be strange with God, to keep aloof from him, and yet to think that our rare and disused Prayers shall find such success, it is groundless. <hi>Daniel,</hi> who would not abstain thirty dayes, but thrice every day prayed, he had an Angel to assure him. <hi>Knock, Seek;</hi> they are words of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s thrice, <hi>David</hi>'s seven times, these find joy. Thou who art strange to God, canst thou wonder if he be strange to thee; if he impart not those joyes that are for his Favourites?</item>
                  <item>2. They must be cheerful. We must delight in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. God, he delights to hear us pray, <hi>Cant.</hi> ii. 14. <hi>Let me</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>see thy countenance, let me hear thy voyce; for sweet is thy voyce, and thy countenance is comely.</hi> If he delights to hear our Prayers, how should we delight in offering them to him? They who count it the burthen of their lives to pray, irksome, tedious, can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect little sweetness in this communion. No, <hi>David</hi> is glad to put himself into this communion, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxvii. 8. <hi>My heart hath tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of thee, Seek ye my face; Thy face, Lord, will I seek.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. They must be fervent. Our remiss, feeble, benummed suits, what force have they to work upon God, or upon our selves? See here, our Saviour prayes himself into heaven: In <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the garden, prayes himself into an Agony. <hi>Paul</hi> praying, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up into the third heaven. S. <hi>Peter</hi> praying, was cast into a trance: S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was ravish'd in spirit. Zeal, it is the wing of Prayer, the ladder of Heaven, like <hi>Elijah</hi>'s fiery Chariot. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our cold, slumbering suits, like Meteors in the Ayr, vanish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing. Nay, so far are they from Intention and Zeal, that they scarce have any Attention and Mind. Can such cold for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities invite God home into their heart? They at <hi>Emmaus</hi> were importunate with <hi>Christ,</hi> constrain'd him to stay with them. <hi>Lot</hi> urged the Angels to turn in to his house. Use these violences,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and thou breakest open heaven. <hi>David</hi>'s heart panted for God. Oh! <hi>When wilt thou come unto me?</hi> Oh! keep this passage open 'twixt God and thee; let no neglect, stop or damm it up.</item>

                        <item>1. Because his Humanity was only patient, and receptive,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in this glorious Alteration; had no activity to infuse this glory. That was but as a Lanthorn, which gives not light of it self; a Candle within it must shine, and enlighten it.</item>
                        <item>2. To intimate, that it was the Action of God the Father, putting Honour and Glory upon his Son; and not so much the Action of the Son, assuming Glory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: <hi>Father, Glorifie thy Son, that thy Son may Glorifie thee.</hi> The Merits were the Son's; the Rewards, his Father's.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

                  </item>
                  <item>2. It was <hi>Qualitativa mutatio;</hi> A Transfiguration; a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Alteration in the appearance, and qualities of his Body, not a substantial Alteration in the substance of it. <hi>Assumpsit gloriam, non deposuit naturam. Hieron.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>And from it, gather these Corollaries;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Haec fides nostra;</hi> It is a rule for our Faith. It was the same body of <hi>Christ,</hi> in nature and substance, <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> Glorification. <hi>Ubiquitaries,</hi> and so <hi>Papists,</hi> make <hi>Christ</hi>'s Glorification not to consist in investing of his body with glorious qualities, but in the abolishing, or turning his flesh into his Deity.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> No, <hi>Christ</hi>'s body here, and in heaven, is not changed in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural proportion, but enriched and beautified with heavenly endowments. His nature is not abolish'd, but onely replenish'd with Glory. Glory freed him from natural infirmities, it doth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104362:37"/>
not strip him of natural properties. Still, <hi>eadem quantit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> say, by virtue of Union, and glorification, it must be every where; <hi>Papists</hi> say, by virtue of glorification, it may be any where, in a thousand places at once. Thus in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have built him a Tabernacle of accidents and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. No; Glory, as Grace, perfects Nature; it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it. It is a qualitative, not a substantial alteration.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Haec gloria nostra.</hi> It was a qualitative alteration, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remaining the same; this is our glory. Our flesh is glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Christ,</hi> and he communicates to it a glorious condition.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> This is the advancement of our bodies. He assumed our body, not only for passion, but for glorification. Fond Hereticks say, he left this body behind him; No, he hath united it undividedly to him, dedicated it in himself to glory. <hi>Securae estote caro &amp; sanguis, occupÃ¢stis coelum in Christo, Hieron.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Haec spes nostra:</hi> This is our hope, that these our frail, earthly bodies shall be in his good time transfigured, and made like his glorious Body. <hi>Anabaptists</hi> dream of new bodies to be made. No; what he hath shewed me in his own, he can, and will perform in ours. <hi>Our vile bodies shall be made like his glorious body.</hi> His glorified body was <hi>primitiae,</hi> the First-fruits,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and they are pledges of the whole Crop.</item>

               <p>So much for the first, the kind or nature of this alteration, Now</p>
               <p>II. For the Subject of it,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It is <hi>Corpus,</hi> not <hi>Anima;</hi> his Body, not his Soul; this was not enriched with any new encrease of glory, but his body only. The Soul by virtue of the hypostatical Union, was replenished with all grace and glory from his Conception. Then he was annointed with the <hi>Oyl of gladness.</hi> He was <hi>comprehensor quoad animam ab instanti,</hi> but he was <hi>viator in corpore,</hi> that was in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> state of infirmity, and so capable of increase of glory. Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of glory to his Soul;</item>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. It was needless.</item>
                        <item>2. It was useless. This Transfiguration was purposed for the good, and profit of the Apostles, and so to be such as was observeable by them.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. It was <hi>vultus;</hi> his Face or countenance. No question, all his Body was cloathed with Majesty, but his Countenance was most Resplendent. That is <hi>sedes majestatis.</hi> What the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural beauty of our Saviour's countenance was, some curiously <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> enquire, and accordingly resolve it to be beyond all others, even beyond <hi>Adams</hi> in Paradice: But as <hi>Moses</hi> vayled his Face, so the Scripture hath put a Vaile of silence and concealment upon this of <hi>Christ.</hi> It is best to resolve; the habit of his Body, as it was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104362:37"/>
utterly free from the least blemish, and deformity, so was it also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> fitted and tempered to his state of humiliation, and infirmity.</item>
                  <item>3. It was <hi>vestitus;</hi> his Garments: that's the other subject of this alteration. And then follows;</item>
               </list>
               <p>III. The manner:</p>
               <p>1. His Countenance, that was <hi>shining as the Sun.</hi> Not but that <hi>Christ</hi>'s glorified Body doth now surpass all created Glory; all excellencies cannot equalize his Majesty. But;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. This is the most glorious Creature, to which we may resemble it.</item>
                  <item>2. This Transfiguration was not a full representation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his Heavenly Glory, but only a glimpse of it. <hi>Non erat plenitudo gloriae, sed similitudo.</hi> Had this <hi>Sun of righteousness shined in his full glory,</hi> the eyes of the Apostles could not have beheld it. <hi>He dwells in that light, that no eye can approach unto.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Now from this resemblance of <hi>Christ</hi>'s glory, <hi>as the Sun;</hi> deduce it into these particulars:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Sol,</hi> it is <hi>origo lucis;</hi> all light flows from the Sun, and is derived from it. The Starres shine by a borrowed light. So <hi>Christ,</hi> he is the original and <hi>Fons gloriae,</hi> the Fountain of glory.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> All his Saints, and Angels are opace dark in themselves; their light it is from him. He is <hi>Fons gratiae, &amp; gloriae,</hi> as the King is <hi>Fons honoris.</hi> From his fullness they receive all; he cloaths them with light; if he hide his face, they are eclipsed.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Solis splendor,</hi> it is <hi>purissimus;</hi> the light of the Sun, it is most refulgent. The Moon is waterish, the Starres glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering; but the Sun is most pure. So <hi>Christ,</hi> he is not onely pure, but purity it self. No mixture, or shadow of darkness, or corruption is in him. There are <hi>maculae in Luna, sic in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia;</hi> spots in the Moon, and so there are in the Church. <hi>The</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>Starres are impure in his sight. Cujus participatione, sumus justi, ejus comparatione sumus injusti.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Solis splendor,</hi> 'tis <hi>vegetans;</hi> the light of the Sun it enlivens, and quickens, and gives vivacity to all creatures. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers say, without the influence of the Sun, no creature can live; This being eclipsed, all things languish. In its departure, there is nothing but fading and dying; in its return it gives vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity. So <hi>Christ,</hi> he is the Fountain of spiritual and glorious life. A gracious aspect from him, enlivens us, as it did S. <hi>Peter, Malach.</hi> iv. 2. <hi>The Sun of righteousness comes with healing in his</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>wings; and ye shall go forth and grow as the Calves of the stall.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Solis splendor,</hi> it is <hi>laetificans;</hi> the light of the Sun it is cheering and comforting. <hi>It is a good thing to see the Sun;</hi> darkness is sad, and irksome. So <hi>Christ</hi> refreshes and glads the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104362:38"/>
Soul, <hi>Ps.</hi> iv. 7. the light of his countenance puts <hi>gladness in my</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>We have seen his Countenance, <hi>shining as the Sun;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See,</p>
               <p>2. His Garments; these are shining, and glorious. And it is express'd three waies;</p>

               </list>
               <p>Here are two Queries that may be put;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Why are his garments glorious? A gloryfied body shall have no other garments, then the robes of immortality, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? True: but <hi>Christ</hi> was;</item>

                        <item>1. Not <hi>instatu gloriae,</hi> but only <hi>in actu,</hi> in a transeunt pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of glory.</item>
                        <item>2. Not in the fullness of glory, but in some resemblance. In Heaven he cloaths himself <hi>with light as with a garment,</hi>

Look upon all the Beauties that are in the world, the most glorious, and resplendent creatures, and unite all their excellencies, and raise up thy thoughts by them, and from them to the contemplation of that glory which is in Heaven. View the curious rarities of Art, and Nature. Is the Snow, a vanishing Meteor, so white? The material Heavens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> so pure? The Lilly so beautiful? Oh! Our <hi>Solomon</hi> in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is cloath'd more richly then any of these.

                  <item>1. This Transfiguration of <hi>Christ</hi> was but a glimpse of his Glory, no full manifestation. He shews here but one beam of his Majesty, not the full lustre and splendour of it. When he comes in full Glory, troops and millions of Saints and Angels shall wait upon him. Now he more privately discovers himself, in the view of a few: and if he be now so glorious, how resplendent will he be in all his Saints, and holy Angels?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. These Saints present, are not present for attendance only, but as witnesses, to give testimony to the Son of God. And two witnesses of such choice and note, of so great authority to seal and assure us of <hi>Christ</hi>'s glorious Divinity, are sufficient. <hi>At the mouth of two witnesses,</hi> or, <hi>at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established, Deut.</hi> xix. 15. There need no more. Here therefore onely three from earth are assumed to this vision, and two onely from heaven. Hereafter, <hi>Every eye shall see him;</hi> Now the sight of him is more reserved and mystical, and of a more reserved dispensation.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Two Saints are assumed into attendance of this Glory, others are omitted; to shew and figure out a disparity and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Glory in those blessed Spirits. All the Saints have their portion of bliss, but in their proportion, not in a just equality. As from earth he hath his favourites, three choyse Apostles, the rest stood at a more remote distance; so, in heaven, though all are happy, yet have they their measures, and degrees of Glory. These <hi>two</hi> in the Text are taken into a greater nearness, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a more full view of <hi>Christ;</hi> others were waiting his coming into heaven, longing for, and expecting his glorious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> These had the favour of seeing him before in the dayes of their flesh. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> saw his back-parts: These again are dignified with this glorious Apparition; assumed with him into his triumphant Chariot, as <hi>Iehu</hi> did assume <hi>Ionadab.</hi>

No, he assumes not Angels, but these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                  <item>1. They were, <hi>magis idonei Testes,</hi> more competent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient witnesses of his Deity and Mediatourship, then the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest Angels. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> should be of more prevailing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therity, then the Angels. These had Authority of teaching in the Church. And they bear record here, in relation to what they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104362:40"/>
were before, with respect to the Scriptures, of which they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Pen-men, and Teachers. This is a great assurance of Truth, that those Saints who first published the tidings of Salvation, are now eye-witnesses; feel, and find the truth of what they Preached. <hi>Remember them who have spoken to you the word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation, Heb.</hi> xiii. 7. That Doctrine which they taught, brought them to Glory.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Duo homines, Two men;</hi> they attend this Glory of <hi>Christ,</hi> because they are more concerned in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Incarnation, and Mediatourship. These are not onely Spectators, but Partners. Our Salvation, and bliss, is the main aym of <hi>Christ;</hi> the glory of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Angels is less principal, and accessory. <hi>He took not upon him their nature;</hi> fulfilled not their Covenant. <hi>To us he was born;</hi> to us he lived; for us he died. They are not the <hi>Spouse,</hi> but the friends of the <hi>Spouse.</hi> The Church is <hi>Christ's Spouse;</hi> they, like S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> rejoyce at the sight of it. As when God led the <hi>Israelites</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> a <hi>mixed</hi> people followed them, and entred in with them: so we are the choise people, who are led into heaven; Angels are but Inmates in heaven, in respect of us. And heaven is said to be <hi>prepared</hi> for us, not for Angels. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. <hi>Hell is prepared for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> but not so Heaven; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this is not prepared for the Angels, but for you. The joyes of heaven, are called, <hi>A sitting down with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob,</hi> not with Angels, <hi>in the kingdom of heaven.</hi> They are but <hi>Pocilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores,</hi> but Servitours and Attendants upon our Glory.</item>
                  <item>3. It is more comfort to the Apostles, to see Men in Glory with <hi>Christ,</hi> rather then Angels. Angels in heaven were <hi>ab ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi> there, never excluded; but to see Men assumed, this shews that the virtue of our Mediatour hath opened Paradise again, quenched the fiery Sword, reconciled us, and given entrance for our banished Nature into the state of Glory. It was comfort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for the captive-Jews, to see <hi>Daniel,</hi> and his fellows, advanced by the king of <hi>Babel,</hi> and made chief in the kingdom; for to see <hi>Hester</hi> made Queen, and <hi>Vashti</hi> neglected: so, to see flesh of our flesh, Men in the same captivity and condemnation, reconciled, glorified; it bids us hope well for a gracious admission.</item>

No, here we see the main Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> he adores him, as Lord of the Prophets, to whom all Prophets ministred, ushered in, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.

                        <item>2. The eyes of the Apostles give evidence of this Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

                     </list>
                     <p>Now this reality of Appearance, assures us of two Truths:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Is <hi>Veritas Immortalitatis;</hi> the truth of the Immortality of souls and spirits: The spirits of these two holy men, are living and immortal. It is a wicked opinion of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> now raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Jews, that the souls are extinguished with the bodies. Here is not onely <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they rejected; but <hi>Moses,</hi> whom they believed, is here really exhibited. This is the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Faith; <hi>Ye are come to the spirits of just men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> This is a foundation of Religion. If no Immortality hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no Piety here. How carnally drunk do many live, as if there were no soul, or no Immortality?</item>
                        <item>
                           <p>2. Is <hi>Veritas,</hi> the truth, nay more, <hi>facilitas Resurrectionis,</hi>
                              <pb n="73" facs="tcp:104362:43"/>
the easiness of the Resurrection. <hi>Elias,</hi> indeed, in body was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> translated; but <hi>Moses</hi> was dead, and buried in the plain of <hi>Moab;</hi> yet here his body is united to his soul, and appears in Glory. How easily can the Lord of our bodies and souls, raise, and place our bodies in Glory? See, he beckens <hi>Elias</hi> out of heaven, <hi>Moses</hi> out of his grave. <hi>Moses</hi> his body was not as <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s, <hi>four days,</hi> but two thousand years in the grave, yet at the <hi>nutus</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> is it raised, and united. Our bodies and souls shall be in his hands, not onely for safety, and custody; but for guidance, and disposal. Speak but the word, Lord, and thy servants shall revive.</p>
                           <p>That's the first; a real Appearance.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                     <p>II. It is a glorious Appearance; <hi>Appear'd in Glory. Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> being attendants upon <hi>Christ,</hi> appear in Glory, as Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men appear in greatest Magnificence, to attend the King.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Here is the glory of the Saints, to attend <hi>Christ</hi> in Glory. The Jews thought if <hi>Christ</hi> were advanced, <hi>Moses</hi> must down. Whosoever preached <hi>Christ,</hi> spake against <hi>Moses.</hi> No, <hi>Moses</hi> was never so glorious, as in this Attendance. It is otherwise with this Sun of righteousness, and the Saints; then with the body of the Sun and the Stars. These do, <hi>occidere heliace,</hi> not appear when they come nearer to the Sun: But our Sun of Glory makes these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Stars, the nearer they be, to be the more glorious. As in <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s dream, the Sun, Moon, and Stars were all shining together.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appear gloriously in <hi>Christ</hi>'s presence. <hi>Moses</hi> is then made manifest and clear, when <hi>Christ</hi> comes. Take <hi>Moses,</hi> asunder, and without <hi>Christ,</hi>

                              <item>2.

               <p>I. The Action, <hi>Collocuti;</hi> They talked. It was no dumb shew, and representation to gaze upon; but an holy and heavenly communication. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> if they appear, they appear as Prophets, speaking, and conferring; either speaking of God, or to God. It is the life of a Prophet in heaven; day and night, without ceasing, there is nothing but speaking.

In the Scriptures, we find <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets conferring with <hi>Christ,</hi> which S. <hi>Peter</hi> preferrs before this Vision, and calls 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 19. <hi>A more sure word of Prophecy.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Colloquium,</hi> this Speaking, implyes two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Consensum.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Familiaritatem.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Consensum.</hi> It teaches us, That there is a sweet agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> with our Saviour <hi>Christ;</hi> that there is no repugnancy or contradiction 'twixt the Old, and New Testament, but a sweet harmony and agreement. Here, the Law and the Prophets, like the two Cherubs, are both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing, and looking upon the Mercy-Seat. This <hi>Christ</hi> taught his Disciples; <hi>All things must be fulfilled which were written in</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>and in the Prophets, and in the Psalmes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, Luk.</hi> xxiv. 44. There were certain Hereticks in S. <hi>Aug.</hi> time, who professed themselves enemies to the Law, and the Prophets. But, <hi>Non potes segregare Legem ab Evangelio, ut nec umbram Ã  corpore. The Lord thy God will raise unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me,</hi> saith <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> xviii. 15. Like unto me, not contrary to me. The same Religion, the same substantial Truth, the same Grace and Salvation is in both Testaments. There is a variety of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but the same Truth and Substance; there is the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of both. Thus S. <hi>Iames</hi> answers this doubt, <hi>Known to the Lord are all his works from the beginning;</hi> it is no change in God. As the prescripts of the Physician, are some of one kind to day, to morrow of another, both ayming at the health of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; <hi>Aug.</hi> The Gospel was comprehended in the Law, the Law is explained, and cleared in the Gospel. The Law shews <hi>Moses</hi> vailed, the Gospel unvails him.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Denotat familiaritatem.</hi> Their talk and conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth a sweet and holy familiarity, and communion with God on earth. As of <hi>Moses</hi> it was said, <hi>The Lord spake unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend, Exod.</hi> xxxiii. 11.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Observe, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were men of much communion with God upon earth; many heavenly entercourses passed between
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104362:44"/>
them; and now they are admitted into a near, and sweet, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> familiar communication. Men of communion with God here, shall be received with more free access, and familiar conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Christ</hi> in heaven. They who never maintain speech with God here, how can they look to have access in heaven? They who love to come into his presence, delight in hearing him speak to them, and they to him by Prayer and Meditation, they shall have nearest, and freest, and sweetest communion hereafter. That's the first; the Action, <hi>Collocuti sunt, They talked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. The Person, <hi>Cum Christo, With Christ;</hi> Not with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; nor the Apostles with them. Here was a miraculous Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but no parley; nor entercourse.</p>
               <p>Observe; Here is no shew, or appearance of any entercourse 'twixt Christians on earth, and the Saints in heaven; no invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or salutation on the Apostles part; no revelation, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on these Prophets part. The Lord hath purposely estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged us from all entercourse, 'twixt us and the Spirits departed. There is no need of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> to speak from heaven; we have <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and all that they can say, behoofeful for us, in their Books and Writings. <hi>Ye are come to the Spirits of just</hi>

                  <hi>men made perfect, and to Iesus the Mediatour of the New Testament, Heb.</hi> xii. 23, 24. He is the onely Mediatour.</p>
               <p>III. The Matter of this Conference, <hi>His decease, which he should accomplish at Ierusalem.</hi> Had some the reporting of this Conference, it should have been of some other matters. May be, of the Succession of Times and Kingdoms; of the rising and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Monarchies. These the Prophets were acquainted with; but these they talk not of. Others would have reported some Seraphical discourse of the nine Orders of Angels, and those Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchies; or some great discourse of <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> or of the souls in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> No such matter; it is here, <hi>De morte Christi, Of</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                  <hi>Christ's decease.</hi> But,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Why do they conferr about this?</item>
                  <item>2. How do they talk of it?</item>
                  <item>3. Why do they conferr about the death of <hi>Christ?</hi>

               <list>
                  <item>1. This is the grand, necessary, fundamental Work of <hi>Christ</hi> for his Church. If such a Synod as this meet, it is not for trifles; but they talk of the Common Salvation of the Church. That is the Capital Truth, the ground-work of all our Faith, and Salvation. This takes up their discourse: Nay, it is the Meditation of God; His ancient thought from Eternity was busied about this, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                  <item>2. This they <hi>talked</hi> of, as a thing that was a great grief, and offence to the Apostles. A little before, <hi>Peter</hi> abhorred to hear of <hi>Christ</hi>'s death. It bred in them;</item>

                  <item>3. This they <hi>talked</hi> of, as the thing that both Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets prefigured, and foretold. All their Sacrifices were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of his Death; all their Prophesies, Predictions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it: <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, Luk.</hi> xxiv. 46.

                  </item>
                  <item>4. This they <hi>talked</hi> of, as the matter of <hi>Christ</hi>'s greatest Glory and Renown. They being to Adore <hi>Christ,</hi> and to put Honour upon him, they invest him with his Garments dipp'd in Blood. <hi>Isa.</hi> lxiii. 1. <hi>Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed Garments from Bozrah? This that is glorious in his Apparel, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in the greatness of his strength, mighty to save?</hi> What Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour like this, to dye for his Church, to be the Sacrifice of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> World, the Ransom of Mankind, the Conquerour of Hell, the Purchaser of his Chosen? <hi>Quapropter, Wherefore God alsoâ€”hath given him a Name, which is far above every name, Philip.</hi> ii. 9. <hi>Absit,</hi> therefore, saith S. <hi>Paul, ut gloriarer nisi in Cruce Christi; God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross of Christ, Galat.</hi> vi. 14.</item>
                  <item>5. This they <hi>talked</hi> of, as the main matter of heavenly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Here is <hi>Colloquium de Morte. Christ</hi> puts himself into this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> premeditation of Death, for two purposes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <p>1. As a moderation of his present Glory and Majesty, into which he is advanced. Being thus magnified by his Father, and raised to an high pitch of Glory, he seasons it with this deep, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104362:47"/>
serious meditation of his Death and Passion. The thoughts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> our end and dissolution, are never unseasonable, but yet they are most sutable and seasonable in our greatest advancements, and prosperity. When you abound with all outward comforts, then allay, and moderate thy joy with this mortifying Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I must lye down in the grave.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Christ</hi> interchangeably; In his Humiliation, he refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself with the expectation of Glory: When he stands at the Bar, <hi>Ye shall see</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Son of man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming in the clouds of heaven, Matth.</hi> xxvi. 64. And so before his Passion; <hi>O Father, glorifie me with thine</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                        <hi>own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was, Ioh.</hi> xvii. 5. Contrarily; being in the state of Glory, he puts himself into the cogitations of Death. When the Graecians came to visit, and do honour to him, he discourseth of his Passion; <hi>Except a corn of Wheat fall into the ground, and dye, it abideth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, Ioh.</hi> xii. 24. Naturally, Abundance, and worldly prosperity, raises our thoughts too high, makes us forgetful, nay, to abhor the mention of death. Greatness, like <hi>Ahashuerus,</hi> will have no mourning, nor sackcloth, <hi>Esther</hi> iv. 2. to appear before him. As the Wiseman hath it, <hi>O Mors, quam amara!

                        <hi>Death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to them that are at ease in their possessions!</hi> The thought of Death, it should be like that <hi>Stimulus carnis,</hi> that Thorn in the flesh, to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> lest I should be pufft up with abundance of Revelations. Thus the Apostle exhorts; <hi>Brethren, the time is short,â€”Let them that rejoyce, be as though they rejoyced not,â€”and they that use the world,</hi> as not over-using it, <hi>for the fashion of the world passeth away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 29, 30, 31. Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> admitted into conference with God, cryes out, <hi>I am but dust and ashes, Gen.</hi> xviii. 27.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Christ</hi> puts himself into this premeditation of Death,</p>

                  <item>
                     <p>2. As a condition of his future Glory. This Transfiguration, it was a glimpse of his after-Glory, into which he was to enter: a pawn and pledge of the full Possession. But yet, as knowing that through sufferings and death, he must enter into it, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditates, and considers of his Death and Passion. Thus <hi>he must suffer, and enter into his Glory, Luke</hi> xxiv. 26.</p>
                     <p>No certainty or evidence of Glory and Salvation, must make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> us forget, nay, it ought daily to re-mind us of, the means and conditions of our glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 17. <hi>Ioynt-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we also may be glorified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Our hope of heaven, like the discourse of the Spies, Oh it

is a good land! should incourage us to endure any thing: Let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> us arm our selves, say they, and fight for it, and win it with the sword. If I be Predestinate, I shall be saved, live as I list; it is the voyce of an Atheist. No: <hi>Having these Promises, let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 1. <hi>Let us work out our own salvation with fear and trembling, Phil.</hi> ii. 12.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Use.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This should teach us to be frequent and abundant in these thoughts of Death; to season all our meditations, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with that deep consideration. It hath a manifold virtue and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> use in our whole lives.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It hath a virtue of abating the glut and surfeit of all wordly pleasures; it will damp those vain lusts that boil in our hearts. Let the Adulterer know that his body must one day lye in the grave, it will make him tremble at the defiling of it: Let this thought appear, like the Hand-writing on the wall, it will make the Cup fall out of the hand of the Drunkard. Let the Covetous man hear of, <hi>Stulte, hac nocte, Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be taken from thee,</hi> and he will moderate his craving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thoughts.</item>
                  <item>2. It hath a virtue of perswading to Repentance, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God; and preserving of such a Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that may not affright, but refresh, and comfort us in our last need.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p>3. It hath a power of abating the fear and horror of Death when it approacheth. Death's face is dismal, acquaint thy self daily with it, view it, look upon it, forecast it in thy mind; it will not seem terrible, when it approacheth to thee.

               <list>
                  <item>1. Respectively to this Life; so it is <hi>Negatio Durationis:</hi> It tells us, This life, it is not a state of perpetuity, and continual duration. <hi>Exodus</hi> here, is never used, but in the people's leaving of Egypt, in their departure from thence. Their being there,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was but a sojourning in a strange Land, as God calls it. Egypt was no perpetuity. This the faith of all the Saints professed, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 13. <hi>They confessed they were strangers and pilgrims upon earth;</hi> they had no abiding place; dwelt in tents, as strangers, and travellers; laid no foundations, sought an after-City. Thus
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104362:48"/>
our life is called, the time of a souldier; the stay of a wayfaring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> man; the age of an hireling; all, terms of flitting, and expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; an Apprentiship, a Stewardship; all limited, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p>2. Respectively to Death; so it is, <hi>Negatio Annihilationis.</hi> Death is a departure, therefore no destruction, and absolute ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. Were we of the faith of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> Death were no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, departure, passage; but a quenching of the life, a destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the soul, an annihilation of the spirit. No, our Souls die not, but depart onely. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it, <hi>A returning of the soul to God, Eccles.</hi> xii. 7. Immortality is a part of that Image of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which remains indelible. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Death, <hi>A dissolution,</hi> or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; not a destruction, and annihilation. The light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taught it the Heathen, and the light of Scripture assures it us. <hi>If in this life onely we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 19. The very Philosophers discourse of the regions of souls, and world of spirits; and places of aboad, even after this life.</p>

                        <item>1. Is <hi>Mors, exitus?</hi> Is Death a departure? It must make that word sound in our ears, <hi>Migremus hinc;</hi> fix not your rest,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and aboad in this world. The Saints profess, they belong to another City. Indeed, <hi>David</hi> calls the wicked, <hi>The men of this world, Psal.</hi> xvii. 14. They settle here, make this their heaven: But this must assure us, this life is but an Annuity, it is not a Perpetuity. <hi>The fashion of this world passeth,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul. The world passeth away, and the lusts thereof,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iohn. Sedemus hic juxta flumina Babylonis, omnia trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eunt.</hi> Look upon all things here, as such that must be left. He who is to remove from a Farm, takes not that care as if it were his own; 'tis not mine Inheritance. Engage not your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> selves too deeply, build not too strongly. The <hi>Rechabites</hi> expecting Captivity, built no houses, but dwelt in tents.</item>
                        <item>2. Is <hi>Mors, exitus?</hi> Is Death a departure? Then see thou fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all thy work, <hi>Quia decedendum. What thou hast to do, do it with thy might: for there is no work, nor device, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor wisdome in the grave, whither thou goest, Eccles.</hi> ix. 10. Might we stay as long as we list, or return again when we please, then we might presume: but, <hi>Statutum est semel mori, It is appointed to men once to dye, Heb.</hi> ix. 27. If we were to return, and die again, we might recover our omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but we must accomplish all now, for if Death once comes, there is no return from the grave. It is otherwise with our <hi>Exodus,</hi> then with the Israelites: they carried their dough upon their shoulders; they had not prepared for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104362:48"/>
themselves any victuals, <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 39. but they did it in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their passage: But if our departure find our work unfinish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is no recovery; then all thoughts perish, all hands fall; no work, or counsel, or purpose any more.</item>

                           <p>3. Is <hi>Mors, exitus?</hi> Is Death a departure? Provide, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast for a place of refuge. Death is like a cruel Landlord, turns us out of dores. What folly is it, not to provide a place to receive us? This <hi>Christ</hi> commends in the Parable of the Steward; <hi>Make to your selves friendsâ€”that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations, Luk.</hi> xvi. 9. This was our Saviour's comfort, <hi>I leave the world,</hi>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here is <hi>Susceptio Conditionis.</hi> It is called an accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or fulfilling; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>. It is Active, not Passive; not to be fulfilled upon him, but by him; he himself to accomplish. <hi>Christ</hi>'s <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Death, as appointed by God, was unavoidable, and necessary; as inflicted by his enemies, it was violent and enforced; yet he himself, voluntarily undergoing and performing of it, it is his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fulfilling. <hi>Christ</hi>'s sufferings were not bare sufferings, but voluntary performances. He was Lord of his own life; <hi>No man takes it from me; I lay it down.</hi> That which gave merit and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to <hi>Christ</hi>'s suffering, was his willing, and free, and active undertaking of it. And as in <hi>Christ,</hi> so in Christians, their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, their deaths, they are active in them, not patients onely. A wicked man, Death gnaws upon him, he is snatch'd to Death; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a Christian willingly admits of it: When God calls, he offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as <hi>Christ</hi> did. <hi>Quis tam facile dormivit? I lye me down</hi> and rest. <hi>Egredere, Ã´ Anima.â€”Non repetent animam, ego reddam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:104362:49"/>Now this under-going of death, it is called an <hi>accomplishing,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a <hi>fulfilling;</hi>
               </p>

                  <item>
                     <p>1. In respect of God's counsel, and ordination. <hi>Christ's</hi> death was appointed from eternity; he had purposed and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layd it. <hi>Act.</hi> iv. 28. <hi>To do whatsoever thy hand, and thy counsel determined before to be done: He is the Lamb slain from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world,</hi> in God's wisdom appointing it, in his truth promising it, in faith believing it; only his actual suffering, that accomplish'd it. <hi>Ought not Christ to suffer these things, and so to enter into his glory?</hi> This makes <hi>Christ</hi> so studious to admit of death; else how should the Scripture be fulfilled.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                     </p>
                     <p>This consideration makes the Saints suffer all things, Death it self, naturally, willingly. <hi>This commandement received I of my Father; The end of my times are in thy hand. To God belong the issues of death: Ps.</hi> lxviii. If chance, or violence only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, Flesh and Bloud may struggle; but God's appointment, that makes us submit; <hi>I held my peace, because it is thy doing. Moses,</hi> when God expressed his resolution, he must die, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes no more, goes up to the Mountain, layes down his life. S. <hi>Peter</hi> layd down his life, as the Lord had shewed him; <hi>The will of the Lord be done.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                  </item>
                  <item>2. Death is called an <hi>accomplishment,</hi> or <hi>fulfilling</hi> of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, because that is but the closure and ending. All our life, 'tis a beginning, and progress to our end. As all <hi>Christ</hi>'s life, it was a <hi>pro-passio</hi> to his <hi>Passio;</hi> his sufferings were all <hi>Viae ad mortem;</hi> so our life, it is a progress to death. We no sooner come into the world but we begin to go out. <hi>We die daily</hi> in this sense. That part of our life that is gone, it is <hi>Morti depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanda;</hi> it runns upon the score of Death. Indeed eternal life, it is <hi>tota, &amp; simultanea possessio vitae,</hi> 'tis <hi>vita in statu,</hi> fixed; but this, is <hi>in fluxu,</hi> as waters alwayes flowing. Youth, 'tis the death <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Child-hood; Man-hood, the death of Youth; Age, the death of Man-hood; then Death closes all. Philosophers say, <hi>motus</hi> and <hi>terminus</hi> are but one thing really; so our passing and consummation of life, it is but one continued-death.</item>

                     <p>1. It is, <hi>Locus singularitÃ¨r designatus;</hi> a place singularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed. All the Circumstances of <hi>Christ</hi>'s death were fore-sett <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and appointed; The time of it was foretold, and calculated by <hi>Daniel;</hi> the manner of it was prefigured, and foretold by the Prophets; the place, all the occasions, and instruments and circumstances were designed. As the Paschal-Lamb, was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104362:49"/>
not onely commanded to be slain, but on what day, in what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> place it was to be dressed, in what manner to be eaten.</p>
                     <p>And as it is so in <hi>Christ</hi>'s death, so likewise in ours. Our times are set and fixed; the period of our life, the circumstance of place, all occurrents fore-layd. Thus God appoints <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> both time and place to die in. Thus <hi>Elias</hi> must now, and in such a manner be assumed. Thus S. <hi>Peter</hi> was fore-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by what manner of death <hi>he must glorifie God.</hi> So <hi>Agabus</hi> shews S. <hi>Paul</hi> how he must be bound. It must settle our hearts; Our lives are in God's book set, that time is fixed; as was the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                        <hi>Exodus</hi> of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> the self-same day. It must make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe up our selves, our deaths, the whole carriage of them, to God's wise disposal.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. It is, <hi>Locus typicÃ¨ praefiguratus: Hierusalem,</hi> that was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and prefigured as the place of <hi>Christ</hi>'s death. This was prefigured in <hi>Isaac</hi>'s Offering on Mount <hi>Moriah.</hi> On this Hill <hi>David</hi> Offer'd, to cease the Plague. This place he appointed, to build the Temple on. There was no Altar we know allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but this of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> Here the Passeover was to be slain and eaten. Thus the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 11. <hi>The bodies of those</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>beasts, whose bloud was brought into the Sanctuary by the High Priest for sin, are burnt without the Camp, v.</hi> 12. <hi>Wherefore, Iesus also that he might sanctifie the people with his own bloud, suffered without the Gate.</hi> It must seal up unto us the fulfilling of all our Redemption. Every Circumstance was prefigured, and is now accomplished. Now was the great Jubilee when <hi>Christ</hi> dyed; now the whole Burnt-Offering was tendred up to God.</item>
                  <item>3. It is, <hi>Locus moraliter praefigurans Ecclesiam. Christ</hi> must die at <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> that is, his death it is proper to, and effectual for his Church and people. Out of the bounds of the Church, there is no redemption, or salvation. He who is out of this Ark,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> perishes; he who eats the Passeover out of this house, is accursed; he who lives out of this <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> is an Heathen. They erre, who teach, In any Religion there is possibility of salvation. No, <hi>Salvation is of the Iews,</hi> sayd <hi>Christ;</hi> so now, Of the Christians. <hi>Basan</hi> is an high Mountain; but this is God's Mountain, where it pleaseth him to dwell. They erre too, who teach, that <hi>Christ</hi>'s sufferings may profit even <hi>extra Ecclesiam;</hi> and that there is a common grace beyond the pales of the Church. No, no sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice but in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> no grace but in the Church. That is the place to which God hath respect: <hi>There he hath commanded a</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>blessing, and life for evermore.</hi> If <hi>Shimei</hi> peep in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> (his lines pass but to <hi>Gath</hi>) he dies for it.</item>

               <p>I. Conceive it, <hi>ut naturalis infirmitas,</hi> as a natural Infirmity.

Nay the Evangelist singles out <hi>Peter,</hi> as the chief Sleeper. So in the Garden, these when they should have assisted and refresh'd <hi>Christ</hi> in his Passion, they were then fallen a sleep again. And <hi>Christ</hi> singles out <hi>Peter; Simon, couldest thou not watch one hour?</hi> It is true, as Commentators conceive, it was in the time of Sleep. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest were no Church-sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but being called to watch on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Night, the weakness of Nature prevailed upon them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> This is the condition of the best Saints; <hi>Corpus quod corrumpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, degravat animam.</hi> We live here a life of necessities; we should wish to have Evangelical bodies, alwayes to attend his Glory, and service. But while we bear about us these clogs of corruption, we are sunk downward, even in our best perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.

               <p>The Reason, and Purpose of this present departure, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> may be given in divers congruities:</p>

Having performed this service, they depart from him, and leave the world.</p>
                     <p>It represents to us the date of the Saints continuance with us; they have their employment, and having finished that work, they are removed and withdrawn from us. Till <hi>Moses</hi> hath done his work, no weakness nor decay appeared in him; when that time is finish'd, no strength can prolong him. <hi>Elias</hi> must not be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his life, till he hath finished his course; when that is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, he is fetched away presently. The Saints, in this respect,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are like to <hi>Iacob</hi>'s vision of Angels; they were all <hi>Ascendentes, &amp; descendentes, non commorantes.</hi> As S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> comparing those two places in the <hi>Acts;</hi> first S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s escaping in a basket out of <hi>Damascus, Acts</hi> ix. 24. and his resolute going to <hi>Ierusalem, Acts</hi> xxi. 13. observes, till S. <hi>Paul</hi> had done his work, he shifts for his life; when he had finished it, he offers himself to death. It is the condition of all the Saints, <hi>Having served their generations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counsel of God,</hi> they are withdrawn, and no more converse with us. As a faithful servant makes no lingring, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, but being sent, and having dispatched his business, as <hi>Elizae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>-servant,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> salutes no man, but returns back again. We wish the continuance of the Saints with us: No, they have their work set them, their time set them, and having accomplished that, they must not fix here; but return to him whose Agents and Servants

Even the glory of the Saints in heaven is thus dispensatively, and by degrees, vouchsafed unto them. They in heaven lived in expectation of this blessed Appearance: and, till then, lissening, and looking to see their Saviour; they cry,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>How long, Lord, how long?</hi> As before his Descention, the Saints on earth cried, <hi>Oh that thou wouldst bow the heavens, and come down!</hi> So they in heaven were wishing, Oh that the heavens might open to receive him back again. Their full consummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will not be made perfect, till we, with <hi>Christ,</hi> be caught up in the clouds. They are, <hi>Sub Altare, non super Thronos.</hi> They are cloathed in Whites, <hi>Sed nondum Duplicibus induuntur;</hi> they must wait for that accomplishment.

The presence of the Saints departed, is not to be expected, nor imagined, but onely in these cases of Miraculous Employment. There is not onely a gulph of Separation 'twixt hell and heaven, but a distance of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration also 'twixt heaven and us. We have heard, in Popery, of the many Walkings and Appearances of the Saints departed: But they are all of them dreams of deceived Men, or lyes of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Devils, except this Appearance.

So, if all other sweet societies break, yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if <hi>Christ</hi> abide with us.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Come we to the Request it self: And in it,</p>
               <p>I. Of the Motion for Continuance; <hi>Bonum est nobis esse hic; It is good for us to be here.</hi> This is a mix'd Motion: And let us consider in it, <hi>Quae vera, &amp; bona;</hi> and then when we come to the Censure, we will consider, <hi>Quae temerÃ¨, &amp; ineptÃ©.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Motion for Continuance, there are several Truths, and very considerable:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>PrimÃ² territi, nunc gaudio affecti;</hi> First, we saw them cast into a kind of Astonishment, <hi>In somno ecstatico;</hi> now see it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ends in Joy and Comfort. It is the order of Gods making himself known; first, to strike us with fear, to bring us to comfort; first, Astonishments; then, Consolations. Thus he dealt with <hi>Mary:</hi> first, she was afraid; then, she was raised to <hi>Sing her Magnificat.</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:104362:56"/>
So, with <hi>Zechary:</hi> So, with the Shepherds. The Devil, on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> contrary, he breeds false joys, but leaves true terrours in the soul. That's one Considerable.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Societas Sanctorum semper desideranda. Peter</hi> was loth to leave the Company, and Society of these holy men. Oh! It is good to be here always. <hi>The Communion of Saints, it is a great part of heaven: You are come to the Assembly of the First-born; to the spirits of just men made perfect. David</hi> professes, <hi>Psal.</hi> xvi. 3. <hi>All his delight is in the Saints on earth.</hi> Ill company is a pattern of hell; hasten from them: But the fellowship of the Saints is a ravishing comfort; hasten to them. Hast thou the company of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a Saint? Prize it; but, <hi>Depart from the Tents of those wicked men, Numb.</hi> xvi. 26. That's a second Considerable. The last is,</item>
                  <item>3. The joyes of Glory, and Presence of <hi>Christ,</hi> are ravishing and transporting. Nothing doth so satisfie the soul, and inebriate the spirit, as these rays and beams of Glory. <hi>Oh! taste and see how good,</hi> how sweet, <hi>God is.</hi> Now, how transporting the Comfort is, that is in the glorious Presence of <hi>Christ,</hi> will appear by these five Comparisons:</item>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Comparatively to all outward joyes and comforts; It makes him forget all; he thinks not of kindred, friends, any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> worldly comfort; he can be content never to go down from this Mount more; bids adieu to father, friends, houses; all are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to being here.</item>

Comparatively to all other manifestations of God out of <hi>Christ; Moses,</hi> he trembles; <hi>Manoah</hi> quakes; <hi>Abraham</hi> is asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd; <hi>Daniel,</hi> he is dead. Oh! God out of <hi>Christ,</hi> is fearful; God in <hi>Christ,</hi> is gracious. The Glory of God, affrights; the Glory of <hi>Christ,</hi> cheers, and refreshes.</item>

               <p>We have seen the Motion for Continuance, It is good <hi>being here.</hi> Now follows,</p>
               <p>II. The proffer of service to further this Continuance; <hi>Let us make three Tabernacles, one for Thee, one for Moses, one for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias.</hi> It is a mix'd Motion; and though rash, and unadvised, and unreasonable; yet, for the generality, it carries with it some, not onely excusable, but commendable affections, in S. <hi>Peters</hi> making <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of it. It was, <hi>Inconsulta, &amp; praematura Devotio. Ambros.</hi> Unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, and rash; but yet well-meant, and devout.</p>
               <p>View the Prints of Devotion and Goodness that were in it; and in the Censure we shall see the weaknesses of it; the blots of imperfection that were in it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first Print of Devotion and Piety, is, That he proffers to erect a Tabernacle for <hi>Christ,</hi> and these Saints. Observe, The Presence of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Saints, is to be honoured with our best services: No pains, or cost, can be too precious to entertain such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a Presence as our Saviour's. S. <hi>Peter</hi> puts not off <hi>Christ</hi> with emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Observances; Adoring his Glory, Admiring his Beauty, with wishes onely for his Continuance; but bethinks himself of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating, and devoting his Labours and Cost to Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him. Naturally, Religion consults with the Shunamite, What shall we do for him? If he be a God, then there must be a Religion, and Worship; if that, then a Temple, or Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and if that, then it must be answerable to his Glory, in the comeliest manner: These are the natural consequences of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Piety. See <hi>David,</hi> how careful he was to erect a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle for Gods Worship? So forward was he, that the Prophet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> must restrain him, and cool his Devotion; <hi>I will not serve the Lord with that which cost me nothing;</hi> refusing ease, and help, to support the charge; but he will honour God with his Substance. He envied himself his own house, till God had his. <hi>I dwell in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:104362:57"/>
and the Ark of God under Curtains. Nay, it takes up all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his thoughts; he afflicts himself for it. <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxii. 1. <hi>Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member David, and all his afflictions:</hi> He would <hi>not climb up to his Bedâ€”till he found out a place for the Lord.</hi> Alas! we can be content to tender him some cheap Observances; but to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for our Religion, to erect Tabernacles, to bestow pains, and cost, that sets us off; that is the best God, and Religion, that costs us least. Oh! It is an argument of our base esteem of God, of Religion, of our Souls, of the kingdome of Heaven, when we murmur at any charge our Religion requires of us. The Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> upbraids the Jews, <hi>Hag.</hi> i. 4. <hi>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this House lye waste?</hi> The Heathens scorned to hear of Cheapness in the service of their gods. <hi>Phidias</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make the Statue of <hi>Minerva, In marmore, potius quam e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore;</hi> said,</item>

                        <item>1. It would last better:</item>
                        <item>2. It was <hi>vilius,</hi> cheaper: The <hi>Athenians</hi> hissed at that reason.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p>2. The second Print of Piety in this motion of <hi>Peter,</hi> is, He consults with <hi>Christ</hi> in the choice of this service, that he would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> perform towards him: <hi>Matth.</hi> xvii. 4. <hi>Master, if thou wilt, let us make here three Tabernacles;</hi> he submits to his Appointment and Direction in all this forwardness.</p>
                     <p>No Service or Worship is to be tendred to <hi>Christ,</hi> but what he allows and gives warrant to. <hi>You shall not do whatsoever is good in your own eyes, but what I command you.</hi> In matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Invention is Superstition. As <hi>Vincentius,</hi> alluding to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Tradidi quod accepi; quod accepimus, non quod excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vimus.</hi> As they at <hi>Samaria,</hi> we must learn the manner of the God of the Countrey. <hi>Moses,</hi> though wise, and holy, yet refers the Worship of God to his own choice. <hi>Exod.</hi> x. 26. <hi>We know</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                        <hi>not with what we must serve the Lord, till we come thither.</hi> And all his frame of the Tabernacle, <hi>must be done according to the pattern shewn in the Mount. Id utique Deo dignum, quod ipse Deus sibi fatetur acceptum.</hi> That God is to be worshipped, nature tells us; but how, that is his Choice and Pleasure, and matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Strange fire was abominable; so are invented Services. Devotion, in respect of forwardness, and cheerfulness, and frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, asks, and offers, <hi>Wherewithall shall I come before the Lord, and how my self before the high God? Shall I come before him with Offerings, with Calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                        <hi>thousans of Rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of Oyl? Micah</hi> vi. 6, 7. But Faith and Obedience, takes this answer, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requires:</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will-offerings for their kind prescribed, these will be accepted.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:104362:58"/>3. A third Print of Devotion, in this proffer of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his care for <hi>Christ,</hi> and these two Saints. He thinks not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and provision for his own safety and abode; he had no thoughts of a Tabernacle to shelter himself. Love, and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God and his Church, transports the Saints out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, makes them even forget their own comforts in respect of God. All S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s care and solicitude, is for <hi>Christ. Love seeketh not her own;</hi> but the glory of <hi>Christ</hi> hath the first thoughts, and deepest consultations. When self-love swayes us, then we are all for our selves, take care for building our own Tabernacles, provide for our own. Whereas <hi>Tertullian</hi> observes, Not any that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> followed <hi>Christ,</hi> that ever questioned how they should live: None said, <hi>Non habeo, quo vivam. Pietas non respicit vitam, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to minus victum.</hi>

                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. It is enough for S. <hi>Peter</hi> to be, <hi>In famulatu Christi.</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon him, is provision enough. As Noblemen count themselves more honoured to serve in the Court, then to Lord it in their own.</item>
                        <item>
                           <p>2. Faith knows, <hi>Christ</hi> will take care of them. Take thou care to provide for <hi>Christ, Christ</hi> will provide for thee. Let <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> prepare a Tabernacle for the Ark, the Ark shall bring a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> blessing upon his Tabernacle. As <hi>Elias</hi> to the Widow, Provide for me first, venture all thy Meat and Oyl, and be sure of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of encrease. If <hi>Christ</hi> have a Tabernacle, he will not shut us out of dores. As God to <hi>David, Because thou hast thought to build me a House, I will build thee a sure house.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So much of <hi>Peters</hi> proffer of furtherance for continuance of <hi>Christ</hi> and those two Saints with him. Now follows,</p>

               <p>III. The Censure that the Scripture passes upon this Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It was inconsiderate and unadvised; <hi>He knew not what he said.</hi>

                     <p>1.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104362:58"/>
there he was overtaken with a passion of Fear at the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> draught of Fish; it stirs up a strange, sudden Motion, <hi>Lord, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, for I am a sinfull man:</hi> His Fear abandons <hi>Christs</hi> Presence and Society. Here, in this place, a passion of Joy puts him upon a vain, inconsiderate suit; it casts him into a dream, and he talks like one in a dream, or trance; <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxvi. 1. <hi>Then were we like men that dream. Ioh.</hi> xiii. 8. <hi>Christ</hi> offering to wash S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> feet, he is taken with a sudden passion of preposterous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and Humility; <hi>Lord, thou shalt never wash my feet.</hi> So, again, <hi>Matth.</hi> xvi. 22. <hi>Christ</hi> foretelling his death, <hi>Peter</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with a preposterous passion of Love, breaks out into this inconsiderate Motion, <hi>Lord, be it far from thee; this shall not be unto thee.</hi> So <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn, Luk.</hi> ix. 54. <hi>Christ</hi> being excluded by the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> these two are taken with a sudden passion of Anger and Revenge, and make a Motion accordingly; <hi>Shall we call for fire from heaven, and consume them?</hi> Thus Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in rash and violent passions, they conceive strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Desires and Motions.</p>
                     <p>We must inspect, and so examine our passionate wishes, check them, as <hi>Christ</hi> did <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s wives suit, <hi>You know not what you</hi>

It arose out of the ignorance of Understanding, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Apprehension of heavenly Glory. <hi>Peter</hi> hath here a view and glimpse of it, but yet knows not how to judge and esteem of it. That spiritual and heavenly Condition, it is a meer strange thing to us: We apprehend it in our earthy and carnal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and so talk of it, out of gross apprehensions. <hi>Peter</hi> thinks, three Tabernacles will well suit with three glorious Bodies. The thoughts that we have of those unconceivable joyes, are, like our selves, low, and unproportionable. Ask the piercing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est judgement, of those After-joyes, How must they stammer, and fumble, and bewray <hi>Ignorance?</hi> If it should be asked,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                     <p>As <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> If we cannot understand more earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, as, The work of Grace, Union with <hi>Christ,</hi> The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Regeneration; How can we understand him, when he speaks of heavenly? <hi>O! Eye hath not seen;</hi> and that sees far: <hi>Ear hath not heard;</hi> and that receives much: nay, <hi>Heart</hi> hath not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to imagine, or conceive those hidden things. In this case, we are no more able to conceive what that life of Glory is, then a child in the womb can conceive what is the condition of this present life. Our discourses of heaven, are like theirs, who talk of Countreys they never saw. Nay, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was there, yet found them unutterable. All other knowledge hath some help and hint from nature, but this is a <hi>Mysterie hid from Generations,</hi>

                  <item>
                     <p>This inconsiderate unadvised Motion of <hi>Peter, He knew not what he said,</hi>

                     <p>3. It arose from the surcharge, and overwhelming of this great Glory. The exceeding Glory of <hi>Christ</hi> hath overwhelmed the soul, and mind, and capacity of <hi>Peter,</hi> and overcomes his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. <hi>Excellens objectum, corrumpit.</hi> Our understanding is shallow, limited, finite, proportionable to these lower things; but God, and the fulness of his Glory, are too high for us. As it is with our Brains; be we on the ground, then they are steddy; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but upon some high mountain, or steeple, they fail us. <hi>Bonorum quorundam, sicut &amp; malorum, intolerabilis magnitudo est. Tertull.</hi> Not onely the torments of hell would consume us; but, if God should not put strength into our souls, the very joyes of heaven
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104362:59"/>
would swallow us up. <hi>Stay me with flagons, comfort me with</hi>

As we say of crazy bodies, Too pure an ayr, and too accurate a diet will overthrow them: So, our crazy souls are not able to undergo the eminency of that Glory. <hi>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, it is high, I cannot attain unto it, Psal.</hi> cxxxix. 6. Hence, they say, we must have <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Gloriae confortans, &amp; elevans intellectum;</hi> Our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings enlarged, and raised, and strengthened, to undergo that weight of Glory. The Sun puts out a Candle: So, the light of Glory will soon damp our poor glimmering Spark. This makes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the very Angels stand aloof, and cover their faces. <hi>He dwelleth in that light that cannot be approached unto;</hi> that light is like the Sun-beams to sore eys.

                     </p>
                     <p>We have seen the nature and condition of this Motion, whence it arises.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider the particular conviction of this rashness in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the many particularities of his erroneous Motion. Formerly we have seen what commendable things were contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in this his suit; but we see it here censured as unadvised, and imprudent. Let us review these Motions of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and see his failings.</p>
               <p>I. In his Motion of Continuance: <hi>Master, it is good being here.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first Error; <hi>'Tis good being here:</hi> He would fain abide here always: He errs, in desiring a perpetuity of that condition, which was but transient and momentany. This Vision was but a taste of Glory, but a drop from the Honey-comb, not a full repast of Glory; intended onely to strengthen their Faith, incourage their Diligence, correct their Error, quicken their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Hope; all these purposes are omitted, and he must not part with this Vision of <hi>Christ,</hi> but must have it perpetual. As <hi>Mary,</hi> she embraceth the feet of <hi>Christ,</hi> would never have left him: <hi>Christ</hi> bids us leave off, these were but extraordinary Appearances, not to be dwelt upon. Besides, the vileness of noysom lusts, which still would be craying, even the spirit of man loves to glut it self in spiritual refreshments. How loath were the Apostles to part with <hi>Christ</hi>'s bodily presence? So, in many extraordinary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, which are not intended as perpetual, yet there is <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bido,</hi> and <hi>Luxuria spiritualis,</hi> we would fain enjoy those ravishing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> joyes which are but for a time. No, as the Angel that refresh'd <hi>Elias,</hi> said to him, Feed, and be walking, <hi>thou must live in the strength of it forty dayes;</hi> it may be all thy life time: No, stick to Faith, that's our Ordnary. As <hi>Dives,</hi> who lived deliciously every
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104362:60"/>
day; so, some Christians, if they be not caught up into heaven,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> do not see Visions of Angels, they are discontent.</item>
                  <item>2. A second Error is, in that he places the fulness of joy in the view of the Humanity of <hi>Christ,</hi> but gloriously Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and can be content never to see more, or go further, but to behold this Glory. True, it is a great accomplishment to our bliss, to see that price of our Redemption, the Body of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in Glory; but yet it is not the main and original. No created Glory can be the fountain and fulness of Glory to us. Even the Manhood of <hi>Christ</hi> is blessed by derivation, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation from an higher Fountain. The Society of the Saints is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> comfortable; the view of that Lamb of God, most ravishing: but yet it is the blessed God-head, the face of God himself, the adoring and enjoying an heavenly communion with the Sacred Trinity, that is our true, prime, original happiness. <hi>Shew us the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and it sufficeth, Ioh.</hi> xiv. 8. The increated Glory of <hi>Christ</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, that is the matter and summ of our blessedness. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xvii. Our happiness is to behold the Glory which <hi>Christ</hi> had with God, not on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> but before the world was. <hi>This is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is Light,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> i. 5. that we may <hi>have fellowship with the Father, and with the Son,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>vers.</hi> 4. Our hearts are restless, till setled upon this. All our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are flowing and running, till they are swallowed up in this Ocean. The eyes of our body, indeed shall have <hi>Christs</hi> Body, as the most glorious Spectacle of all Comfort; but the eye of our soul, that goes higher. As the eye of Faith rests not upon the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of <hi>Christ,</hi> but upon his Divinity, and so on the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; so doth the eye of Beatifical Vision, that succeeds Faith.</item>
                  <item>3. A third Error, <hi>'Tis good being here;</hi> He would settle his rest upon Mount <hi>Tabor;</hi> This was an error, to bring down hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon earth. To enjoy <hi>Tabor;</hi> he can be content to part with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> heaven, and resign up that place to enjoy this. Like the two Tribes of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> because the land on this side <hi>Iordan</hi> was rich and commodious, they beg to be settled there, care not for the Land of Promise. Like some vain Traveller, who can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to settle in some Inn on the road, because he finds good u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage there, and never hasten on to his own Countrey, to his own home. Not onely wicked men would fain settle here, but sometimes Gods children could be content with the life of grace here, and think not sufficiently of heaven above. No, we must know, <hi>Tabor</hi> is but a <hi>viaticum</hi> to heaven: It is <hi>Manna</hi> indeed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but not for our stay; onely for our Journal in the Wilderness. Heaven is the Countrey, that is the Region, and Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. Grace never leaves us, till it brings us thither: As Waters will ascend as high, as from whence they rise; so Grace, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104362:60"/>
comes from heaven, and it will thither again. <hi>Hierusalem</hi> is from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> above: <hi>Tabor</hi> is but a Colony that belongs to it.</item>
                  <item>4. A fourth Error, <hi>'Tis good being here; Peter</hi> would have <hi>Christ</hi> set up his rest here, and never go down more from Mount <hi>Tabor:</hi> What shall become then of <hi>Christs</hi> Death, and Passion, and the Redemption of Mankind, by his being Crucified? All our happiness, this on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> that in heaven, depends all upon this. He hath heard our Saviour forewarn it, yet is he so transported with this passionate joy, that <hi>Christ</hi> must not suffer now; he must forget his message, and the command of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Redemption of his Church, to bear <hi>Peter</hi> company <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> upon Mount <hi>Tabor.</hi> Nay, as some conceive, purposely he moves it to <hi>Christ,</hi> and proffers his assistance, that so he may escape the death of the Cross. So carnally, sometimes, are our affections set, that we think we love <hi>Christ,</hi> and our selves, when we cross him most. No, <hi>Christ</hi> must descend from Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend Mount <hi>Calvary; Thus it is written, that Christ must suffer, and so enter into his Glory.</hi> How else should the Scripture be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, the Church redeemed, Heaven purchased, the Devil van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished? How dangerous are our carnal desires, of what fearful consequence, if God should give way to them?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                  <item>
                     <p>5. A fifth Error, <hi>'Tis good being here;</hi> He would never leave this place of Glory, but enter upon the possession of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently. Ey, but much labour is to be undergone, many services to be performed, to attain this rest. No, <hi>Peter</hi> would slip into heaven in an instant.</p>

                        <item>1. <hi>Laboranduni. Peter</hi> should say, Let us go down, and perform those conditions of gaining heaven. We must not so linger for heaven, as not to be content to take pains for it. The Spies that discovered <hi>Canaan,</hi> came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> back, and said, Come, let us fight for it, it is a good Land.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Prius patiendum.</hi> There is a <hi>Cup</hi> to be tasted of, and <hi>Baptisme</hi> to be <hi>baptized</hi> with first. <hi>Through many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions we must enter into heaven.</hi> Fain would we go to heaven without the Cross; and pass, <hi>A deliciis, ad delicias;</hi> No, we must be made conformable to our Head, who was consecrated by afflictions. <hi>Crux, scala Coeli;</hi> the Cross is the ladder by which we must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the Crown.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>Moriendum.</hi> We must pass through <hi>Golgotha,</hi> to come up to this Mount. <hi>Peter</hi> indeed, as well all, are loth to be <hi>uncloathed;</hi> but we would be <hi>cloathed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up of life,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 4. The
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104362:61"/>
valley of death leads to this Mountain; That <hi>straight</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> must be passed. <hi>Peter,</hi> after, is content to lay down his Tabernacle, here he forgets it. It is the Supper of the <hi>Lamb;</hi> the labour of the day, and the evening of death must first come.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. A sixth Error; <hi>Good being here:</hi> Fain would he hold <hi>Christ</hi> ever upon Mount <hi>Tabor.</hi> Why, what shall become of all other Saints? <hi>Peter</hi> will engross <hi>Christ</hi> here to himself. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> from heaven, and three Apostles on earth shall enjoy <hi>Christ,</hi> no matter for others, he takes no thought of them: He will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive heaven of <hi>Christ,</hi> those in heaven must go without him. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for the Saints on earth, he never thinks of them neither, so he may have his full of Glory. Whereas a more advised spirit would have provoked <hi>Peter</hi> to have been zealous to call in and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite others to the fellowship of these joyes. Indeed, other worldly blessings are diminished by many partakers, but this is more encreased. The Lepers, 2 <hi>King.</hi> vii. said, <hi>We do not do well,</hi> we do not carry tidings into the City. The spirit of Piety, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, provokes us to call in others to share in <hi>Christ</hi> with us. The woman of <hi>Samaria, Ioh.</hi> iv. 29. <hi>calls out all her neighbours</hi> to enjoy <hi>Christ.</hi> Thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> brought in his kindred, <hi>Acts</hi> x. 24.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Had <hi>Andrew</hi> served <hi>Peter</hi> thus, what share had he had in <hi>Christ? He went and found out his brother Simon, Ioh.</hi> i. 41. <hi>Peters</hi> Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have <hi>put this Light of the world under a bushel.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</item>

                        <item>2. Love to our brethren, that will quicken us up to gain them. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls his acquaintance to be in <hi>Christ</hi>'s company, <hi>Luke</hi> v. 29.</item>
                        <item>3. This will make our selves fuller partakers of Glory:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> The more we gain, the more we shall shine. It is a sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that will end in bringing sheaves.</item>

               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> should have been content to have parted with this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a time, for the conversion and good of others. When God bids <hi>Moses</hi> go down from the Mount for the peoples cause, <hi>Moses</hi> saith not, <hi>'Tis good being here.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew what the joyes of heaven were; yet, for the Churches sake, he was not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be out of heauen some time, but <hi>Anathema</hi> for ever. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, si adhuc populo tuo sum necessarius, non recuso laborem, fiat voluntas tua; desidero requiem, sed non recuso laborem.</hi> So said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> S. <hi>Martin</hi> in S. <hi>Bernard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have seen <hi>Peters</hi> Errors in his Motion for continuance: Now let us see what failings there were.</p>
               <p>II. In his proffer of building <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> In it, <hi>He knew</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:104362:61"/>
                  <hi>not what he said.</hi> That proffer hath blemishes and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Being here, as he supposes, in <hi>Christs</hi> kingdom of Glory, he forecasts an erection of three Tabernacles; <hi>One for Christ, one for Moses, one for Elias. Christ</hi> here hath his family, and <hi>Moses</hi> his, and <hi>Elias</hi> his. Whereas <hi>Christs</hi> Tabernacle, and Church being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> must not persist: All must be in <hi>Christs</hi> Tabernacle, or utterly excluded. <hi>Elias</hi> must have a distinct Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle from <hi>Moses,</hi> till <hi>Christ</hi> comes and pitches his Tabernacle among men; but then they must resign and give place to him. <hi>Unum ovile,</hi> all must be under one Head; all one Flock, and one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Shepherd. No man must <hi>Ducere familiam,</hi> be the Master of the house, but onely <hi>Christ;</hi> all must come in and hide themselves in <hi>Christs</hi> Pavilion. Thus the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> they would build many Tabernacles: One sets up a Tabernacle for <hi>Cephas,</hi> another for <hi>Paul,</hi> another Tabernacle for <hi>Apollo. Paul</hi> flings down these Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, sets up <hi>Christs</hi> onely. In the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> there is no <hi>Temple, but the Lamb is the Temple, Rev.</hi> xxi. 22. Who is <hi>Moses,</hi> and who is <hi>Elias,</hi> but servants of this Tabernacle, of which <hi>Christ</hi> is Lord? We must not have, not only <hi>Altare contra Altare;</hi> but not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>Altare cum Altari. Christ</hi> alone is the Lord, all the rest are but servants.</item>
                  <item>2. A second Error; <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> must needs have Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, and abide with <hi>Christ,</hi> to make up this Glory. Why? <hi>Christ</hi> alone, and his Tabernacle, cannot that suffice us? It is an Error, so to affect the presence of the Saints, as to account <hi>Christ</hi> an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Saviour, if they be wanting; or our happiness insufficient, if Saints be not joyned with him. 'Tis comfortable to have the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Saints; but, in point of salvation hereafter, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort here, we must know, he is alone <hi>All-sufficient for us. Whom have I in heaven but thee? Nihil, Domine, praeter teipsum.</hi> In this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> case, though <hi>Abraham</hi> know us not, and <hi>Iacob</hi> be ignorant of us, and <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> they abide not; <hi>Yet thou art the same, Lord, thou never failest.</hi> The Court is where the King is, though none of his followers attend upon him. If <hi>Christ</hi> be not thine, and vouchsafes his presence, all the Saints and Angels in heaven can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comfort thee: If thou hast him, were they all strangers to thee, thou hast fulness of bliss in him onely. The Sun alone, is more refreshing, then all the Stars in the Firmament.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p>3. A third Error; <hi>Peter</hi> will set up three <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> One for <hi>Christ,</hi> then for <hi>Moses,</hi> then for <hi>Elias. Christ,</hi> indeed, is first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but here is too much equalizing the servants with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. <hi>Nimis perversum quod Mosen &amp; Eliam Collegas Christo facit, cum omnes in ordinem cogendi, ut ille solus emineat.</hi> It is too fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-like a provision, to sort <hi>Christ,</hi> and Saints, in such Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104362:62"/>

                     <hi>This is my beloved Son.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> is the preparation, <hi>A bright cloud overshadowed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. <hi>A cloud overshadowed them.</hi> The overspreading of this cloud upon our Saviour, and the Apostles, was purposed of God, for divers reasons:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To correct the Error of <hi>Peter;</hi> He would prepare Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles to shelter <hi>Christ,</hi> and those glorified bodies; as suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that those glorified bodies had need of shelter &amp; coverture. God confutes this Error: Here is an overshadowing and shelter from heaven; not a Booth, or a Tent pitch'd by man, but framed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by God; an heavenly Cloathing, miraculously framed. As <hi>David</hi> speaks, <hi>He layes the beams of his chambers in the waters, and makes the clouds his charret, Psal.</hi> civ. 3. He cloaths himself with this aÃ«ry, or rather, heavenly Mansion. Thus <hi>Solomon, The heaven of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens cannot contain him, 2 Chron.</hi> ii. 6. <hi>He hath said, he will dwell in the thick cloud, 1 King.</hi> viii. Tabernacles, and such poor earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly helps, suit with our frailty, his Glory can erect a more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Pavilion.</item>
                  <item>2. To allay, and moderate the lustre and resplendency of that great Glory. This Transfiguration, and Glory of <hi>Christ,</hi> hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> overcome S. <hi>Peter,</hi> he is not able to stand before the brightness of it; he was swallowed up with it. See here, God attempers himself to their weakness, abates of that Majesty, and spreads a Pavilion, and Shade of Clouds to shelter them from the surcharge
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104362:63"/>
of Glory, that was too great for them. As <hi>Moses</hi> put a vail on his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> face, that he might not amaze, and terrifie his people. As we cannot look upon the Sun in its full brightness, but under a cloud by refraction, or reflection; so the Majesty of <hi>Christ</hi> is unsuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, till he vails himself, and abates his Glory, and condescends to our frail capacity.</item>
                  <item>3. A cloud overcasts, and overshadows them, to hinder their further prying, and looking into that Glory. He gives them a glimpse of Glory, but overcasts it presently. We must not search too far, look too much into that Majesty. Our curiosity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> would still be gazing, and prying, till God darkens himself, and closes our sight from further beholding. When the men of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee</hi> stood gazing up into heaven after <hi>Christ,</hi> when he was taken up into heaven, <hi>A cloud received him out of their sight, Acts</hi> i. 9. Thus God curbs our bold approaches to his presence. <hi>Moses</hi> would see the <hi>Face</hi> of God, God shews him his <hi>Back-parts;</hi> but hides his countenance. When he appear'd on <hi>Sinai,</hi> he set bounds to the people. <hi>Tutum est nescire, quod non licet scire.</hi> Thus the Temple was framed; the people were restrain'd to the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Court, the Priests to the inward; but there was a vail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum. Psal.</hi> xviii. 11. <hi>He made darkness his secret place; his Pavilion round about him, were dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</hi> Thus he doth;</item>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. To strike reverence, and awe into us: The unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of Gods mysteries, and our inability to view and comprehend them, are purposed to work admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and adoration in us.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Ut sit locus Fidei.</hi> God suffers not our eyes to behold his full Majesty, and those heavenly mysteries, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise our Faith, in believing what we see not. In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary cases he shines more clearly; but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he holds us to the dim light of Faith. The Israelites, in the night, had a pillar of Fire; but in the day, a pillar of Cloud. Hence we are said, to <hi>walk by Faith, and not by Sight. Christiani non rationales, sed fideles.</hi> It is the goodness of Faith, <hi>Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed, Ioh.</hi> xx. 29.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>Ut sit locus Expectationi.</hi> We must not see that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now, but expect it hereafter. As in the Primitive Church, the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> were not suffered to see <hi>Baptisme,</hi> or the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> the more to quicken their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> desires after them; so God casts a cloud before his Glory, to make us long for that time, when these clouds shall vanish, and we behold him <hi>Face to Face.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> admitting <hi>Absolom</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104362:64"/>
his coming to his presence, provoked him to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> long to see the King's face.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. To withdraw, and separate <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> from them. <hi>Peter</hi> lingred, and sued for a stay; no, a cloud is cast 'twixt him and them. It is our condition; we may, and naturally we do lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after the society of the Saints, still to retain them with us; no, God withdraws them, and casts a cloud of separation and concealment, that they are not to be seen again; all further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with them is denied to us. Papists, they keep the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage open, betwixt us and the Departed; they pray to them, and for them; and tell us of their frequent Apparitions. No, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sees a cloud cast betwixt us, God hides them in his Pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As <hi>Christ</hi> was caught out of sight with a cloud; so are we hindred from any further conversation with Saints departed. Happy they who are taken from us, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi>'s presence, and caught up in a bright cloud of comfort.</item>
                  <item>5. A cloud appears and overshadows them, as a Symbole and Token of God the Father's presence. Usually Gods presence was represented by a Cloud. Thus he filled the Temple with a Cloud, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> viii. So <hi>Exod.</hi> xix. A Cloud appeared upon Mount <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                        <item>2. He is Invisible by the eye of Reason, the eye of the Soul.

The Son, he is God manifested in the Flesh; the Holy Ghost, he appeared in the shape of a <hi>Dove,</hi> and <hi>Cloven Tongues;</hi> but the first Person never made himself known by any visible Apparition. Hence it is, that the Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That in the Old Testament, whensoever it is said that God appeared, as to <hi>Adam, Abraham, Iacob, &amp;c.</hi> still it was the Son who appeared; and those assumed bodies were <hi>Praeludia In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnationis.</hi>

That is the saving sense: The sense of greatest Discipline, saith Reason; the sense of Faith, saith Religion. Popery is a Religion for the Eye; Ours for the Ear. A Christian is described, <hi>In auditu Auris;</hi> At the Hearing of the Ear they shall obey. Hearing, it is that breeds Faith. It is a comfort to have these Visions, Tastings, Feelings; but if all these fail us, or be denied us; yet if we can Hear, and Believe, it sufficeth. We must stick to this. In this sense, All <hi>the Body must be an Ear. Miracula, muta sine voce;</hi> but Seals to a Blank.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                              <item>2. It is the great conviction of the worlds Infidelity: <hi>Had I not spoken to them, they had had no sin; but now they have heard,</hi> therefore their sin abides. Thus <hi>Christ</hi>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> convinces the Pharises; <hi>The Baptisme of Iohn, was it from heaven, or from men?</hi> Their consciences told them, <hi>If we say, from heaven; Why did we not believe him? Take heed ye despise not him that speaks from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> To despise the Testimony of Men, of Prophets, of Messengers, went not unpunished. <hi>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. He that believes not God, hath made him a lyar; because he believes not the Record God gave of his Son,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> v. 10.

Call a man, cruel, unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, or proud, or covetous, the bloud riseth not so much, as when ye call him a lyar. How must God be provoked, when we give the lye to his Truth, questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Son, authorized by his own Seal? Unbelief gives God the lye.</item>
                              <item>3. This Testimony from heaven, it seals up our condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if it be rejected; it makes an Unbelievers Damnation, most confessedly just, beyond all exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. God hath sent his Son, and testified of him,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that in him he offers Grace and Reconciliation. What can we plead, if upon rejecting this Testimony, we be condemned? People, that live out of the Pale of the Church, where this Testimony is recorded, are like men that live in an unwholsome Ayr, and far from Physicians; when they fall sick, there is but one way with them. But see, here is <hi>Balm in Gilead;</hi> a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian is here, make use of him then, or you perish wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.

                     <p>There are divers Degrees of Gods Communicating his Goodness:</p>

                        </item>
                        <item>3. He more communicates his Goodness, by imparting the choyce Similitude of himself to man: That much pleas'd him, as the <hi>chief of all the wayes of God:</hi> which makes <hi>David</hi> wonder, <hi>Lord! what is man?</hi> So, <hi>Psal.</hi> civ. surveying all the creatures, when he comes to man, <hi>vers.</hi> 23, 24. then he wonders, <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works?</hi>

But,</item>
                        <item>5. The greatest, and most glorious communication, is of himself in the Incarnation; to make a creature to be God, by Personal Union. This is the most Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable work of God: This, all the Angels wonder at. If at the creation of Light, all the Angels of God shouted for joy, and admiration, as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks; sure, when this work was atchieved, then all creatures did wonder much more. And in this, God was highly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> pleased.</item>

their failings, and imperfections. <hi>He found folly in his Angels:</hi> In <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the best of them there is matter of displeasure. But for this Son of God, <hi>There was no guile found in his mouth.</hi> There was in him, exact Purity of Nature, without stain, or blemish. <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and he hath nothing in me, Ioh.</hi> xiv. 30. that he can search out, and accuse me for.

                        <item>2.

                           <hi>For he is not as man, that he should repent,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 29. but he hath no more content in us, then a man hath in that which he repents of, and wishes were undone.</item>
                        <item>3. Is <hi>Ira;</hi> In him, are thoughts of wrath and Indignation against us; a bent, and purpose of will to punish, and afflict, and make us smart in his Displeasure.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104362:69"/>
with it a secret antipathy, and loathing of us; his Soul abhorrs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> us. <hi>The wicked are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> His eyes cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us; he abhorrs to <hi>look upon iniquity.</hi>

                        <item>6. Is <hi>Gaudium in Perditione;</hi> The Scripture goes thus high: The Lord even rejoyceth in his Justice, triumphing over sinners in their Perdition. <hi>Ah! I will ease me of mine Adversaries, and avenge me of mine Enemies, Isa.</hi> i. 24. <hi>Prov.</hi> i. 26. <hi>I will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh.</hi>

                        <item>2. It is respectively to all, even our best services and performances. Out of <hi>Christ,</hi> God refuseth all, counts them all abominable.

                        <item>3. The Extent of this Displeasure reacheth even to the creatures that are about us. Even for our sakes, the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is involved in his Displeasure. Sin hath blasted the beauty of all Gods workmanship. God is out of love with the whole frame of the world, in indignation to man's sin. At our Fall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. the earth was cursed; and that curse, none but <hi>Christ</hi> can take off. <hi>Malachi</hi> closeth up the Old Testament with this same curse; <hi>I will smite the earth with a curse.</hi> The Law leaves the creatures under a curse.

               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Quibus modis?</hi> By what means?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Quibus gradibus?</hi> By what degrees <hi>Christ</hi> hath wrought it?</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. <hi>Quibus modis?</hi> By what means hath <hi>Christ</hi> gained us the love of his Father? These four wayes;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By his Intercession: He is well pleased in him, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Interceding for us. The Prayer of our Saviour is of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power to prevail with God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xi. 42. <hi>Father, I know that thou hearest me alwayes.</hi> It argues the love and power of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, when we obtain, not onely for our selves, or those about us, but can reconcile, and pacifie offences towards others. It argued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> great favour to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he could prevail so much for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Thus God graced <hi>Iob,</hi> when his friends were sent to beg his entreaties. Much more do the Intercessions of <hi>Christ,</hi> those strong cries and supplication, by which he continually obtains mercy for us, argue God's being highly pleased with him. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> his prayer for the people, bound the hands of God; <hi>Now therefore let me alone, Exod.</hi> xxxii. 10. Yet that is nothing so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing as <hi>Christ</hi>'s Prayer. S. <hi>Steven</hi>'s prayer procured <hi>Saul</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; how much more shall <hi>Christs, Father forgive them,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to God? recommend us to his mercy?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. By his Satisfaction he hath wrought this peace, and made him well pleased, having satisfied for us. Satisfaction, it is the making up of a wrong, or injury, or damage, by the paying of a full recompensation. Now the sufferings of <hi>Christ</hi> were</item>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Of that Infinite value in their natural Dignity;</item>
                        <item>2. Of that high esteem in God's valuation; that by them, the breach of Gods Law had a condign satisfaction by this performance. Penal Statutes are never satisfied, but by the mulct and forfeiture. The Law of God, that's Penal; the price of his Death, the value of his Bloud, that was laid down, and in it God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is pleased.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. By his Merit: In him God is well pleased, as Merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us. <hi>Christ</hi>'s actions had not onely the virtue of impetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or satisfaction, but of abundant Merit, to purchase favour for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104362:70"/>
us. Now the reason why <hi>Christs</hi> Merits do thus pacifie God, is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> because his Merits do more please him, then sin can displease him, <hi>Praestando bonum acceptabilius. Christs</hi> obedience gave God higher content, then our disobedience can discontent him. He is more delighted in his righteousness, then he was offended by our unrighteousness. This is like, and beyond <hi>Noah</hi>'s sacrifice, <hi>A savour of rest in the nostrils of God; I will curse the earth no more.</hi> This is a main Argument against Despair; <hi>Christ</hi> hath more pleas'd God, then thou hast displeased him.</item>
                  <item>4. By his Union. God is pleased in him, uniting us to him. Not one hair of <hi>Christs</hi> head shall perish. <hi>He is the Saviour</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>of his Body, Ephes.</hi> v. 23. When we are implanted into <hi>Christ,</hi> then God looks graciously upon us. As <hi>Isaac</hi> said unto <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> xxvii. 21. <hi>Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau, or not:</hi> So, when God feels us to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and parts of his Son, O, 'tis the voyce of my Son, 'tis a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Body, then his Soul blesses us. This Union makes us to enjoy a communion in all that <hi>Christ</hi> did: As S. <hi>Bernard</hi> speaks, <hi>Non alius qui foris-fecit, alter qui satisfecit, quia caput &amp; corpus unus est Christus. Christus, non potest habere membra damnata.</hi> That's the first, <hi>Quibus modis?</hi> See,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

               </list>
               <p>II. <hi>Quibus gradibus?</hi> Take them in these three steps:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In <hi>Christo placabilis: Christs</hi> Mediation, and Gods good pleasure in him, makes him placable, and appeasable, and reconcileable. Out of <hi>Christ,</hi> God <hi>is a consuming fire, Heb.</hi> xii. 29. His thoughts towards us, are onely thoughts of anger: But his Son hath founded a new Covenant, in which God is Intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, sin Pardonable, heaven Attainable. This is one step of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he hath wrought his Father to, to enter a parley and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reconciliation; He hath set up an Office, to sue out our Pardon; He hath set forth a gracious Remedy; open'd a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for sin, and for uncleanness. <hi>Non sic Diabolis. God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 19. and hath sent Ambassadours, <hi>vers.</hi> 20. to treat, and intreat for Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</item>
                  <item>2. In <hi>Christo placatus:</hi> That's more. Our Peace and Reconciliation is actually obtained in, and for him onely. <hi>He hath made us accepted in the Beloved, Ephes.</hi> i. 6. Thus the Apostle, <hi>Having slain enmity;</hi> not only weakned it, but overcome it, <hi>He hath reconciled us unto God, Ephes.</hi> ii. 16. He presents us to God, obtains our pardon, knocks off our fetters, discharges us out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> prison, cancels our bill, seals up our pardon.</item>
                  <item>3. In <hi>Christo continuo placandus. Christ</hi> doth not onely set us <hi>in Statu quo,</hi> and so leaves us; but brings us into favour, and holds us up in favour. <hi>Christ</hi> is of perpetual use; not at our
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104362:71"/>
first Reconciliation, but in all our life. This virtue of <hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

                     <list>
                        <item>1. Makes our sins of another condition then when we were out of him: They are not <hi>condemnatorta,</hi> but our pardon shall be granted.</item>
                        <item>2. Makes our actions, though imperfect, yet accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because done in him. He is the Altar, that san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies the Offering: His Odours persume our Prayers. In <hi>Numb.</hi> vi. 19, 20. <hi>The Priest, at the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, was to lay his hands upon the hands of him who brought it, and to wave it before the Lord:</hi> So <hi>Christ,</hi> he is to present our Prayers, and all our Offerings,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and that makes them acceptable.</item>
                        <item>3. Our persons, they are look'd upon as in <hi>Christ,</hi> and so with them God is well pleased.</item>

               <p>Corollaries from hence, let be these:</p>

                  <item>1. <hi>In quo complacitum; ergo non ex odio Patris morti traden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus. Peter</hi> thought, <hi>Christ</hi> must not dye; <hi>We thought him forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God.</hi> No, it was not hatred of his Son, that brought him to death; for he was most pleas'd with him in his death.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>In quo complacitum; ergo gratuitum;</hi> 'Tis good pleasure, and acceptation, that's all our tenure. He had a Son who pleased him, he needed not us.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                  </p>

                     <hi>First,</hi> The Impression of this Passion, <hi>They were sore afraid.</hi> Of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this we will take a double consideration:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Ex parte Dei;</hi> Why God stirs up in them this great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Ex parte eorum;</hi> What occasioned it in them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I. Consider it in respect of God. Purposely, God affects them with this, rather then with any other Passion, for divers reasons;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Ut altiÃ¹s imprimeret in memoriam.</hi> Those lessons that are fastned into us with extraordinary fear, take deepest appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension in us, stick fastest in us. Those Truths are dearest to us,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that cost us dearest. Fear, and horror, and temptation, are the most profitable Schools to learn in. As a mother loves that child most, that she brought forth with the greatest pain and sorrow.</item>
                     <item>2. To teach them the fittest and best way to make use of <hi>Christ.</hi> He hath now propounded him to them; and, to drive them to this refuge and sanctuary, to make them see their great weakness and insufficiency out of him, and need to shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in him, he purposely affrights and terrifies them. While we are at ease, no fears or terrors seise on us, we sit loose from <hi>Christ;</hi> but if Gods Glory once fears us, then we run to the horns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of this Altar. When men are prick'd in their consciences, then they cry out, <hi>What shall we do to be saved?</hi> So the Jaylor. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conversion, Love is too weak an attractive to our servile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Fear works more powerfully. <hi>Lot</hi> must be affrighted out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and constrained to fly for his life. The pursuing of the avenger of bloud, must make the man-slayer to fly to the city of Refuge. <hi>Some save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, Iude, vers.</hi> 23.</item>
                     <item>3. This fear at the voyce of God, was sent upon them, to enforce them to this particular duty, to hear <hi>Christ.</hi> The voyce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of God out of <hi>Christ</hi> is terrible; but <hi>Christs</hi> voyce, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting voyce. It is the gracious goodness of God, and a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful respect to our infirmity, not to speak to us from heaven, by his own glorious voyce; that would amaze us; but to speak to us, <hi>more humano. Christ</hi> Incarnate, and so men of our quality and condition, are the most fit means to speak to us. <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 26. the people desire that <hi>Moses</hi> may speak unto them in Gods name; <hi>Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say; and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.</hi> So the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 19. <hi>They that heard</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                        <hi>the voyce of God, intreated that the Word should not be spoken to them any more: vers. 20. For they could not endure it.</hi> Nay, <hi>Moses</hi> himself did <hi>exceedingly fear, and quake, vers.</hi> 21. Yet how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse are we? Oh, we think, if God from heaven would speak
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104362:74"/>
unto us, we would believe. Alas! How unable are we to bear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it? If men speak, we fleight it: <hi>Is not Iesus one of us? His bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and sisters, are they not all with us? Matth.</hi> xiii. 56. If he speak himself, then he is too terrible; if by men, then too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible: <hi>They are offended at him.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. They are cast into this great dejection and fear, to humble them, lest the glory of these heavenly Visions should too much puff them up. Naturally, we wax proud upon any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary favour. As <hi>Haman,</hi> being alone called to the Banquet with the King, how proud was he upon it? The Lord, to keep down our spiritual pride, after high favours, usually exercises us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with low abasements. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> lest he should be lifted up with those Revelations, he was buffetted by Satan. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</item>
                     <item>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Sometimes God humbles us, before he pleases to reveal himself to us. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was cast into a great horror before God appeared to him. So <hi>Esay, Ezekiel, Daniel:</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> before he was called to be an Apostle, he was cast down to the earth. Humility is the fittest preparation to receive any favour, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from God. It makes us sensible,</item>

                              <list>
                                 <item>1. Of our weakness, that it is not our strength that attains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to these Revelations.</item>
                                 <item>2. Of our unworthiness; <hi>To me, who am less then the least of all Saints, is this grace given, that I should preach the unsearchable riches of Christ, Ephes.</hi> iii. 8.</item>

                           </item>
                           <item>2. Sometimes, after God hath vouchsafed us some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favour, then he abases us, and casts us down. Thus <hi>Iacob,</hi> after his wrestling with God, was lamed. <hi>We must have this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the Power may be seen to be of God, and not of us, 2 Cor.</hi> iv. 7.</item>

                  <p>II. Consider it in respect of Themselves, what occasion'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this terror in them. It is strange, the Apostles should be thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. They were <hi>Sancti:</hi> If they had been wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane men, it had been no marvel: For <hi>Balaam,</hi> and such as he, to tremble, that's no wonder; but for these holy men to be thus dismayed, is much.</item>
                     <item>2. They were in a warrantable, and holy action, yet are they affrighted. For men to be surprised with horror in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable, profane action, that's no marvel; as <hi>Balthazar</hi> in his Cups, to be struck with astonishment; and <hi>Cain,</hi> at the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of his brother: But these were in a lawful action, and yet affrighted.</item>
                     <item>3. They were in <hi>Praesentia Christi.</hi> Indeed, to be left to ourselves, and to see nothing but terrors on Gods part, there is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104362:75"/>
some cause of fear; but to be so near a Sanctuary, and yet to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> tremble!</item>
                     <item>4. They had <hi>Visiones laetas, &amp; exhilarantes;</hi> were made partakers of Visions full of comfort, and joy: To see <hi>Christ</hi> in Glory, and to enjoy a sweet society with the Saints, and yet to be in fear! No marvel, if the presence of an angry God, and some dreadful Visions, should terrifie.</item>
                     <item>5. They heard <hi>Vocem Pacificam;</hi> that God in <hi>Christ</hi> was well pleased with them, yet they tremble. Indeed, to hear the thundrings of the Law, that's terrible; but here, was <hi>Vox Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii;</hi> here were <hi>Harpers, harping with their Harps, Rev.</hi> xiv. 2.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> What should be the reason, that notwithstanding all these hints of comfort and assurance, that yet they fear? See the grounds of this, in these three Observations:</item>
                     <item>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. These holy men, though Saints, yet they carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them the conscience of sin, a secret guiltiness, and that now awakens, and troubles them. The best of us carry about us the remainders of our father <hi>Adam,</hi> his guiltiness, his fears. <hi>I heard thy voyce in the garden, and I was afraidâ€”and I hid my self, Gen.</hi> iii. 10. <hi>Adam,</hi> in his Innocency, was voyd of this fear, be enjoyed a sweet Communion with God; but since, the best of us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> have many secret accusations, and niblings of conscience, that will perplex and annoy us.</item>
                           <item>2. The Voyce, and Presence, and Approach of God will awaken this guiltiness of our conscience. His Presence darts in a light unto us, that makes sin appear, that discovers to us our secret and concealed sins. Indeed, the Saints, conversing with men, seem, to themselves, and others, unreprovable. So, S. <hi>Paul</hi> is not conscious to himself of any thing; <hi>But he that judges me is the Lord, 1 Cor.</hi> iv. 4. He knew not Concupiscence to be sin, till the Law passed upon him. The light of a Candle doth not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that which the light of the Sun doth.</item>
                           <item>3. This conscience, thus awaken'd, strikes us with fear and astonishment. <hi>Oh, if the Lyon roar, the beasts tremble.</hi> Then <hi>Iob abhorrs himself in dust and ashes;</hi> as a bad servant trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles when he sees his Master. So <hi>Esay; Wo is me, I am undoneâ€”for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts, Isa.</hi> vi. 5. Thus S. <hi>Peter, Lord, depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Luk.</hi> v. 8.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>To strengthen us against these fears;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Get strength of Faith. Weak Faith will shrink. <hi>Why did ye fear,</hi>

                     <item>2. <hi>Love, that casts out fear, 1 Ioh.</hi> iv. 18. Get the love of God shed into your hearts; and then argue as <hi>Manoah</hi>'s wife did, <hi>If</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This Verse sets out the comfortable and gracious recovery of these Disciples, out of those amazing fears into which they were cast. The summ and substance of it, may be resolved into these considerable Observations:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Observe from the Agent in this recovery: As by the power of God they were cast into these fears; so it is God alone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> who must raise and recover them. The terrors of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are removable onely by the power of the Almighty. 'Tis not any creature, but God onely, who can raise and refresh them. <hi>He hath torn, and he must heal us; he hath smitten, and he</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:104362:76"/>
                     <hi>must bind us up, Hos. vi. 1. He maketh sore, and he must bind up;</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>he woundeth, and his hands must make whole, Iob</hi> v. 18.</p>
                  <p>Divers reasons may be given;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. From the Subject of these terrors. These fears are set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the soul, and conscience; clogg'd with secret guiltiness, awakened by the voyce of God, struck with horror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now the soul, and conscience, it is obnoxious onely to the power of God. He onely can set these terrors upon it, and so take them off again. No created power can strike fear into the conscience, or convey comfort into it. He hath appropriated this to himself onely. Our outward man is lyable to the wrath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of man, but the conscience is Gods peculiar. Fear not them who can destroy the body, but him who can strike terror into the conscience, who can affright the soul.</item>
                     <item>2. From the Nature of these fears: They are supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and spiritual, and so must be cured by answerable comforts. Outward applications, cannot cure inward maladies. But spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual comforts are from God onely. <hi>The spirit of a man may sustain all other infirmities, but a wounded spirit who can bear? Prov.</hi> xviii. 14. Sicknesses, losses, natural and humane means may relieve us in them; but these apprehensions that come from heaven, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> upon sense of Gods Majesty, they are of another nature. As balls of wild-fire ordinary water will not quench them; so these flashes from heaven, are not extinguish'd with sublunary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</item>
                     <item>3. The Grounds of these fears cannot be removed but by God, and so, by consequence, not the fears themselves. Secret guiltiness, conscience of sin, apprehension of Gods wrath, they betray us to these fears. Now, none but God can free us from these. Guilt, it is an obligation, and recognition, in which the soul is bound over to answer to Gods Tribunal. These fears, like an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Hue and Cry, are sent out against us; none can recall it, till God makes stay of it. <hi>I have sinned, what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? Iob</hi> vii. 20.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This will appear in these three respects;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In those sins that are not punishable by mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet the guilt of these will haunt the conscience.</item>
                     <item>2. In those sins that are not discernable by mans obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; when no eye sees us, or can accuse us, yet then the soul is troubled, and perplexed. As <hi>Cain,</hi> he had an easie escapal; there was none but his father up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> earth: yet, saith he, <hi>Every one that findeth me, shall slay me, Gen.</hi> iv. 14.</item>
                     <item>3. In those persons who are subject to no mans censure. Kings, and those who are, in respect of man, lawless,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104362:76"/>
and uncontroleable, as <hi>David</hi> was, yet he cryes out,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                        <hi>Against thee have I sinn'd, Psal.</hi> li. Thus the woman in S. <hi>Ioh.</hi> viii. though all her accusers forsook her, yet she stood still, trembling before <hi>Christ,</hi> expecting his doom, or absolution.</item>
                  </list>

                     <hi>Application.</hi>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. It must teach us to discern the true cause and original of these spiritual anxieties. We must know, they are the terrors of the Almighty. Do as <hi>Rebeckah; Why am I thus? enquire of the Lord, Gen.</hi> xxxv. 22. If we come to these conjectures, <hi>'Tis a chance,</hi> as the Philistims said, we shall never think of those cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that will do us good. Nature will answer, if we seek help of her, as the King of Israel did to <hi>Naaman</hi>'s messenger; <hi>See, he sends to me to recover a man of his leprosie; Am I God?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <p>2. It shews the insufficiency of all other means to recover our spirits thus dismayed. Some other means may, for a time, cast us into a slumber; like <hi>Opium</hi> to a sick body, it will stay the sourse of the disease for a time, but it will break out again with greater violence.</p>
                        <p>There are three wayes of bodily cures; Either,</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. We allay the pain; Or,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                           <item>2. Stupefie the part affected; Or,</item>
                           <item>3. Remove the cause:</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>So, some outward worldly means, may, for a while, allay and mitigate these fears and anguishes: As Pleasure; <hi>Saul</hi> gets an Harper to chase away the evil spirit: Or Employment; <hi>Cain</hi> falls to building of Cities, to drive away his terrors: Or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; the noyse and din of that, may out-noyse our fears; but this is no cure. Others go about to stupefie the part, to benum, and dead, and sear conscience, to make it sensless and brawny. Yet this cures not, but heals onely, and skins-over the wound <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of conscience. The cure cannot be effected here, but by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the cause, which is the apprehension of Gods power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us.</item>
                     <item>3. It should make us careful to avoyd the causes and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of such spiritual fears, which, by all humane means, are irrecoverable. Those diseases that have <hi>Parabilia medicamenta,</hi> are not so dangerous; men are not so shie of them: but, suppose that a disease were in it self deadly, and but one medicine in the world could cure it, and that too in the hand and skil of one only Physician, how careful would we be, not to endanger the running <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> into that malady? These fears of conscience, they are like the Kings-Evil; none can cure it but the King; all other helpers are Physicians of no value. The Conscience may, like the woman in the Gospel, who had spent much upon Physicians, but was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104362:77"/>
the better, nay, the worse, she suffered much from Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it may seek out for case elsewhere, but all in vain, till God remove its terrors. As they said of Leprosie, that it was not to be cured by the Art of the Physician, but it was left to the hand of God; so we may say of Sin, and the fears that arise in the soul because of it.</item>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another observable Consideration, is from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and speedy Act of relieving and recovering of these Saints. They being cast into fear and perplexity, they are not suffered to lye under it, and to be swallowed up of it; but a speedy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent help is from God reach'd out unto them; they are raised <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and comforted. Observe, as God wisely suffers his children to be overtaken with fear and perplexity; so he graciously orders it, that they shall not perish in these amazements; but that they shall have a timely and seasonable recovery.</p>

                     <item>2. We are not only destitute of any good deservings, but our lives have been demeritorious, sinful, offensive, deserving the contrary.

                     <item>2. <hi>Difficultatem in actu;</hi> Hardness, and difficulty in the act to be performed. Repentance, 'tis no easie, light touch of sorrow, or weak impression of grief, a sudden qualm of melancholy, soon dispelled; no, 'tis deep, and piercing, 'tis a convulsion of the soul, a racking and torture of the heart and conscience; 'tis no less <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then a <hi>renting.</hi> See with what terms of extremity the Scripture describes it; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. 10. 'tis a <hi>smiting of the heart; Acts.</hi> ii. 37. 'tis a <hi>pricking of the Conscience;</hi> nay, a <hi>wounding of the Spirit, Prov.</hi> xviii. 14. an hewing, and <hi>cutting off, Matth.</hi> v. 30. no less then <hi>mortifying, Coloss.</hi> iii. 5. and that the most violent, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that can be; <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 24. 'tis a crucifying torment. <hi>Zecharie</hi> foretells it, <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. 10. <hi>They shall mourn as for their onely Son, and shall be in bitterness, as for their first-born; Primo-genitus, &amp; Uni-genitus.</hi> The loss of the first-born, and onely begotten, the sorrow of it (but in those that feel it) it is inconceiveable. Yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the sense of this, or any worldly sorrow, must be farr exceeded in our penitential sorrow, and grief for Sin; If not <hi>affectivÃ¨,</hi> by stirring up, and enforcing our sensual affection, yet <hi>appretiativÃ¨,</hi> in a judicious disallowance, and abomination; if not <hi>respectu cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralis perturbationis</hi> (as <hi>Aquine</hi> expresses it); yet <hi>ratione spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis displicentiae:</hi> if not in outward bodily vexation, yet in thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual, and spiritual detestation, this grief must be the greatest. Indeed so great, 'tis call'd <hi>Contrition, Psal.</hi> li. 17. <hi>A broken, and a contrite heart</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>O God, thou wilt not despise.</hi> Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken, but even to contrition. <hi>Aliud frangi, aliud comminui,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                        <hi>&amp; conteri,</hi> saith <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the fourth of his <hi>Meteors;</hi> a thing may be broken, or cut in sunder, and soon set together, and joyned again; Contrition breaks all in pieces, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the brazen Serpent, to dust and powder. Had <hi>Hezekiah</hi> but broken that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104362:86"/>
brazen Serpent into some pieces, superstition would have reserv'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a relique, or have sodder'd it up, and made all whole. As they report of some living Serpents; cut them only into some few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, they will grow together again, and heal up presently; and so, do we but slightly divide, and cut this Serpent of Sin, and not hack and hew it all asunder, it will easily re-collect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it self. Repentance proceeds unto contrition; Not a weak attritien onely (as some Scholemen and Jesuits would moderate the matter) a faint wishing that he had not sinned, a slight fit of grieving, or some sudden pang; No, it enters <hi>to the dividing of the soul and spirit;</hi> 'tis a renting of the heart-strings. <hi>My heart</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> (saith <hi>David, Psal.</hi> xxii. 14.) <hi>is like melted wax;</hi> not warm'd, or heat onely, but burnt, and melted in the sense of his sins.

We may truly say of such heartless repentance, as the Messalians falsly taught of Christian Baptism; it doth, <hi>Radere peccata, non eradicare;</hi> shave, or pare off sin, not kill it at the root. Sin, 'tis as deeply fastned in the heart, as Ivy that grows and springs out of a wall; we may shed off the leaves, but if we would throughly destroy it, and root it out, we must dig down the wall, and break it in pieces: So, if thou wouldst work out those <hi>fibrae peccati,</hi> that are fretted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and incorporated into thy soul, thou must bruise and break thy heart by Repentance. As in curing of a sore, so here, 'tis not sufficient to wipe away the filth and corruption that issues from thy soul, except the core of sin, which lyes in thy heart, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, and perish'd.

world, and outward temptations mortified, and crucified to us,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> except our hearts be crucified to them.

Thy heart must die unto the World, as well as the World be crucified to thee: Outward bodily Reformation affects not the soul.</p>
            <p>In this Case, it fares with the body of sin, as with the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> body; if any outward member be dead, or cut off, the life and strength runs to another: As the <hi>Athenian</hi> Souldier first grappled with his right hand; when he lost that, laid hold with his left; after that was cut off, fastned with his teeth; his heart was not wounded: So the body of Sin, 'till the heart be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, stop the issue of it in thine hand, it breaks out in thine eye; if thou pluck that out, it will find vent in thy tongue: A stab at the heart destroyes all presently.</p>

'Tis so in the first motions, and quicknings of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. That's the second ground, why our hearts should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be affected by Repentance, <hi>Ratione consequentiae;</hi> outward Contrition will naturally follow.</p>
            <p>Thus having with <hi>Elias</hi> observed the former part of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Contrition, like a mighty strong Wind renting the Rocks;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104362:92"/>
listen with patience to that gentle voice, wherein the Lord is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the next part of my Text, which is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The duty of Conversion, <hi>Return;</hi> Without this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Contrition 'tis to no purpose. As <hi>Luther</hi> said well of it, It is <hi>fuga Dei,</hi> and <hi>fremitus adversus Deum,</hi> drives us further from God. 'Tis not every <hi>renting</hi> that God accepts. The <hi>contrite heart</hi> must be a Sacrifice; not any kind of wounding and killing, but a religious devout tendring, and offering it up unto the Lord. <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> they <hi>rent their hearts,</hi> but did not sacrifice them; except to Devils. This must be a sacrificing of them to God by a sorrowful conversion, not a cruel murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of them by horror and desperation.</p>
            <p>But the time forbids any further enlargement.</p>
            <p>Here, we observe three things,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Motum.</hi>
               </item>

            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The kind of Motion. Repentance, 'tis a Returning. And that implies, and inferrs these Observations,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Return; Ergo recessimus Ã  Deo.</hi> Sin, it is a forsaking, and fleeing, and departing from the Lord. In every sin,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> there is,</item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Aversio,</hi> A man turns his back upon God; And then</item>
                     <item>
                        <p>2. <hi>Conversio,</hi> sets his face towards the prosecution of sin.</p>
                        <p>With <hi>Cain,</hi> we go out of <hi>the presence of Ged,</hi> set out selves out of his view, and observation. As the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, must into a far Country, could not swagger and revel in his Father's company. A Sinner must either securely put out his own eyes, that he see not God; or prophanely conceit, he can put out God's eyes that He cannot see him: (Like him, who drew the Curtain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> over his Father's Picture, when he sat down to Card<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing); or, it is almost impossible to commit sin.</p>
                        <p>With <hi>Abraham, walk before God;</hi> With <hi>Enoch, walk with God,</hi> and keep close to him; not take a turn, or two, and then part with him: but, walk constantly, and converse with him, and sin if thou canst. In this respect, there is a proportion 'twixt our walking by faith here, and our walking by sight and beatifical vision in heaven hereafter. Ask the Scholemen, what's that makes the Saints <hi>impeccabiles</hi> in Heaven, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they cannot sin? They tell us, It is <hi>Visio beatifica;</hi> they always look upon the face of God, that they cannot have the least glance, or cast of their thought to sin. Sin, it is a Departure and Forsaking of God.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104362:92"/>
That's the first Observation. <hi>Return; Ergo recessimus</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                           <hi>Ã  Deo.</hi>

                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Return; Ergo non progrediendum.</hi> To sin, and then sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; to sorrow, and then to sin again, is like desperate Debtors, wipe off the old Score, to begin a new; like unsatiable Drunkards, cast, and vomit, that they may drink the larger; or, like Popish Penitents, satisfy for the old Forfeit of Sin, and renew the Patent, and get further Licence. What Sorrow, and Contrition is this, but that which Devils and the Damned undergo? They have torture and anguish, and yet <hi>immobilitati in pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the burden of their sorrow sinks them deeper into Sin: they blaspheme for the smart of their wounds. That's a second. <hi>Return; Ergo non progrediendum;</hi> we must not go forward.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Return; Ergo non cessandum.</hi> 'Tis not sufficient to break off sinning, and sit still, not putting a foot forward in this duty of Conversion. Doth <hi>Paul</hi> onely give over his journey to persecute the Saints, and lie still grovelling on the ground? No, <hi>Domine, quid faciam?</hi> He turned his course, repaired to <hi>Ananias.</hi> Repentance, 'tis the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> physick of the soul; it must not onely cure the pain, but raise up the patient, and enable him to walk and stir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Civil, and restrained men, may exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the effect of Contrition; they may outwardly break off the course of Sinning, but they express not the nature and virtue of Conversion; there is no life or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as loggs, they must be stirred with leavers; or, as dead men, carried upon other mens shoulders. That's a third Collection; <hi>Ergo non cessandum.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>Return; Ergo properandum.</hi> Travellers out of the way,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> when they are set right, they make all speed to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Road. They that set out early, and hold straight on, may go fair and softly. We have lost time, and way; How should we hasten and quicken our Return? Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this in S. <hi>Paul, I was a persecutor, I was a blasphemer;</hi> there is his straying, and aberration: but since, <hi>I laboured more then they all;</hi> there is his haste and speed in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. That's the reason, saith <hi>Gregory,</hi> why Angels joy more for the Conversion of one Penitent, then for the Perseverance of ninety nine Innocent, <hi>Quia Poenitentes,</hi>

                  <hi>cautiores, humiliores, ferventiores resurgunt;</hi> they double their pace, and add wings to their speed in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. That's the fourth Conclusion. <hi>Return; Ergo properandum.</hi>

            <p>This Judgment being denounced against them, the Prophet calls the Jews to repentance; that being the onely possible means to divert this Judgment. Flesh, and bloud indeed, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we hear of armies of enemies, casts out for other ways to defeat them. This seeking to God by repentance, and casting our selves upon his help, naturally we have no list to it. When the <hi>Syrians</hi> assaulted <hi>Iudah,</hi> God offered King <hi>Ahaz</hi> his help; no, he would not trouble God so much; <hi>Noluit misericordiae divinae oneri esse, Esai.</hi> vii. He would not tempt the Lord, forsooth; he was so modest, as not to be beholding to God for a deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; any other way would please him better. As <hi>Dominicus Soto</hi> tells us of a ridiculous and superstitious practice in <hi>Spain,</hi> to drive away locusts. When those swarms annoy'd the Country, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> countrey-people would enter an Action against them in their Courts; and Proctors, and Advocates were assigned to plead for them; and then the Judge he sentenced them, and did excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and accurse them. Sure, all other means without this of repentance, are of no use; they are but charms, meer mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helps, and will not profit us. Neither Caterpillars, nor <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> armies of Locusts, or swarms of enemies, can be driven back, but by repentance.</p>
            <p>So then the purpose of the Prophet in this Chapter, is to call them to repentance; and he prescribes a repentance suitable to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their Condition;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To the Condition of their Sins; Their Sins were general, and national; <hi>They had all corrupted their ways.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The Judgment threatned, that was general; <hi>An overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:104362:95"/>
                  <hi>Scourge,</hi> as <hi>Esaiah</hi> calls it, <hi>Isai.</hi> xxviii. 15. <hi>Sword, Go</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                  <hi>through the land, Ezek.</hi> xiv. 17. <hi>An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land, Ezek.</hi> vii. 2. Now sure the plaister must be as broad as the sore; so, accordingly he invites them to a general, and national Humiliation. It was to be proclaimed by the sound of the trumpet, <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. not by a knock at a private mans door. The trumpet was to call together the whole congregation, <hi>Numb.</hi> x. 2.</item>
            </list>
            <p>If ye look to the first Verse; there the Judgment comes with a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> it sounds an Alarm; it threatens all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the land. If God threatens with a trumpet, we must call to repentance with a trumpet, with as loud, and shril a sound, that the whole nation may be warned. It must be <hi>Zephany's</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: <hi>Chap.</hi> ii. 1. <hi>Gather your selves together, yea, gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, O nation, not desired.</hi> It must be like the feast of Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was the yearly fast in <hi>Israel, Lev.</hi> xxiii. 28, 29. all must humble themselves; <hi>It is a day of atonement, to make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for you, before the Lord your God. Whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Personal, and private humiliation, is not of that prevailing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in a general danger. God tells the Jews, that the prayers of two or three, though never so righteous men; as <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Iob, Ezek.</hi> xiv. 14. should not divert a judgment from the whole nation: they might escape themselves; but if the Nation repen<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d not, the whole Land should perish. There is more must go to th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> removing of a general Judgment. We may spit out a spark; or <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e mans diligence may quench a small fire; but when a whole Town is on fire, every man must bring his Bucket. One mans prayer, to remove a national judgment, is, as if we should go about to quench a raging fire, by the sprinklings of a casting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> See this practised by the Jews, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> vii. 2. <hi>All the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.</hi> And see how they expressed and testified it, <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. <hi>They gathered together to Mispeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the Lord.</hi> Their eyes were as buckets, their heads fountains of tears.</p>
            <p>And, is not a fire kindled among us? How many smoaking firebrands are scatterd through the land? We may say of our present sad condition, as our Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> speaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> i. 2. <hi>Hear ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land; Hath this</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?</hi> Who can remember such distractions in our Kingdom? When did this Kingdom shake and totter as now it doth? First troubles in the <hi>North;</hi> when that's quenched, the flame breaks out in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:104362:96"/>
sparks are scattered among our selves; As <hi>Ezekiel</hi> prophesies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>Chap.</hi> vii. 26. <hi>Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour,</hi> therefore our humiliation should be general.</p>
            <p>Now, this duty of Repentance and Humiliation, it is press'd upon them by a double Motive;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By denouncing of a judgement; and that is not onely bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretold, but exactly described in a dreadful manner; the more to affect them. God musters up his forces, and sets them in battel-array, from the second verse, to the twelfth. The Chariots of God are twenty thousands, even thousands of judgements, and the Lord is among them,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                  <hi>to turn the battel to the gate.</hi> Ey, this will work fear; and, <hi>Metus,</hi> 'tis <hi>Instrumentum poenitentiae:</hi> Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>r, it is a good ingredient into Repentance. Thus God urges his people to Repentance, by presenting of terrors. <hi>Amos</hi> iv. 12. <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel; and because I will do thus unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</hi> Yes, God looks for this submission, that we should be startled at his threatnings. <hi>Amos</hi> iii. 8. <hi>The Lion hath roared, who will not fear?</hi> That is one Motive, Fear; and that will drive us to Repentance: But then he adds,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               </item>
               <item>2. Another Motive, and that is Hope; and that is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attractive, that will draw us to Repentance. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it is a compounded thing of Fear and Hope. <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>m, metu miscet;</hi> it takes Motives both from Law and Gospel; but yet it works most kindly by Evangelical means, that's hope of Mercy; and that's the Motive of my Text, <hi>Qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap> novit? Who knows, whether the Lord will return?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>So then, the former Motive was an affrightment to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but this in my Text, it is an encouragement to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, upon hope of Mercy. And in it observe these two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> things:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Matter of their Hope:</item>
               <item>2. The Measure of their Hope.</item>
            </list>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Matter of their Hope; and that is laid down in four particulars;</item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The first Matter of their Hope, is the regaining of Gods grace and favour towards them; <hi>He will return.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The second Matter of their Hope, is the recalling of his threatnings and judgements; <hi>He will repent.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. The third Matter of their Hope, is the renewing of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mercies to them; <hi>He will leave a Blessing behind him.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. The fourth Matter of their Hope, is the re-establishing of his holy Worship among them, that he will afford them <hi>A Meat-offering, and a Drink-offering to the Lord</hi>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:104362:96"/>
                        <hi>our God.</hi> That's the first thing, the Matter of their Hope; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and then follows in the Text,</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>2. The Measure of their Hope, how far-forth they may hope, and that is set down in a somewhat strange expression; and 'tis very considerable. Here is no full assurance; here is but an ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and intimation; here is not a <hi>Door of Hope</hi> set open to them, as <hi>Hosea</hi> speaks, <hi>chap.</hi> ii. 15. here is but a small chink, or creviss, to spy some Hope at: 'Tis but, <hi>Si fortÃ¨,</hi> It may be, God will be merciful; 'tis but, <hi>Quis novit?</hi> Who knows but he may be merciful?</item>
            </list>
            <p>Come we to the Matter of their Hope: And the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> Matter of their Hope, is the regaining of Gods favour; that he will <hi>Return.</hi> His turning away from them, that signifies his displeasure, that he hath no delight in them, but is provoked and offended: His returning to us, 'tis the renewing of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and of his good-will towards us, when he vouchsafes his Presence, and will rest amongst us.</p>
            <p>So then, for the understanding the nature of this Mercy, this <hi>Return</hi> of God to us will afford us these three Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is our main happiness, could we so esteem it, to enjoy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Gods Presence, to have him dwell amongst us.</item>
               <item>2. It is the bitter fruit of Sin, that it causeth God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Presence, and to turn away from us.</item>
               <item>3. It is the blessed fruit of Repentance, that it recovers Gods Presence, causeth God to return graciously to us.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. I say, 'tis our main happiness, to enjoy Gods Presence, to have him dwell amongst us. And this happiness we enjoy by Gods Presence, will appear by three advantages, which his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and abode, doth bring unto us;</p>
            <p>The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <p>1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> Advantage, is, Gods Presence and abode with a people: It is the holiness of a Nation, where he dwells, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes his Presence. That people, by virtue of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, becomes an holy Nation. All holiness comes by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation; it is not inbred in us, but must be derived from Him, who is Holiness it self; and all participation comes by union with him. A people near unto him, are an holy people. <hi>He is the holy One of Israel;</hi> and by that near relation, <hi>They are made an holy people unto the Lord their God, Deut.</hi> vii. 6.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>We see that this Presence of God makes a people ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even by that Legal and Ceremonial holiness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Jews;</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The land of <hi>Israel</hi> was call'd an holy Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104362:97"/>
God dwelt in it, and vouchsafed his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in it. He would not have it defiled and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted. <hi>Defile not the Land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell; for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel, Numb.</hi> XXXV. 34.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it was called the holy City, because it was the City of the great King. God dwelt in her palaces, therefore it was accounted a sacred, and an holy City, <hi>Matth.</hi> iv.</item>

                  <p>All other Nations, because God was estranged from them, were an unholy people; every other land, was a polluted land.

               <item>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> Advantage we gain by Gods Presence, is, That it brings with it the Glory of a Nation. It is the high dignity, and renown, and honour of a people, that God abides with them; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 1. <hi>What advantage then</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

               <item>
                  <p>3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> Advantage that Gods Presence brings, 'tis the Strength and Safety of a Nation. <hi>I'sal.</hi> xlvi. 5. <hi>God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved.</hi> He calls himself, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 29. the Strength of <hi>Israel.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>is departed from them, and the Lord is with us; fear them not.</hi> Though there were Giants, and their Cities be walled up to heaven, yet fear them not. So again, <hi>Moses</hi> encourages them; <hi>Deut.</hi> vii. 21. <hi>Thou shalt not be affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at them; for the Lord thy God is among you, a mighty God, and terrible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so, on the contrary, when the people, being in a great sin, would needs go up to fight, <hi>Moses</hi> dislwades them; God had then withdrawn himself; <hi>Go not up, for the Lord is not amongst you. Sampson</hi> wist not that God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was departed from him, and the Philistines prevail'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. How did <hi>Moses</hi> lament, when God said, He would not go with them. So doth the Psalmist, <hi>Thou goest not forth with our Armies.</hi> His Presence, it is our <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> our Shield, and Fortress. <hi>The Shields of the earth belong unto God, Psal.</hi> xlvii. 9.

                  </p>
                  <p>Well then, If so much good comes to us by Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence amongst us, it is worth the enquiry, Wherein doth this Presence of God consist? How is he said and known <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to dwell in a Nation? I mean not now his substantiall Presence; so he is present in all places; that Presence fills heaven and earth, <hi>Ier.</hi> xxiii. Nor do we now speak of his glorious Presence, where his Majesty and Glory

shines, that is in the heavens; <hi>Heaven is his Throne;</hi> No,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nor yet do we mean his miraculous Presence, where he manifests himself in some extraordinary work of his Power; thus the Israelites, when they were in want, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd his Presence; <hi>Is the Lord amongst us, yea or no?</hi> No, besides all these, he hath a gracious Presence, by which he dwells amongst us. Yes, that gracious, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and beneficial Presence, is that we speak of: How shall that appear to us?</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. God dwells in a Nation, which he chuses to be his <hi>Peculiar people,</hi> the people of his Covenant; amongst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whom he fixes his Sanctuary, and establishes his Worship. As <hi>David</hi> speaks, <hi>The Lord hath chosen Iacob to be his Inheritance.</hi> Thus <hi>Hosea</hi> calls the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Countrey of the Jews, <hi>The Lords Land, Hos.</hi> ix. 3. All the world is his dominion: but by special purchase and possession, so the Church is his. That is like the Lords Demeans, which himself holds in his own hand.</item>
                     <item>2. The place of Gods delight, that is the residence of his special Presence. Delight fixes a man to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> abode. When we are such a people that God takes pleasure in us, then he saith, <hi>Here will I dwell, for I have a delight in it. The Lord hath chosen Zion, he hath desired it for his habitation, here will I dwell,</hi> and rest in it, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxii.</item>
                     <item>3. There are we to reckon of Gods special Presence, where he sets his Family; that is the usual place of presence and abode. Where we see God gathers to himself a Church, is daily collecting to himself a people, to know him and worship him, there we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> may conclude, God vouchsafes his Presence. Thus <hi>Christ</hi> is described, <hi>to walk among the Churches, Rev.</hi> i. When it may be said of a place, as God saith of <hi>Corinth, Acts</hi> xviii. 10. <hi>I have much people in this City,</hi> there resolve that God is present.

            <list>
               <item>1. This is the malignant effect of sin, that it parts God and us, makes a separation, moves him to withdraw and turn away from us. <hi>He rejoyces in the habitable parts of the world, and his delights are with the sons of men,</hi> Prov. viii. 31. But sin and wickedness causes an alienation in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him, and estrangeth him from us. Thus <hi>Cain</hi> complained, <hi>I am east away from thy face, Gen.</hi> iv. 14. So <hi>Saul,</hi> upon his disobedience, cryes out, <hi>God is departed from me,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxviii. 15. <hi>I will shew them the back, and not the face, Ier.</hi> xviii. 17. It was the woful condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by nature we were <hi>strangers from God,</hi> nay, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> tells them at <hi>Lystra,</hi> that God suffered all Nations to walk and wander in their own wayes, never owned, or regarded them.

               <item>2. Not onely the world of wicked men reap this fruit by their sins; but Gods own people find this uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble desertion: when they grievously offend him, he turns away from them. This, <hi>Moses</hi> shewed them in a visible Resemblance, <hi>Exod,</hi> xxxiii. 7. The people there had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against God; then 'tis said, <hi>Moses took the Tabernacle, and pitch'd it without the Camp, a farr off from the Camp,</hi> thereby signifying God's displeasure against them, and his departure from them. Otherwise, the Tabernacle was to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be in the midst of the Host, <hi>Numb.</hi> ii. But God was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and withdrew himself from them.</item>
               <item>3. Yea, not onely his visible Church, but even God's Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Saints find this woful effect, that their sins bring
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104362:99"/>
upon them, that God stands aloof off, and withdraws <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> from them. How often doth <hi>David</hi> mourn for this, and pray against it? <hi>Psal.</hi> x. 1. <hi>Why standest thou a farr off, O Lord, why hidest thou thy self in time of trouble?</hi> So again, <hi>Psal,</hi> xxxviii. 21. <hi>Forsake me not O Lord, O be not far from me.</hi> Upon his sin of Adultery, <hi>O<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>cast me not away from thy presence.</hi> This the Saints often find and feel; if they turn unto folly, God turns from them, stands afarr off, not to hear them, not to help them, not to own them. And <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> gives the reason, <hi>Res delicata est Spiritus Dei,</hi> he will not rest in a defiled soul.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                     </gap>, not to be implacable, and revengefull. 'Tis so with men, how much more is God graciously inclined? <hi>He is slow to anger, and ready to forgive.</hi> Two rare properties amongst men; Those that are soon angry, if they be soon pleased again, we count them good natures.</p>

                  <p>On the contrary, they go too often together, Hardly angred, and as hardly pleased: But, God is hardly anger'd, soon pleas'd. With God, <hi>Poenitentia,</hi> 'tis <hi>illex misericordiae,</hi> it allures, and draws on, and invites mercy. <hi>Tertul.</hi>

               <item>3. Repentance removes the matter of Gods anger, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> displeasure. Fire burns no longer then there is fuel to feed it.

He hath conditioned, that if we repent, he will be mercifull. We owe it to <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Gospel, that our repentance prevails thus with him. The moral Law, the very Law of nature requires repentance; if we do amiss, we are bound to be sory for it.

            <p>Surely, It is a strange thing to see God repent. Repentance, it is for man, and for sinful man. <hi>God is not as man, that he should repent,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 29. Amongst men, we use to repent upon two Cases; and neither of them are incident to God:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. When there is something happens upon our action, which is <hi>improvisum;</hi> which we did not fore-see: that makes us repent of what we have done.

            <p>It is a speech after the manner of men. Not that God hath the passions and affections of Repentance; but he exercises those actions, which, in man, flow from Repentance. When God changes his deeds and dealings with men, then the Scripture
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104362:101"/>
saith, <hi>He repents.</hi> Repentance in God imports a change in some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Effect of his, but it doth imply any change of his Mind. <hi>Mutat sententiam, sed non mutat consilium,</hi> saith <hi>Gregory;</hi> he is said to reverse his sentence, but not to alter his counsel.</p>
            <p>Or, take it thus; Repentance hath a double Aspect;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It looks backward to what we have done, so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets this thought in us, <hi>Nollem feeisse,</hi> I wish I had not done so. Such an act of Repentance, 'tis not in God; he is never displeased for what he hath done.</item>
               <item>2. It looks forward; and so Repentance saith, <hi>Nolo ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra facere,</hi> I will do so no more. This action of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> God assumes to himself, <hi>I will punish you no more;</hi> I will change my dealings, I will bless where I have cursed, I will promise where I threatned. We may conceive this notion in terms of Scripture. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Scripture calls it <hi>Repentance for sin;</hi> that's the act of grief and contrition. Sometimes it calls it, <hi>Repentance from sin;</hi> when we give it over, commit it no more.

            <p>Yet we must not part with this sweet expression of God's repenting towards us. We may conceive it <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as may well agree with the Honour of God.</p>
            <p>We see, that God cloaths himself with this relenting and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affection of Repentance. Thus ye have it, <hi>Iudg.</hi> ii. 18. <hi>It repented the Lord because of his peoples groanings:</hi> So <hi>Amos</hi> vii.

               <item>3. <hi>Irascitur;</hi> That's a third Imitation of Repentance. He that repents, is angry with all that provoked him to do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> what he repents of, or were helpers or instruments of it. Thus God doth in his Repentance towards us. All those, who have had an hand in afflicting of his people, he is highly displeased with them. As a tender-hearted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther casts his rod into the fire, with which he hath cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised his Son; Thus God will afflict those, who have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted his people. <hi>I will render unto Babylon, all the evil they have done unto Zion, Ier.</hi> li. 24. <hi>The Nation that shall oppress them, I will judge, saith God to Abraham, Gen.</hi> xv. 14.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Facit contrarium.</hi> He who repents of what he hath done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> will do the quite contrary; so God repents over his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Hath he affrighted them with threatnings? He will refresh them with promises. Hath he afflicted them with Punishments? He will comfort them with Mercies. <hi>He hath wounded us, and he will heal us,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea,</hi> vi. 1.</item>

               <item>6. Repentance <hi>duplicat contrarium.</hi> A true penitent will not onely do the contrary, but he will do a great deal more; he will redeem his former actions by a double a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; So God repents of afflicting his people.

            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Matter of their Hope; that's Gods renewing of his mercies upon them, <hi>He will leave a blessing behind him.</hi> Here is a third benefit we gain by our Repentance; It gives us hope that we shall recover his former mercies, which our sins have depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us of: It prevails with God, not onely to free us from his judgements, but to store us with mercies. This good we shall get by Turning and Repenting; We shall not be losers by our former sufferings and afflictions.</p>
            <p>See here this goodness of God; It is expresly promised, in <hi>vers.</hi> 25. <hi>I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>the Canker-worm, and the Caterpillar, and the Palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.</hi> Not onely you shall not suffer any more annoyance by them, but you shall regain your former dammage: You shall not feel the smart of former judgements; but the plenty you shall enjoy, shall make you forget your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer losses: It shall be contrary with you, then it was in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s dream; here the full and the fruitful ears of corn shall consume the blasted; the fat kine shall devour the lean kine; the years of plenty, shall make you forget the years of scarcity.</p>
            <p>These are the welcoms that Repentance finds at Gods hand.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> He doth not barely set us <hi>In statu quo,</hi> but he betters our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus the loving Father, entertaining his returning Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, <hi>Luke</hi> xv. he not onely receives him, but kisses him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces him; not onely cloaths him, but adorns him; not onely feeds him, but feasts him. Here is the Kiss, and the Gold-ring, and the rich Robe, and the fatted Calf, and Musick, and Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. This is the <hi>Superpondium</hi> of mercy, the over-plus of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. This is <hi>Dos Poenitentiae,</hi> the Dowry of Repentance. Where God pardons, he doth not onely take off his judgements, but brings on plenty of mercy upon them. <hi>Is this the manner of man,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>O Lord?</hi> We count it fair favour, to escape a deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but God deals over and above, He leads us with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>And the Manner of Expression is to be observed:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is called, <hi>A blessing.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 'tis either Nature's bounty, or the fruits of our Labour; all of our own acquiring. Thus we over-possess what we do enjoy; but when we repent, the Prophet will teach us to call them as they are, <hi>Blessings of God, from his holy hand.</hi> Our peace before,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104362:102"/>
it was the wisdome of the State, or the dread of our enemies, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> our own riches and strength; but after a Judgement hath been upon us, Repentance will teach us from whom we must have it, to whom we must ascribe it. It makes us look up to heaven, and give God the glory of it. Repentance will teach us to set a right estimate of our plenty and prosperity; not so much to own them as Comforts, as to love them as Blessings: That's to take the right comfort of them, as they are fruits of Gods Love, pledges of his Favour, seals of our Reconciliation.</item>
               <item>2. It is called, <hi>A leaving a blessing behind him.</hi> It implyes two things:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                     <item>1. <hi>Ordinem Benedictionis:</hi> What's that? First, he hopes for favour in Gods gracious return to them: Then, after it, he hopes for fruits of favour, and a supply of other blessings. Yes, this is the right method of Repentance; first, and above all, it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for, and ayms at the recovering of Gods favour; <hi>Pardon my sin, Lord, cast me not away from thy Presence, return to us in mercy, and loving kindness, own us as thy people, take us for thine inheritance:</hi> then, after that, we may hope for, and expect any other favours. A true Penitent, prizes Gods favour better then life it self, or the means of life; other mercies of plenty and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> prosperity, Faith and Repentance accounts as accessaries, and additions. It is an unworthy love, to love God for his blessings, and not for himself. A true Penitent speaks to God, as <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth</hi> did to King <hi>David, Let Ziba take all, now the King is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in peace.</hi> Let the worldlings enjoy plenty; here is the main comfort of a true Penitent, <hi>God is returned to my soul in peace.</hi> This Expression, <hi>He will leave a blessing behind him;</hi> it shews,</item>

'Tis a Penitent's comfort, that God reserves mercy till <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> afterwards; that his anger, 'tis like a land-floud, <hi>Non durabit aetatem;</hi> that <hi>The rod of the wicked shall not alwayes rest upon his inheritance;</hi> that <hi>he will do good to us, at the latter end,</hi> after our afflictions. <hi>The end of that man is peace, Psal.</hi> xxxvii. Here is the contrary vicissitude in Gods dealings with the wicked; there is a great difference betwixt these two wayes of God's proceedings; To begin with a Judgement, and to end with a Blessing, that is his childrens portion; and, to begin with a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and to end in a Judgement, that's the lot of the ungodly. They shall suck up the dregs of Gods anger. <hi>Sodom</hi> may have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a fair morning, a chearfull Sun-shine at the beginning of the day, <hi>Gen.</hi> xix. 23. but the day ended in fire and brimstone: But the Church may have a foul morning, but the Sun will break out upon them; they shall have a fait evening; <hi>God will leave a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing behind him.</hi>

It is an holy Panegyrick, or Song, for the whole Nation, and people of the Jews; a solemn recital of the many memorable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in that Common-wealth, from their first settlement. And it hath been the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Kingdoms and Common-wealths, to have their <hi>Chronographos,</hi> those who should Record, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the several passages, and affairs of their State; to keep upon Record their beginnings and foundations; their Acts and Monuments, the good and ill events that have betided them.

his Sacred Pen-men, and Secretaries, to Enroll and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> up the several passages of his Church, and to transmit them to posterity.</p>
            <p>In particular, besides those sacred annals of his Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Historical books of Scriptures, the Holy Ghost hath purposely framed some more summary and compendlous, but yet full, and perfect relations of the affairs of his Church; and those likewise composed and framed into Songs, and Psalms, to make them more fit carriage for memory; and that, by the pleasantness of them, they might sink more deeply into their hearts, and more strongly affect them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

               <hi>of him, and covenanting with him.</hi> Actions, all of them, in their own nature good; all of them, if rightly performed, penitential acts, good ingredients into repentance.</p>
            <p>Put them together, they are such acts as accompany Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and they will afford us a double Meditation.</p>
            <list>

            <list>
               <item>1. When we repent, then we set our selves to seek God; therefore when we commit sin, then we part with God. Repentance, that's a seeking, therefore sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that's a losing of God.</item>
               <item>2. In Repentance, there is a returning to God; 'tis a work of conversion; therefore in our sinning, there is a departing from God, and a forsaking of God, that's more; Forsaking is more then losing.</item>
               <item>3. In Repentance, there is an enquiring after God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in a course of sin, and before we repent, we never think of him, but slight and neglect him.</item>
               <item>4. In Repentance, there is a remembring of God, and of his mercies; therefore by sin, we do not onely not actually think of him, but we grow into a forgetfulness of God, we have no remembrance of him.</item>

            <p>These five evil effects of Sin, take notice of them; By <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sinning against God, we lose him, we never so much as think of him, nay, we remove him out of our memory, we utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him, nay, we break our Covenant with him.</p>
            <p>Here is the condition of a stubborn and a wilfull Sinner. A man that lives, and lies in sin, he doth wretchedly cast off all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, rejects and abandons him.

Prosperity makes us wanton, Affliction often times hunts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> us in, and brings us before him. Sickness, and Poverty, and Losses, and other uncomfortable Events, they are usual means to reclaim us. <hi>Hosea,</hi> chap. ii. 6. compares afflictions to an hedg of thorns; <hi>Behold, I will hedg up thy way with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

'Tis to great purpose that <hi>Solomon</hi> advises us, <hi>Prov.</hi> iii.

                     <item>1. Formal, and express, when he that acts it, intends onely to counterfeit, means nothing else. That's gross hypocrisie.

Hardly can we think a man in such a case as these Israelites were now in, at the point of death, would be so gross, as to mock God expresly.</item>
                     <item>2. There is hypocrisie of a finer thread, that's interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative hypocrisie; Such an hypocrisie wherein we deal falsly with God, and our selves too: Such as God will judge hypocrisie. How's that? when a man rests in some acts of repentance, but yet fails, and falls short in the main, and is careless of that. As</item>

                        <list>
                           <item>1. There are some actions of repentance, as confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin, calling for Mercy, promising Amendment; these are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> good, but yet more is required.</item>
                           <item>2. There are some affections, and passions of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; as sadness, and sorrow, and feat, and anxiety, dejection of mind, and other passionate motions; these also are good, but yet fall short.</item>
                           <item>
                              <p>3. What then is wanting? The main of all is, that the heart must be changed. I say, changed. It may be affected, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and troubled, and yet remain as bad as ever. So it was with <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> the terrours of God deeply affected him. So <hi>Ahab</hi> was strangely cast down upon <hi>Elijah's</hi> threatnings; was sad in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> good earnest. And what think you of <hi>Iudas?</hi> was not he much affected? But yet, no true change was wrought in their hearts; they were the same men still; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> an oppressour in his heart, <hi>Ahab</hi> a persecutour.</p>
                              <p>Here then is that which makes up repentance to be true and spiritual, and such as God will accept; when it puts a new heart into us, changes our natures from what we were before, begets in us new resolutions, that we chuse what we refused, love what we hated; frames the very heart a-new. In this case, hypocrisie works like Art, sincerity like Nature. How is that? Why Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> work begins within, frames the inward of a man: first the heart, then shapes the outward members, so doth Sincerity; But Art, that works upon the outside, alters the figure and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lineaments, goes no further, so doth Hypocrisie.</p>
                              <p>

               </item>
               <item>2. A second Conviction of their unsoundness of repentance is, that it was a flitting, momentary, unconstant repentance; <hi>They were not stedfast in his Covenant.</hi> That's a second Conviction. True repentance will prove lasting repentance; Hypocritical repentance is slippery, and unconstant.</item>
            </list>
            <p>A true Convert hath an inward principle of repentance planted into him; Grace is a second Nature, and works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as nature doth; but an Hypocrite in his actions of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and repentance, is moved, not by an inward principle of God, but by some outward motive. When that ceases, his conversion fails. The motions of Piety in a good Christian, are like natural motions; the motions of an Hypocrite, are as artificial motions. The motions of the Sun, and the motions of a Clock, keep time alike; and for a time; we will say, the Clock goes as true as the Sun. Ey, but here's the difference, the one moves out of an inward principle, naturally; the other, the Clock, is moved by an outward principle; the weight, and plummet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> makes it go; and when that is down, the Clock stands still: Or, as in waters, a natural Stream flows always, it is fed with a Spring; but a sudden Land-floud, though it runs strongly for a while, yet it will dry up, it hath no spring, or fountain to feed it.</p>
            <p>A great difference 'twixt affectation that will tire; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which will hold out: A great difference 'twixt passion, which is sudden, comes and goes; and fixt resolution, which is constant. An Hyocrite is like an unbroken Horse, he may strike a stroak or two right, but falls to his trot. Sudden flushings of heat are one thing, and the kindly warmth at the heart is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> A good Christian is the same out of affliction, that he is in affliction. An Hypocrite, Oh! he is a new man on his sick-bed; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him, and ye discover him as covetous, as profane as ever. In affliction he vows, in prosperity he forgets his vows. What saith <hi>David? My heart is fixed, O Lord, my heart is fixed. Psal.</hi> lxvi. 13. <hi>I will pay thee my vows, which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.</hi> In his repentance, he hath renewed his Covenants with God, and he will not break with him.

            <p>Thus the Prophet, placed <hi>in Excelsa Fidei specula,</hi> in Faith's Watch-tower, foresees their miseries, and foretels their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

            <p>A necessary Truth it is, and yet we are exceeding back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to learn it. And this backwardness in us, is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two difficulties:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. This acknowledgment, it is <hi>Confessio Fidei;</hi> and all men have not this Faith, to see and discern our calamities and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from whence they come. Many feel the rod, that cannot hear it; feel the smart of it, that cannot apprehend who hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> appointed it. With <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> we can see the Hand-writing upon the Wall but we cannot read it, and understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. As the Jews, when God spake from heaven, <hi>Iohn</hi> xii. 29. <hi>They said, it thundred;</hi> it was but a ratling in the Sky, they made no more of it: So, a natural man without Faiths prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, can hardly look so high as to the hand of God. The evil we suffer, 'tis but some distemper in nature; or the malice of men; or, if it be more immediately from God, then it is chance and fortune, any thing rather then God, that doth afflict us. Whereas Faith and Piety overlooks secondary causes, and fixes upon God. <hi>Iob</hi> neither mentions <hi>Sabeans,</hi> nor <hi>Caldeans</hi> in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his losses, but acknowledges God in all his sufferings: <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away.</hi> This made <hi>Ioseph,</hi> when he was shamefully entreated by his unnatural brethren, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg to them, <hi>Non vos, sed Deus;</hi> 'twas not you, but God, that lent me into <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <item>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:104362:117"/>2. Men are exceeding loth to acknowledge their sufferings to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be Gods judgements, upon another difficulty; 'Tis <hi>Confessio reatÃ¹s;</hi> it bewrays our guiltiness; it carries with it an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, that all is not well 'twixt God and us, but that he is become our enemy, and fights against us. Now naturally we are very unwilling to think that God hath any quarrel against us. It is a deceit which we are exceedingly subject unto. Prone we are to delude our selves with this false perswasion, that God and we stand in good terms. How hardly could <hi>Samuel</hi> dispute <hi>Saul</hi> out of this delusion, and make him confess there was a breach 'twixt God and him? We are very desirous in all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if it be possible, to prove that God is not the Authour of them, but some other cause: <hi>Iudiciis Dei detrahimus, ne pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catores nos esse cognoscamus,</hi> saith <hi>Salvian.</hi> As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> laboured a long time to prove that God sent not those plagues upon him, but that <hi>Moses</hi> wrought them some other way; his Inchanters could do as much as that came to. It is no easie matter to make us acknowledge, either our doings of evil to be sins against God; or our sufferings of evil, to be judgements from God. <hi>Thy judgements,</hi> saith <hi>David, are far out of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

His judgements are evident convictions of our sinful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations. <hi>I know, O Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David, that thy judgements are just, Psal.</hi> cxix. The violence of men doth not impeach the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104362:117"/>
justice of God; nor doth the justice of God warrant, or excuse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the violence of men. <hi>Iehu</hi> must answer for all that bloud which was shed in <hi>Iezreel;</hi> and yet <hi>Iezreel,</hi> by Divine Sentence, was devoted to destruction, <hi>Hos.</hi> i. 4. <hi>Vos cogitÃ¢stis malum, sed Deus vertit in bonum;</hi> You thought evil against me, but God meant it to good, said <hi>Ioseph</hi> to his unnatural brethren, that sold him into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Their wicked designs were no impeachments to Gods holy purposes. <hi>Quod homo facit improbÃ¨, Deus facit justÃ©.</hi> The malice of men can be no prejudice to the justice of God.</p>
                        <p>We owe this dutiful acknowledgement to God in all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. <hi>We must accept of the punishment of our iniquity, Levit.</hi>

                        <p>In all heavy calamities of warr and blood-shed, of dearth and famine, of sickness and diseases, we may take up the Prophet <hi>Habakkuks</hi> question, <hi>Was the Lord displeased against the Rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers? Was thy wrath against the Sea?</hi> So may we say; Is the Lord displeased with the course of nature, that he makes it unkindly? Is he angry with the quiet and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> peaceable order of the world, that he turns it all into up-rore and confusion? No verily, he is the God of order, not of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; he is the God of peace, not of dissention; but our sins have bred and brought upon us those judgements. We are like chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, set on fire with our own soot. We minister the fewel that feeds the fire of Gods indignation. That's the first; they are judgments, and therefore deserved.</p>

Our afflictions, they are not casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but the wise and holy dispensations of a righteous God. <hi>In regno providentiae, non est locus temeritati.</hi> Chance, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, have no place, bear no sway, in the kingdome of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and government of God.

The most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and seemingly casual afflictions, are yet wisely and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ordered by Divine Providence. Amongst the Plagues of Egypt, that of the Swarms of Flies was the most unlikely to be subject to Guidance; Who can order, or direct the tumultuary motions of those living Atoms, and errattick Creatures? Yet, what saith God of that Judgment? <hi>Exod.</hi> viii. <hi>I will send swarms of flies, and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of them; but in Goshen, where my people dwell, no swarms of flies shall be there.</hi> Thus also he calls the Annoyance of Locusts, and Catter-pillars his great Army, of which he is Commander; and see how he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them, <hi>They shall march every one in his wayes, they shall not break their ranks, they shall walk every one in his path,</hi> as a well-ordered Army, <hi>Ioel</hi> ii.

That which could endure the fire, was to pass through the fire; but that which could not endure the fire, was to pass through the water. It was his gracious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his people; How oft did they provoke him in the Wilderness?

            <p>These indeed should be the times of our amendment; and it would have been more pleasing and acceptable.

Yea, naturally we are prone to set light by Gods more gentle and mild Visitations; <hi>Nubecula citÃ² transibit. Solomon</hi> forewarns us of it, <hi>My son, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise not the chastisement of the Lord,</hi> lest his milder Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, turn into severer Judgments.

We see it in the Method that God observed with <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> first, He admonished them by his Messengers; then, He awakened them by his Miracles; then, He scared them by his Threatnings; then, He visited them with

more remote Afflictions; then, came home to them with sores <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and sicknesses; then at last, slew them; And then, they yielded to Him.</p>
            <p>What saith the Prophet in the foregoing Verse? <hi>In the way of thy judgments have they waited for thee.</hi> We should have done it in the way of his mercies; but we have lost that opportunity. 'Tis high time we should turn to him <hi>in the way of his Iudgments.</hi> It had been our wisdom to have prevented our sufferings.

Though we have our ten thousands, he hath his twenty thousands to come against us, as our Saviour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> speaks. He hath his Sickle in his hand to reap down whole Countries, <hi>Ioel.</hi> iii.

               <hi>First,</hi> For the Supposition. And the Sum and Substance of it will appear unto us in these three Extractions, which we will draw out of the Text.</p>
            <p>I. The Strength and Comfort of the Creatures, may fail us; there is in them a fading, and vanishing Condition; <hi>The fig-tree may not blossom, the Vine may be fruitless, the fields may yield no meat:</hi> we may be destitute of all these succours, and supports <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of life.</p>
            <p>All these helps, and supplies for life, have a possibility in them of failing of us. Reckon not upon them as certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable comforts, that will not disappoint us. As it was in the Manna, which they fed on in the Wilderness; 'tis so in all the helps and means of this life, there is a Worm of Corruption that will breed in them.</p>
            <p>This uncertainty, and failing in the Creature, will appear to us in these three Particulars;</p>

               <item>1. In their production and breeding, there is a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> deal of uncertainty. <hi>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening with-hold not thine hand; for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this, or that,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, Ecclesiast.</hi> xi. 6. He who sowes, sowes in hope, upon adventure, God gives it a body at his pleasure.

                     </gap>t of the comforts of them. The Prophet tells
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104362:127"/>
us of <hi>Bread,</hi> and of a <hi>Staff of Bread.</hi> This <hi>Staff of Bread</hi> may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> broken, and then that supply of life is weak and impotent. <hi>Levit.</hi> xxvi. 26. <hi>When I have broken the Staff of your Breadâ€”then ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</hi> There is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And the reason is, because the vigour, and nourishing power of the creatures, are not originally in them, but by a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry derivation from God into them. He is the Authour, and Fountain of Life. <hi>Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, and they are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>

               </item>
               <item>3. The very being, and substance of these natural helps, carry with it this condition, That they are vanishing, and fading.</item>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104362:127"/>
in them. The most excellent, and permanent creature of it self <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> tends to nothing, if not supported with the word of Gods Power. <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 6. There is a <hi>Pondus Naturae,</hi> and there must be <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenentia Divina,</hi> that must sustain it. As S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks of man, He is <hi>Terraefilius, Nihili nepos;</hi> the Earth was his Mother, Nothing was his Grandfather. As all creatures came out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, so thither would they sink again, and return to nothing.</item>
                     <item>2. As sublunary creatures, so by their natural compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, they are subject to fading and corruption. All things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Moon, are fading and transitory. The heavens have a frame of perpetuity; but these creatures, that are the means of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our lives, they are full of variety, uncertainty, contrariety; all grounds of corruption.</item>
                     <item>3. Consider the creatures as living under Gods curse for the sin of man, and so they are subject to a greater weakness and vanity. Gods displeasure doth blast them, suck out the strength, and vigour of them; and it brings upon them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Adam's</hi> punishment, not to yield us fruit without our labour; but, often times, <hi>Cain's</hi> curse, they are barren, fruitless, though we do labour. As his Blessing can put a strange virtue and viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city into them; <hi>Daniel's</hi> Pulse was more nourishing then the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> King's Dainties; It made a little Meal in the barrel, and Oyl in the cruse, to yield plenty; So, on the contrary, his Indignation consumes the strength and vigour of nature. <hi>Master, the tree that thou cursedst, is presently withered.</hi> See this in the Israelites, they must needs have Quails, and Dainties, the most nourishing food; he sent it them to the full; but what saith <hi>David? He sent leanness withall into their soul, Psal.</hi> cvi. 15. It never thrives with them. <hi>He sent among his fat ones, leanness, Isa.</hi> x. 16.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>This vanishing weakness of the creatures, should make us think what to reckon of our lives. Such as the fewel is, such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> must needs be the fire. Straw, and stubble, yield but a sudden blaze, and soon out again. And if these succours, and supports of life be thus vanishing, and fading; sure then Life it self is but a transitory thing, no matter of consistence. Weak materials make no strong buildings, and vanishing meats breed but a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing life. Our Saviour calls them but <hi>perishing meats: Labour not for the meat that perisheth, Iohn</hi> vi. 27. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> sets out this condition, both of meat and life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 13. <hi>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God shall destroy both it and them. Whosoever drinks of this water, shall thirst again, Iohn</hi> iv. 13.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> These outward helps may, for a time, refresh; but, not alwayes preserve and support our lives. All these outward things, they are but <hi>Consolatiunculae temporales,</hi> as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> calls them, petty, transient comforts, like the refreshings of <hi>Ionah's</hi> gourd,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104362:128"/>
but the shade of a few leaves, and there is a worm at the root of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it, that will consume it presently.</p>
            <p>So much of the first Extraction; The creatures are weak, and may fail us.</p>
            <p>II. A second Extraction from the Text, is, When Scarcity and Want comes as a judgement from God, and from his wrath and heavy displeasure, then it is extreme, and extraordinary, and beyond the course of nature. The creatures have naturally some weakness in them, they are subject to fade and decay; but when his anger blasts them, then Want and Scarcity proves far more heavy, and unsupportable. It is like a sharp arrow, shot by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the hand of a mighty Giant; and drawn up to the head, it falls with a double force, and pierces deadly. See the greatness, and sadness of this judgement now threatned, in these aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Gods anger will cause a dearth and famin in a most plentiful and fruitful land. The land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest of all lands, as the garden of God; a land <hi>flowing with milk and honey; a land of vineyards;</hi> the best of all lands, as <hi>Moses</hi> describes it, <hi>Deut.</hi> viii. It was <hi>Terra fructus centesimi;</hi> it brought forth to <hi>Isaac,</hi> no less then an hundred-fold, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxvi.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The Fruit of it was so wonderful, that they cut down but one bunch of Grapes at <hi>Eschol,</hi> and the people, who had seen the plenty of Egypt, admired it. It was so rich a land, that it was the granary of other neighbouring Countreys. It had not onely plenty for it self, but bounty for others. <hi>Solomon</hi> gave <hi>twenty thousand measures of Wheat,</hi> for food; <hi>and twenty measures of pure Oyl, to Hiram, King of Tyre.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> v. 11. <hi>And the Countrey of Tyre was nourished by this Country. Acts</hi> xii. 10. Yet, when God is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, <hi>Psal.</hi> cvii. 34. <hi>A fruitful land maketh he barren.</hi> He turns Paradise into a wilderness. He brings Want, <hi>in monte filii</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                  <hi>Olei,</hi> Scarcity in a most fruitfull land. That's the first Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</item>
               <item>2. Gods anger will cause a Dearth in those Fruits, that are naturally most yielding and pleasant. The Fig-tree, of all trees, is most fruitful, bringing forth of it own accord, with the least care, and culture, fructifying in the most barren, and stony places; bearing twice a year; soonest ripening; almost never failing. So the Vine, that's a fruitful Plant; 'tis made the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of Plenty, and Fruitfulness. That's a print of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the most hopeful, and plentiful of all the creatures,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fail us, and do not their kind to us.</item>
               <item>3. A third print of Gods anger in this Scarcity threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is, That it is a national, general, over-spreading Famine. Usually, if one part of the land suffers Scarcity, other parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104362:128"/>
with Plenty. But when God calls for a Famine, sends a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> judgement in this kind, he turns the whole land into a Desart. <hi>Rashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Nahum.</hi> i. 4. These were the richest soil of all the Countrey, yet these were parch'd up, and fruitless, by his displeasure. When he sends a Judgment, <hi>he will bid it go through the land, Ezek.</hi> xiv. He will make the whole Land to mourn, bring an overflowing scourge upon it.</item>
               <item>4. A fourth print of Gods anger is, He makes it an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal scarcity upon all kinds of food, and supports of life. Here is the <hi>staff of Bread</hi> broken, and the herds and flocks fail, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> refreshng of the Wine-press; the Seed, and the Vine, and the Fig-tree, and the Olive-tree, all become fruitless. Such a deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is more then ordinary. Usually, when one commodity fails, another abounds; if Corn be dear, Cattel will be cheap. That weather oft-times that hinders one kind, helps another. But here, when God comes with a Judgment, he blasts all the helps of Nature. Then the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl, they all fail by the blastings of his displeasure. Thus God compares his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a fire that burns all before it; <hi>The Land is as the Garden of Eden before it; and behind it, a desolate Wilderness, Ioel</hi> ii. 3.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> This the Lord points at as a wonder, <hi>Ioel.</hi> i. 2. <hi>Hear this, ye old men,</hi> ye who can talk of dear years, <hi>hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?</hi>â€”<hi>That which the Palmer-worm hath left, hath the Locust eaten; and that which the Locust hath left, hath the Caterpillar eaten.</hi> O, Gods Judgments make a full end. He makes the decays of Nature excessive, and violent. As it is said of the Grass-hoppers of Egypt, <hi>there were never such since;</hi> exceeding grievous.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now, Gods displeasure oft-times breaks out in this kind of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Judgment; he chooses this kind of scourge of scarcity and famine to punish a people with, for divers reasons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is a most just Judgment, thus to cut us short, to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish our portion, to call for a dearth, and poverty upon the land, to withdraw from us the succour and supply of the creatures. For sin forfeits all our interest and right we have in the comforts of the creatures. We are not soveraign and supreme owners of them, but we hold them of God; our title to them is from him, and that upon condition of our duty, and homage, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him. Thus we see God claims, and challenges them all, as his own. 'Tis <hi>my oyl, and my meat, my flour, and my honey,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi. 18, 19. Now, wicked men, they incur not onely some smaller penalties, but it is just with God to seize all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into his own hands, and to forbid them to yield their fruit unto us. Thus he punished the first sin, <hi>Cursed be the earth for</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:104362:129"/>
                  <hi>thy sake, thorns, and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee, Gen.</hi> iii.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Thus he revenged <hi>Cains</hi> wickedness, <hi>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not yield to thee her strength.</hi> So also he threatned the Jews for prophaning his Sabbaths, <hi>That the land should lie waste, and keep her Sabbaths; there should be neither sowing, nor reaping, Lev.</hi> xxvi. 34. God tells us the Land is his, we are but sojourners with him. Or, as <hi>Parisiensis</hi> tells, God doth as some Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, lets out the world to halves. There arises a double fruit.</item>
               <item>

               <item>2. This scourge of Scarcity, 'tis an equal, and suitable, and proper punishment. Our sins are, usually, the sins of abusing the plenty of a good Land, to luxury and excess; and it is the usual rule of Gods proceedings, <hi>In quo quis peccat, in eo plectitur.</hi> The matter of our sinning, commonly becomes the matter of our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. Thus God fits the punishment of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> suitable to their sin; <hi>Thou hast taken my meat, and my flour, and mine oyl, and</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                  <hi>offered them to Idols; therefore I will diminish thine ordinary food, Ezek.</hi> xvi. 19. So, when God threatens a scarcity of wine, <hi>Ioel</hi> i. 5. Whom doth he call upon to take notice of this Judgment? <hi>Awake ye drunkards, and weep, and howl all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine, for it is cut off from your mouths; howl ye drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards;</hi> and so, howl ye worldlings when scarcity seizes upon you; you have sinn'd in the abuse of these creatures; your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess hath brought this judgment upon you. God usually meets with men in their own ways. Covetousness, and earthly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, luxury, and excess, all of them are abuses of these good gifts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of God; To punish us in the loss of these is a proper punishment.</item>
               <item>3. This calamity of dearth, and scarcity, the failing of the creatures, that the earth doth not give her increase, 'tis a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable judgment. The creatures are made to be our servants, we are made to be Gods servants. As long as we do perform our service to him, the creatures shall yield their strength, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and prove serviceable to us. But, if we fail God, how just is it then that the creatures should fail us? As S. <hi>Aug.</hi> sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observes, our Reason would not obey God, therefore our Sense shall not obey Reason. As <hi>Hushi</hi> said to <hi>Absalom, Whom all</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                  <hi>Israel, makes King, and serves, him will I serve;</hi> excusing his seeming revolt from <hi>David;</hi> so, when the creatures start aside, and revolt from us, prove unserviceable to us, 'tis their real pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, They must serve their grand Lord; if we revolt from him,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:104362:129"/>
they revolt from us. The Father's words are these, <hi>Lib.</hi> 13. <hi>de Civit.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 113. <hi>Qui superiorem Dominum deseruerunt, inferiorem famulum ad suum arbitrium non tenebant;</hi> And, <hi>de Nupt. &amp; Conjug.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 16. <hi>Injustum erat, ut ei obtemperetur, Ã  servo suo, qui non obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diverat domino suo.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. God oft-times, singles out dearth and famine, to punish a Nation with; it is a deep, and evident, and apparent judgment. War, and oppression, and captivity, many other calamities, mans hand is seen in them, they are agents and instruments in bringing them upon us. And in such calamities, we can be content not to see Gods hand in them, but to charge our sufferings upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> malice of men; as if God and we were in good terms. God oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times loses the glory of such afflictions. As indeed the heart of man is exceeding desirous, in all afflictions, if it be possible, to prove that God is not the authour, but some other cause. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> laboured a long time to prove that God sent not those plagues upon him, but that <hi>Moses</hi> wrought them some other way, his Enchanters could do as much as that came to, till at last they cried out, <hi>It is the finger of God.</hi> Now, in such a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as want, and famine, to weaken the strength of nature, to make that fruitfull womb of the earth barren to us, none but God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> can do it,. He onely can <hi>make the heavens as brass, and the earth as Iron,</hi> and restrain the celestial influences. Can man <hi>bind the sweet influences of Pleiades? or loose the bonds of Orion? Iob</hi> xxxviii. 31. Can any but God, forbid the clouds to drop fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? No, these Judgments are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, we must cry out, <hi>God fights against us.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. Famine, it is a Scourge wherewith he uses to chastise a people, as being a comprehensive Judgment, like a chain-shot that bears all before it. Many other calamities that are brought upon us by humane means, are most-what avoidable by humane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> helps. Wisdom, or riches, or strength may exempt, or secure from some other annoyances; but scarcity, and famine, that strikes at the life of every man. All must beg <hi>daily bread. The profit of the earth is for all; the King himself is served by the field, Eccles.</hi> v. 9. No King can help against this Judgment. <hi>If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? Out of the barn-floor, or out of the wine-press?</hi> said the King of Israel, in the famine of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> vi. 27.

            <p>III. A third Extraction from the Text is, Gods own children and servants, are lyable to these extremities of want and scarcity,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104362:130"/>
which God brings upon the world, as well as others. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> here, in his own name, and in the name of the Church, hath a fearfull apprehension of them.</p>
            <p>Indeed, sometimes, and in some Judgments, God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes a special exemption to his Church and Children. Instance in three cases;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To preserve an holy portion of his People, and a Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery for his Church. <hi>Isaiah</hi> acknowledges it, <hi>Chap.</hi> i. 9. <hi>Except the Lord of hosts had left us a small remnant, we should have been as Sodom and like unto Gomorrah.</hi> Still a remnant shall be saved. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> applies it to the preservation of his chosen People,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 29. Gods Church must remain to all Posterity, no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must sweep them all away. In this case, when common Judgments are sent upon the world, he exempts his own. When the deluge came upon the old world, an Ark was provided to save <hi>Noah,</hi> and the holy seed. When he visits them, he doth it in measure, he makes not a full end of them.</item>
               <item>2. God exempts his own People from common Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when the Judgments are sent in the cause of his Church, to manifest and maintain that they are his People, and that their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sufferings from the world, are most unjust, then usually he puts a difference, and exempts his own from common calamities. Thus in all the plagues of <hi>Egypt, Gosben</hi> was priviledged; he put a difference betwixt the Hebrews, and the Egyptians; he passed over them, when he plagued their enemies. Thus in the case of famine, <hi>Isaiah</hi> tells the enemies of Gods People; <hi>Behold, my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; Behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; Behold, my servants shall rejoyce, but ye shall be ashamed; Isai.</hi> lxv. 13. <hi>Malachi</hi> assures them of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, and that God will make it appear Who are his, <hi>Chap.</hi> iii. 17. <hi>In that day, when I make up my jewels, I will spare them, as a</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                  <hi>man spares his own Son that serves him; and then shall ye diseevn between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God, and him that serves him not.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. In the pÃ¹nishment of those sins, which his children have withstood, opposed, protested against, and mourned for; usually in that case, God exempts such Saints, and Servants of his. This obtained <hi>Lot's</hi> exemption out of <hi>Sodom's</hi> overthrow, he mourned for the abominations that were done in <hi>Sodom;</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> makes it a ruling case, and argues from it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 5. <hi>If God spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                  <hi>Preacher of Righteousness;</hi> and in the overthrow of <hi>Sodom,</hi> verf. 7. <hi>delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked;</hi> thence he gathers this Conclusion, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation.</hi> This protected <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:104362:130"/>
kept him out of captivity. This holy carriage exempted <hi>Baruch;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his life was given him for a prey. Those that mourned for the abominations of the Land, were marked out by God for esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and deliverance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> ix. 4.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But out of these, and the like cases, 'tis true, Gods own people and servants are subject to these common calamities, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as others. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his family, are by famine driven into Egypt, <hi>Gen.</hi> xii. So <hi>Isaac</hi> and his family were driven into the Philistines country, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvvi. And <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his family, by want, were driven into Egypt. Thus the People of God in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>Davids</hi> time, suffered a famine of three years. <hi>Eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s</hi> that great Prophet, was forced out of the land of <hi>Israel,</hi> into <hi>Sarepta,</hi> by reason of want.</p>
            <p>The Saints have their share and portion in these common calamities upon divers Reasons;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The differences, that God puts 'twixt his own and others, are not seen in the administration of these outward things, not in making their portion in riches, and outward prosperity, more full then others. As he makes the wicked partakers of temporal blessings, <hi>his Sun, and his Rain doth good to them, Matth.</hi> v. 45.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> So his temporal judgments fall upon the righteous, as well as upon the unrighteous. <hi>Communia esse voluit, &amp; commoda profanis, &amp; incommoda suis,</hi> Tertul. <hi>Solomon observes it. Eccle.</hi> ix. 1. <hi>No man knows love, or hatred, by all that is before them; all things come alike, to the righteous, and to the wicked.</hi> The priviledges of Gods People are not temporal, but spiritual; not exemption from common sufferings, but grace and comfort in them; that's the Saints portion. Otherwise, Religion would not be a matter of faith, but sense; and men would serve God, not for piety, but for plenty.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               </item>
               <item>2. The Saints are partakers in these common sufferings, as being parts and members of those Societies and People who are thus punished. A Christian, is both <hi>filius Seculi,</hi> and <hi>filius Dei.</hi> He hath that in him, which belongs to the present generation, as well as that which pertains to the state of regeneration. Now, the sins of any body, or nation, may involve all the members in the same Judgment. <hi>Haec mala, nos quoque perstringunt, ut vobis inherentes. Lot</hi> was carried away in the Captivity of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as cohabiting with them. As in personal sins, the Father's sin doth subject the Son to punishment, <hi>quia filius pars patris;</hi> all <hi>Achans</hi> family was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> destroyed for <hi>Achans</hi> sacriledge; so, in national sins, the Saints of God, though personally innocent, yet because members of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent body, are liable to undergo the temporal smart of national Judgments.</item>
               <item>3. The Servants of God, are often contributers to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104362:131"/>
heap of sin, that brings down Judgments. Though they be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not actours of those gross impieties that call for vengeance; yet their sins, though of a smaller nature, adds to the fewel of Gods indignation. Gross impieties are like Pitch, or Gunpowder, that enrages the fire; but even the sins of Gods Servants, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible matter, and do add to the flame. Thus, not onely <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi> his bloud-shed, but even good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his vanity, and boasting of his riches, brought upon the Land the Babylonish Captivity.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> meditates upon this point piously; and gives reasons, why good Christians are involved in common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Quamvis longÃ¨ absint Ã  flagitiis, non tamen Ã  delictis;</hi> Sinners they are, though not outragious ones; and their sins, may be, are <hi>tanto crebriora, quanto minora.</hi> Small sins frequently committed, are just provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</item>
               <item>2. They are punish'd here with wicked men, saith he, <hi>Quia non sic vivunt cum impiis, ut cum iis viven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est.</hi> They suffer with wicked men; because living with them, they do not teach them, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them, and reprove them, and mourn for them.</item>
               <item>3. Saints suffer in temporal things, because, though they do not luxuriously abuse them, yet, saith he, they do too much enjoy them. <hi>Simul cum impiis flagellan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non quia simul agunt malam vitam, sed quia simul amant temporalem vitam; non aequaliter, sed tamen simul.</hi>

               </item>
               <item>2. As he forecasts them; so, in this Particle <hi>Yet,</hi> he provides against them. And that sets out the holy entertainment which the Prophet will give to this foreseen Calamity.</item>

These, and such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as these, are the thoughts of carnal men. Ey, but this Scripture offers more grace.

            <list>
               <item>1. Here is the low degree of the affliction; he takes it at the worst; he supposeth himself not onely in some necessity, but in extremity, in want of all outward things. He saith not, Onely if I have food, and raiment, though but hard fare, and coarse clothing, it shall suffice; He submits not onely to <hi>Agur's</hi> portion, <hi>Neither riches, nor poverty, but food convenient</hi> to sustain nature; He stops not at <hi>Micaiah's</hi> diet, <hi>Bread of affliction, and water of affliction;</hi> No, he knows how to undergo the loss of all things. Let poverty come upon him as an armed man, and spoil him of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all; yet his heart will hold up, he is not dismayed. Ey, here is Piety in the strength, and highest improvement. That will not capitulate with God, how much it will suffer, and no more, but will resolve to bear the heaviest burthen, submit to the sharpest affliction, and undergo it holily.</item>
               <item>2. The Prophets Piety is seen in another degree, that's the high degree of affection, with which he will entertain this great affliction.</item>

                     <item>2. He resolves, not onely to be content with it, and well pleased with this condition; that's a degree higher. Patience suffers it, but Contentment feels it not.

They answer all these Prophesies, as <hi>Esay</hi> complains of them, <hi>chap.</hi> xxx. 10. <hi>They say to the Seers, see not; and to the Prophets, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie not unto us right things, but prophesie to us deceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jews, they pervert the Text, and some other Expositours mistake it; and draw down the height and mysterie of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> speech, to an inferiour sense. But, generally, the most Ancient, and most Orthodox Interpreters, do fasten their Meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Text, as a clear, and undoubted prediction of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Resurrection. And this sense we embrace, and so appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the words as a Prophetical prediction, and faithful confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Saviours victory, and triumph, over the power of death.</p>
               <p>And, it is of good use to look back to these Prophesies, even after their fulfilling: As the Angel spake this day to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at the Sepulchre, <hi>Come see the place, where the Lord was laid;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The emptiness of the grave proved that he was risen: So, even after <hi>Christ</hi> is risen, it is of use to our faith, to review these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies; Come see the place that foretold his rising again; the fulfilling of these Texts will greatly confirm our faith of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. As in your purchases, and possessions, though you be already seized and stated in them, yet ye desire to get in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conveyances, to strengthen your tenure: So, though you be possess'd of this dayes benefit, yet these Prophesies are as our fore-fathers records; we claim these Testimonies as our Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; our Faith holds by them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               </p>
               <p>To reflect upon these Prophesies, will confirm our belief in all other Truths, as yet to be fulfilled; <hi>Impleta credimus, impleri vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus, implenda confidimus,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine:</hi> It will put <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Song into our mouths; <hi>As we have heard, so have we seen:</hi> Heard it foretold, Seen it fulfill'd. We may sing with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>All the wayes of the Lord, are Mercy and Truth:</hi> Mercy in Promising, Truth in Performing. We may confess with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Blessed be the Lord, who spake it with his mouth; and hath with his hand fulfilled it.</hi> We may open our Text, as <hi>Christ</hi> did; <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears;</hi> our Faith may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> set to its Seal, That God is true.</p>
               <p>For the words themselves, they report unto us a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, remarkable Prophesie of the Resurrection; of a double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:</p>

                  <item>1. Here <hi>Iob</hi> fore-sees, and fore-tells the Resurrection of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> He tells us, That <hi>Christ,</hi> who by his Death Redeem'd him, hath again obtain'd an endless Life; That after his fall by Death, he is recovered, and got up again; stands, and shall stand last upon the earth.</item>
                  <item>2. He Prophesies of his own resurrection, That though he were now in a dying condition, death had already seiz'd upon him; yet he knew there was hope in his death, that he should be raised from the grave of corruption, to an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living and blessed state and condition.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now, surely, this is a Text of Scripture worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> much to be set by, both for the clearness, and evidence of it, and also for the date it bears, and print of Antiquity.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. 'Tis a clear Prophesie; there is not a fuller, more express description of the Resurrection, in all the Scripture, then this of <hi>Iob</hi>'s. He speaks like an Apostle, rather then a Prophet. <hi>O virum ante Evangelium, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>

                  </item>
                  <item>2. And then there is another Excellency that commends it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the date of Antiquity. They all agree, that <hi>Moses</hi> was the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of this Book. <hi>Iob</hi> lived in <hi>Moses</hi> his time, or before him. St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> reckons him the fourth from <hi>Esau.</hi> So timely a Prophesie of our Saviours Death and Resurrection, 'tis a rare Monument. S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that <hi>Christs</hi> Resurrection was the <hi>Purchase of our Inheritance.</hi> Now, in matters of Inheritance, the ancientest Deeds and Conveyances are alwayes the best. Here is a Court-roll written by <hi>Moses,</hi> the first Pen-man that God ever imployed; and here is a Copy taken up by <hi>Iob,</hi> one of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Saints, and by him conveyed to the Church for ever. It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was a matter of debasement to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he had <hi>Posthumam fidem Resurrectionis; Last of all he was seen of me, as born out of due time,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. Contrary, 'tis a great Dignity to <hi>Iob,</hi> that he is <hi>Primogenitus Fidei;</hi> First of all he was seen by him. His Faith hath the Birth-right of all the Saints in the Old Scripture. It was the high praise of those good women in the Gospel, that they rose early to go to the Sepulchre. <hi>Iob</hi>'s Faith out-strips them all, carries him betimes to the grave of <hi>Christ;</hi> he believes, and confesses his Resurrection.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The words then, they set out unto us a lively Profession of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Faith. <hi>Iob,</hi> indeed, is propounded to us as a pattern of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> v. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Iob:</hi> And it was most remarkable. But yet patience, it is not an original virtue; but springs, and arises from some other Grace. 'Tis <hi>Filia Fidel;</hi> the Daughter of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. It flowes from Faith. Would

Here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is the Mother, and Breeder, and Supporter of his Patience; his Faith of a Redemption, and a Resurrection, made him endure all. <hi>I should utterly have fainted, but that I believe to see the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Lord in the land of the Living,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psal.</hi> cxvi. So should <hi>Iob;</hi> his Faith kept him from fainting. Nay, not onely so, saith S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> v. but by virtue of true Faith, <hi>We glory in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations.</hi> It makes <hi>Iob</hi> endure them, chearfully, comfortably, and even to glory in them.</p>
               <p>So then, let us a little vary the Apostle's Expression, and say, We have heard of the Faith of <hi>Iob.</hi> He makes a double Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of it in the Text:</p>

                              <item>2. It is the great Excellency of our Christian Faith, that the Church, before <hi>Christ,</hi> received and embraced it. The Prophets, as well as the Apostles, they all saw his Glory, and spake of him.

It is the order and method that <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s faith observed, <hi>Isaiah</hi> xxxviii. <hi>Thou hast in love to my soul delivered me from the pit of corruption, for thou hast cast all mysins behind thy back.

It was the Oeconomy of Divine revelation, the mysteries of our Christian faith were but dimly discovered to the faith of our fore-fathers; <hi>I shall see him, but not now, I shall behold him, but not nigh.</hi> And it is observable, The nearer the accomplishment of Prophecies, the clearer were the Predictions. The Cocks, the nearer to the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising, the louder they crow. But, the time <hi>Iob</hi> lived in, it was but <hi>Conticinium fidei,</hi> yet see, he speaks of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and his own resurrection, as expresly and plainly, as if it were near at hand. <hi>Videndo credere,</hi> that's <hi>Thomas</hi> his faith; he saw <hi>Christ</hi> was risen, and therefore believed; <hi>Plus oculo, quÃ m oraculo credidit;</hi> but, <hi>Credendo videre,</hi> that's <hi>Iob</hi>'s faith, he believed it as fully, as if he had seen it clearly.

and the Church in general, you may believe firmly, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> say, I know them; but for those Truths that concern our selves in particular, That <hi>Christ</hi> hath Redeemed me, Sanctified me, will Raise me to Life and Glory, there is no <hi>Scio</hi> for them; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sure of them; hope well we may, but with contrary doubtings and suspitions. No, in all Gods Promises, Faith must labour to work out assurance. <hi>Quod propter Deum creditur, ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitÃ¨r creditur.</hi> If God saith, Faith assures it self of it.

Here is <hi>Fortitudo fidei;</hi> here appears the great strength of his faith, that foresees, and forecasts all the future difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and hindrances of his expectation, and overcomes them all, and is resolute against them. He considers death, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of death, rotttenness, and corruption: Can a body, when it is wasted, and consumed in the Grave, ever rise again? Yes, yes, saith <hi>Iob,</hi> Nothing is impossible to an omnipotent God; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> I know whom I have trusted, and he is able to effect it.</p>
                     <p>A weak Faith is glad to look off from these difficulties, and shrinks back at them: As <hi>Martha,</hi> considering <hi>Lazarus</hi> was four days dead, and began to putrefie, her faith began to fail her; it was too late now to remove the Grave-stone. But Faith in its strength, considers all these, urges these impossibilities, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> and yet overcomes them: As <hi>Elijah</hi> in his dispute with <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, took all the disadvantages to himself; <hi>Pour on water,</hi> and again, <hi>Pour on more water,</hi> Faith shall fetch fire from Heaven to enflame the Sacrifice; so, saith <hi>Iob,</hi> Let me die, and not, and putrefie in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Grave, nay, let the fire burn my body, or the Sea swallow it, or wilde Beasts devour it, yet it shall be restored to me; Death shall be <hi>praedae suae oustos,</hi> like the Lion that kill'd the Prophet, and then stood by his body, and did not consume it. <hi>Iob</hi>'s faith laughs at impossibilities, is asham'd to talk of difficulties; with <hi>Abraham,</hi> considers not his own dead body, but believes <hi>above, and against hope;</hi> knew God would restore it.</p>

                     <p>2. A second print of Piety, is <hi>Alacritas fidei;</hi> the great alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and cheerfulness of his faith, against present discouragements. See how cheerfully he views the horrid face of death, now seizing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> upon him; looks upon his ulcerous body, the skin consumed and eaten with Worms (<hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, he play'd with the Worms) he surveys all the ghastly appearances, and approaches of death, confidently, comfortably, through this faith of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
                     <p>This blessed assurance makes him look Death in the face un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly. Alass we how doth any appearance of death affright us? If we see but another man die, the cold sweat, and the pale face, and the pangs of death upon him, how doth it dismay us. <hi>Iob</hi> finds all these in himself, and speaks comfortably of them. 'Tis <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> S. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s pious counsel, <hi>Si times mortem, ama resurrectionem;</hi> If thou beest afraid of death<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> acquaint thy self with the hope of the resurrection.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> What is the thing his Faith longs for at the resurrection? It is the seeing of his Saviour, the beholding of God, the enjoying of his Redeemer. <hi>In my flesh shall I see God; and mine eyes shall behold him.</hi> 'Tis that that makes the resurrection comfortable; not that we shall live ever, but be <hi>ever with the Lord.</hi> It was small joy for <hi>Absalom</hi> to dwell at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and not be admitted to see the Kings face, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xiv.

               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Iob</hi> was overlaid, and opprest with affliction. Suitable to this condition, this Meditation affords, <hi>Vim sustentaetivam;</hi> it supports his spirits amidst all his afflictions. Here is the patience of the Saints; mockings, and scourgings, and bonds, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they endured them all, because they expected <hi>a better resurrection.

                     <hi>raise us up also with Iesus,â€”and for this cause we faint not.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Thus also he comforts, and cheers up other Christians. <hi>If in this life onely, we had hope in Christ, we were of all men most miserable;</hi> But there is a Resurrection, after this life we have hope in <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore of all men most happy. This assurance will stand by us, when all things else fail. It was <hi>Esau</hi>'s confession, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <hi>I am at the point to die, and what profit shall this birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right do to me?</hi> But, to be <hi>Filius resurrectionis,</hi> that Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right will relieve us at our last agony, and support us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably. <hi>Iob</hi> felt the good of this Meditation, and he insists upon it; Here is <hi>Masticatio fidei,</hi> he chews it in his mouth, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sucks out the sweetness of it.</item>
                  <item>2. You may see <hi>Iob</hi> in another condition, transported with passion, and suitable to that, this Meditation it had <hi>Vim qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etativam;</hi> a great virtue he found in it, to settle, and compose him. In the Verses going before, his spirit is <hi>stirred within him,</hi> he is full of complainings, and murmurings, and quarrellings with God, and expostulations; See how he rebukes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays these storms and tempests, with this Meditation; <hi>O my soul, keep silence unto God, for of him comes my salvation.</hi> Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> stills discontents, <hi>Why art thou so troubled, O my soul? Why</hi>

                     <hi>art thou so disquieted within me? I shall yet praise him.</hi> The day shall come, that I shall see his countenance, and for ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him. <hi>Mortale mori,</hi> is one ground of settlement against these perplexities, and <hi>Iob</hi> makes use of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> xiv. but, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum reviviscere,</hi> is satisfaction with advantage; that will calm, and quiet all his complainings.</item>
                  <item>3. Lastly, behold <hi>Iob</hi> in another condition; he is charged by his friends, with the sin of hypocrisie; and then this Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it hath <hi>Vim apologeticam,</hi> 'tis his defence and apologie against that accusation. Against all their surmises and suspicions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of his integrity, this he opposes for his justification; <hi>It is God that justifies me, who are ye that condemn me?</hi> 'Tis <hi>Christ,</hi> that is dead, and now risen again, he shall judge and acquit me.

provoking, the other weeping; both disquieting the peace of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the soul. And he who is Spiritual, like S. <hi>Paul,</hi> will heed and observe them; have his eye upon his thoughts and inward incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.

Affliction sits light, but sin sits heavy on him. <hi>Tu nÃ´sti gemitus cordis mei, de hacre, &amp; flumina oculorum meorum,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> bewailing but one of his infirmities.</item>
                  <item>3. He finds, and layes hold upon help against them. Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents <hi>Christ,</hi> and his power ready to succour and deliver him; <hi>I thank God, through Iesus Christ my Lord.</hi> These infirmities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fetch'd tears from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but yet he doth not weep out the eye of Faith; looks up to <hi>Christ,</hi> as to his soveraign Antidote, to cure and recover him. And then,</item>
                  <item>4. He comforts himself against those many evils, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent fruits arising from these infirmities. There are three main evils that arise from them;</item>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. These sinful infirmities; in themselves, have a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power in them; they deserve, in justice, no less then the curse of God, and eternal damnation. Papists, and others may sleight these first motions, and count them no sins; S. <hi>Paul</hi> judges them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> damnable. Sin is so strong a poyson, that the least grain is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the Gospel doth not make them no sins, but makes them pardonable, (As God destroyed not the fiery Serpents, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a cure and remedy against them) in themselves damnable. Against this evil consequent, S. <hi>Paul</hi> finds a Consolation, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus;</hi> that State and Condition, brings with it Pardon and Absolution.</item>
                        <item>
                           <p>2. A second evil consequent from these infirmities, is that Thraldome, and Captivity, and Vexation, which these remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of sin bring upon the soul of a Christian. Though he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his pardon, yet his shackles and his bolts are still upon him. Though he be freed from the condemning power of these infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, yet still he suffers encumbrance and vexation from them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="275" facs="tcp:104362:145"/>It is matter of great heaviness to the Saints, that they are thus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hindred and encumbred; that they find such strivings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions in themselves against the law of God; that the flesh should resist and oppress the spirit; that <hi>Hagar</hi> should insult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Sarah;</hi> the bond-woman over the free; that <hi>Ishmael</hi> should over-top <hi>Isaac;</hi> that <hi>Esau,</hi> in the womb of grace, should struggle with <hi>Iacob;</hi> that the house of <hi>Saul</hi> should still be quarrelling with the house of <hi>David.</hi> But against this, he comforts himself and others; <hi>The law of the Spirit hath made us free from the law of sin;â€”ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit,</hi> vers. 9.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. A third evil is, that these infirmities, and remainders of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sin, have a malignant power to make us subject to the law of death. Their very being in a Christian, is the seed and original of mortality.</item>
                        <item>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. Though sin be pardon'd by the death of <hi>Christ;</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. Though the dominion and power of it be broken and subdued by the Spirit of <hi>Christ;</hi> yet,</item>
                              <item>3. As long as it remains in us in the least and lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, it makes us subject to the power of death.</item>

                        </item>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Yet against this, S. <hi>Paul</hi> finds a double comfort:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. This subjection to death is not total, 'tis but half a death; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the death of the body onely. That, indeed, we are obnoxious to; but the soul hath escaped free from the snares of death. <hi>The body indeed is dead</hi> (that is subject to death) <hi>because of sin; but the Spirit, that is life, because of righteousness, vers.</hi> 10. Our chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and best part, the proper seat of misery, or happiness, that's put into a state of spiritual and glorious immortality. <hi>Fear not that, that kills the body, and can do no more;</hi> It is not a total death.</item>
                  <item>2. Even this bodily death to be undergone, 'tis not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that's a second comfort. It hath a limit of time set to it. Death shall not alwayes gnaw upon us in the grave. <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shall have dominion over Death in the morning.</hi> Our bodies, in the holds of Death, are <hi>Prisoners of Hope;</hi> there will be an enlargement; Death shall be swallowed up, and abolish'd; the Power and Spirit of God shall free these mortal bodies, bring us, like <hi>Peter,</hi> asleep out of the dungeon. <hi>If the Spirit of him that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up Iesus from the dead dwell in you.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The Text then, 'tis the blessed Assurance, and Evidence of a Christians happy Resurrection. In it observe these four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                  <item>1. Is the Condition, upon which it is promised, and we may expect it; <hi>If the Spirit of him that raised up Iesus from the dead dwell in you.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Is the main Cause and Efficient of this our Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> for the Condition, <hi>If.</hi> I call it a Condition, and yet it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a threefold force in it:</p>
               <p>I. It hath the force of a Connexion; it makes a Connexion with the former priviledges and comforts of a Christian.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. No condemnation for sin, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. that's one comfort.</item>
                  <item>2. No dominion, nor power, nor absolute sway of sin; that's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a second comfort.</item>
                  <item>3. No total, nor final, nor utter destruction by sin; Death is abolish'd; that's a third comfort.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It shews us a blessed concatenation, and linck of a Christians priviledges. Mercy, it begins in Pardon, and growes, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses it self in Grace, and never gives over till it hath placed us in Glory.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Here is the fat Calf kill'd for us; the holy Lamb of God redeeming us from condemnation.</item>
                  <item>2. Here is the Ring put upon our finger, the Seal and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Pledge of his Spirit; and,</item>
                  <item>3. Here is the choyce Robe of Glory and Immortality, that we are invested with. 'Tis a Connexion.</item>
               </list>
               <p>II. It hath the use and force of an Illation; <hi>But if.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces and proves our Resurrection out of former antecedent principles, and priviledges. The raising, and glorifying of our bodies, 'tis an appendix, and deduction from some other things. Our Resurrection is not so much a principle, as a conclusion of Faith; and it must be inferred, not by an <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> but by a <hi>Sorites;</hi> it hangs not upon one principle, but upon many; Not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conclude, <hi>Praescivit, ergo glorificavit;</hi> but, He hath redeemed, he hath called, he hath mortified, and sanctified, therefore he will raise us, and at last glorifie us. These assurances are not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, and clear in themselves, but are contained in their causes. We must not presently affirm, I shall be saved, my body shall be raised; but it must be lawfully concluded, out of warrantable grounds; If I be justified, If I be sanctified, If the Spirit of God dwell in me; make sure of these, these are Evidences, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Pledges of our Resurrection. That's the second; it hath the force of an Illation.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               </p>
               <p>III. It hath the force of a Caution, and necessary Proviso. And so it makes our Resurrection conditional. But how can that be?</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Our Resurrection, 'tis absolute and necessary, <hi>ex exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia</hi>

                  <item>2. This resurrection to Life, hath a certainty in it; Gods purpose hath determin'd it, <hi>Christs</hi> merits have purchased it. True, and yet it is conditional. Not any promise, or mercy on Gods part, but supposes, and requires conditions on ours.

The denial of this truth, by the Greek Church, caused that great Schism<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 'twixt the Eastern and Western <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Churches; and (if we will believe <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) this errour was remarkably punished by God; the City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on the Feast-day dedicated to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> sackt and overthrown.</p>
                     <p>However, the Christian faith acknowledges the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be, the Spirit of the Father, and the Spirit of the Son.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes he is called the Spirit of the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> xv. 26. <hi>He is called the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father. Luke</hi> xxiv. 19.

                     <p>Again, sometimes he is called (and that in truth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of speech) the Spirit of the Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, Gal.</hi> iv. 6. <hi>God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts.</hi> As the Spirit is <hi>the promise of the Father,</hi> so likewise he is <hi>the promise of the Son, Iohn</hi> xvi.

Thus the Scripture ascribes his Humiliation to himself, his Exaltation to his Father, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 7. <hi>He made himself of no reputation, he took upon him the form of a servant, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himself, and became obedient; wherefore God highly exalted him.</hi> Usurping <hi>Adonijah,</hi> steps of himself into his fathers Throne.

And though he dwells in us by every Grace, yet there are two special Graces, to which the Scripture ascribes the Inhabiting:</item>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Is Faith; that's the Grace that lets in God into the soul, and gives him possession. <hi>Ephes.</hi> iii. 17. <hi>He dwells in our hearts by Faith.</hi> Infidelity excludes him; Faith receives and entertains him.</item>
                        <item>2. Is Charity; by it the Spirit dwells in us. <hi>God is love, and he that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> iv. 16. Love, amongst men, it is a cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> quality. <hi>Amor congregat;</hi> 'tis an associating vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; tis the glew and cement of the world; it makes men dwell together. These two, are the two uniting Graces. Faith, unites to God mystically; Love, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. 'Tis the formal union of the soul with God.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The Spirit dwells in us, not onely by his gifts and graces, but really. The <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> is present, and applies, and unites himself to a Christian. Our bodies are <hi>the Temples of the Holy-Ghost,</hi> not of his Graces, but of his own sacred Person. The Fathers, prove the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> to be true God in Substance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> because he hath a Temple. None but God possesses a Temple. And, <hi>Habitatio,</hi> 'tis <hi>Actus Personae;</hi> properly, none but a person is said to Inhabit. Indeed, Substantially, the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> is every where; but yet Dwelling, adds to his natural Presence, a more special Habitude: He is <hi>tanquam in suo,</hi> where he doth Inhabit. A stranger may be present in an house, as well as the owner; but to be there by special Interest, as in his own Possession, so the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> is present in a Christian.</item>
               </list>
               <p>That's the first Consideration, How the Spirit dwells in us.</p>
               <p>But,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               </p>
               <p>II. What doth this Dwelling imply?</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Dwelling implies Propriety, and special Right and Interest. It is a Possessive word. The soul, and body of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is Gods more immediate Possession; he hath the reference
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:104362:149"/>
of a lord, and owner to it. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 19.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>Ye are the Temple of the Holy-Ghost, and ye are not your own.</hi> A Christian is Gods upon a fuller right and title, then another man. All are his; as all wasts are the lord's of the Soil; but his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and mansion-house, are more specially his. Such a reference hath a Christian to God. He is his, not upon common tenure, but by peculiar appropriation.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p>2. Dwelling implies Residency, and Continuance, and Fixedness of abode.

            <p>I. For the Substance of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s proffer. In it these four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are remarkable:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The forwardness and freeness of it: 'Tis a preventing offer. <hi>Elijah</hi> stayes not till <hi>Elisha</hi> sues to him, but prevents him, and makes the Motion first, and freely invites him to enjoy a blessing from him. True Charity, and desire of doing good,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> stayes not for entreaties, expects not importunity, but freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it self, and begins first. Thus <hi>Isaac</hi> called his son to bless him, unsought-to. Thus <hi>Christ</hi> called <hi>Matthew,</hi> who never look'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; bids himself to <hi>Zacheus.</hi> As the Prophet bids the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow borrow vessels of her neighbours to pour Oyl into; so Charity borrows and begs of others to receive the communion of those graces with which she is furnished. <hi>Elisha</hi>'s first calling was a preventing favour; now his second calling, 'tis by preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Christian Charity, is not like a dry and deep Pump, that must be often pumped before it sends out water; but like a full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Fountain, flowing over, and streaming to all about it. <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>Tis S. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> observation of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> readiness to the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> it must be an express revelation that must forbid him to preach in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Bithynia.</hi> They who are of <hi>Elijahs,</hi> and S. <hi>Pauls</hi>

               <item>
                  <p>2. A second thing observable, is the fulness, and largeness of this his Offer; <hi>Ask what thou wilt.</hi> The Popish Saints are limited to some sorts of blessing, wherein they may prevail. Such a Saint, he can pleasure thee in thy health; such an one is for such a disease; such an one can bestow such a favour.</p>
                  <p>Here is a Favourite of heaven can speed any suit, procure any favour, or blessing, that is fitting for thee. What cannot the prayer of an <hi>Elijah</hi> obtain? He can open, and shut heaven; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> bring down Fire, or Water, as S. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks of him. <hi>Am I God, to kill and make alive, that this man doth send to me?</hi> said the King of Israel to those that were sent to him from Syria, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> v. But what saith <hi>Elisha? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a Prophet in Israel.</hi> God hath given a kind of Omnipotency to the prayers of his Saints. The King can deny you nothing. Prayer is a key, that opens all Gods Store-houses. And he gives this key to his Saints and Children. Happy they who enjoy the society of such an <hi>Elias.</hi> But thrice happy they, who have the spirit of <hi>Elijah;</hi> who can be agents for themselves,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and all who seek to them.</p>
                  <p>But I demand, Was it safe to make such an unlimited offer to <hi>Elisha?</hi> To trust him with such an unbounded wish, to ask what he would?</p>
                  <p>I answer, We must conceive this large and liberal proffer is bounded, and circumscribed with these limitations:</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Caveat of lawful Conditions, and matter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency. God never gives us so ample a power to ask what we will, but straitens it up with these proviso<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>s; If lawful, If use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, If absolutely necessary, If agreeable to his Will, If service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to his Glory. Observe these Proviso's, and ask what thou wilt. <hi>Solomon,</hi> in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ii. 21. bids <hi>Bathsheba, Ask on, my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for I will not say thee nay.</hi> But yet her unadvised petition, was justly denied her. If we ask things agreeable to his will, we <hi>know he heareth us,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> v. 14. Then God saith, as to the woman of Canaan<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

                     </item>
                     <item>2. A second limitation, is, <hi>Congruitas vocationis.</hi> If <hi>Elisha</hi> means to speed, it must be a Suit answerable and fitting to his State and Calling. <hi>Elisha</hi> was a Prophet; let him ask what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a Prophet to ask, and he shall not return empty. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Zebedees</hi> sons sped not in her request to <hi>Christ.</hi> Why? Her suit in general might be lawful, but it agreed not with them to ask such favours; <hi>Ye know not what ye ask: Are ye able to drink</hi>

                     </item>
                     <item>4. A fourth limitation that warrants this Offer, is, <hi>Intima directio:</hi> That Spirit that directed him to offer, would direct <hi>Elisha</hi> to ask. <hi>We know not what we should pray for, as we ought; but the Spirit it self maketh Intercession for us, Rom.</hi> viii. 26. God bids <hi>Solomon</hi> ask what he would; but withall, inspires him with such a prayer as should find acceptance.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>3. A third thing observable, is the Reality and Efficacie of this proffer; <hi>What shall I do for thee?</hi> There is Substance and Reality in that word. Alas! What can <hi>Elijah</hi> do? For tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral blessings, he was to seek himself: for spiritual, they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the immediate dispensations of God himself. True; and yet he calls it a Doing, and Giving. Faith reckons upon Prayers and Intercessions it makes according to the will of God, as if they were real and full Donations; is as sure to obtain them, as if it were already put into the possession of them. See this in <hi>Isaac</hi>'s benediction and blessing of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> xxvii. 37. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him.</hi> How did he this? <hi>vers.</hi> 28.

                  <hi>of corn and wine.</hi> A faithful Prayer, it is as good as an actual Donation.

Here is a way by which the poorest may be beneficial, give, make rich. Prize these Prayers; especially the Prayers of those whom God hath appointed to bless in his name.</item>
               <item>4. A fourth thing observable, is the Wisdom and Order of this proffer: He will have him ask it, before he gives it. Though Gods grace be never so free, yet he requires that we should crave it of him. There is one blessing that God gives unask'd, and that is the grace of Asking. After-graces are given when we pray; onely he prevents us with the grace of Prayer. <hi>God</hi>

We must not look for his Spirit to enter into us sleeping, or without thinking of it. <hi>Ask, and it shall be given you; Seek, and you shall find; Knock, and it shall be opened unto you, Matth.</hi> vii. 7. <hi>Your heavenly Father will give the holy Spirit to them that ask him, Luke</hi> xi. 13. The Well of Grace is deep; but, <hi>Oratio,</hi> 'tis <hi>situla gratiae;</hi> the Bucket, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no drawing up any water of Grace.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Happy we! who may have Grace for asking.</p>
            <p>Wretched we! who will not ask, when we may have it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>We have done with the Substance of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s proffer. Come we now,</p>
            <p>II. To the Circumstance of time, <hi>Before I be taken from thee.</hi> Before I be taken from thee, beg what thou wilt.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <p>1. Observe, <hi>Elijah</hi> being to leave the world, his thoughts are for after-succession, that he may leave a Prophet in the Church of God; he will not leave the Church unfurnished, the people of God unprovided for. Oh! The Saints of God are solicitous, not onely for the present age wherein they live, but forecast for succession, that the worship of God may survive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them, and that after-posterities may be converted. <hi>Moses,</hi> how doth he pray for a Leader after him? <hi>Numb.</hi> xxvii. 16, 17. <hi>Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which may go out before them, and may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in, that the Congregation of the Lord be not as Sheep which have no Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</hi> How doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> charge the Churches for things after his death? <hi>Acts</hi> xx. S. <hi>Peter</hi> being to dye, fore-warns the Eldersâ€”2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i.</p>
                  <p>How wicked are they, who, so they may see peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in their dayes, little care what may befall the Church in succeeding generations. Good <hi>David,</hi> though he was forbid to build the Temple, yet how did he store up for <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxii. Oh! we enjoy the worship and service of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:104362:158"/>
God, and now stand by the care of others, let us not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in our cares and prayers, that a perpetual service may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by those who shall live after us, til the coming of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to Judgment.</p>
               </item>
               <item>2. Observe, he provides for the enabling of <hi>Elisha:</hi> He did not onely anoint him, but now furnishes him, being himself to dye, and to leave the world. Flesh and Bloud would have thought, Let him be imperfect, and deficient, they will wish me again; his defects will be a foil for my excellencies. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Successour, commends his Predecessour. Oh no; He desires to empty out all his Graces into <hi>Elisha;</hi> and rejoyced to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> see an <hi>Elisha</hi> so able to succeed him. The Nobles prayed, 1 <hi>King.</hi> i. 37. <hi>The Lord make the Throne of Solomon, greater then the Throne of King David;</hi> yet there was no jealousie in <hi>David.</hi> Glad they are that the Graces in their Successours may obscure them, that they may not be missed.</item>
               <item>3. Observe, <hi>Elijah</hi> is now most forward, and ready to do good, when he is to depart, and to leave this world. Saints, though they are alwayes desirous to do good; yet at their death, oh then, they are more abundant in all holy desires of doing good. Full of blessing they are alwayes, but at their leaving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the world, then they deal their benedictions more plentifully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. So did <hi>Moses</hi> in his Song; so dealt <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> and so did <hi>Elisha</hi> deal with the King of Israel; <hi>Christ</hi> with his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on mount Olivet; S. <hi>Peter</hi> when he was to lay down his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle. Oh then all Graces are most pregnant; their Faith, their Repentance, their Hope, their Prayers, their Blessings, Counsels, Reproofs; they will take their fill of them. The box of Oyntment, when it is broken, fills the house with the smell. They love to be sacrificed upon the service of the Church. S. <hi>Paul</hi> leaving the Ephesians, preached till midnight, imparts all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to them.</item>
               <item>4. Observe, he saith, <hi>Ask of me, before I be taken from thee:</hi> Had <hi>Elijah</hi> been of the Faith of Rome, there had been no need of this limitation; nay, rather, Ask of me, and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and pray to me, after I am in heaven; there I shall sue for thee, call then upon me. No such matter. If we will make use of <hi>Elijah,</hi> do it now. We may use reverend compellations now, not tender religious supplications thither. <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 23. <hi>Ye are come to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Iesus the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour of the New Covenant;</hi> they are not Mediatours. <hi>Ioseph</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Butler to remember him, but he forgat him. It was the pious meditation of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> upon those words of the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> oxxiii. 2. <hi>Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their Masters, and as the eyes of a Maiden unto the</hi>

                  <hi>he have mercy upon us.</hi> Observe, saith the Father, here upon earth we have Masters, and Mistrisses; but in heaven, <hi>Non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus Dominum &amp; Dominam,</hi> but onely our Lord and Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that must have mercy upon us.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Elisha</hi>'s desire; <hi>I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me.</hi> He answers not <hi>Elijah,</hi> as <hi>Ahaz</hi> to <hi>Isaiah,</hi> when he bad him <hi>ask a Sign;</hi> no, <hi>I will not ask, Isai.</hi> vii. 11, 12. <hi>Elijah</hi> no sooner maks proffer, but he lays hold on it. 'Tis good making use of <hi>Elijah</hi> while we have him with us, unfold our wants to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him, that he may supply them. <hi>Elijah</hi> must not always continue among us. The times may come, when <hi>we shall wish to see one of the days of the Son of man, and it shall not be.</hi> Oh, in this thy day, now the Angel is stirring the water, yet <hi>Elijah</hi> is among us; do as <hi>Elisha,</hi> he makes haste, petitions him presently.</p>

            <list>
               <item>1. The first Supposal, is, <hi>Identitas Spiritus.</hi> He supposes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the same Spirit shall be settled upon him, that rested on <hi>Elijah.</hi> Here is a continuation of the same Spirit in a succession of men. <hi>Elijah</hi> is taken away. Yes; but his Spirit shall remain. The means and instruments of grace may be removed, but the gifts of the Spirit shall continue still. It is worth the observing, God ties not himself to any personal perfections. Oh, we think, If such a Saint dies, what will become of the Church? 'Tis a loss; but yet, in diversity of men, here is the same Spirit. When <hi>Moses</hi> died, his spirit rested upon <hi>Ioshua. Aaron</hi> died, <hi>Eleazar</hi> was invested, and clothed with the same Spirit. It must comfort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> us, when we see glorious Instruments taken from us; <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. yet the same spirit remains, and breathes in his Church. As it was said to the evil servant, <hi>Tolle talentum, &amp; da;</hi> so of the good. The Lord needs no mans person, or parts, he can set his Spirit upon another.</item>
               <item>2. A second Supposal, is <hi>Portio Spiritus.</hi> The Spirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> is apportioned out in a limited dispensation. It is <gap reason="foreign">

               <item>3. A third Supposal is, <hi>Inaequalitas portionum.</hi> There is a single portion, and a double portion. Some have one talent, some two, another five. There is not any Saint but hath one, not any that have all, but some more, some less. <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s mess was five times as much as any of the rest of his brethrens.</item>
               <item>4. A fourth Supposal is, <hi>Duplicatio in juniore. Elisha</hi> the successour, and junior, may have a double Portion, more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                  <hi>Elijah</hi> his predecessour. God can cross his hands, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, and <hi>lay his right hand upon Ephraims head,</hi> who was the younger; and <hi>his left hand upon Manassehs head, who was the first-born, Gen.</hi> xlviii. 14. We cannot prescribe to God. 'Tis neither the age of men, nor the precedency of times, that is any thing; but the Lord may be as bountifull to this Age, as unto Antiquity. It is no disparagement to <hi>Elijah,</hi> that <hi>Elisha</hi> exceeds him. After-ages may be furnished with more eminent men in some kinds, then the more Primitive and Ancient times have been. We worthily reverence Antiquity, and rise up at the gray head; but yet God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> may double some gifts on their successours. <hi>Augustine, Hierom,</hi> the rest, were most reverend; yet <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> others, more famous in their generation.</item>

               <hi>First,</hi> The Matter of his Request. Had many of us such a large Offer made us, to ask what we would, I fear we should not have pitched upon this request of <hi>Elisha,</hi> for a spiritual blessing. <hi>Elijah</hi> had a power of curing, and raising from the dead; health, and long life, some would have asked. <hi>Elijah</hi> could cause plenty, bring famine, increase oyl; others would have urged a supply of riches. <hi>Elijah</hi> could bring down fire to consume his enemies, others would have desired victory, and safety. The Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that, naturally, these are our carnal desires, in his reply to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> iii. 11. <hi>Because thou hast asked this thing, and</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>hast not asked for thy self long life, neither hast asked riches for thy self, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>See, here is one who passes by all these, and knows how to frame a Petition aright, that he is sure shall speed; the prayer for the Spirit. Oh, 'tis a great advantage, to know what to pray for. <hi>Docet dare qui prudenter rogat;</hi> The choosing of the better part, prevails with God. <hi>Herod</hi> offers to the Damosel, to ask what she will; and she asks the head of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> the life of her enemy. Piety will ask the spirk of the <hi>Baptist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why doth <hi>Elisha</hi> pitch upon this request? Why begs he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Spirit?</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. He had <hi>Spirium vocantem,</hi> now he begs the Spirit enabling. He was called to a spiritual Function, now he sues for a spiritual enablement for the discharge and execution of it. If God puts us into a Calling, we must beg and seek for gifts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to it. See <hi>Moses,</hi> how importunate was he with God for enablement? <hi>Solomon,</hi> call'd to the Kingdom, begs a Kingly spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. How many are there, who sue for the Calling, but seldom crave the Enabling? It must be so in every employment. Art thou called to an Office? beg wisdom, courage, fidelity. Art <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thou a servant? beg the graces suitable. Art thou in any course of life? go to God for enablement, that he may make thee an able member in the Church or Common-wealth. In every course of life, we must labour for skill and prudence, and sufficiency. In thy Calling, strive to excel, to the edifying of the Church. Gods Work-men have a wise spirit, to work all cunning work. <hi>Iacobs</hi> Sons were men of Activity, therefore <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would employ them.</item>
               <item>2. He asks that which was fittest for <hi>Elijah</hi> to grant him. <hi>Elijah</hi> had a kind of Universality of obtaining any thing, but it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was proper for him to give that which himself excelled in. They are <hi>Dona dextrae</hi> that move most readily; <hi>Dona throni,</hi> not <hi>Bona scabelli.</hi> With men we grant small requests, and stick at great gifts; but God gives his best gifts most readily.</item>

Oh, it was this, that he had been an able and faithful Prophet, an holy man; it was that which made him leave the World thus peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, comfortably, willingly. This makes <hi>Elisha</hi> crave the Spirit. All outward things, what comfort can they breed at our last parting? Give me that that may breed matter of comfort at my last need; make me such a Prophet, that I may so live, as I may die like <hi>Elijah.</hi>

            <p>Look upon a rich man dying, see what comfort he gets by his riches, or honours. Look on a man replenish'd with Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Spirit, one who hath done God much service, now ready to have his Lords <hi>Euge,</hi> and to enter into that joy; it will make thee wish one dram of grace, rather then the whole World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. Judge of <hi>Elijah,</hi> hid in Mount <hi>Carmel</hi> for Persecution; and look on <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests ruffling in <hi>Iezabels</hi> Court, it may tempt thee to wish their Honour: Ey, but stay a while, see their Honour, and <hi>Elijah</hi>'s glorious Death, or Departure, it will make thee neglect the one, to beg the other; and chuse rather to die in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s hairy Mantle, then in all their bravery.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The measure of it, <hi>A double portion of thy Spirit.</hi> Why so? What makes him desire a greater measure then <hi>Elijah</hi> had? What? Was it envy, and carnal emulation, to out-strip <hi>Elijah?</hi> Or ambition, to be more renowned in his Generation? 'Tis true, a man may be proud of the Spirit, desirous to set up himself. But it was not so in <hi>Elisha.</hi> What may we conceive rais'd his desires so high?</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Dignitas doni;</hi> The excellency of these kind of gifts. Spiritual graces deserve eager pursuits, and vehement desires of them. A man may beg too much of outward blessings; but of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> spiritual gifts to save himself and others, we cannot be too co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous in getting of them. <gap reason="foreign">

Be zealously affected to spiritual Graces, strive to excell for the edifying of the Church. <hi>Solomon</hi> craves abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Wisdom; but of Riches, onely what is moderate and convenient. S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he heard of the virtue that was in <hi>Christs</hi> washing; then he saith to <hi>Christ, Lord, not my feet onely, but also my hands and my head.</hi> How preposterous are our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires generally? We crave two Portions of outward Blessings; but, a little Knowledge, little Abilities to do good, content us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> well.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Eminentia exempli;</hi> The lustre of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s example hath ravish'd him: The Spirit that was so eminent and conspicuous in him, it begets an holy emulation to attain, and outgoe him.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:104362:160"/>
Oh, to see grace of any sort incorporate and incarnate in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> man, it provokes the endeavours of others, makes them long to be excellent in such graces. This stirred up <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> to see S. <hi>Peter</hi> so glorious, he would needs purchase such a gift. When we see Religion clasped up in Books, it works not so effectually; when we see it reall and operative, then it works kindly upon us, makes others (if they have any mettle in them) to attain the like. Those who damp and smother the gifts of God in them, they hinder the progress and growth of grace in others. To see men carry grace, as men do a candle in a dark lanthorn, onely for themselves, it hinders emulation; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but to make it shine forth, and to be radiant, invites others to an holy ambition to out-strip, and exceed, and go beyond their Copies.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Gustus initialis gratiae; Elisha</hi> had some beginnings of these gifts before; he had felt the sweetness, and excellency of them; it makes him therefore the more earnest and eager to be rich in grace. They who have once felt the sweetness of Gods Spirit in any kind, they cannot satisfie themselves in any stint, but are earnest for more. The true Relishes of Gods first gifts, beget not loathing but longing; makes men to cry out, <hi>Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>evermore give us this bread,</hi> and to desire <hi>That the word of God may dwell plenteously in them.</hi> Grace, it is always growing, ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. They who content themselves with their first beginnings, have cause to suspect, they were not true and kindly. How doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> pray for more enablements? They who think they know enough, know nothing as they should.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Pondus officii;</hi> He is now to undergoe a weighty ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to become the main Prophet of the People of God; 'tis a burden heavy enough for Angels, and Archangels: The sense of this weight makes him call, and begg for a double Portion.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> There is no Calling but carries its burden, and so craves help; but the Prophetical Calling, that's an heavy Talent. What knowledge and understanding, what courage and resolution, what patience and forbearance is required? and all little enough for an <hi>Elisha</hi>'s employment. This made <hi>Solomon</hi> beg; Oh, 'tis a great People, give thy Servant therefore a large Heart. It made <hi>Moses</hi> shrink his shoulder from under it. They who in any kind, are to govern others, undergoe a weighty burden; they must beg a double Portion.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>Ardor zeli;</hi> His desire of doing much good makes him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thus earnest for much enablement. He desires to be a faithful Servant, to bring in much gain, to give up a large account of his Stewardship. They who think any service sufficient, any perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance enough, they may content themselves with small portions
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:104362:161"/>
of gifts. Here is one who is ambitious of gaining God much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> glory, of saving many souls.</item>
               <item>6. <hi>Gravitas damni;</hi> The loss of an <hi>Elias</hi> stirrs him up to crave a double Portion. <hi>Elijah</hi> was set for the defence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the burden of the Church rested on his shoulders; Now, that the Church hath lost him, it inflames <hi>Elisha</hi> to get himself furnish'd for to do that service. Oh, when we see the Church loses her choisest Patrons, and Upholders, it must not make us faint, but double our endeavours, that that loss may be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. So, <hi>Moses my servant is dead, arise Ioshuah,</hi> play the man now. This made <hi>Elijah</hi> zealous before; there is none left, <hi>I,</hi>

                  <hi>even I onely am left,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 10; so it doth now <hi>Elisha.</hi> The daily losses that the Church suffers, should make us more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in doing all the good we can.</item>

Look not upon thine own strength, but upon thine infirmities; Lord, <hi>I am a child, and cannot speak, who is sufficient for these things?

Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls upon the Churches, <hi>Pray for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the Gospel.</hi> Let us pray that God would shed his Spirit richly upon his Ministers.

               <hi>First,</hi> A serious fore-warning that <hi>Christ</hi> gives to his Disciples of the approach, and drawing near of the day of Judgment. A Truth, never unseasonable to be taught,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and believed in the Church of God; but yet most proper and suitable to the times of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. The times of the Gospel, in which we live, are call'd, <hi>The last dayes, Heb.</hi> i. 2. <hi>Brethren, the time is short,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. <hi>The ends of the world are come upon us Christians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 11. Not but that the times before <hi>Christ</hi> had this warning given them; and those Primitive Saints took notice of it. <hi>Enoch,</hi> that lived in the first age of the Church, preached this Truth to the old World. God, by the Spirit of Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>sie, reveal'd it; and he, by the eye of Faith, clearly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> discerned it, as if he had seen <hi>Christ</hi> coming in the Clouds. Hear what S. <hi>Iude</hi> saith, <hi>vers.</hi> xiv. <hi>Enoch, the seventh from Adam, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of these times; Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints, to execute Iudgment.</hi> And the Prophets spake so
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:104362:163"/>
clearly of our Saviours coming to Judgment in Glory, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Jews (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> observes) mistook his second coming for his first; they interpreted the predictions of his last appearance, for his first coming into the world in his Incarnation.</p>
            <p>The teaching of this Truth, was not then unseasonable; but yet, of the two Ages of the Church, the doctrine of the day of Judgment is most proper and agreeable to us Christians. The Faith of the Patriarchs and Prophets, was chiefly employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Christs</hi> first Coming, and Incarnation; the Faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must now expect and wait for his second Coming in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Judgment. They listned to hear the first voyce, gentle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and meek, as the voyce of a Lamb; we must be attentive to hear his last voyce, that is dreadful, and terrible, as the roaring of a Lion.</p>
            <p>Answerable to these two Epoches, and periods of the Churches Faith, the Scripture tells us of two dayes of <hi>Christ.</hi>

Indeed, the particular season, and set time of it, is reserved and concealed from us, and that for great and good purpose; but yet <hi>Christ</hi> hath furnished his Church with such signs and tokens of it, in the fulfilling of which, we may plainly conclude, The day is drawing on, and now approaching; that we may resolve with S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> ii. 18. <hi>We know that it is the last time.</hi> See, saith S. <hi>Iames, The Iudg standeth before the door.</hi> Who knows how soon he will enter in upon us? That's the second; he foretells the signs of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He doth not onely forewarn it, and foretel the signs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of it, but premonisheth, and giveth a Caveat to us, that we should carefully provide for it.</p>

               <item>3. The greatness, and measure, and strictness of this heed, in this vigilant, and watchful word of circumspection, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Lest at any time.</hi>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I. The first thing you must consider, is the duty of heedfulness and attention, <hi>Take heed,</hi> saith <hi>Christ.</hi> 'Tis the solemn watchword and warning of Scripture, often urged, and pressed upon us. <hi>Take heed to thy self,</hi> saith <hi>Moses, that thine heart be not deceived,</hi>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:104362:164"/>

               <hi>heed, Iosh.</hi> xxii. <hi>Take heed, and beware,</hi> saith <hi>Christ, Matth.</hi> xvi. It is a warning always seasonable, we all stand in need of it; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in three Exigencies;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. If the duty we undertake, the business about which we are employed, be weighty, and ponderous. Matters of less mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and consequence, may be slubbered and slighted, but matters of importance require heed and attention. Now, matters of Religion, that concern our spiritual state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the eternal welfare of our souls, are of all others, of highest consequence, of greatest concernment. <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap> set your hearts unto it,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> saith <hi>Moses, for it is not a vain thing for you, because it is your life, Deut.</hi> xxxii. 46. So again, <hi>Deut.</hi> iv. 9. <hi>Onely take heed to thy self, and keep thy soul diligently.</hi> And, amongst all the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the fitting of our souls for the day of Judgment, the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, and examination of our consciences, making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> our accounts against that day of reckoning, it is a most weighty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. That is the first enforcement of this duty of Heed; the matter is exceeding serious.</item>
               <item>2 There is a second Exigent of this Care, and Heed, which makes this Caveat seasonable, that is, the approach of some great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> danger, and miscarriage. Safety may breed security; but, when we go upon hazards, and dangers, then we look about, and arouze our selves to care, and heedfulness. Now, there is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking so beset with dangers, as the duty of Religion, and the managing of our spiritual condition. The way of Piety is exceeding narrow, and down-falls on both sides. A Christian is <hi>Salutis funambulus.</hi> The way to heaven, it is no broad high way, but a narrow path, we may soon tread awry. Especially, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the last day, the hazards that our souls must run, at that great day of trial and account, are most perilous.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               </item>
               <item>3. Above all, this Caveat is most seasonable, and necessary, if the miscarriages we may fall into be irrecoverable, and such as there is no getting out of them. In those miscarriages that may be recovered, and fetch'd about again, there is some hope; but if the danger we go upon, be deadly, and desperate, once miscarried, and lost for ever. Oh then take heed, the whole stock is at the stake, if thou miscarriest here, thou art undone for ever. Such is the hazard and miscarriage of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Other days, and duties may have a revolution; if we fail at one time, we may mend it afterwards, an after-game may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> recover all again. But the state and condition which Death, and the day of Judgment will put us into, it is fixed, and unalterable. <hi>As the tree falls, so it lies.</hi> As death leaves us, so Judgment shall find us. <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die, and then after death</hi>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:104362:164"/>
                  <hi>comes judgment, Heb.</hi> ix. 27. Once to die, and but once. Had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we a succession of lives, and deaths (as <hi>Origen,</hi> and some others fondly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>ancied) then, had we miscarried in one, we might reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our selves in a second. No, we must die once for all, and then comes Judgment. The sentence that then shall be passed upon us, it is not to be re-called; it is not (as the Civilians speak in their Law) an Interlocutory Sentence; but final, and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, never to be reversed. <hi>Deliberandum est diu, quod statuendum est semel.</hi> In all Contracts and Bargains, every man will take heed of that that must bind him for ever. How much more should we take heed to our selves in this final, and fatal business; in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> preparations to the day of Judgment?</item>
            </list>
            <p>Come we to the next Particular; which is,</p>
            <p>II. The Persons who are concerned in this Caveat, to whom our Saviour directs this Caveat, <hi>Attendite vobis, Take heed to your selves. Christ</hi> brings this Caveat home to them, and lays it close to their hearts and consciences; they must look about them, it concerns them.</p>
            <p>And then the strength, and force of this Application to these persons, will appear by these three expressions, which will more fully set out the nature and necessity of the Caveat.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                        <p>Our Saviour calls them off from musing upon these wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prognostications, (as the Angel speaks, <hi>Acts</hi> i. 11. <hi>Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven?</hi>) The darkness of the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:104362:165"/>
Sun, the falling of the Stars, the roaring of the Sea, the trembling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the Heavens; he bids them call their thoughts homewards, and fore-cast with themselves, how they shall be able to abide that day, and undergo the trial of it.</p>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>It gives plain check and reproof to the curious Enquiries that naturally we are prone to make into Gods secrets. Our brains will be full of questions, and speculations, about many high Mysteries; but our hearts remain void of those sad, and serious thoughts, to make good use of them to our selves. A man may be very curious, and yet withall extreme careless; exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inquisitive in matters of knowledge, and yet notoriously <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> careless in the practick part.</p>
                  <p>The consideration of the day of Judgment, 'tis not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of contemplation; as it were, to see a blazing Star, an Eclipse of the Sun, or some wonder in Nature: but it abodes some great thing to us-wards. Meditate upon it, as upon the day of thine account, and of thy making or marring for ever. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> brings this doctrine of the day of Judgment to practise. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 10. <hi>We must all appear before the Iudgment-seat of Christ. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the terrour of the Lord, we perswade men.</hi> So S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 10. <hi>The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, and the heavens shall pass away with a noiseâ€”Seeing then these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation?</hi> Thus <hi>Noah,</hi> when he was warned of the Deluge, he was moved with fear, <hi>and prepared an Ark for the saving of himself:</hi> he asked no question, disputed not how it could be, that all the world should be drowned; but fell to building of an Ark for his preservation. How many are ready to dispute, How long it will be to the end of the world? and yet live so, as if it were but a meer dream and fable.</p>
                  <p>No; <hi>Christ</hi> shews us the right use of these truths; calls us to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the moral, and practick part: As when one propounded a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous question to <hi>Christ, Luke</hi> xiii. 23. <hi>Lord, Are there few that shall be saved?</hi> A strange Querie, <hi>How many?</hi> Mark <hi>Christ</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to him; <hi>Strive to enter in at the strait gate;</hi> Few, or many, what is that to thee? strive thou to be one of them. As S. <hi>Aug.</hi> piously silenced that intricate Question, How originall Sin is conveyed? Oh, saith he, Let us strive how to remove it. It were strange, when we see an house on fire, to stand questioning, how it kindled? No, let us bestir our selves and haste to quench it.</p>
                  <p>It is strange, in this so serious a business of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which so nearly concerns us, how mens wits will busie themselves in many nice Enquiries (ye may meet with many such Questions in the School-men); as,</p>

Christ</hi> gives this Caveat to his Disciples then alive, and present with him, and now long since dead, before the day of Judgment. <hi>Christ,</hi> by his divine knowledge, understood well enough that these men should die long before the end of the world, and yet he judged not this Caveat unseasonable for those times and men, and bids them <hi>take heed to themselves,</hi> lest that day surprize them.</p>
                  <p>Admit, this day overtook them not <hi>de facto;</hi> yet <hi>de possibili,</hi> and for ought they knew, it might have teached them, and laid hold on them. We are to judge of these events, not by enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> into Gods secret Decree, but according to the order and likelihood of causes. The general spreadth, and ripeness of sin, when the <hi>Regions look white, non tantum albae ad messem, sed aridae ad ignem, Bern.</hi> not like ripe corn, ready to be reaped, but like drie stubble, fit to be burned; when the Harvest looks ready for the Sickle, when all flesh hath corrupted their ways; 'tis time then, Lord, to lay to thine hand. We must meditate upon that day, <hi>Secundum exigentiam justitiae,</hi> not <hi>secundum exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiam decreti.</hi> His Justice may now hasten it, though his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience delays it, and his secret purpose hath set to it a longer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> date.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks diversly of this day; sometimes he sets it forward, and sometimes backward; both to great purpose.</p>

A Christian must keep a constant watch over himself at all times, upon all occasions, and occurrents, lest these sins overtake, and surprize him.</p>
            <p>Observe; It is not sufficient for a Christian, that he give not
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:104362:167"/>
himself over to the full source and swindg of these sins of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and worldliness, or settles himself in a course of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but it concerns him to beware lest occasionally he falls into these, and be overtaken by them. Indeed, to live and lie in them constantly, and purposely to make a practice and trade of them, it cannot stand with any piety. It is the character and badg of a wicked man, wilfully and habitually to give himself over to these sinful practices.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. For security; Their hearts are always surcharged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, brawnie. They study how to be secure, they put the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> evil day far from them, as the Prophet speaks. Either they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselves there will be no day of judgment at all, <hi>The Lord will do neither good, nor evil,</hi> say they in <hi>Zeph.</hi> i. 12. They can frame arguments to disprove this truth of <hi>Christs</hi> coming to Judgment, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 4. <hi>Where is the promise of his Coming?</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane man! What talkest thou of Promises? 'Tis a threatning to thee. Well! but hear what they say. <hi>All things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation,</hi> and so are like to do. Or else, they will set back the expectation of it for many years hence; they look not to see it in their days; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                  <p>Let the ages to come fear that day. This was the prophaneness of the Jews in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s time; when he prophesied of an evil day, Tush, they put it off with a jest, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xii. 22. It was grown a Proverb among them; <hi>The dayes, say they, are prolonged, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very vision failes; they say, The vision he sees is for many dayes to come, he prophesies of the times that are afarr off;</hi> and so they set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle themselves in a course of security. And so,</p>

            <p>But a Christian must not onely abstain from such wilful and habitual courses of sin, but must take heed of being in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree at any time over-taken and surprised with them. <hi>Blessed is</hi>

It is not sufficient for him, that he is able to say; God, I thank thee, I am not as common worldlings, I am no usual glutton, or drunkard, or all for the world, or prophanely secure; I believe the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and when I say over my Creed, I think of it; I fast some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and take off my self from my worldly affairs: that is not all, that is required of a Christian; he must be more exact and circumspect. He musts not onely not willfully rush into these sins, but take heed, lest by any over-sight he slips, and stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and falls into them. It is not sufficient that these sinful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be not like an Hectick Fever, always upon him; but he must shun any one fit, be afraid of the least grudgings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to them.</p>

Art thou not given to these sins of Voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Covetousness; yet if thou look not to thy self, Satan <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> may surprise thee by some temptation. <hi>Consider thy self,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, lest thou be tempted.</hi> Let our hearts seem never so empty of these sins, Satan can fill our hearts with these lusts, as he did to <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira, Why hath Satan filled your hearts with covetousness?

                  <list>
                     <item>1. These sins of voluptuousness, and worldliness, they are <hi>Peccata praecurrentia:</hi> The prevailing of these sins are a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prognostick of that day; these sins will then over-spread <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the world. There are in Scripture two great Judgments, which <hi>Christ,</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> make types and resemblances of the day of Judgment. And <hi>Christ</hi> notes these sins, as the symptoms and fore-runners of this Judgment:</item>
                     <item>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. He instances in the Deluge, and Flood, that drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the old World. See what <hi>Christ</hi> saith of that, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiv. 37. <hi>As the dayes of Noah were, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the dayes that were before the Flood, they were eating, and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, and</hi>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                              <hi>knew not till the Flood came, and took them all away, so shall also the coming of the Son Man be.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. He instances in the Overthrow of <hi>Sodom. Christ</hi> makes that a type of the day of Judgment. What saith he of that? <hi>Luke</hi> xvii. 28. <hi>As it was in the dayes of Lot, they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded, and then it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all; so shall it be in the day of Christ.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>See here the practises that <hi>Christ</hi> instances in: In the old <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> World, eating and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage: So in <hi>Sodom,</hi> they ate and drank, they bought and sold, builded and planted. Why, the Scripture charges both those times and places, with farr greater sins.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. The old World is charged with bloud, and violence, and heavy oppressions. Men lived like Giants, oppressing and devouring others; That is a crying sin: So,</item>
                           <item>2. <hi>Sodom</hi> is charged with other kind of sins of unnatural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations. Yet observe, <hi>Christ</hi> instanceth not in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and violence of the old World, nor in the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but in their <hi>eating, and drinking, and buying, and selling,</hi> and driving after the world; to teach us, That when the world comes to this state and condition, to be voluptuous, and covetous; let their voluptuousness
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:104362:170"/>
be natural, eating, and drinking, and the enjoyment of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> marriage; let their covetousness be without oppression, <hi>they bought and they sold,</hi> traded fairly, paid for what they took; yet a secure giving over our selves to these courses, is a fore-runner of judgment. As some sicknesses, (<hi>Morbi symptomatici</hi>) are more fearful, not in themselves, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are fore-runners of plague and pestilence; so are these sins dreadful. When the World lyes in them, in a careless security; when men say, <hi>Peace and Safety;</hi> every man chears up his neighbour, Be not afraid, all shall be well, <hi>then shall come upon them sudden destruction,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> v. 3.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The Meteor, called <hi>Malacia,</hi> it is a certain sign of a storm and tempest.</item>

                     </item>
                     <item>2. These sins, they are <hi>Peccata accelerantia;</hi> when these sins are overspreading, come to a ripeness, and predÃ³minancy, they do not onely foretel, and prognosticate, but they hasten the day of Judgment, and bring it upon the world. And so they are more considerable. Bare signs are not to be neglected. But these sins are not onely ominous signs, but effectual provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and speeders of judgment. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> that these sins will make the last times <hi>perilous times,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 1, 2. <hi>This</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                        <hi>know also, that in the last dayes, perilous times shall come; for men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetousâ€”lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God:</hi> These, and the like sins, will be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous sins; make perilous times; expose the world to vengeance; provoke judgment. Should we see the Sun darkned, the heavens to tremble, the Stars to fall, the Sea to roar, it would make us to look about us: Why, to see the world drown'd in voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and security, and greediness of gain, loving pleasures, and profits, more then God; to a spiritual man, are indeed more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Those onely foretel; these hasten, and ripen, and pull down <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vengeance and judgment.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Christ</hi> bids us beware of these sins, respectively to the day of Judgment, because these sins, they are <hi>Derisoria Iudicii;</hi> they will beget a profane spirit of deriding, and scoffing at the day of Judgment. Voluptuousness, that is a mocker: <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us so, <hi>Prov.</hi> xx. And Covetousness, that is a mocker too: <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 14. <hi>All these things heard the Pharises, which were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and they derided him.</hi> And Security, that is a mocker too: <hi>They mocked Gods Messengers,</hi> saying securely, These things shall happen to themselves.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

            <p>No doubt, <hi>Noah</hi> had many a flout put upon him for talking of the Deluge, and building his Ark.

And mocking, that is a most dismal provoker of judgment. Trembling at threatnings, even in <hi>Ahab,</hi> did set back Gods judgments; but mocking and deriding Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, that hastens judgments.

                        <p>1. This Story shews us, <hi>Antiquitatem Ecclesiae,</hi> the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable antiquity, and old-age of the Church, and Worship of God. It appears by this story, that Religion is no late upstart invention,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> set up in world by some politick men, to keep people in awe (as Atheists judg of it). We cannot say of it, <hi>Tempus erat, quando non erat;</hi> From the beginning it was not so. No, the Church is as old as the World. Religion is of the same date, and standing with the Creation. God imprinted the sense of Religion into the heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> and this print was not fully defaced by his fall. And God renewed, and restored it soon again, established a Church presently, instituted a Religion, and Worship of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                        <p>Of all other sins, Atheism is of a later-birth. We read of Lust,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and Cruelty, and Bloud-shed, soon after the Creation, but not of Atheism.

This Story shews us, <hi>Discordias Ecclesiae.</hi> It lets us see the fruits and success of quarrels, and discontents, that arise about matters of Religion, and Worship of God. Here are two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of a near and dear relation: Twins they were, (as some conceive them) both of the same birth; and yet see, here a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content arises in point of God's Worship. <hi>Abel</hi>'s worship is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, <hi>Cains</hi> disallowed by God, and that works an alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in <hi>Cain</hi> from his brother <hi>Abel.</hi> Yea, more then so, it works a bitter hatred and opposition, it breaks out to murther. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and dissentions in matters of Religion, and Worship of God, are of all others, most outragious, and deadly.

                        <p>1. It may be taken indefinitely. <hi>In process of time,</hi> that is, after many days, so some understand it; after much time had passed over their heads, many revolutions, then they sacrificed. And so it shews us, <hi>Lentum progressum Religionis;</hi> the leisurely, slow growth &amp; progress of Religion. Gods worship, and Service, comes but slowly forward in the World. The seed of Religion, sow it never so timely (as no question <hi>Adam</hi> did in his Sons) comes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> up very late, above all other seeds that are sowen into men.</p>
                        <p>See, these two are their crafts-masters in their secular Trades and Professions; <hi>Abel</hi> a Shepherd, <hi>Cain</hi> an Husband-man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in those mysteries, but their Profession of Religion comes after many days. The Trade of Religion is long a-learning. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our fall, man is become but an auk creature for any discipline, very unteachable; but above all, most untoward, and dull to receive Religious instruction. Line after line, and precept after precept, much planting, and watering, and yet but slow increase. Ye account it an unkindly year, when ye receive no more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> your seed again; and that untimely, in a backward Harvest. It were well with us, if we could see our seed again. <hi>Thick sown, and thin come up,</hi> argues a bad soil, and it is near unto cursing, as the Apostle speaks. He who sets himself to gain men to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is like him who goes to make a fire of green wood; much
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:104362:173"/>
a-do there is, to make it take fire, and it is soon out again. How <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> may God justly expostulate with us, that He is last served, who should have the precedencie? Where is thy morning-Sacrifice? Nay, where is thine evening-Sacrifice? In matters of Religion, how are ye children in understanding? whereas in matters of the world, ye are men of a ripe age.

So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii. 9. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sacrifice of days was the yearly Sacrifice. And so it betokens a set solemn time, appointed, and appropriated to the Worship of God by publick Sacrifice; and it was at the years end; and that, by the best computation, and most natural, was at the end of Harvest. That was the beginning of the year by the civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as being, most likely, the beginning of the world. The world was created in Autumn, when the fruits of the Earth were ripe, and mature. This was the time, in all probability, when these men sacrificed.</item>

                  <p>Sett, solemn times for the Worship of God, are of ancient,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and usefull appointment; especially this Sacrifice of the seventh Moneth, was in most solemn manner to be performed to God, with thanks for his blessings, having gathered in their fruits. 'Tis here practised by <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi> It was after, commanded by God, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiii. 16. <hi>The feast of Harvest, the first-fruits of thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which thou hast sown in the field, and the feast of In-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is at the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.â€”then thou shalt appear before the Lord with a Sacrifice.</hi> And this Law was so strict, that men might not taste of their fruits, till this Service was performed. <hi>Lev.</hi> xxiii.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 14. <hi>Ye shall neither eat bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the same day that ye have brought an Offering unto your God.</hi> God will be first served, and our recognition-Sacrifice, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and homage we owe him, must be performed, ere we put forth our hand to taste of his blessings.</p>
                  <p>God justly challenges this at our hands, as being our great Land-lord; we are but his Tenants, <hi>Levit.</hi> xxv. 23.

                     <item>1. It was <hi>Personalis cultus;</hi> each of them in his own Person performs this Service, and Worship to God; <hi>Cain</hi> hath his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and <hi>Abel</hi> hath his. Here is one observable point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and take notice of it; the performance of religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to God, is a duty that binds every man in person. These men, they put it not off to their father <hi>Adam,</hi> they rest not in any other mans devotion, but they take themselves bound personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to appear before God, and worship him. No man can worship God by a proxie. He who will serve God by a proxie, must look to go to heaven by a deputy. No, the duty of Piety binds every soul. As <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>No man can make an atonement to God for his brother.</hi> We can neither buy, nor borrow this oyl of our brethren; we must all have it ready in our own vessels. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> answers <hi>Pharaoh, We will go with our young, and with</hi>

                        <hi>our old, not an hoof must be left behind.</hi> That soul that neglects to keep the Passover, must be cut off from Gods people. So strict was the Law for the Worship of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxiv. 23. every man must appear before God, to perform this Worship. Every soul, from a Moneth, and upward, were to offer to the Lord, in token of their redemption, <hi>Numb.</hi> xviii. 16. If any man can exempt himself from being Gods vassal, and liege-man by Creation, he may deny his homage. If any can plead his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, that he stands not in need of redemption, he may neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his atonement by Sacrifice. If any man can say, he stands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not in need of a daily supply of blessings, he may give over his daily prayers. If any man can alledge he owes nothing to God, that God hath not been aforehand with him, in mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he may omit his service of thankfulness.</item>

                        <pb n="333" facs="tcp:104362:174"/>2. A second thing observable in this joynt-worship of <hi>Cain</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and <hi>Abel,</hi> is <hi>Rectitudo cultus;</hi> 'tis a true, warrantable, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful worship that was performed by them.</item>

It was <hi>Cultus legitimus;</hi> such a worship as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, no superstitious worship invented by themselves, but taught by Revelation, received by Prophetical Instruction, such as we see God allowed by after-approbation. These brethren were not like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s sons, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> they offer no strange <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fire to God, but proceed by rule and direction.</item>

                     <item>This way of worship, <hi>Abel</hi> learn'd it from <hi>Adam. Adam,</hi> he was taught it of God, and taught it his children, saith <hi>Pererius.</hi> Inventions of Gods Worship are but Superstitions. That God is to be worshipped, even Nature teaches us; but how he is to be worshipped, He alone must direct us. As <hi>Moses</hi> said to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, Exod.</hi> x. 26. <hi>We know not with what we must serve the Lord till we come thither,</hi> and he teach us.</item>
                     <item>Indeed, the times when <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> offered, were Primitive Times, the Form of Religion was not yet degenerate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Idolatry, and the setting up of false Gods, and false Worship, were not yet crept into the Church. It is the dignity of true Religion, it hath the Precedency of all, before Idolatry, and Superstition. Idolatry is a <hi>post-natus</hi> to Religion, of an after-birth. The Field was first sown with good Seed, the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man came afterwards and sowed his Tares, <hi>Matth.</hi> xiii. Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, it is a Super-semination. <hi>Id verum, quod prius; id falsum &amp; adulterinum, quod posterius, Tertul.</hi> True Religion hath the Birth-right, pleads Prescription before all false Worships. <hi>Christ</hi> in his Reformation brings the Jews back to that which was first,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                        <hi>Abinitio non fuit sic;</hi> checks all Superstitions with this Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>It was not so from the beginning.</hi> It is our Plea, Where was Invocation of Saints, and Angels, or Worship of Images? Did <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Abel,</hi> so worship? No, it was the malice of Satan that sowed these Tares, foisted in these Corruptions. Purposely God kept Religion untainted in the beginning of the World. Though a deluge of other sins brake early into the World, Cruelty, and Lust, and Violent Oppression; yet Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry was kept out, that the very novelty of it might make it sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                     <item>
                        <p>3. A third thing observable in this Worship of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> is <hi>Unitas Cultus,</hi> their joynt brotherly consent and unity in their worship of God. As they were twins in their birth, so, as twins, they joyn hand in hand to compass Gods Altar. We read
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:104362:175"/>
not of an Altar that <hi>Cain</hi> erected, and another that <hi>Abel</hi> set up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> apart for himself; but as they were of the same family, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fraternity, so they joyn as Members of the same Church, as pertaining to the same Altar.</p>
                        <p>The Jews conceive, it was all one place, where <hi>Adam</hi> sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and now his Sons; and after, <hi>Noah;</hi> Though they go too far when they say, it was where <hi>Abraham</hi> sacrificed <hi>Isaac;</hi> and after, <hi>David</hi> sacrificed; and where after, <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple, and erected the Altar. Surely Concord in the Worship of God, 'tis most necessary and comely. Without these two, Truth, and Unity, God accepts no service. Truth and Peace are the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Religion. Thus S. <hi>Peter,</hi> forbidding discord, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to Christians domestick peace, presses this reason for it, <hi>That your prayers be not hindred,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 7. Discord breeds Distraction in holy duties. Quarrelling and Contention, it is the bane of Devotion. See how uncomely was <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi>'s quarrelling with <hi>Moses, Num.</hi> xii. What Disturbance did it breed in the publick affairs of the people of <hi>Israel?</hi> It hindred their Progress into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and set it back. 'Tis said, the people journied not till <hi>Miriam</hi> was brought in again, and the breach made up again. So, on the contrary, what a gracious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> promise doth <hi>Christ</hi> make to Prayers made in the spirit of Unity? <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 19. <hi>If two of you shall agree on earth,</hi> as touching any thing that they shall ask, <hi>it shall be done for them of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These two Brothers here, they came in Unity. They had one God, one Altar, one kind of Service by Sacrifice, one Time too; and no doubt they came in one Affection; the grudge grew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. See with how many bonds S. <hi>Paul</hi> labours to continue Christians together in an holy Concord, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 5. <hi>There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, one body, one</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                           <hi>spirit, one hope of our calling, therefore keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> Christians must say, <hi>We are all one mans children.</hi> Our cognizance is Love, and Unity, and Concord. The quarrels and contentions, that did arise amongst Christians, 'twas a great hinderance to the Conversion of the Gentiles. When they could not answer the Christians Arguments, then they objected the Contentions of Christians, that they could not agree amongst themselves. <hi>Hoc est Opprobrium Gentium,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine, Non consentitis.</hi> The Gentiles cast that in their teeth, that there was not Concord, and Unity amongst them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> That's the third.</p>

                     <item>
                        <p>4. A fourth thing observable in these two brethrens Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, it was <hi>Cultus cum sumptu.</hi> They did not put off God with empty shews, but they are at charge here in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:104362:175"/>
of God, they can be content to be at cost in honouring of him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> according to their state, and condition. <hi>Cain,</hi> he is an husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he brings of the fruit of the ground to honour God with, a Sacrifice of Corn. <hi>Abel,</hi> he is a Shepherd, he brings his Offering of the Herd and Flock. Nature it self teacheth us this Truth. If there be a God, then sure he must be worshipped, and that worship must be maintained, though with cost, and charges. 'Tis a spice of Atheism, to say as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, <hi>Go ye your selves and worship God, but let your flocks alone;</hi> as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the wealthy men in his time, they would be rich at Home, but poor at Church; they would leave their purses at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> home, that they might not be at charge for any Church-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution; <hi>Leave your flocks behind you.</hi> No, saith <hi>Moses,</hi> we must have them with us, <hi>Of them we must offer a sacrifice to our God.</hi> This <hi>Solomon</hi> commands us, <hi>Honour God with thy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and the first-fruits of thine encrease, Prov.</hi> iii. 9. And he learnt it of his father, <hi>David;</hi> he chose to be at cost in serving of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. 24. <hi>I will not serve the Lord with that which cost me nothing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus doing, we honour our God; ey, and we honour our selves, and our substance too. The Jews knew how to prevail <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with <hi>Christ,</hi> for the good Centurion; <hi>He loves our Nation,</hi> nay he loves our Religion, <hi>and hath built us a Synagogue.</hi> As <hi>Origen</hi> discoursing of the liberal Contribution for the erecting of the Tabernacle, <hi>Quam gloriosum erit?</hi> saith he; How great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is it, that it shall be said, This mans Gold made the Ark? This mans Silver made the Pillars and Sockets for them? This mans Wealth furnisht the Tabernacle? And it is also an honour to our wealth to be thus employed. As <hi>Protarchus</hi> in <hi>Aristotle</hi> said, Those stones were happy stones of which Altars were made. Sure, 'tis an happy employment of what God gives to us, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we give something of it again to God to maintain his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                        <p>Superstition spares for no cost, and shall Religion be close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed? The Jews that lavish'd out their gold Ear-rings, and Jewels, to make the Golden Calf, were afterwards as forward to contribute their gold and silver for the Ark and Tabernacle. Our Christian Worship, it is more spiritual then that of the Jews, but that discharges us not of this duty.

            <p>But then the Inquiry must be, Where is our Christian-Sacrifice? Have not Christians something to offer, and sacrifice to God?</p>
            <p>I answer, These carnal and external Sacrifices of Beasts, belong all to the Law of Ceremonies, and so cease now, and are out of date. <hi>Christ</hi> hath put an end to them. The Salt that did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> season their Sacrifices was Gods Institution, now they want that Salt, and so they corrupt and putrefy. The Mannah that was kept longer then Gods appointment, bred worms, and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; such now are all Jewish Sacrifices. Now they are no sweet savour, but a loathsome stench in the nostrils of God.</p>
            <p>But then, have Christians no Sacrifice?</p>
            <p>Yes verily. The summe and substance of those Sacrifices is compleat in <hi>Christ.</hi> He is the onely Priest, and Sacrifice of the New Testament. He offered up himself once for all; He gave himself as an Offering, <hi>and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>savour, Eph.</hi> v. 2. A Sacrifice of that efficacy, that it need not be offered often; it was once offered, and is for ever effectual. S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> compares the Jewish Sacrifices to weak Plaisters, that must be often renewed. <hi>Christs</hi> bloud was like a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:104362:176"/>
plaister, <hi>Semel impositum, semper sanat;</hi> once applied, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> perfectly cures us.</p>
            <p>But yet, though we have now no proper Sacrifice external, and bodily, yet we have still our Evangelical and spiritual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. For, besides that every good work, and holy action, done for the honour of God, is a Christian Sacrifice; <hi>Feci Deo,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> speaks, makes it a Sacrifice. As S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus bonum<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> quod fit ut sancta societate inhaereamus Deo;</hi> Any good work that may joyn us to God, and commend us to his accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that's a Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Besides that, a Christian offers up to God a fourfold Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

               <item>2. <hi>Sacrificium cordis devoti;</hi> the Sacrifice of a devout heart; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that's the Sacrifice of Prayer; and our great Christian Sacrifice, when the soul, by prayer, ascends up to heaven, as upon the Altar of Incense. Thus <hi>David</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Let my prayer be as Incense, and the lifting up of my hands, as the evening Sacrifice, Psal.</hi> cxli. 2. <hi>Theodoret</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, when <hi>Christ</hi> cast out the sheep, and the doves out of the Temple, and said, <hi>My house shall be called an house of prayer,</hi> he abolish'd all other Sacrifices, and appointed prayer to be the solemn Sacrifice, and Service of the Church.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               </item>
               <item>3. A Christian hath another Sacrifice, that's <hi>Sacrificium cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis grati,</hi> the sacrifice of a thankful heart, the sacrifice of praise, and thanksgiving unto God. Thus we see, <hi>Psal.</hi> l. God rejects their bloudy sacrifices; in stead of them, he tells them, <hi>Whosoever offers praise and thanks to him, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours him. Will I eat the flesh of Bulls, or drink the bloud of goats? Offer unto God thanksgiving.</hi> He takes away the first, that he may establish the second. And, <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 15. <hi>Let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.</hi> And in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> kind, the great sacrifice of the Christian Church is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; the great commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great benefit of our Redemption. The most religious and mysterious benediction and praising of God,

'tis the <hi>Cup of blessing,</hi> and calling upon the name of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Lord.</item>
               <item>4.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Success and Acceptance of it. <hi>Abel</hi> and his Service is respected; but <hi>Cain</hi> and his Offering is rejected. We have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> seen them go hand in hand in this outward Performance, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almost discernable that can make the difference. And herein we have three things observable:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Authour of this different Acceptance, that's God.</item>
               <item>2. The Ground of this different Acceptance.</item>
               <item>3. The Nature of it; that's Respecting, and Not-respecting.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Authour of this different Acceptance, is God. See here the Inversion that God makes. In their approach, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. there <hi>Cain</hi> hath the Precedency; first comes <hi>Cain,</hi> then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Abel</hi> is named in the second place. Ey, there is the order <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of nature, and carnal precedency; but see, how God returns them in His estimate: He gives <hi>Abel</hi> the precedency, names <hi>Cain</hi> in the second place; <hi>The Lord had respect unto Abel, but unto Cain he had not respect.</hi> Ey, here is the order of Gods free Grace. He crosses his hands, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did with <hi>Manasses</hi> and <hi>Ephraim;</hi> he layes his hand of Acceptance on <hi>Abels</hi> head, his hand of Disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance upon <hi>Cain.</hi> Carnal prerogatives avail not in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in matters of Grace. Nature hath no ground of preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; there the New-birth carries it. <hi>They were in Christ before me,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> xvi. That was a good ground of dignity.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Post-natus, Born out of due time:</hi> It was a matter of debasement to the Apostle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> let us consider the ground of this different Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why did God regard the one, reject the other? We may
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:104362:177"/>
conceive, there was a double ground of difference:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In respect of the Persons:</item>
               <item>2. In respect of their Actions.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. The first is taken from their Persons. 'Tis Gods me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, he looks first to the Persons, then after to their Offerings. Men observe another order. With men, the Gift commends the Person to favour: As <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>A gift out of the bosome, makes way for a man,</hi> it prospers where-ever it goes; it makes room for him, and brings him before Great men, <hi>Prov.</hi> xviii. 16. 'Tis not so with God; with him, the Person must commend the Gift, not the Gift the Person. First, God respects <hi>Abel,</hi> and then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his Offering; dislikes <hi>Cain,</hi> and then rejects his Service.</p>
            <p>And in their Persons there was a double difference:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. God puts a difference betwixt them.</item>
               <item>2. He finds a difference.</item>
            </list>
            <list>
               <item>1. God puts a difference betwixt them; that's the main original difference, his free choyce and favour: Here is the higest cause. Why did God respect <hi>Abel?</hi> It was because he had a favour unto him. Why passed he by <hi>Cain?</hi> He left him where he found him, in his corrupt original, and so turn'd away from him. It must answer the Apostles question, <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 22. <hi>How is it, that thou wilt manifest thy self to us, and not unto the world?</hi> Here is the supreme cause that must answer and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all such enquiries, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; Even so, Father, for it was thy good pleasure.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Gods sees, and finds a difference in their Persons. <hi>Abel</hi> was a just, and an holy man; God gave a testimony of him, that he was righteous, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. <hi>Cain,</hi> a meer counterfeit in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <hi>He was of that wicked one,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> iii. Here then is the second ground of difference; 'tis the piety and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Person, that commends the work and service unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Gods Acceptation. This <hi>Solomon</hi> teaches us; <hi>A good man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains favour of the Lord, Prov.</hi> xii. 2. And on the contrary, saith <hi>David, If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me, Psal.</hi> lxvi. And so again, <hi>Prov.</hi> xv. 8. <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright, is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi> See, the wicked, they have their Sacrifices, they can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the outward carkasses of Religion; but 'tis the prayer of the upright, that is accepted, their spiritual devotion: And then, the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord; it is not onely vain, or offensive, or odious, but 'tis abominable unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God; he loaths and abhorrs it: but the prayer of the upright is his delight; not onely accepts it, but takes delight and pleasure in it. But then, there is,</item>
            </list>
            <p>II. A second ground of difference, and that is in their
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:104362:178"/>
Actions, and performance of their Sacrifice.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Some conceive, there was a difference in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Sacrifice. <hi>Abel,</hi> he made choyce of the best, the Firstlings of the Flock, and the fat thereof: <hi>Cain</hi> makes no such choyce, but takes any thing that comes next to hand, thinks any thing good enough to offer to God. O! it is matter of just provocation; God takes it in high displeasure, to have the meanest, and vilest things tendred to him; He expects a fat Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice at our hands, <hi>Numb.</hi> xviii. 12. <hi>The best of the Oyl, and the best of the Wine, and of the Wheat, shalt thou offer unto the Lord.</hi> God complains of this base usage of him, <hi>Malach.</hi> i. 13. <hi>Ye have</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                  <hi>said, It is a weariness, and ye have snuffed at it, and ye have brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; should I accept this at your hand? Cursed be the deceiver,</hi> saith God; He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it fraud, and couzenage. The coarsest grain, the least heap, the lightest sheaff, must be Gods portion. The Jews say, <hi>Cain</hi> was a covetous man, and his Sacrifice smelt of it: They say, he was the first that used false measures, and false weights, and he served his God with them. Nay, sure, <hi>Religio de optimis;</hi> Religion calls for the choysest; and, <hi>Gratitudo de optimis,</hi> Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness will be no niggard, but open-handed to God. Can any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> cost or pains be too good for him?</item>
               <item>2. Besides this difference in the Matter, others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in the Manner of their service and worship. <hi>Abel,</hi> he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to God, religiously, reverently, devoutly; <hi>Cain</hi> in meer formality, without reverence and devotion. <hi>Placebat in munere, qui placuit in corde,</hi> saith <hi>Cyprian. Abels</hi> heart was devoutly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; that set the price upon his Oblation. A devout heart, makes a fat Sacrifice. Oh! God abhorrs our loose, negligent, careless addresses to him. <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                  <hi>him, Psal.</hi> lxxxix. 7. <hi>Let us have Grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence, and godly fear; for even our God is a consuming fire.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. But the main ground of the difference S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 4. <hi>By Faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent Sacrifice then Cain.</hi> That one Ingredient seasons all our Sacrifices. If that be wanting, God never regards them. Indeed, Faith is all in all in this work.</item>

                     <item>2. <hi>Ex fide promissi; Abels</hi> Faith look'd up to the <hi>Messias,</hi> saw him by Faith, that was the life of his Sacrifice; <hi>Cain</hi> rested in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the outward Ceremony.

                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let us consider the nature of this acceptance; that is said here, to be Respect, and Disrespect; <hi>He respected Abel, and his offering, but to Cain and his offering, he had no respect.</hi>

            <p>But then, with <hi>Cain,</hi> all goes contrary; no respect had to him, his Sacrifice is rejected. And 'tis a requitall in kind. He heeded not God, when he sacrificed to him, and God heeds him not. Meer fashion, and formality in Gods Service, makes God to be respectless of our prayers. Why should God hear him pray, who hears not himself? <hi>Excors sacrificium,</hi> among the Heathens, the Sacrifice which wanted a heart, was counted prodigious, and of ill abode.</p>
            <p>And as it is a just requital, so it is an heavie one; The miss of his favour, the turning away of his countenance, the stopping of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his ears against our prayers, 'tis the greatest Judgment; when he shuts out our prayers, <hi>that they cannot enter, Lam.</hi> iii. 8. <hi>When he is angry with the prayers of his people, Psal.</hi> lxxx. 4.

            <p>For Use of all. Is this the great success of our prayers, that God should respect them? It must put us into a three-fold dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in our addresses to him.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

If there be such hazard in our service, it may be accepted as it may be performed, or it may be rejected; it concerns us to look to the manner of performance, so to tender up our service unto him, that it may be accepted. Naturally, we are all Popish in this point; we think, that the <hi>Opus operatum</hi> is sufficient; we rest in the outward deed done; so we dispatch with God in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory way, we think all's well, and that our Sacrifice shall fall on fire of it self, though we put not one spark of devotion under it.

Most men perform their service to God at all adventures; hit or miss, speed, or speed not, they heed it not. Oh! a good Christian should see, and observe how God respects his prayers, waiting upon him, till he gives us an answer of Peace. Our eys should wait upon the Lord, <hi>till he have mercy upon us, Psal.</hi> cxxiii. Well; how shall that be? how shall we discern that our prayers are accepted?

                     <item>1.

                     <item>2. His Meditation ascends higher by a second Inspection, and that is <hi>Inspectio libri Scripturae,</hi> verse 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is</hi>

The other, the Book of the Creature, is but as the Inventory of the Goods; this of the Scripture is the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Conveyance, and Assurance of all to us. In it he sees the riches of Gods wisdom, and his precious promises. As S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> observes of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s journals; he came out of the land of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> into the land of <hi>Promise.</hi> God bids him look up to the stars; (and the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were great beholders of the stars and firmament) but yet <hi>Abraham</hi> asks, <hi>In quo cognoscam?</hi> How shall I know that I shall inherit it? He could not gather that, by beholding the Creatures; the Word of Promise, and the Book <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the Scripture, must give Assurance of that.</item>

            <list>
               <item>1. An holy Perplexity in the soul of <hi>David,</hi> which makes him cry out, <hi>Who can understand his errours?</hi>

                  <hi>from my secret faults.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. An holy Prevention for the time to come, <hi>Keep thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. An holy, both Resolution, and Consolation,; <hi>Then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great Transgression.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <list>
               <item>1. In the first Part, we see the nature of Sin; it casts a man into Perplexity, it breeds gripings, and anguishes in the soul, and conscience.</item>
               <item>2. In the second, we see the nature of Mercy; that pardons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and purges, and pacifies the conscience; that rebukes the storms, and brings in a sudden calm into our souls again.</item>
               <item>3. In the third, we see the nature of Grace; that prevents, keeps us from presumptuous relapses; that preserves us so, that no wickedness shall have dominion over us.</item>
               <item>4. In the fourth Part, we see the nature of Integrity; that gives comfort, and consolation, that strengthens it self in all good purposes and resolutions.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And these Particulars represent unto us the whole life of a Christian; they set in order the motions of the soul in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and progress of his conversion.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What is the first Motion, and quickning of life in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian? <hi>Examen Conscientiae,</hi> a searching out of his sins; not a confident stepping into Heaven, in a present assurance, but a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful penitential perplexity.</item>
               <item>2. The second Motion in the heart of a Christian, is Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Suit for pardon and peace, <hi>Cleanse me, purge me.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. The third Motion is imploring of help, Prayer for grace and assistance against Relapses, establish me with thy spirit, <hi>Keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               </item>
               <item>4. The fourth Motion is <hi>Studium integritatis,</hi> and <hi>Gaudium in studio,</hi> resolutions and endeavours for integrity, and all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible innocency, and the keeping of a good conscience towards God and man.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now put these together, and then we may discover three Combinations;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A Combination of two sorts of Sins, not all of the same size and magnitude; here are <hi>Errores</hi> and <hi>Contumaciae,</hi> sins of Infirmity, and sins of Presumption; sins of a weaker tincture, and sins of a double die; <hi>Lapsus in via,</hi> and <hi>Excursiones extra vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;</hi>

Nay, not onely so, but some sin past and forgot, that thou hast buried in oblivion, a sin of many years past, even that may turn in upon thee, and perplex and affright thee; <hi>The Clouds may return after the rain.</hi> Thus <hi>Iob</hi> complains, <hi>Thou writest bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth, Iob</hi> xiii. 26.

            <p>But yet, what might be the occasion of this perplexity in the Prophet <hi>David? David</hi> was now looking into the law of God, considering the great light and glory of it, and a beam of that light hath darted into his conscience, a spark of that fire hath fallen into that fuel, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
               </gap>ets all on fire; casts him into a sudden amazement, and makes him cry out, <hi>Who can understand</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>his errours?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe from hence, that the word of God hath a secret, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable power upon the soul, to convince it of sin, and to cast it into horrour. Good <hi>Iosiah,</hi> at the first reading of this Word, had his heart melted with fear and astonishment. Thus S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> iii. 20. <hi>By the Law, is the knowledg of sin.</hi> And, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 11. <hi>The Commandment slew him, and was found to be death unto him, vers.</hi> 10. And there be divers reasons of this Truth:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In the Scripture is presented a transcendent rule of holiness; the infinite purity and sanctity which is in God himself.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> He is holy in his Works, but most holy in his Word. <hi>He hath magnified his Word above all his Name, Psal.</hi> cxxxviii. 2. In it shines the purity of his Nature, not capable of blemish, or imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now then, the soul seeing this transcendent holiness in God, is presently convinced of infinite impurity. <hi>Mine eye seeth thee, wherefore I abhor my self, and repont in dust and ashes,</hi> saith <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> xlii. 5, 6. <hi>Probavit aurum, &amp; reprobavit,</hi> saith S. <hi>Bernard;</hi> The Angels, though as fine as gold, are <hi>impure in his sight. Qui discernit inter Stellas, quanto magis inter glebas? If the Starrs are not pure in his sight, how much less</hi> (Job xxv. 5.) <hi>man,</hi> who is but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a clod of earth? And this makes the holiest men to tremble at his presence. <hi>Cujus participatione sumus justi, ejus comparatione sumus injÃºsti,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine:</hi> They, who by derivation from him are made holy; in comparison of him, are most unholy.
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:104362:183"/>
Nay, the holy Angels themselves, in their approaches to him, do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hide their feet and their faces. If <hi>Sancti Angeli in Propitiatorio, quanto magis peccatores prae Tribunali?</hi> If Angels on the Mercy-Seat tremble, what shall sinners do, that stand at the Bar, before the seat of Justice?</item>
               <item>2. As in the Scripture there is a transcendent rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, so is there also an exact rule of holiness prescribed. The Law forbids all sin, enjoyns all holiness. No passage in the life of man, but is ordered in it. As <hi>Theodoret</hi> observes in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, and in the furniture of the Tabernacle, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular was curiously prescribed: <hi>Sitales imagines, quales</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                  <hi>veritates?</hi> saith he. If the Ceremonial Law was so accurate, and precise, how strict is the Law of moral holiness, of which that was but a type? The Measures, and Weights of the Sanctuary, were double as much as the ordinary Measures. Thine actions may carry weight, and be allowable amongst men in common conversation, which yet will be found light in the Sanctuary of God. <hi>Mensurant se in dolosa statera consuetudinis humanae, non in statera Sanctuarii,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> Bring thine Actions to this standard, and thy defects will be discover'd; and then that which seems warrantable, and commendable amongst men, will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> appear sinful, and abominable before God.</item>
               <item>3. The Law of God, it is a spiritual rule, not resting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in an outward conformity, but requires the exactness of soul and spirit. It keeps secret thoughts under awe; and judgeth of outward actions, according to the heart; not of the heart accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to outward actions. <hi>I the Lord search the heart, even to give to every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings, Ier.</hi> xvii. 10. Thus S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> discoursing of the exactness of Gods Law in the true intent of it, saith, The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises forbade the outward commission of uncleanness; the Law <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of God forbids the uncleanness of the thought. They make the Law like <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> he had <hi>Zonam pelliceam circa lumbos,</hi> a leathern girdle about his loyns; whereas <hi>Christ</hi> had <hi>Zonam au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ream circa pectus, Rev.</hi> i. 13. <hi>a golden girdle about his breast;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the first rise, and stirrings, and motions of sin. This makes the Saints mourn for the first conceptions of sin, though they prove abortive. <hi>Libera me Ã  cogitationibus meis,</hi> saith the devout Father; Free me, and purge me from my sinful cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</item>
               <item>4. The Law of God is operative, not a dead letter, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hath an active power to work upon the heart. <hi>Verbum Dei, non est opus, sed operans,</hi> saith S. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> The Spirit of God goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, and makes it quick, and powerful, and sharp, and mighty in operation, <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. As in the frame of a mans body,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:104362:183"/>
under every vein there runs an artery full of spirits; so, under <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> every vein of Truth in the Scripture, there is an artery of Spirit, quickning, searching, discovering, citing, condemning.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This discovers the ground of that aversness that is in most men from this blessed Word. Why can any other discourses find entertainment rather then this? Why? It breeds trouble and perplexity; It discovers my sin; It affrights my conscience; makes me out of love with my self, and appear ugly. These Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles are too true for my false eyes. <hi>Ahab</hi> cannot endure to talk with <hi>Micaiah,</hi> nor meet with <hi>Elijah,</hi> they never speak good unto him. The generalities of Scripture we can like well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but when it comes near, and begins to close with us, we fling away from it. <hi>Amant veritatem lucentem, oderunt redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentem,</hi> saith S. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> And that's the first Consideration, <hi>Quae occasio?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A second Consideration of this perplexity in <hi>David,</hi> is, <hi>Quae conditio?</hi> What is the nature, and purpose of it? And we see it express'd in a vehement, and passionate question; <hi>Quis intelligit? Who understands his errours?</hi> And it may be resolved into these three Expressions:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is <hi>Vox ignorantis;</hi> It is the speech of a man, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his ignorance; he knows not his errours.</item>
               <item>2. It is <hi>Vox admirantis;</hi> It is the speech of him, who sees many errours in himself, and suspects more, and is asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at the Consideration of them.</item>
               <item>3. It is <hi>Vox gementis;</hi> He utters his thoughts with a sighing Acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is <hi>Vox ignorantis;</hi> He knows not his errours; and then it implyes this Observation; That the perfect discovery of the errours of our lives, is a thing most hard, and even impossible.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> The truth of this Observation will appear in these Particulars:</p>

                  <hi>all,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iames, Chap.</hi> iii. 2. He saith not, In many things some of us offend, or in a few things all of us offend, but in many things we offend all. They who are all clean, had need wash their feet, saith our Saviour. To which S. <hi>Bernard</hi> alluding, gives this warning; that though we choose our way, and pick our path, and so avoid mire and dirt, yet, <hi>In bono itinere, pulverem colliges;</hi> in the fairest, and cleanest way, our feet will gather soil, some errours will be committed.</item>

They who have daily practised this work of Repentance, and have kept a privie watch, and search in their hearts, are yet fain to return an <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> and though not conscious to themselves of any sin unrepented of, yet, to make all sure, will beg pardon of God for unknown transgressions. As men, not guilty of any breach of Law, to their own knowledge, will obtain a general pardon of the King, to prevent the worst. That's the first, the strength of this Assertion; Who doth understand? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>II. The matter of this Question; <hi>Who understands his errors?</hi> Take it in three Particulars;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Quis intelligit naturam errorum?</hi> Who understands the nature of all his actions, whether they be erroneous, yea, or no? whether that which he doth, be warrantable and good, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? Indeed, for the main Capital duties, those <hi>Principia pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctica,</hi> and heads of morality, and those likewise that are of the nearest, and most evident proximity unto them, he is hardly a Christian who knows not them; but for many particular Cases, and Questions of conscience incident to the life of man, who can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> resolve them? Some actions, indeed, are notoriously evil, sins of the first magnitude, the light of nature reproves them; Some of weaker evidence, sins of infirmity; some not discerned, nor known, sins of ignorance and incogitancie; See them repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:104362:184"/>
in three Parables, <hi>Luke</hi> xv. <hi>The lost Son, The lost Sheep, The</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                  <hi>lost Groat.</hi> Art thou not as the lost Son? Dost thou not break away from God by wilfull rebellion? Yet thou mayst be as the lost Sheep, and stray away from thy God by a sin of infirmity. If not so, yet Who hath not been as the lost Groat, and his action hath slipt away out of his hand, betwixt his fingers, as it were, by ignorance, and incogitancie?</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Quis intelligit numerum errorum?</hi> Who ever yet kept such a carefull account in his conscience, as to register, and book down the just number of his sins? <hi>David,</hi> who had not sinn'd so frequently as we have done; yet, when he surveys the number of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his sins, he gives up this account; <hi>They are more in number then the hairs of my head; mine heart hath failed me, to see the swarms and numbers of them.</hi> Upon which place, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditates; <hi>Capilli minuti sunt, sed multi,</hi> saith he. <hi>David</hi> had little sins, like as hairs; but yet multiplying, and increasing as the hairs of his head. Thus S. <hi>Bernard</hi> counsels us, In our addresses to God, to consider, whether we can meet with him, with ten thousand sins repented of, who comes against us with twenty thousand sins that we never thought of.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Quis intelligit aggravationes errorum?</hi> Who understands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the many aggravations that may make a seemingly-small sin out of measure sinfull? Nay, an action good of it self, yet may have some malignant circumstances, that may blemish, and corrupt it. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> respecting the substance of his actions, and his good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, confidently saith, <hi>O that I were weighed in a ballance;</hi> but if he takes in the many mis-carrying circumstances, then, if he will be weighed, he must follow S. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s counsel, <hi>Statera sit crux Christi,</hi> the beam and standard must be <hi>Christ</hi>'s Cross, and the worth of his merits must help down the weight, or it will be too light.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

So, though thy sins at first appear but few, and small, yet gather up the fragments, the many circumstances, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of them; Thou didst such a sin in such a place, at such a time, being of such a calling, after former pardon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and vows made, and grace received; these aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ã²ns will make a small sin, exceeding sinfull.

            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>Quod fundamentum?</hi> What is the ground? Whence arises this difficulty of discerning errours? We shall find it chiefly from these three.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Sublimitas Legis;</hi> the divine excellency of the Law of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:104362:185"/>
God; a most comprehensive Law, requiring exact holiness, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> forbidding the least swarvings, and aberrations there-from. To which purpose, besides the substance and body of an action which the Law requires, there are two dimensions in the Law of God, by which we may judge, and take the estimate of our actions.</item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The first is the <hi>Maximum quod sic;</hi> and that scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is set down in the first Commandment; <hi>With all thy mind, with all thy heart, with all thy strength.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The second Dimension is, the <hi>Minimum quod non;</hi> and that scantling is set down in the last Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Non concupisces, Thou shalt not lust.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                  </list>
                  <p>Now judge of thine actions by these two Dimensions;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In thy good actions, hast thou kept the first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion? hast thou done the good that thou shouldst do with all thy might? Then,</item>
                     <item>2. In thy sins, hast thou observed the second proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? hast thou not so much as lusted after some unlawfull actions? hast thou been free from all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inclinations that way?</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>Ye see, betwixt these two dimensions of the Law of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> here is a large space for the intervening of many offences. This made <hi>David</hi> break out into admiration; <hi>I see an end of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but thy Law is exceeding broad.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The second ground of this difficulty in finding out our sins, is <hi>Subtilitas cordis,</hi> the marvellous subtilty, and closeness in every mans spirit. The heart of man is an unsearchable lurking place for sin; there are many windings and turnings, and corners in it. 'Tis full of excuses, and concealments, framed like a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, or maze, or like an harbour for thieves, with many secret passages, and close conveyances in it. It will <hi>excusare excusatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> saith, weave cunning excuses. It will hide a sin like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                  <hi>Rachel,</hi> when <hi>Laban</hi> searched for the Idols; bury it like <hi>Achan,</hi> in the midst of his Tent. <hi>David</hi> finds it so intricate a work to search his own heart, and to find out his sins, that he begs Gods help in it. <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxix. 23. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts, and see if there be any wicked way in me.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3, The third ground of this difficulty, is <hi>Falsitas Satanae,</hi> the falshood of Satan, his depths of deceitfulness, by which he will perswade us, and bear us in hand, that it is otherwise with us then we conceive and fear; Either he tells us, it is no sin, as he did to <hi>Eve,</hi> ye are mistaken; or, else he tells us, it is not so great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a sin; or not so many sins, we may do well enough for all these. If we make him our Auditour, he will falsify our Accounts, like the unjust Steward in the Gospel; <hi>How much owest thou my Master?</hi> Our conscience tells us an hundred Measures, nay, ten thousand Talents; but he will falsify our account, and make us
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:104362:185"/>
us write wrong; and set down fifty. That's the third branch,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                  <hi>Quod Fundamentum?</hi>

            </list>
            <p>IV. <hi>Quae consequentia?</hi> What be the consequences of this truth?</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Is this true, that none <hi>can understand his errours?</hi> nor know what sins he hath commited? Then sure it is much more true, <hi>Quis intelligit quae non commisit?</hi> Who understands what sins he might have committed, had not God restrained, and by his Grace prevented the commission of them? And so it is <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum gratitudinis,</hi> a provocation to thankfulness. There is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the greatest wickedness, but thou mightst have acted it, had God taken his hand from off thee and left thee to thy self. As a man who is gone over a narrow Bridge safely, or escaped some great down-fall, where others have perished, and then looking back, how is he affected with fear, and thankfulness? <hi>Tot sunt mihi remissa, quot non commissa,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine</hi> piously.</item>
               <item>2. Is this true, <hi>Who can understand the errours he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted?</hi> Then this is true also, <hi>Quis intelligit quae commissurus est,</hi> Who knows what sins he shall fall into, if God leave him to himself?

A du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it self exceeding useful and beneficial; <hi>It is able to save our souls;</hi> no less good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> comes by it, as the Apostle tells in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>verse.</hi> Now miscarriages in such weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty performances, are very dangerous and prejudicial. The best things, when they are abused, prove most mischievous. And therefore the Apostle contents not himself to commend this duty to us at large, and in general terms, so it be done any way, it is enough, all is well; but prescribes an holy manner, sets down a strict caveat and proviso, how we should receive the word of God, so that we may reap profit by it, and be blessed in the deed.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>So then, the Text it is a strict severe Caveat for the due recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the word of God. And it is framed in that manner, as is like to be most prevailing, and effectual; and that is, by fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning us of a great inconvenience and mischief that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:104362:189"/>
us, if we fail in the duty. And so in the words we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> two Particulars:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Officium,</hi> the Duty prescribed, and enjoyned us:</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Periculum,</hi> the great Danger we run into, if we fail in the Duty, and miscarry in the performance of it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Duty prescribed; and in it observe three things:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Here is <hi>Suppositio officii praevii;</hi> A previous preparative Duty presupposed; that is, Hearing of the Word; we must become Hearers, set our selves to attend, and listen to what God speaks to us. That's the Duty necessarily imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and supposed.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               </item>
               <item>2. Here is <hi>Prohibitio officii erronei;</hi> A Prohibition of a gross mistake in performance of this Duty; Beware you err not in this duty of Hearing, and place all your Religion in bare Hearing, as if that were all which God requires of us, to give him the Hearing; That's expressed in this word, <hi>Onely; Be not Hearers onely.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Here is <hi>Injunctio officii debiti;</hi> The main, full, compleat Duty we owe, and must perform, to the word of God, if we look for any good by it. What's that? We must be <hi>Doers of the Word;</hi> Practise what we Hear, and yield our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Obedience to it. That's the first Particular, The Duty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> follows the other Particular of the Text, to enforce this Duty; that's the danger and mischief we shall fall into, if we fail in this Duty, and that will prove to be an heavy miscarriage, <hi>We shall deceive our own selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Come we to the Duty prescribed; and in it, to the</p>
            <p>I. First Particular, that's <hi>Suppositio officii;</hi> The Duty presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. The Text premises, and supposes this, That we must be Hearers. And because there are many things that will crave our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> audience, and the ear lyes open to every voyce, <hi>The ear is not satisfied with Hearing,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, Eccles.</hi> i. 8. therefore in point of Faith and Religion, the Apostle limits our Hearing to the onely, and peculiar, and proper Object, and that is, <hi>The word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that here are two things considerable;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The limitation of the Matter, that must take up our Hearing, and that is the word of God: And then here is,</item>
               <item>2. The prescription of the Duty, this word of God must be Heard, and attended to.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               </item>
            </list>
            <list>
               <item>1. Then for the Object. All our religious Hearing must be conversant about this one thing, the word of God. The Text places us, like <hi>Mary,</hi> at <hi>Christs</hi> feet, commends unto us that <hi>Unum necessarium,</hi> that one thing necessary. <hi>I will hear what</hi>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:104362:189"/>
                  <hi>God the Lord will say,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psal.</hi> lxxxv. 8. Thus when God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> brings his Son into the Church, he confines our Hearing unto <hi>Christs</hi> Voyce, <hi>This is my Well-beloved Son, Hear him, Matth.</hi> xvii. 5. Faith hath an ear for no other Voyce, but onely to <hi>Christs</hi> Voyce, speaking in the Scripture. <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 17. <hi>Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by the word of God.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>indoles,</hi> and natural disposition of Faith, to listen to <hi>Christs</hi> Voyce, and to none but his. <hi>My Sheep Hear my Voyce, but the voyce of strangers they will not Hear, Iohn</hi> x. Thus <hi>Origen</hi> expresseth it, <hi>Ut natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis quidam attractus quibusdam inest, ut magneti ad ferrum, bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini ad ignem; sic Fidei ad Divinum Verbum.</hi> As onely the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> draws the iron to it, nothing else; so the word of God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can draw our Faith unto it, and make us fasten upon it.</item>
               <item>There are three things we should aym at in our religious Hearing; and all three are the peculiar effects of the word of God:</item>

All our Religion, it is not in lissening and attending to the word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> read, or preach'd to us. The body of Religion, 'tis like the natural body of a man, it consists of many members, and parts; many several joynts required to the making up of an entire bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; heart and head, and hands and feet; so Religion consists of several Services; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

'Twas the <hi>Pharisee's</hi> Religion, he inquired after some one great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. No, saith <hi>Christ, The second is like unto it.</hi> He who fails in one, is guilty of all.

Hearing, that is but receiving of Seed; fructifying in good works,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that's the end and harvest of Hearing.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Hearing,</hi> it is <hi>levissimum officium;</hi> In compare with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial parts of plety, bare Hearing is but an easie Duty. Indeed to hear as we should do, attentively, reverently, devoutly, is a Task of some Pains, but yet of a great deal easier Discharge, then other Duties are. Hypocrisy and Formality, will be very assiduous in lissening and attending, <hi>Swift to hear;</hi> but slow and dull to more weighty Performances. Repentance and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the Trade of Godliness in Holiness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Oh, that is an hard saying. How unworthy is it, to put off <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> God with such slight Services, to mock him with such easie Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; tithe Mint, and Annise: but the great things of the Law are too heavy for us.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus we see that onely <hi>hearing</hi> of Gods word, falls short of our main duty, makes us no good Christians. And not only bare hearing, but take this hearing with all the advantages of it, that are short of practice; all make it but a defective duty, such as will fail us, and be unprofitable unto us.</p>
            <p>It may be we will grant, that the bare, outward, bodily hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, may be justly reproveable; but yet we think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to make it good, if our hearing be qualified, and attended with some commendable conditions, which we hope will be accepted, and stand us in some stead: As,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. If it be a diligent Hearing, constant, and assiduous; if we frequent the House of God, miss not any opportunity of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, that we hope will go for good Service, and stand us in some stead: if we be such as S. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks of, <hi>Verse</hi> 19. <hi>Celeres ad audiendum, Swift to hear,</hi> in season, and out of season, upon all occasions. Indeed such as are backward to this duty, seldom setting themselves to be instructed, often estranging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> themselves from the Service of God; such as make this duty to give place to every avocation, or worldly business, their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we grant is to little purpose. Nay, not onely such Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness is sinful, but even a diligent frequenting of this Duty, such as will miss no occasion, but <hi>will wait daily at Wisdoms doors,</hi> yet if they rest in that, their Religion is Vain. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells of some that are <hi>always learning,</hi> and so would be taken for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Christians, and yet he passeth an hard censure upon them. And <hi>Christ</hi> telleth us of such who could affirm, they were his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Auditours, heard him daily preach in their Synagogues,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and yet they come short of Heaven; our Saviour tells them plainly, <hi>He knows them not.</hi> Will you see what <hi>Christ</hi> saith to a very forward, and diligent Auditory, that frequented his Preaching, <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 1. <hi>There were gathered together an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>

So then, bare Hearing, though it be diligent, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous, will not go for good Service.</item>
               <item>2. What if it be Hearing with some Proficiency, when we so hear as that we understand, and grow in knowledge, and our mind is edified, such as do as <hi>Christ</hi> bids them do, <hi>Hear, and understand, Matth.</hi> xv. 10. or, as he speaks <hi>Mark</hi> xiii. 14. <hi>Let him</hi>

                  <hi>that readeth, understand;</hi> such an <hi>hearing,</hi> we trust, will serve the turn. Indeed, to be always learning, and <hi>yet never to come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> complains of some Dullards, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 7. such as he reproves, <hi>Heb.</hi> v. 11. that are <hi>Segnes auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, Dull of hearing;</hi> still remaining unskilful in the word of righteousness; have Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, and yet no Proficiency; such as the Psalmist complains of, that after long teaching, still <hi>err in their hearts, that have not known Gods ways, Psal.</hi> xcv. that are wise to do evil, but to do well have no knowledge; Such Hearers we grant are unprofitable, they can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> reap no good by it. Nay, not onely such, but if thou beest an understanding, and in that way, a proficient Auditour, attainest to a great measure of knowledge in the mysteries of Religion; such as S. <hi>Paul</hi> describes, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 18, 19, 20. <hi>One, who knowest Gods will, and art instructed out of the Law, that canst be a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, an instructer of the foolish, a teacher of babes, and hast the form of knowledge, and of truth in the law;</hi> yet, even this great progress in knowledge, if thou stoppest there, will stand thee in no stead. Wert thou able to understand all Mysteries, to resolve all doubts, to clear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all difficulties in the Scripture; dost thou understand all that's preach'd, remember all, talk of it to others, and instruct them in it; 'tis much: but yet thou art but an unprofitable Hearer for all this. Hell is full of such Auditours; beware of it; even this Hearing, with Proficiency in knowledge, if thou go no further, will fail thee at last.</item>
               <item>3. But what if our <hi>hearing,</hi> go another step further, and so it be an affectionate Hearing, that we hear the word with great warmth of affection, sure then we are past danger; such kind of Hearing will go for currant, and be well-excepted; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                     <item>1. If we bring with us to our <hi>hearing</hi> of the Word, the affection of <hi>reverence;</hi> Indeed that's exceeding lovely. A reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Auditour is a comely Creature in Gods Church; he beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the Congregation, and makes it honourable. As for
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:104362:192"/>
drowzy, and heedless, and prophane Auditours; such as with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the same spirit hear Gods word, as they would hear any common Discourses; the Church, and the Market-place is all one to them, they shew no awful demeanour in hearing Gods, Word, we cry shame of them; such are blots, and spots in our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations: But if we come with reverence into Gods House, listen as to the voice of God with reverence and fear, compose our selves to such a deportment, as may suit with that sacred work which we are about; we hope that will pass for a full discharge of our duty, and make us good Christians beyond exception. No, verily; Reverend Hearing, without Religious Practising,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is but mocking of God. The Son that <hi>Christ</hi> speaks of in the Gospel, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxi. 28. when his Father bid him, go work in his Vineyard, heard him, and answered him very reverently, <hi>said to him forthwith, I go Sir;</hi> but that was all. He gave his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a regardful, and reverend answer; but for all that, he went not, and is condemned for it. So the young man in the Gospel, that in all the haste would needs be a Disciple of <hi>Christ,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean'd himself to <hi>Christ</hi> exceeding reverently, <hi>Mark</hi> x. 17. <hi>He came running,</hi> and fell down on his knees to <hi>Christ,</hi> and calls him, <hi>Good Master,</hi> and desires to be instructed of him; but that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was all. For when <hi>Christ</hi> injoyns him what to do, he turns his back upon our Saviour, refused to obey him. So then, a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend hearing will not suffice, if it stops there, and comes short of practising.</item>
                     <item>2. What if we bring with us another commendable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in our <hi>hearing,</hi> the affection of <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>gladness,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in Hearing? That is much indeed; we hope that will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. As for those, who are listless in this Duty, who have no appetite, find no rellish, taste no sweetness in the word of God, we condemn them for unworthy Auditours; such as call the Word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the Lord, <hi>A Burthen,</hi> as they did in the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi>'s time. It was a by-word with them so to taunt the Prophet, <hi>What is the burden of the Lord? Ier.</hi> xxiii. Or like those whom the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> complains of, <hi>Chap.</hi> i. 13. they cried out, <hi>What a weariness is it to serve the Lord!</hi> they snuffed at it. Or, as those in <hi>Amos</hi> his time, <hi>Chap.</hi> viii. 5. who would fain be rid of the days of Gods worship, saying, <hi>When will the new Moon be gone, and the Sabbath,</hi> that we may fall to our work again? Such kind of Auditours have little hope to find mercy, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God. Nay, not onely such, but thou mayst hear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the word of God with joy, and much pleasure, account the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath a delight; and, yet if thou restest there, and failest in point of practice, and obedience, thy Religion is vain. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> met with such kind of Auditours, who took great delight in hearing
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:104362:193"/>
him preach, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33. 32. <hi>Lo,</hi> saith God to <hi>Ezekiel, thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                        <hi>them as a very lovely song, of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument, for they hear thy words, and doe them not.</hi> Oh! they were much taken with <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Sermons, they were as Musick to them, sweet aires, delicate strains, they were ravished with his eloquence, but that was all; the Musick is ended, and so was all their Devotion.</item>
                     <item>Thus our Saviour compares some sort of Auditours to <hi>stony ground.</hi> And what are they? <hi>Such as hear the word, and with joy receive it,</hi> but it never takes root, or fructifies with them, <hi>Matth.</hi> xiii. <hi>The seed rots under the clods,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> speaks,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> i. 17. Such Auditours were the High Priests Officers, who were sent to apprehend <hi>Christ;</hi> they were transported with his heavenly Sermons, <hi>Never man spake, as this man speaks, Ioh.</hi> vii. 46. but yet fell short of Salvation. Nay, <hi>Herod,</hi> as wicked a man as he was, was much delighted in <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>'s preaching. <hi>Mark</hi> vi. 20. 'tis said, <hi>He feared Iohn,</hi> accounted him an holy man, observed him, and heard him gladly; and yet <hi>Herod</hi> was a Reprobate for all that. 'Tis S. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Nunquid omnes qui delectantur, mutantur?</hi> Mistake not, saith he; many are delighted to hear Sermons, that yet are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the better for them; <hi>Delectare, suavitatis est; sed flectere, victoriae.</hi> There is that sweetness in the word of God which may much delight us; but then the word hath got a full conquest over us, when it bowes and bends us to the obedience of it. That's a second; Hearing with delight is not the thing that God accepts, if it falls short of Practice.</item>
                     <item>3. But what if this hearing of the word of God doth so much affect us, that it begets many <hi>good motions</hi> in us; and we find our selves inwardly wrought upon, many good thoughts and purposes are stirred up, and quickned in us; then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we are right-good Auditours, and have heard to purpose. Indeed, those that are never affected, or moved with all that they hear, dead-hearted men, not all the words in Gods book can so much as stirr them; such as <hi>Christ</hi> speaks of, <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 17. <hi>We have piped unto you, and you have not danced, we have mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, and you have not wept;</hi> the Promises cannot allure them, the Threatnings of Gods word cannot affright them; brawny-hearted men, nothing can enter into them; No hope of such men. Ey, but we, you should know, are other-ghess men, are much taken at a Sermon; when we hear God thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> out Judgments, we tremble at them; when he offers his Promises, we are much affected with them; and for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements we purpose to observe them; Is not this sufficient? No, even such kind of Hearers, if they proceed no further, will
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:104362:193"/>
fall short of heaven. A man may be in that condition that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum</hi>

            <p>A man may be Sermon-sick, and have a qualm come over his conscience, and some gripes of remorse, and yet recover again <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his old sinfull temper, and never be converted, <hi>Non concipi tantum sufficit, sed &amp; nasci,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> 'Tis not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, but the birth of the new man that makes us Christians. These conceptions may prove abortive; like the untimely fruit of a woman, never see the Sun. Ye may have sudden flashes, good moods, passionate wishes, nay purposes, and good intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the hearing of Gods Word, and yet ye may miscarry.

            <p>We have done with the second, <hi>Prohibitio officii erronei;</hi> bare Hearing, though accompanied with many good qualities, will not do it.</p>
            <p>We come to the next; that is,</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Injunctio officii debiti; Be doers of the word.</hi> And here comes in the Conjunction of both duties, <hi>Hearing, and Doing.</hi> These put together, make up a good Christian. Still ye shall find the Scripture puts these two together, <hi>Hearing, and Doing, Deut.</hi> 5. 28, 29. <hi>This people have well said, all that they have spoken; O that there were such an heart in them, that they would keep all</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>my Commandments alwayes.</hi> And so again, <hi>Vers.</hi> 1. <hi>Hear, O Israel, the Statutes, and Iudgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.</hi> And this is not onely the voyce of the Law, but of the Gospel too; Not onely <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>Christ,</hi> is for doing. <hi>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them, Iohn</hi> xiii. 17.</p>
            <p>And great reason there is for this Conjunction, to keep these two duties close, and undivided, <hi>Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Doing;</hi> to know, and to perform. Not to hear, nor know, breeds a blind Religion; we would be doing, but we know not what. To know, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to do, breeds a lame Religion; we see our way, but we walk not in it. Both are requisite to true Religion. <hi>That the soul be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge, it is not good, Prov.</hi> xix. 2. And if it hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without practise, 'tis never a whit the better. For, as the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:104362:194"/>
bare knowledge of evil, if we do not practise it, makes us never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the worse: so the knowing of good, if we do not practise it, make us not the better.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The nature of Religion requires it. What is Religion? Wherein consists it? It is not a matter of contemplation, but of action; 'tis an operative practick virtue. It is an art of holy living. It begets not a speculative knowledge swimming in the brain, but works devotion, and obedience in the heart and life. 'Tis not <hi>a doctrine of words, and names,</hi> as <hi>Gallio</hi> prophanely mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termed Christianity; <hi>Non magna loquimur, sed vivimus,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Christians are not talkers, but doers. 'Tis not a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> profession, but matter of practice and action.</item>
               <item>2. The Authour of Religion, is represented in Scripture, not as a Teacher, or Doctor onely, but as a Commander, and Law-giver. <hi>There is one Law-giver,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iames, who is able to save, and to destroy; Chap.</hi> iv. 12. So the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, Chap.</hi> xxxiii. 22. <hi>The Lord is our Iudge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King.</hi> A King, a Law-giver, a Judge; words import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and requiring duty, and obedience, and practice of us.</item>
               <item>3. The Subject of Religion wherein it is placed, is not so much the knowing part of our soul, as the active and practical <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> part, the will and affections, which are the spring of practice. Religion, 'tis never rightly seated, till it be settled in the heart; and from that flow the issues of life. Wisdom calls for the heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxiii. <hi>My Son, give me the heart. I Wisdom, dwell with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Prov.</hi> viii. 12. Prudence, that looks to practice.</item>
               <item>4. That Religion is an holy art of life and practice, the summary description of Religion in Scripture shews us. 'Tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a doctrine according to godliness,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 3. 'Tis called <hi>the mysterie of godliness,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 16. a mystery, teaching us to be godly. 'Tis called <hi>a form of sound words in faith and love,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 13. 'Tis an exercise of keeping <hi>a good conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man, Acts</hi> xxiv. 16. all, matters of practice. Now, practical truths are best learned by practice; their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is best known by use and performance: As a rich and costly garment appears then most comly and beautifull, not when the Workman hath made it, but when it is worn, and put upon our body ('tis S. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> Similitude) <hi>Sic Dei mandata pulchra sunt cum exponuntur, multÃ² autem pulcriora cum implentur;</hi> So, saith he, the Scripture appears glorious, when it is by the Preacher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; but far more glorious, when by the people it is obey'd,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and performed.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Without this doing and practising what we hear, all our hearing &amp; learning is but in vain: As eating of meat, except by the heat of the stomack it be digested, and convey'd into all the parts
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:104362:194"/>
of the body, will never support life; so, it is not receiving the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Word into our ears, but the transmitting of it into our lives that makes it profitable. Nay, hearing, and knowing makes us much the worse, if it ends not in doing; as meat taken into the stomack, if not well digested, will breed diseases. Thus saith S. <hi>Iames, Chap.</hi> iv. 17. <hi>To him that knows to do good, and doth it not, to him it is sin,</hi> that is, saith S. <hi>Chrysostom, Cibum sumenti, &amp; non digerenti, morbus est;</hi> 'tis as he that eats meat out of a false stomack, and never concocts it, to him it breeds sickness.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the danger, if we fail in this duty; What's that? The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Apostle tell us, <hi>We deceive our own selves;</hi> that's the mischief; we run into a gross foul errour, which will prove exceeding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial and hurtfull to us.

            <p>II. As they are deceived in their Opinion, so they are deceived in their Expectation. These Christians that are all ears, and no hands; hearers, not doers; they promise great matters to themselves, Gods favour, and Heaven it self; and hope to do as well as the most laborious practisers. Vain men!<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> how will they be deceived, and disappointed of their hopes? Their hope will make them ashamed, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks. <hi>The hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites hope,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, shall be like the house of a Spider;</hi> they have been but Cop-web-Christians, no solidity in their Religion, and their expectation shall be as slight and slender, swept away, and come to nothing.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are self-deceived; that's a second mischief, and that is worse. <hi>Malim errare, quam fallere,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian;</hi> 'Tis ill to be deceived; but to be authours of our own errours and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, to deceive our selves, that's a double misery. These hypocritical Christians, <hi>they deceive themselves.</hi> They think to deceive others, but upon the issue they will find they most of all deceive themselves;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. They think to deceive God, to beguile him with their empty shows of devotion: As <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> meant to put him off with half they had promised him, and to bear him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in hand with a lye, that they had paid him all. No, God found it out presently, and it cost them dear. What saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to these Hearers, that would serve God on free-cost, Hear his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, but with-hold their maintenance? <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he reap, Gal.</hi> vi. 7. Empty services, shall have empty rewards. Thou wouldst Hear him, but not Obey him; he will Hear thee too, but he will not Answer thee.</item>
               <item>2. They think to deceive the Minister, put him off with a bare Hearing, and listening to what he says; and they hope <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be esteem'd by him for his best Auditours, and the forwardest Christians: As <hi>Gehazi</hi> thought to carry it cunningly, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude <hi>Elisha,</hi> but it will be found that they will cozen themselves. <hi>Isaiah</hi> met with such Auditours; complain'd <hi>he had labour'd in vain,</hi> spent his strength to no purpose; but <hi>my work is with my God;</hi> he will reward him. Though the sick Patient die, yet the Physician hath his fee, is paid for his pains. The Minister is not deceived.</item>
               <item>3. They think to deceive their neighbours, and by their seeming-forwardness to delude them. Well, that Imposture holds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not always. There is never a counterfeit Creeple, but is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times seen walking without his Crutches. The hypocrites vizor will some time or other fall from his face, and then he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his true colours. But suppose they be not discover'd, yet the matter is not great; the mistakes and errours of Charity are seldome culpable, but most-what commendable. The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, in the long run, will be found, above all, to have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself. And that's the greatest deceit, and most uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. There is some excuse to be over-reached by others, it makes the sin, or errour, more pardonable; but who will pity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> him that cozens himself? That's one reason why the sin of the lapsed Angels was not pardonable, as was the sin of <hi>Adam.</hi> The Devils misguided themselves, our first Parents were deceived by the Serpent.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Context is an affectionate Protestation of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s love to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> He as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them of his love to them, and of his care for them. The Apostle was even now in an holy ardency of spirit, rapt up into Heaven, longing to be dissolved and to be with <hi>Christ,</hi> Verse 23. Yet see his charity and love to <hi>Christs</hi> Church; when he thinks of them, he checks and abates his former desire. For the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of Gods people, and for the promoting of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is content, yea willing, and desirous to keep out of Heaven, to forbear those joyes; and preferrs their spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> welfare, before his own present happiness, and salvation, <hi>Verse</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>See what an high pitch of Piety and Grace, S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto. A little to insist upon the Context. Ye may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve

many remarkable evidences, and degrees of his piety in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this passage of Scripture.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. He hath attained to a strong assurance of his future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and bliss; he knows his dissolution shall be a translation of him into a blessed condition; death shall prove to him a great advantage, <hi>Verse</hi> 21. <hi>To die, is gain to him.</hi> It is an high improvement of piety to attain to this Christian Confidence, and Assurance. No doubt, it cost S. <hi>Paul</hi> much pains and labour to work his heart to this holy confidence, to be perswaded, that death (which a worldly man accounts the utmost loss) should bring to him the greatest gain.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               </item>
               <item>There are, who talk of their assurance of Salvation; but it is to be feared, In many 'tis but imaginary, a groundless presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; in others, it is but intellectual and notional, inferred and gathered haply by way of argument and discourse, and so goes no further then a speculative Conclusion. But this of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 'tis cordial, and affectionate, and experimental, the fruit of many prayers, and holy endeavours. And such an Assurance is rare to be found. 'Tis that hidden Manna, which few taste of; <hi>Osculum Spiritus Sancti,</hi> that Kiss of love and peace, which God bestows on his devout and dearest Favourites. It costs a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> great deal of searching, and religious labouring, e're we can find it. <hi>Nesciunt quantis gemitibus, &amp; lachrymis constet,</hi> saith S. <hi>Aug.</hi> Happy are they, who after long seeking, can at length attain to it. Ye see S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath found it. That's the first.</item>
               <item>2. A second pitch of Piety in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> is not onely that he hath attained to a bare contentment, but a great willingness, yea more then so, an earnest longing to die, and to be dissolved, <hi>Vers.</hi> 23. That's a further, and higher degree and growth of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. It argues much strength of faith, a great prevailing of grace, to sigh and groan in our selves till we be dissolved. This <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> S. <hi>Paul</hi> professes of himself, and such as he was, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 23. <hi>We that have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we groan within our selves, waiting for the adoption; the redemption of our bodies.</hi> And so again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 8. <hi>We are confident, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</hi>
                  <p>It is well with us, we think, if we can with much ado work our selves to any tolerable contentment to die, and to leave the World. We account it a great Mastery over our selves, if, after much strugling, and resisting, we at length submit to that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and yield to death. But <hi>Paul</hi> is not here barely content <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to die, but longs for that blessed hour, judges it <hi>best of all to be dissolved, and to be with Christ,</hi> Verse 23. <hi>O, when shall I appear before the presence of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. <hi>In this we groan earnestly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to be cloathed with our house which is from heaven.

The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, have <hi>mortem in patientia, vitam in desiderio,</hi> they die pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, but would live willingly; the other, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> here, they have <hi>vitam in patientia, &amp; mortem in desiderio;</hi> this life, it is the matter of their patience, but a blessed death is the matter of their desire.

                  <p>In those times to be a faithful Preacher of the Gospel, was to be no less then a Martyr. Well, S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath counted the cost, forecast the worst; Pains, Poverty, Persecutions, he can endure them all for the love of <hi>Christ,</hi> and for the good of his Church. He chooses to suffer all sorts of miseries, and afflictions, so he may be serviceable to <hi>Christ,</hi> useful to his Church, rather then to leave that holy Work undone, and to enter into Heaven. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> makes it a tryal of our love to God, if, when God should put the offer to our choice, Live as ye list, satisfie every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> lust, deny your self nothing, I will never punish you for it, <hi>Sed non videbis faciem mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>,</hi> onely you shall not see my face; if we refuse that offer of outward enjoyments, that we may be partakers of that blessed Vision, 'tis a good argument of our love to God. Here is a greater tryal of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> love to <hi>Christ;</hi> Wilt thou presently enjoy me in Heaven, or still serve me on Earth? Wilt thou for my sake keep out of Heaven? Nay, more then so, undergo Pains, suffer Persecutions, for my Churches good? Yes, S. <hi>Paul</hi> accepts of this employment on Earth, and will forbear his preferment in Heaven. O <hi>Paul!</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> great is thy love to <hi>Christ,</hi> and to his Church. Thus S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,</hi> and S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> express this choice of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> As if a poor Woman should stand at the door of some great Palace, wherein are all kinds of Pleasures and Delights; and being without,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:104362:199"/>
cold, and hungry, should be offered her self to come in, but to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> leave her Children without in the cold, there to lie in want and misery; though she would fain be within, yet she refuses that offer, chooses to stay still in the cold to tend her Children, then to part with them, and enter in. So <hi>Paul</hi> here, had rather stay out of Heaven, then forsake those Babes in <hi>Christ,</hi> whom he had begot to the Gospel. Not onely, as <hi>Moses,</hi> he chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin; but, rather then to enjoy the happiness of Heaven. Nay, see the fervency of his love to the people of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 3. <hi>He could wish himself Anathema,</hi> separated and accursed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from <hi>Christ</hi> for ever, for his brethrens sake, that he might gain them to God; not onely forbear Heaven for a season, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go it for ever, that others may gain it.</p>

                  <p>1. <hi>Onely;</hi> 'tis <hi>Summum votum meum;</hi> Of all my desires, this is the chief; of all my prayers, and studies, and requests, this is the main, and summ of them all, That you live as Christians.</p>
                  <p>Observe the true spirit of <hi>Paul,</hi> and such as he was; the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good, and growth in grace of them that are committed to them, is their main desire and care, the height of their wishes. S. <hi>Paul</hi> preferred their well-doing, before the care and thoughts for himself. He had even now spoken of his own life and death; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but he breaks off that discourse with this more serious exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As if he should say, Let God dispose of me as he pleaseth; that which goes nearest my heart, and doth take up my thoughts, is, that you may prosper, and grow in grace; and this hath been the temper, or rather the zeal of all Gods faithfull Prophets and servants. <hi>Moses,</hi> how did his spirit burn in him for his peoples good? <hi>Blot me out of thy Book; onely be gracious unto thy people, do not cast them off.</hi> He had rather God should destroy him then them. S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith, That speech of <hi>Moses</hi> was a greater wonder then all the miracles he wrought in <hi>Egypt.</hi> It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was much in <hi>David,</hi> to say, <hi>Spare these Sheep, and let thine hand be upon Me;</hi> they were Innocents, he was the Offender; but in <hi>Moses</hi> his speech, the people were the offenders, he was most innocent, and yet he prays, Destroy me, but spare them. So <hi>Samuel,</hi> though
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:104362:200"/>
unkindly, and ungratefully dealt withall by the people, yet, <hi>God</hi>

                     <hi>forbid,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I should cease praying for you.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was so earnest with God for the Jews, that God is fain to forbid his importunity; <hi>Pray not for this people.</hi> The Apostle S. <hi>Iohn</hi> professeth, it was his greatest comfort, to see his Disciples thrive in grace. <hi>I have no greater joy, then to hear that my children walk in the truth, Epist.</hi> iii. 4. S. <hi>Peter,</hi> how doth he make it his main care, to further the salvation of the people of God? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 12. <hi>I will not be negligent to put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of these things, Vers.</hi> 13. <hi>As long as I am in this Tabernacle, I will stirr you up:</hi> Nay, I will endeavour, that after my absence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> you may <hi>remember these things;</hi> Like another <hi>Elias,</hi> who prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Epistle before his departure out of this world, to be sent to the King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> who should reign afterwards, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxi. 12.</p>
                  <p>It adds to the joys of Gods servants in heaven, that their people are proficient in the ways of piety. And it seems by the Apostle, it abates of their comfort, if their people miscarry. <hi>That they may give an account of you with joy, and not with grief. Heb.</hi> xiii. 17. Why so? If they have done their duties, though the people miscarry, yet they shall be rewarded: the Physician hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his Fee, though the sick man dies. True, true; but yet sorry he is, that he could not recover him. Above all, S. <hi>Paul</hi> is most abundant in these gracious expressions. How earnestly doth he pray for the Churches, to whom he writes? <hi>Ephes.</hi> i. 16. <hi>I cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers.</hi> Again, <hi>Ephes.</hi> iii. 14. <hi>For you I bow my knees, to the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, Phil.</hi> i. 9. <hi>I pray that your love may abound more and more, Coloss.</hi> i. 9. <hi>I cease not to pray for you, and to desire that you may walk worthy of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> iii. 12. <hi>The Lord increase you, and make you to abound in love.</hi> And again, <hi>Now the very God of</hi>

               <hi>First,</hi> That concerning which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this Charge, 'tis <hi>their Conversation;</hi> the ordering of that aright is the duty of the Text. And of it, take a threefold Consideration.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. This Duty here injoyn'd, 'tis <hi>Officium progressivum;</hi> 'tis an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> injunction of an holy progress in the practice of Piety. By S. <hi>Paul</hi> preaching, they had already attained to the first work of Christianity, a saving Conversion, they had embraced the faith, he had laid the foundation of Religion among them;
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:104362:203"/>
now he seconds his first pains with an earnest exhortation to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Christian Progress. These two lessons must always go together;</item>

                  <list>

               </item>
               <item>
                  <p>'Tis to no purpose to lay the foundation of Piety, if we build not upon it; but, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. <hi>We must be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to perfection.</hi> As in nature, 'tis not sufficient, that life is begun, or an infant born, but he must be nourish'd up to growth and strength; so in the course of our spiritual condition, 'tis not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sufficient to be renew'd, and made Christians, but we must add to the first stock of grace, build upon the foundation; let piety have its perfect work. What saith S. <hi>Paul? Gal.</hi> v. 25. <hi>If we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. Abraham</hi> was glad when <hi>Isaac</hi> was born; but he made a feast, when <hi>Isaac</hi> was wean'd, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxi. Not onely glad of his birth, but joyed at his growth, <hi>When he was wean'd from the milk, drawn from the breast,</hi> as <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaks, <hi>Isai.</hi> xxviii. 9.</p>
               </item>
               <item>2. This Duty here injoyned, 'tis <hi>Officium practicum;</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of our Conversation looks to practice. Indeed a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Christian, is the onely Christian. Christianity hath never its full work upon us, till it descends down from our heads into our hearts, and from thence breaks forth into our lives. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, 'tis <hi>Ars practica,</hi> not a matter of bare knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, but of doing, and practising. <hi>If ye know these things, blessed are ye, if ye do them, Ioh.</hi> xiii. It never fared well with the Church, when Religion was restrained onely to the knowing, and understanding part; He who could move most questions, and answer them best, understand the deepest Mysteries, should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be counted the best Christian; No, saith <hi>Tertullian, Non magna loquimur, sed vivimus.</hi> Christianity, is not an art of disputing learnedly, or talking curiously, but of living holily. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses it, <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 8. <hi>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God, may be careful to maintain good works; these things are good and profitable to men;</hi> as if he should say, Without it, all your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is vain, and unprofitable.</item>
               <item>3. This Duty here, 'tis <hi>Officium comprehensivum.</hi> Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'tis a word of large Comprehension, betokens not some one Act, or Performance, but extends it self. to the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Carriage of a Christian. And so the Text inforces this Duty, that a Christian must be exact in all points. Religion must bear sway in all the passages, and turnings of his life. He must be good, every way good.</item>
            </list>
            <list>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:104362:203"/>
               <item>1. Christianity enjoyns him all kind of duties; duties to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God, duties to Man, duties to Himself; makes him a servant to all; lays upon him the whole Law of holiness and righteousness, without the least dispensation or exemption from any.</item>
               <item>2. It furnishes him with all kind of graces; it enlightens his understanding, sanctifies his heart, orders and composes and puts in tune all his affections. At his Conversion, the seeds of all graces are sown into him, and then it expects from him every good work. A good Christian, turn him to what duty you will, he hath skill to perform it: For the worship of God, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for that; he will pray devoutly, he will hear reverently,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> converse with God spiritually. Turn him to man, he will submit obediently, deal and trade justly, converse innocently, help others charitably. In his work he will be diligent; in his recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations he will be sober; in prosperity humble, in affliction pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. He will be a good master, a faithfull servant, a good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an obedient son, a loving husband; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> describes him, <hi>Ready to every good work.</hi> 'Tis not Christianity, to hit upon some one duty, and fail in all the rest; No, <hi>He must walk in all the commandments of God, without reproof.</hi> That's for the matter.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take notice of the Rule of Direction; according to which a Christian must order his conversation; it must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as becomes the Gospel of Christ.</hi> The Rule, 'tis high and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. God intends a Christian should be an exact creature, and so propounds to him an eminent Rule. A Christian must not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his life after every inferiour square. Other Rules there be, which many set to themselves, but they are not suitable to the state of a Christian.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. There is the licentious Libertine's Rule; and that is, <hi>Quod libet, licet;</hi> to live as he list, to do what is good in his own eyes; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so he can satisfie himself, that's all he cares for.</item>
               <item>2. There is the common mans Rule, that's <hi>Mos humanus;</hi> that's his square, to do as his neighbours do; live according to the custom of other men. This sways with the most. <hi>Vae torren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti consuetudinis humanae.</hi> O, this is as a mighty stream, bears down all before it. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>A walking according to the course of this world, Ephes.</hi> ii. 2.</item>
               <item>3. There is the civil mans Rule, that's <hi>Lex humana,;</hi> to be as honest as civility, and morality, and mans law enjoyns us, not to trespass against any Law of man; more then so, is more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> needs.</item>
            </list>
            <p>No, all these Rules are short, and defective; <hi>Mensura hominis est mensura Angeli,</hi> even in this sense also. Christianity sets us an higher pitch. We must live answerable to the Gospel of <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:104362:204"/>
suitable, and agreeable to that holy Profession. Take the summ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of it in these five Expressions;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A Christian must live, and order his conversation, <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum praecepta Evangelii,</hi> according to the doctrine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Gospel. Mans law is too short; nay, <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, 'tis too dark; the Gospel doth clearly lay down the Law of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. The love of God, even to the loss of our lives; the love of our neighbours, even to the loving of our enemies; these are, for their clear propounding, <hi>Praecepta Evangelica,</hi> doctrines of the Gospel. So meekness, and patience, and bearing of the cross, they are in a special manner, Evangelical precepts. The two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thought it enough to live as <hi>Elias</hi> did, and to seek for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon their enemies: No, <hi>Christ</hi> tells them, they are called to another spirit; the Spirit of the Gospel, is a spirit of meekness.</item>
               <item>2. A Christian must live, <hi>Secundum beneficia Evangelii,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the high prerogatives, and benefits of the Gospel. The benefit of Redemption, how should that oblige us? <hi>We are bought with a price.</hi> What use doth <hi>Paul</hi> make of that? <hi>Glorifie God in your bodies and souls which are his. Christ died for us, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but to him</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                  <hi>which died for them;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 15. How doth <hi>Ieremiah</hi> upbraid the Jews? <hi>Ier.</hi> vii. 10. <hi>Will ye say, we are delivered, to commit all these abominations? Do ye thus requite the Lord, ye foolish people, and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? Deut.</hi> xxxii. <hi>Pater non tantum procreans, sed redimens.</hi> No, our Redemption, our holy Calling, and Vocation, calls unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Our Adoption, and being made not onely servants, but Sons of God, they all require answerable conversation; it should beget in us S. <hi>Pauls</hi> resolution, <hi>Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; Whether we die, we die unto the Lord.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. A Christian must live, <hi>Secundum auxilia Evangelii;</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to those helps and supplies of grace, which the Gospel affords us. The Gospel, 'tis the <hi>ministration of the Spirit,</hi> it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to do what it requires of us. And a Christian is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely intended by God to be to the praise of the glory of his grace, <hi>Ephes.</hi> i. And so again, <hi>We are his workmanship, created to good works, Ephes.</hi> ii. We are his workmanship, his choise master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, wherein he would have the power of his grace to be most conspicuous. And, <hi>We are created to good works,</hi> that is, purpos'd and intended to abound in good works; and again, <hi>Created to them,</hi> that is, enabled, and fitted for them; as in the creation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> every created thing was enabled to live after the kind. What saith S. <hi>Paul? I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me.</hi> 'Tis a shame for a Christian, not to exceed the scantling and abilities of other men. How doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> check the <hi>Corinthi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>

                  </hi>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:104362:204"/>
for their backwardness this way? <hi>Are ye not carnal, and walk like</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                  <hi>men?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 3. whereas they should be spiritual, and walk like Christians.</item>
               <item>
                  <p>4. A Christian must live, <hi>Secundum dignitatem Evangelii;</hi> so as may make for the dignity, and credit, and honour of the Gospel. The world judges of Religion by the lives of those, who do profess it; as is their conversation, accordingly do they account of their Religion. Wickedness in a Christian, 'tis blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy against God, 'tis as the sin of sacriledge; he robs God of the honour due to his Name. This is the aggravation of <hi>Davids</hi> sin, in the matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> that he gave occasion to the enemies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the Lord to blaspheme, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xiii. 14. So likewise God charges it upon the Jews, <hi>Mal.</hi> ii. 11. <hi>Iudah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord.</hi> So S. <hi>Iames</hi> lays it to the charge of loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living Christians, <hi>Iames</hi> ii. 7. <hi>Do they not blaspheme that worthy Name by which you are called?</hi> The sins of Christians are much more scandalous then of other men. They dishonour God, bring an evil report upon his holy Profession, shame the whole Church, and expose it to reproach. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> disswading the Corinthians from all uncleanness, reminds them of that near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that they have to God. <hi>What? know you not that your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>are members of Christ?</hi> And again, <hi>What, know not, that your bodies are Temples of the Holy Ghost?</hi> The members of <hi>Christ,</hi> they must not be polluted; the Temples of the Holy Ghost, they must not be profaned; nor must the Church of God be dishonoured by us. The lewd lives of Christians are reproaches to the whole Church, as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes it in the case of the incestuous <hi>Corinthian;</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> charges it upon the whole Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 1. <hi>'Tis reported commonly that there is fornication among you.</hi> See, saith he, he burthens the whole Church with it: As a man coming into a room, wherein is some nastysmell, saith, The whole house stinks; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so the whole Church heard ill, for that one man's sin.</p>
                  <p>The honour and credit of the Gospel, is the grand motive that the Scripture uses, to call us to holiness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> iv. <hi>I beseech you walk worthy of the vocation to which you are called.</hi> Again, <hi>Ephes.</hi> v. <hi>Walk as children of light;</hi> and yet again, <hi>as becomes Saints, Ephes.</hi> v. <hi>Women</hi> must behave themselves, <hi>as becomes holiness, Tit.</hi> ii. 2. <hi>Wives must so live, that the word of God be not blasphemed. Tit.</hi> ii. 5. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants must shew all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things, Tit.</hi> ii. 10. S. <hi>Peter</hi> presses this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive upon all sorts of Christians, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 12. <hi>Have your conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>honest among the Gentiles, that they may by your good works which they shall behold, glorifie God in the day of visitation.</hi>
                  </p>
               </item>
               <item>5. A Christian must live, <hi>Secundum spem Evangelii;</hi> suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the blessed hope, and expectation which the Gospel
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:104362:205"/>
brings us; A Christian, as he is of an honourable birth by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> so he is begot to a lively hope of an heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; and so must live as one who hopes for heaven. Consider seriously of that glory that shall be revealed upon thee, think of thy throne, thy crown, thy white robes, and then argue with thy self in S. <hi>Peters</hi> language; <hi>What manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness.</hi> The Scripture is earnest in this enforcement: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 1. <hi>Having these promises, dearly beloved, let us perfect holiness in the fear of God.</hi> And as S. <hi>Paul</hi> prest it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, so himself practis'd it; <hi>Our conversation is in heaven, from whence we look for a Saviour, Phil.</hi> iii. 20. Christians are to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be <hi>fellow-citizens with the Saints, of the houshold of God,</hi> of the society of Angels; live then we must, according to the law of our Countrey. When <hi>Samuel</hi> design'd <hi>Saul</hi> by his anointing, to be King over Israel, he bids him, give over seeking his fathers Asses; another heart, a Kingly spirit was presently shed upon him. How unworthy is it for the Heirs of Heaven, to mind nothing but earthly things? Such, saith the Father, are <hi>Fidei, &amp; Spei suae prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicatores;</hi> they falsify their faith, confute their hope, renounce their expectation of their heavenly inheritance. Let S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s exhortation be our conclusion; <hi>He that hath this hope in him, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies</hi>

Graces and gifts in a Minister, they are virtually as much, as in multitude of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> They are like Seals, or Prints; one character in them, begets the like in thousands that take impression from them. The Apostles, they first received the promise of the Spirit; they, like <hi>Gideo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s</hi> fleece, were moistned with this heavenly dew, when all about them were wholly dry; by them it was derived to common Christians. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> compares this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of the Spirit to the first rising of the Sun; first it enlightens the Mountains, and from them reflects into the lower Valleys; The Apostles, and Ministers, they are these holy Mountains, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting their Beams upon inferiour Christians. S. <hi>Ierom</hi> likens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them to those twelve Fountains at <hi>Elim;</hi> other disciples must be planted by them, and draw moisture from them, like the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Palm-trees.</p>
            <p>Which makes S. <hi>Paul</hi> direct this passage of his Epistle touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gifts of the Spirit, especially to the Sons of the Prophets, that aimed at the publick Ministry, and Service of the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> As the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> fitting their children to some trade of life, brought them into a room full-furnished with instruments of all Professions, that so they might choose in what trade they might be serviceable to the Common-wealth; so the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Apostle brings them into the Church, <hi>Officinam gratiarum,</hi> the Store-house of all Gods graces, that in the view, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them, they may make their choice. And lest, like children, they should fancy the gayest, omit the most useful, he gives them direction for the most serviceable graces to the Church of God. And this he doth in the representation of a most lively, and elegant Allegory. As S. <hi>Peter</hi> in a vision being called to preach, had a vessel let down full of the bodies of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers beasts for his choice, and use; (their <hi>conpora bruta,</hi> were <hi>animae humanae,</hi> the beasts signified men;) so in these twelve,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and thirteen, and fourteen Chapters, here is a representation of the body, and several members of man, head, hands, eyes, feet; here <hi>membra humana,</hi> are <hi>dona divina,</hi> for our choice and practice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:104362:206"/>And as in the disposition, and frame of our bodies, so in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dispensation of these gifts of grace, three things are observable in the Apostles discourse, severally handled in these three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and together collected, and united in my Text:</p>

               <item>3. Here are <hi>tres gradus;</hi> he orders them into three degrees answerable to their true worth, and opposite to the erroneous esteem of these <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Amongst these three, <hi>Charity, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>

                  <hi>Gifts, Prophecy,</hi> they did set the chiefest price, and most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> doted upon the least profitable, <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Languages;</hi> All would speak Tongues, and work Miracles, but little account was made of <hi>Prophecy.</hi> Like those Sons of <hi>Sceva, Acts</hi> xix. they would work miracles themselves, leave preaching to others, <hi>We adjure you by Iesus, whom Paul preacheth.</hi> And even those who did prophesie, did it in strife, and much contention, puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing up themselves, not building up others. All their gifts were void of Charity, no thought had of that. The Apostle inverts this order; like the Master of the Feast, <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. displaces those that had got the highest room; preferrs the lowest, sets <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Charity in the first place; <hi>Follow after Charity:</hi> next after it, preferrs <hi>Prophecy,</hi>

            <p>Come we to the,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> Object, <hi>Charity;</hi> that is the principal, and the chiefest Grace; and the Observation hence, is briefly this; that, Charity and Compassion to the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> above all other graces,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is a principal gift required in a Minister. Look upon <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Priest, in his holy attire, and then ask <hi>David</hi> the mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of all that Ceremony; <hi>As the precious oyntment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aarons beard, that went down to the skirts of his garment, Psal.</hi> cxxxiii. 2. without which, it was death to serve in the Temple; so comely, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, in the office of a Minister, is charity, and compassion to the Church of God. S. <hi>Paul</hi> preferrs it before faith, and hope, and all other graces. Though not for personal, and private use, yet for service, and benefit to the Church of God, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds them all. 'Tis a fundamental preparative, and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for all other graces, and enablements; and that in these three respects:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Ut habeat;</hi> It fits and enables him for the receipt, and obtaining of them. In this case, it is with the working of the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:104362:207"/>
Spirit, as with his Being. As naturally he proceeds, <hi>per modum amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> so, graciously he inspires and sanctifies, <hi>per modum charitatis. Multa remissa,</hi> many sins forgiven, <hi>because she loved much;</hi> and so, <hi>multa concessa,</hi> many graces infused, if we love much. This was represented in the first effusion of the Holy Ghost. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were in one house, and in one mind, in a charitable union; and then they received those cloven tongues. Of which S. <hi>Aug.</hi> speaks, alluding to those two descents of the Holy Ghost: they had first <hi>Spiritum unitum in columba,</hi> before <hi>divisum in linguis;</hi> He descended in the appearance of a Dove; the Emblem of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; after that, <hi>In linguis divisis,</hi> in tongues and languages:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> They were together in one mind, and in one house combined in charity. As <hi>Origen</hi> observs of <hi>Iob's</hi> children; Mark, saith he, their charitable affection! Satan could sooner kill them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then by any breach of love, make them fall out, and live asunder. This <hi>Chrysostom</hi> notes in S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Conversion, and Call to the Ministery; God observed his zealous affection to the Synagogue, how strongly he loved his Mother-Church; <hi>Christ</hi> would especially gain him to his service: As a Captain, who sees in his enemies Camp, a valiant, and resolute Souldier for the good of his Country, labours by all means to work him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> on his side, and furnishes him with his choisest armour; so God calls S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and enables him with his richest graces. That's the first thing observable; <hi>Ut habeat,</hi> it fits and enables him for all other graces.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Ut Ecclesiae habeat.</hi> When they are infused, Charity stirrs them up, and improves them to the use, and advantage of the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> Other gifts, without charity, rest in the person into whom they are infused; charity disperses, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys them to others. See this express'd in S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Similitude; <hi>The whole body is compacted by that which every joynt supplies</hi>â€” <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                  <hi>and makes an increase of the body unto the edifying of it self in love.</hi> Other graces without charity, as meat received into the body without the natural warmth, lies clogging the stomach; but Charity, like the vital heat, concocts, and conveys them to every member; it makes a supply to every part, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 16. That's the reason, that of all other graces, God requires our charity to be bestowed on his Church; he seems to part with his own right in it, and sets it over to his Church. <hi>If God so loved us;</hi> What then? The inference, we should think, were more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; Then we must love him again: But God parts with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> bestows it on his children; <hi>Then ought we to love one another,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> iv. 11. He requires us to exhibit it to his Church.</item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>In signum amoris;</hi> then 'tis best tryed. Every man
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:104362:208"/>
will love God: it is best discovered in our love to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his Church.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>In fructum amoris;</hi> the fruit of our charity cannot reach to him. As <hi>David,</hi> desiring to shew love to <hi>Ionathan</hi> even after his death, inquires out <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,</hi> or any of his children, that they might enjoy what <hi>Ionathan</hi> could not. <hi>Quod homini proficit, Deo servit,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Then charity is most service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, when it is profitable to his Church.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p>The Church, that is commended especially to our love and charity. As S. <hi>Bernard</hi> observes of <hi>Christs</hi> provision for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> at his death; he commended her to S. <hi>Iohn</hi> his loving disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in terms of love, <hi>Behold thy Mother,</hi> and, <hi>Behold thy Son;</hi> so in the disposition, that's the principal affection to which <hi>Christ</hi> commits it. Art thou a Minister? conceive <hi>Christs</hi> voice from his Cross to thee, <hi>Behold thy Mother, behold thy Son.</hi> This was the Preface to S. <hi>Peter's</hi> charge; <hi>Peter, lovest thou me?</hi> then, <hi>feed my flock.</hi> Of both which Speeches to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn, Aquinas</hi> conceits, that, answerable to their affection, so was their commission. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> loved <hi>Christum mysticum in membris, Christ</hi> in his members; to him therefore the Church was by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> name commended. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> loved <hi>Christum personalem, Christ</hi> in his person; to him therefore he committed the care of his Mother.</p>
                  <p>Love is the affection that's principally required. This we see typified in <hi>Aarons</hi> brest-plate; the names of the <hi>Israelites</hi> they were ingraven, and set upon the holy <hi>Pectoral,</hi> not upon his shoulders onely for care and burden, but upon his breast, the seat of love; they must be dear and tender to him. It is a sin in any man to be void of Charity; but it is an hainous impiety in a Priest. It had been cruelty in any Jew, not to regard his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wounded and bleeding body; but for a Levite, and a Priest to pass by, and neglect the body, nay the soul, of their brother without charity and compassion, what sin more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable?</p>
                  <p>Without this gift, all other graces they are fruitless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, <hi>sine hac, nihil sum,</hi> saith the Apostle; not <hi>minor,</hi> or <hi>parvus,</hi> but <hi>nihil sum.</hi> Had I all Languages, even to the tongues of Angles; had I all Miracles, to remove Mountains; had I all Patience, even to the enduring of Martyrdom, (<hi>Quale crimen,</hi> saith <hi>Cyprian, quod nÃ¨ Mariyrio quidem potest expiari?</hi>) <hi>sine hac</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>nihil sum.</hi> And <hi>cum hac, omnia sum. Charity bears all, believes all, hopes all.</hi> Strange! The act of Charity is onely to love; <hi>Elicit suum actum, imperat omnem.</hi> As a spring in a clock sets all the wheeles going; or the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> in Heaven carries
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:104362:208"/>
all the Spheres with it. Art thou to Prophesy? <hi>Charit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> saith the Apostle, <hi>The love of Christ constrains.</hi> Hast thou Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages? they are unprofitable in themselves divided from Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Charity directs and unites them together, <hi>Ex una lingua, factae sunt multae, hoc superbia fecit; ex multis facta est una, hoc charitas facit. Aug.</hi> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaking of malicious tongues, saith, <hi>They are set on fire of Hell, and they set on fire, the whole course of nature</hi> in strife and confusion; so these gifts of tongues, being set on fire by charity, as by fire from Heaven, they set on fire the whole course of nature, in grace and conversion.</p>
                  <p>Not, as if Charity were absolutely necessary; as if none but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a Convert could convert others. Tongues, and Miracles, as we see in <hi>Iudas,</hi> they may do good; but not so kindly, as when love imployes them. As S. <hi>Augustine</hi> observes of <hi>Christ's</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, they prevailed the more with his Auditours, because they were not onely <hi>signa potentiae,</hi> but <hi>fructus amoris.</hi> They were <hi>miracula salutaria,</hi> helpful, and beneficial. Had they been <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civa,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> his were in Egypt, they would have bred hatred and terrour, driven men farther from him; or, had they been <hi>innocua,</hi> to remove Mountains, to fly in the air, they would have wrought wonder, and astonishment; but they were <hi>salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> healing, and feeding, and raising from the dead; these were beneficial, and provoked love, and affection. As the Prophet, when he laid his staff upon the child, which was <hi>signum potentiae,</hi> it never fetch'd life; but the embracing of his arms, that was <hi>fructus amoris,</hi> that warm'd and enliven'd him. Miracles, and languages, they may do good, but not so kindly.</p>
                  <p>Much more, Prophesying, though divided from Charity, hath its use and profit for the conversion of others. To this purpose, S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> alluding to that of S. <hi>Paul, Some preach Christ of</hi>

Prophecie without Charity, nourishes others, feeds not himself: <hi>Non gustat;</hi> as that Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Governour, provides for the people, but himself starves; or, <hi>TantÃ¹m gustat,</hi> hath some smack or relish of saving truth, but feeds not upon it; Like Nurses, that taste onely of that, their children live upon. Charity eats, and digests, and grows by it. Prophecie without Charity, doth <hi>Sua Deo, Se Diabolo,</hi> as Saint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

Thou art a servant and thou must, and thou hast a Talent and thou mayst be profitable to thy Masters advantage.

The censures are onely spiritual, that the Church inflicts.

Prophecy now ceasing, we must wait for no more Visions, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> rest our selves on the set word of God.

An evident proof of this, we may see in this Apostle; He was our Saviours <hi>beloved Disciple,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> choise Favourite among all the Apostles; one that enjoy'd the greatest portion of our Saviours affection; and therefore, as having received the greatest love, he returns the most again to <hi>Christ;</hi> his heart was enflamed with the love of <hi>Christ:</hi> In all his Epistles, he breathes nothing but love, he stirs up himself, and all others, to the love of <hi>Christ.</hi> Now;</p>

Because Christian Love, 'tis the chiefest trial, the clearest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> evidence, and demonstration of our Faith; the kindliest fruit that springs from Faith, is Love.

            <p>Come we to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> Particular; What is the affection that a good Christian bears to <hi>Christ?</hi> 'Tis Love; yes, that's the Christian virtue, that's the Evangelical grace. 'Tis the main difference 'twixt the Law <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and the Gospel, <hi>Timor, &amp; Amor.</hi> The Law, 'tis the <hi>ministration</hi> of Fear; the Gospel, that's the breeder and begetter of Love.

               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:104362:214"/>
               <hi>spirit of love and liberty.</hi> The Scripture makes it the summ of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all, the substance of Religion. <hi>Neither circumcision, avails any thing,</hi> as the Jews would have it, <hi>nor uncircumcision,</hi> as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Gentiles, <hi>But faith that works by love, Gal.</hi> v. 6.</p>
            <p>Indeed, 'tis the end both of Law, and Gospel. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> sets out the several lincks of this chain of Salvation, and how they depend one upon another. First, <hi>Lex adducit ad fidem;</hi> the Law, that sends us to Faith; then, <hi>Fides fundit orationem,</hi> Faith, that pours out prayer; then, <hi>Oratio impetrat Spiritum,</hi> prayer obtains the Spirit; then, <hi>Spiritus diffundit charitatem,</hi> the Spirit, that inspires us with love; <hi>et Charitas implet Legem,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> love, 'tis the fulfilling of the Law. Here is the whole frame and fabrick of a Christian. Faith, that lays the foundation; but love, that sets up the wall, and lays on the roof, brings all to perfection.</p>
            <p>Not that a Christian ought to be free from all kind of fear. There is a threefold fear to which we are liable, answerable to our threefold state and condition;</p>

               <hi>Fear</hi> then, 'tis not wholly excluded from the state of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; but yet the grace that the Gospel aims at, 'tis the grace of <hi>love. The end of the Commandment</hi> (especially as the Gospel propounds it) <hi>is love,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 5. 'Tis the aim of all Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dealings with us. <hi>He hath chosen us, that we should be holy, and without blame before him in love, Ephes.</hi> i. 4. 'Tis the summ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of his Covenant which he hath made with us, <hi>He keeps covenant and mercy with them that love him, Deut.</hi> vii. 9.</p>
            <p>See the excellency of this Love of God in three particulars:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. This Love of God, gives a chief title and denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Christians; 'tis their badge and cognizance. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> describes an holy man; <hi>Cant.</hi> i. <hi>The upright love thee.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> describes an holy man; <hi>Let them that love thy name, be joyfull in thee, Psal.</hi> v. 11. <hi>David</hi> sues to God for favour and mercy under this denomination; <hi>Psal.</hi> cxix. 122. <hi>Look thou upon me, and be mercifull unto me, as thou usest to do to those that love thy name.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 'Tis this grace that God highly regards in us; <hi>If any man love God, the same is known of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 3. He sets much by such, and owns them, and highly accounts of them.</item>
               <item>2. This <hi>Love,</hi> 'tis the Title and Assurance of all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. All his promises are appropriated to them that love him. <hi>I will shew mercy unto thousands of them that love me.</hi> 'Tis in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment.</item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Heavenly promises, and blessings, are passed to us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this condition. <hi>He shall receive the crown of Life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him, Iames</hi> i.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 12. <hi>Eye hath not seen, neither hath ear heard, what God hath provided for them that love him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 9.</item>
                     <item>2. Temporal blessings are assured us with this Proviso, <hi>Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, Psal.</hi> xci. 14. See how large a Patent God hath made to such Christians; <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. <hi>We know that all things shall work together for the good of such as love God.</hi> Whatsoever befalls them, shall turn to their good; as, on the contrary, all shall work to the worst to them that love him not; they are doomed by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> S. <hi>Paul</hi> with an heavie Curse; <hi>If any man love not the Lord Iesus Christ, let him be Anathema, Maran-atha,</hi> accursed for ever: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 22.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Love,</hi> 'tis the ingratiating quality of all our services;
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:104362:215"/>
'tis that which commends us and our services to Gods accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they are then accepted of God when they spring from love. 'Tis <hi>love</hi> that is the <hi>fulfilling of the Law, Rom.</hi> xiii. 10. Thus <hi>Christ</hi> shews what kind of obedience he expects at our hands, <hi>Ioh.</hi> xiv. <hi>If ye love me, keep my commandements.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>labour of love,</hi> that he expects and requites. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of his labour in preaching; <hi>Necessity is laid upon me, and wo be to me, if I preach not the Gospel; for if I do this willingly,</hi> (out of love) <hi>I have a reward,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 16, 17. Especially God in the Gospel invites us to his service by motives of love, draws us to it with the cords of love. 'Tis not the language of the Gospel,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> If ye will avoid wrath and vengeance, escape damnation, then perform obedience to me: but, <hi>If ye love me.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <list>
               <item>1. All other motives are base and servile, without this willing and loving affection. To serve out of fear onely, lest we smart for it, 'tis the drudgery of a slave; to serve out of love, 'tis the duty of a son. <hi>Si quid boni feceris &amp; invitus, fit de te magis, quÃ m Ã  te;</hi> 'tis done upon thee, rather then by thee; thou rather sufferest the doing, then doest it thy self. No, this is the Mark of a child of God; <hi>his delight is in the Law of God, Psal.</hi> i. He takes a pleasure and felicity in it. <hi>Blessed is the</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                  <hi>man that feareth the Lord; he delighteth greatly in his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Psal.</hi> cxii.</item>
               <item>2. The service of love is onely accepted, because it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is an ingenuous service, and of a right intention. He that serves God onely to escape punishment, or to gain some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to himself, such a service ariseth onely out of self-love; he dares not offend, lest he should be miserable. But he that serves God out of love to him, such an one aims at God, not at himself. Were there no Hell to punish him, no Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, the love of God would work him to all due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Indeed, as <hi>Parisiensis</hi> notes, He that abstains from sin for fear of punishment onely, there is no more retribution due to him, then to thieves and pilferers, that abstain from theft for fear they should be apprehended and punished. And so he that serves God onely for a reward, serves not God but himself. <hi>Illi servit unnsquisque, propter quem servit;</hi> he doth it for his own sake, not for God's sake? But love seeks not its own, but the honour of God to whom it is devoted.</item>
               <item>3. This service out of love is most acceptable to God, because this kind of service is most honourable to God. He <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that serves him for love, doth truly perform an honourable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him. <hi>Non colitur Deus, nisi amando, Aug.</hi> He onely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours him, that doth truly love him. Whereas he that serves him for fear onely, casts a secret aspersion upon God; like the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:104362:216"/>
bad servant in the Gospel, <hi>Luke</hi> xix. that told his Lord, <hi>I know</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                  <hi>thou art an hard man.</hi> No, God is a gracious Soveraign, not a cruel Tyrant, and so desires to be served as good Subjects serve their King, out of love; not as Bond-slaves serve an usurping Tyrant, out of dread and terrour.</item>
               <item>4. The service of love is the onely service that God sets much by; because that service which arises from love, is the onely constant, and lasting service. <hi>Love</hi> is long-breath'd, and will hold out and persevere; whereas fear is a flincher, and will soon tire, and start aside. Thus the dissembling Israelites <hi>started aside like a broken bow.</hi> The Psalmist gives the reason,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their hearts were not true to him; <hi>When he slew them, then they sought to him, and returned; but they did but flatter him with their mouth, for their hearts were not right with him, Psal.</hi> lxxviii. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted obedience is never lasting. <hi>Metus, haud diuturni magister officii.</hi> But love is full of patience, and perseverance, thinks no duty we do to God, tedious, or irksome; counts a perpetual service but short; we may invert <hi>David</hi>'s words, esteems a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand days in Gods service, but as one day: as <hi>Iacob</hi> endured fourteen years hard service for <hi>Rachel;</hi> he bore the melting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> heat of the day, the pinching cold of the night; and yet, they seemed but a few dayes, <hi>Because he loved her, Genes.</hi> xxix. 20.</item>
            </list>
            <p>That's the first thing considerable; The affection of Love. We come,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To that that is the fruit of this loving Affection, the action that flows from it, that's Obedience; <hi>Herein is love, that we keep his commandements;</hi> that's the kindly proof of our love. <hi>Probatio dilectionis, est exhibitio operis,</hi> saith <hi>Gregory;</hi> Doing and obeying, is a strong demonstration of our inward and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> loving him. And this sets out the just requisites and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of our love to God. It puts four qualifications upon our love:</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <p>1. It shews, our love to God must be <hi>Amor operativus;</hi> it must be an active, and operative, and working love. Indeed, love it is seated in the will, the fountain of action; it rests not in our understanding, the knowing faculty. 'Tis not a meer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or speculation, swimming in the brain, but a devout affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction rooted in the heart. Bare knowledge of God makes us not the better. <hi>Knowledge,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, puffs up;</hi> but 'tis love that builds up. Bare notion, 'tis not <hi>soliditas,</hi> but <hi>tumor,</hi> saith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> S. <hi>Aug.</hi> like windy meats, they swell, but they do not fill with any good nourishment. Therefore the Apostle places all in love. <hi>If any man think that he knows any thing, he knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet as he ought to know; but if any man loves God, the</hi>
                     <pb n="417" facs="tcp:104362:216"/>
                     <hi>same is known of him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 2, 3. That's worth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as it is doing, not knowing, onely; so it must be, <hi>Amor operans,</hi> not <hi>loquens tantum;</hi> not a love that will vanish into a verbal Profession. Such there are of whom S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks; <hi>He that saith he loves God;</hi> 'tis love, and lip-labour, both of one value: <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Sampson, How canst thou say, that thou lovest me,</hi> and wilt not do this for me, that I require. No, Gods law, 'tis <hi>Objectum practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> 'tis the matter, not of our knowing, or speaking onely, but of our doing, and practising. Religion, 'tis a practical art, serves not to make us the wiser onely, but the better also. 'Tis an holy art of Living well, and not of knowing, and speaking onely. <hi>I have lifted up my hands to thy Commandements, which I have loved, Psal.</hi> cxix. 48. (<hi>lifted up his hands,</hi> not his eyes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) saith <hi>David;</hi> and again, <hi>Verse</hi> 105. <hi>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet,</hi> not to mine eyes onely to gaze and look on it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Herein is love that we keep his Commandements;</hi> It puts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other qualification on our love; 'tis <hi>amor reverentialis;</hi> not a love of equality, but a love of subjection, and inferiority; such a love as the Inferiour bears to his Superiour, that hath a power to command him; such a love as the Israelites Servant professes to his Master, <hi>I love my Master,</hi> and will not leave his service. When we hear of loving God, we dream of equality, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity. Oh! God is our friend, <hi>Christ</hi> is our brother, we have fellowship with them both; and so we think we may carry our selves fellow-like towards them. No, the Text tells us, He is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> still our Commander, and our love we bear to him, must be a love joyned with reverence; the love of a Son to his Father, the love of a Servant to his Master, the love of a Subject to his Soveraign; lowly and submissive, such as is the love of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to him that is farr above him, and superiour to him.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Herein is love, that we keep his Commandements;</hi> This shews that our love to God must be <hi>Amor regulatus;</hi> a love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and restrained to what God commands us. The onely matter of religious love and service to God, is, what he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and commanded us to do. <hi>Id utique Deo dignum, quod ipse Deus sibi fatetur acceptum;</hi> that is onely accepted, which God hath prescribed. <hi>Ye are my friends,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>if ye do what I command you, Ioh.</hi> xv. 14. In this case, our own inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are but presumptions, and superstitions. Hence it is that
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:104362:217"/>
                  <hi>Love</hi> is call'd, <hi>The Royal Law,</hi> because God hath appointed in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> what things we must shew our love to him. I told you, the love we owe to God, 'tis not a love of equals, but of inferiours, and so must be submissive, and guided by his will, not by our own. Indeed, for the forwardness, and chearfulness of our love, so it must be voluntary; Nothing is so free as Love. <hi>Non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum servire Deo meo debes, sed &amp; adulari, Tertul.</hi> But yet for the expressions and performances of it, he hath strictly bounded it within the compass of his <hi>Commandments. Saul</hi> thought he had shewed great love in reserving the fat Cattel for Sacrifice; But what said <hi>Samuel, Hath the Lord such pleasure in Sacrifices, as</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                  <hi>when the voice of the Lord is obeyed? He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requires at thine hands.</hi> Offer to him not thine Inventions, but his own Prescriptions.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Herein is love, that we keep his Commandements;</hi> This shews, our love to God must be <hi>Amor extensus, &amp; universalis;</hi> our love to God must be intire, and universal, of as large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as all Gods Commandments. As before ye heard of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction, so here we meet with an Extension. <hi>Love</hi> must be <hi>the fulfilling of the Law, Rom.</hi> xiii. We must not be <hi>partial in the Law of God,</hi> as <hi>Malachi</hi> speaks. <hi>Quod propter Deum fit, aequaliter fit.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The love of God looks at every Commandment, and makes conscience of it. Thus <hi>David</hi> professes the intireness of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; <hi>I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right.</hi> The least Commandment carries a divine authority with it.

Now where God layes most weight, there we must expect most care. The love of God, 'tis called, <hi>The great Commandment, Matth.</hi> xxii.

This love will keep us not onely from outragious impieties, but from smaller transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> As true love to our friend will with-hold us not onely from doing him a mischief, but from doing of him the least displeasure.</item>

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:104362:217"/>
sins as may dishonour God by a publick scandal, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> love will not offend the eyes of his Holiness when he sees in secret.</item>

Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>It was a yoke that neither we, nor our fathers could bear, Act.</hi> xv. 10. Not onely men in the state of Corruption, but the very Saints in the state of Regeneration, come short of it. Imperfection of grace, cannot attain to perfection of obedience. The Church of God defended this truth against the Pelagians; That the Law <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of God in the exactness of it, no meer man did ever fulfil it. There are two Dimensions in the Law;</item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The first is <hi>maximum quod sic</hi> in doing of good, how full must that be? it must be <hi>toto corde,</hi> with our whole heart.</item>
                     <item>2. The second is, <hi>minimum quod non,</hi> in declining from sin, how much must that be? 'tis, <hi>Non concupisces;</hi> not so much as to linger, or lust after it. Consider these two Dimensions, and it will make us confess with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I see an end of all perfection, but thy law is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                        <hi>large;</hi> That's the first.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>2. Take the Law in the lowest pitch of righteousness, yet an unregenerate man cannot obey it. He is so far from fulfilling all the Law, that he cannot perform the least part of it. Some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:104362:218"/>
Acts a meer natural man may do; S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>They do</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                  <hi>by Nature the things written in the Law:</hi> but look to the spiritual manner of performance, so no natural man can obey it in the least and lowest degree of it. Every carnal man is reprobate to every good work, <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 10. <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Perfect Love fulfills it perfectly; imperfect Love, doth it imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; but without Love there is no performance. You may as soon gather Grapes from Thistles, as any good work from an unregenerate man. <hi>Laudo fructum boni operis, sed in fide quaero ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicem,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> If the root be not good, which is Faith working by Love, the fruit, though outwardly specious, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vicious. That's the second.</item>
               <item>
                  <p>3. Consider the Law in the Evangelical mitigation and abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, yet still the Saints of God find difficulty in it. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man is two men. That which is spiritual, and renew'd in him, that readily conforms to the Law of God; <hi>The spirit is willing,</hi> saith our Saviour; ey, but <hi>the flesh is weak:</hi> Nay, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wilful, stubborn, and resisting. A Christian, indeed, is freed <hi>Ã  morte Peccati,</hi> from the death of sin, he hath a new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life put into him, that disposes him to all holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but yet he is not freed <hi>Ã  morbo Peccati,</hi> from the disease <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of sin, that still hangs upon him, and that shrinks away, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws it self from this due obedience. A Christian hath both <hi>Primitias Spiritus,</hi> the First-fruits of the Spirit, they make him Spiritual; and withal, he hath <hi>Reliquias carnis,</hi> some dregs of flesh in him; they make him carnal, loth and listless to any holy obedience,</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the Law,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In the highest pitch, is impossible to the Saints;</item>
                     <item>2. In the lowest pitch, 'tis impossible to the unregenerate;</item>
                     <item>3. Even in its moderation, 'tis difficult to the best in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> imperfect state of regeneration.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>But yet 'tis most true what the Text affirms, <hi>Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous.</hi> His Service is no such hard service as the world accounts it; 'tis no such toyl and drudgery as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men conceive it. 'Tis a service indeed, (for why should we be left to a lawless liberty?) but 'tis an ingenuous service; <hi>Take my yoke upon you,</hi> saith <hi>Christ, for my yoke is easie, and my burthen is light.</hi> 'Tis Satans policy to stave us off from God with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; O, he is an hard Master, <hi>duram servies servitutem;</hi> farewel comfort and contentment, if he be your Master.

Thus as <hi>Solomon</hi> made no bond-men of the children of Israel, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ix. 22. but put them into ingenuous services; so doth God with his servants.</item>
                     <item>2. As it is a free, so it is an honourable Service: As <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we know, the greatness of the Master dignifies and ennobles the service that is done unto him. 'Tis the high Title that the Saints have gloried in, that they were Gods servants, and belonged to him. <hi>David</hi> gloried more in this, that he was Gods servant, then that he was Israel's King. So, <hi>Theodosius, Behold, Lord, I am thy servant, I am thy servant, and the son of thy hand-maid, Psal.</hi> cxvi. He chose to be <hi>A door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in Gods house.

               <item>1. The work which God enjoyns them, 'tis possible to them. Gods Commandments are made possible to a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man. <hi>All things are possible to him that believes, Mark</hi> ix. <hi>I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me, Phil.</hi> iv. 13.

               <item>3. This work, 'tis not onely possible and easie, but

pleasant and delightful. A good Christian finds exceeding great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> pleasure and sweetness in it. <hi>A just man</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) delights to do justly;</hi> 'tis a joy to him, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxi. 15. So, a good Christian delights in Piety. Thus <hi>David</hi> professes of himself, <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God; thy Law is within my heart, Psal.</hi> xl. 8. So S. <hi>Paul, I delight in the Law of God in the inward man, Rom.</hi> vii. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that the course of Piety, 'tis a delightful course; <hi>All her wayes are wayes of pleasantness, Prov.</hi> iii. 17. If men serve and obey God, they <hi>shall spend their dayes in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their years in pleasure, Iob</hi> xxxvi. 11.

                  <hi>meat and drink to do the will of God, Ioh.</hi> iv.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Look upon the several parts of Gods Service, those that are most tedious and irksome to a carnal man, Gods servants take great delight and felicity in them:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Prayer, and pouring out our souls unto God, how dull a thing is it to a carnal man? 'Tis as easie to make a stone mount upward, as for a carnal man to raise up his heart in Prayer, and to make it ascend up to the Throne of God. But <hi>Daevid</hi> tells us how delightful it was to him; <hi>O, my soul is filled as with marrow and fatness,</hi> when he called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> God. 'Tis a Saints heaven upon earth, to enjoy this communion with God by devout Prayer.</item>
               <item>2. Reading, and Hearing, and Meditating on Gods Word; put a carnal man upon it, O 'tis tedious and irksome to him; he presently cryes out, <hi>O what a weariness is it?</hi> Ey, but <hi>David</hi> counted Gods Word, <hi>His Song in the house of his pilgrimage;</hi> esteem'd Gods Word above <hi>his appointed food;</hi> it was the very joy of his heart.</item>
               <item>3. The Lords Day, and so the attendance upon the publick Worship, a carnal man counts it but loss of time, he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> no list to it, he can tell how to spend that day to better purpose; like those prophane ones in <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They rejoyced to hear the joyful sound that call'd to the solemn Assemblies, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxxix. What comfort did <hi>David</hi> take in it, when he went to the house of God with the voyce <hi>of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy-day, Psal.</hi> xlii.</item>
               <item>4. Bounty to the poor; What saith a carnal man to it? Just as <hi>Nabal? Shall I take my bread, and my flesh,</hi> and give it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to I know not whom? But the Saints delight in it: <hi>He will devise liberal things,</hi> as <hi>Isaiah</hi> describes him; <hi>He will draw out his soul to the hungry, and satisfie the afflicted soul, Isai.</hi> lviii.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:104362:219"/>Even the most painful works of Christianity, a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> delights in them. I will name but two:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Mortification, and suppressing our natural Lusts, and evil concupiscence. Flesh and bloud repines at that work, but a good Christian delights in it. <hi>The Spirit that is in him, lusts against the flesh, Gal.</hi> v. 17. delights to cross it, to curb it, and keep it under.</item>
               <item>2. The undergoing the Cross, and bearing of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that saith hard to flesh and bloud. Carnal men may seem to be Christians, <hi>Usque ad Crucem,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> speaks; they will pass for good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                  <hi>usque ad Crucem,</hi> til they spie the Cross. They will not suffer for Religion. But the Saints of God take delight in persecutions. Hear what S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 10. <hi>I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christs sake,</hi> And see it in the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> v. <hi>They rejoyced, that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the Name of Christ.</hi> All these hard and difficult services, the Saints count them high, and noble Functions, and delight in them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               </item>
               <item>3. Look upon the Encouragements that Christians find in the service of God; they will make it appear, that the service of God is no such irksome service. The world indeed thinks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of it, but S. <hi>Bernard</hi> gives the reason; <hi>Vident punctiones nostras, sed non vident unctiones.</hi> This makes the world think the service of God to be an hard service, they look upon the labours, but they are not acquainted with the comforts, and encouragements that sweeten these labours, and make them plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to us. Many Encouragements there are.</item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. His gracious Assistance. God helps, and assists his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in all their works. This he doth; by putting their souls into a right frame of holiness. <hi>He answers us with strength in our soul, Psal.</hi> cxxxviii. 3. Till then, the faculties of our souls are like the members of our bodies: when our shoulder is out of joynt, every burthen is grievous; but put it into joynt again, and the same burthen will sit light upon it. So grace sets us in a right frame, and makes the Law of God connatural to us. That breeds delight, when we act according to nature. A carnal man, set him to do a spiritual work, ye put him out of his element; but a spiritual man is spiritually affected.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. A second Encouragement, is Gods mercifull conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence. When his servants that desire to serve him, yet fail, and fall short of what is their duty, God winks at their sailings, and passes by them. See this graciously promised to us, <hi>Mal,</hi> iii. 17.
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:104362:220"/>
                        <hi>I will spare them as a man spareth his own Son that serves him.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> A loving father will not quarrel for every failing, if his Son doth his best; but, wink and connive at him. Indeed, were it not for this, there were no serving of him. Did he not pass by our failings, no flesh would be saved. <hi>If he should mark all that is done amiss, who may abide it? But there is mercy with him that he may be feared, Plsal.</hi> cxxx. Thus the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> admires Gods gracious dealing with his children, <hi>Micah</hi> vii. 18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that passes by the transgressions of his people?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. A third Encouragement is, the many heartnings, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret chearings that God vouchsafes to his servants in the course <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of their obedience. He is no churlish <hi>Nabal,</hi> sowr and harsh to his poor servants, but puts life and heart into them.</item>
                     <item>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. He vouchsafes his Presence to them, as <hi>Boaz</hi> to his Reapers. The Master's eye, the chearfulness of his countenance, is the mans encouragement.</item>
                           <item>2. He speaks chearfully to their hearts. He hath both his <hi>AgÃ¨,</hi> and his <hi>EugÃ¨</hi> for them; Go on; and, <hi>Well done, faithfull servant.</hi> Thus he heartned Saint <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> xviii. 9. <hi>Be not afraid Paul, for I am with thee, and no man shall hurt thee.</hi> Which made him work <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> out his heart in the service of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. A fourth Encouragement is his loving acceptance of our poor services. Our faithfull endeavours, our honest desires, our sincere intentions, are graciously accepted.</item>
                     <item>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. He will accept half-service for whole; imperfect obedience goes for good pay.</item>
                           <item>2. He will accept endeavours for performances. When we come short of the work, yet if we went about it, put our strength to it, 'tis well, saith God.</item>
                           <item>3. In some cases, the Will shall stand for the Deed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. <hi>If there be a willing mind, it is accepted.</hi> He stands not upon a full satisfaction, but makes up our defects with a gracious acceptation.</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. A fifth Encouragement is his bountifull rewarding of us; Besides the grand paiment, the weight of glory, the reward of the inheritance; a strange paiment, for servants to have the inheritance given them, <hi>Coloss.</hi> iii. <hi>Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve the Lord Christ;</hi> that Pay will countervail all our service, were it infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more; besides that, How many encouraging blessings and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> doth he bestow upon his servants, over and above? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their wages, they have their avails out of their Masters bounty. <hi>David</hi> found it, and acknowledgeth it; <hi>Thou hast dealt bountifully with thy servant.</hi>

               <item>1. Our abilities to serve him, come from his assistance.</item>
               <item>2. Our failings, are made up by his connivence.</item>

And, indeed, <hi>Tertullians</hi> Maxim holds good here, and is of Universal truth, <hi>In optimis nonnihil est pessimi;</hi> The best, and most sanctified, and refined Saints, have some remainders and dregs of infirmity and imperfection; overtaken sometimes with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> slips and weaknesses.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So that this motion, and speech of <hi>Elijah,</hi> it is a mix'd speech, made up of two several Ingredients:</p>
            <list>

                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, something natural, and carnal, savour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of weakness; a pang of discontent and weariness.</item>

                  </gap>, something good and spiritual; though it be somewhat tainted with unseasonable circumstances, yet separate the precious from the vile; purge, and winnow it from the chaff of some malignant infirmities that attend it, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we shall find it a speech truly Christian, and Heroical, and of an eminent pitch and strain of Piety.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> look upon it as natural, and carnal, and savouring of weakness. The very carriage of the Prophet, the context of this Scripture, and the unsuccesful event, must make us suspect it as questionable, and doubtful: He hath a little forgot his constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and courage; and <hi>Iezabels</hi> threatnings and persecutions have cast him into some fits and grudgings, of fear and infidelity. And this very passage, I suppose, makes S. <hi>Iames, chap.</hi> v. 17. to take notice of <hi>Elias,</hi> as of a man of weakness and imperfection. <hi>Elias,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> saith he, was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>A man subject to like passions as we are.</hi> Let's not gaze and feed our eyes with this nakedness of the Prophet; go we backward, rather, and cover it; and, in one word, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the benefit of it, and use, to our selves.</p>
            <p>The Prophet is permitted to fail in this particular, and his failing is registred, and the Apostle takes notice of it;</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <p>1. <hi>In honorem Eliae:</hi> 'Tis strange, but true; This blot of infirmity, it serves for the honour and dignity of him. He was so eminent for Grace, in such a splendour of Sanctity, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely the Holy Ghost is fain to let us know he was a man, lest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we should deem him an incarnate Angel, his Piety was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous. The world could easilyer discern Grace and Heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in him, then nature and infirmity: So that the Prophet here; and the Apostle elsewhere, are glad to tell us, he was a frail creature. Thus it was with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> so glorious in their words and works, amongst the Lystrians, that they took them for gods; and therefore the Apostles were enforced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, they were men subject to the same passions with them, <hi>Acts</hi> xiv. 15.</p>
                  <p>It is the glory of Religion, when it shines in its full strength; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it makes their faces shine like Angels. It may shame our weak glimmerings of Piety, so much overlaid with carnality and gross infirmities, that we need not doubt we are men, but question whether we are Christians.</p>

               <item>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:104362:222"/>2. <hi>Elias,</hi> and so the Saints appear in the Scripture clogg'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with infirmities, to moderate their honour, lest it be excessive, and beyond bounds. Look upon them as Saints, but remember them frail creatures. God purposely sets these Foils on his Saints, to allay our esteem of them. The Church of God in several ages hath had divers conflicts concerning the Saints, and their falls and infirmities. The <hi>Manichees</hi> in S. <hi>Augustines</hi> time, urged and exaggerated them, as if the God of the Old Testament had liked and allowed them; and <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Scripture, had, by their report, authorized and approved them. They went too farr, to inferr, from the relation, the consequence of approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Contrary, the Papists now excuse and extenuate them, as if there had been no need that the God of the New Testament should pardon and remit them. They denied them to be Saints; these deny them to be men. We must go a middle way; Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their Sanctity, Pity their Infirmities: Learn to distinguish <hi>Inter puritatem fontis, &amp; impuritatem vasis.</hi> They have their flaws, and slips, and foyls, that <hi>Christ</hi> only may be <hi>King of Saints, and the Holy One of Israel.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Saints appear to us in infirmities, to teach and assure us the possibility of imitation. Naturally, we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to put off these examples of the Saints in Scripture: What talk you of <hi>Elias?</hi> or <hi>Moses?</hi> or <hi>Paul?</hi> These were Saints; we must not think to come near them. Thus we set them aloft, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond imitation, as half-gods; whereas the Scripture presents them as men of our size. Thus the Israelites gave over the hope of winning of <hi>Canaan;</hi> Oh! they are Giants, we are Grass-hoppers. No such matter. <hi>Elias</hi> had his passions and weaknesses; and though he was eminent, yet not transcendent, but within the sphere and compass of imitation. 'Tis a policy of Satan, to stave us off from imitation of the Saints, by a fond superstitious admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But my aym and purpose is to look upon this speech,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> as sever'd from passionate and unseasonable Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; and to set it in just, and due circumstances: and then it is a speech of admirable Piety.</p>
            <p>The words are a Suit, and request, made by the Prophet for his death, and dissolution; he made request for himself that he might dye.</p>
            <p>In it observe two Particulars;</p>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> for his forwardness to dye, and motion he makes for it. Conceive it in three Particulars:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Optat;</hi> Here is an holy Wish.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Orat;</hi> That's more; he makes an holy Supplication.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Resignat;</hi> He yields himself up to God in an holy Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. <hi>Optat;</hi> He expresses his willingness, he wishes to dye. For fuller understanding of this willingness to dye, let us consider,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Nature of it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               </item>
               <item>2. The Grounds, and Occasions of it.</item>
               <item>3. The Evidences, and Strength, and Power of it.</item>
            </list>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Nature of it. To flesh and bloud it is a strange paradox; that death should come within the compass of a Wish; whereas Nature, and Reason, and Religion too, all seem to lead us to the preservation and maintenance of our Life, and Being. 'Tis true, and yet <hi>Elias</hi> his case is here allowable, and of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary use and practice too. The Saints of God may, and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to dye, and wish for it; but yet with these Caveats:</item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Caveat;</hi> In these wishes for Death, they apprehend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Death in a limited Consideration;</item>
                     <item>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. In the apprehension of Nature, as it is a state and condition of Separation and Destruction; so we all shrink at it, and flee from it. 'Tis that impression that God hath planted in us, a care to preserve, and maintain our Being. Death thus apprehended, makes <hi>David</hi> beg respit, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxxix. 13. <hi>O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more. Psal.</hi> vi. 5. <hi>In death there is no remembrance of thee.</hi> This makes S. <hi>Paul</hi> sigh and groan. We would not be uncloath'd of this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our flesh, but enter immediately into immortality. Nay,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> amongst others, even this apprehension made <hi>Christ</hi> wish esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and deliverance. He fear'd, and wish'd, and begg'd esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal.</item>
                           <item>2. In the apprehension of Religion; as Death comes with a malediction, that makes it dreadful. Were Death onely a consequent of Nature, or a contingency of Fortune, or a contrivance of Man, some more manly resolutions may wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly undergo it. But as it is the stroke of Gods anger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, that heads the arrow and dart of Death; and as it is attended with that train of evils and curses that follow Death,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that's matter of horror. To see Death on a pale Horse, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, <hi>Rev.</hi> vi. 8. but to see Hell following after him, that's dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. To look into the Grave, and see the Worm of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis sad; but to look lower, and to see that never-dying
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:104362:223"/>
Worm, gnawing, and consuming, that's unsufferable. Thus it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not desirable: But then,</item>
                           <item>3. In the apprehension of Faith, we find Death al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and changed; nay, sanctified, and sweetned to us; made useful and advantageous; and so it is acceptable and desirable. Death, in its own nature, is Gods Serjeant and Officer; the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of such an one to a debtor, or malefactor, is fearful, and they run from him; but to a friend, or acquaintance, he is as a messenger of love, and we willingly admit of him. This Officer comes to a Christian, not to arrest, or attach him, but lovingly to invite him. 'Tis made an in-lett into heaven, a passage to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                              <hi>Oh, When shall I come, and appear before God!</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Caveat. The Saints desires of Death are alwayes conceiv'd with a limitation of submission to Gods will, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. In this case, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> gives us a good rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Gods will and pleasure. He makes a threefold sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of these desires to God:</item>
                     <item>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Is, <hi>Quod certum est Deum nolle, execremur nos:</hi> When Gods negative is clear and express, he rejects our desires; we must yield and give over: As it was with <hi>Moses,</hi> he begg'd often of God to go into <hi>Canaan;</hi> at last, God gives his perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> denial, <hi>Speak no more to me of this matter;</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> gave over.</item>
                           <item>2. Is, <hi>Quod certum est Deum velle, velimus &amp; nos:</hi> When Gods will is express and absolute, then we must abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely desire it. When God did definitively appoint <hi>Moses</hi> to dye, <hi>Go up to the Mount, and dye; Moses</hi> yields presently: <hi>He dyed according to the word of the Lord, Deut.</hi> xxxiv. 5.</item>
                           <item>3. Is, <hi>Quod incertum est, utrum velit, an nolit; neque velimus ex toto, nequc non velimus, neutri parti nimis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haereamus:</hi> When his will, for Life or Death, is hidden, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> then we must bring down our desires from an absolute Petition, to an humble and submissive Subordination. Thus that good Bishop in S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> tempers his desires and prayers for Death; <hi>Domine, si adhuc populo tuo sum necessarius, non recuso laborem; fiat voluntas tua; desidero requiem, non recuso laborem.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. Caveat. The Saints desires of Death are limited, and stinted with an holy moderation. In this case, what the School-men resolve of <hi>Christs</hi> desire of Life, we may conclude of the Saints desire of Death; it was an act of his <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>; it was a moderate willingness, not a resolute will: As S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 8. a <gap reason="foreign">

'Tis one blessed end, and issue of afflictions, they wean us from the desire of life. Prosperity glues us to this life, Afflictions loosen us. <hi>O mors quÃ m amara!</hi> How bitter is death when we are at ease! <hi>O mors, quÃ m jucunda!</hi> How pleasant is it when we are in torments. These <hi>minores mortes,</hi> fit us for the great Death. S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s fightings with beasts at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> made him willing to grapple with this.

            <list>
               <item>1. Prayer, is a deliberate desire. Sudden wishes vanish, and die in us. Many have some pangs of mortification, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, as <hi>Balaam</hi> had; but would be loth God should take them at their word, like him in the Fable. No; <hi>Elias</hi> and a Saint goes further; it is their deliberate wish. All things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> considered, they judg it best for them, they exercise their hearts towards it, waiting with <hi>Iob,</hi> groaning with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> begging with <hi>Simeon,</hi> their dissolution.</item>
               <item>2. Prayer, it is a religious desire, a matter of devotion, and holy supplication, tendred to God, framed into their prayer. A natural man, or a wicked man may have wishes to die, and deliberations. So had <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and <hi>Iudas;</hi> but they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented not these desires in prayers to God. The Saints die like <hi>Ioab, at the horns of the Altar,</hi> by prayer sacrificing their lives to God; like old <hi>Simeon,</hi> brought by the Spirit into the Temple,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and there praying for death.</item>
               <item>3. Prayer, it is a restrained desire. Prayer extends the will, but restrains the power. He is willing to die, <hi>Oh that I had wings like a Dove!</hi> but is not the disposer of his life to part with it at pleasure. Were our lives our own, we need not beg leave of God to lay them aside. His Petition, 'tis a real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that our time is in Gods hand, not in our own. We may be waiters, and suiters, and in desires hastners, but not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of our own death. As <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, we must like <hi>Elias</hi> be <hi>in ore speluncae,</hi> or <hi>in ostio Tabernaculi;</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ready to receive death, not to hasten it to us. In preparation we must hasten, not in execution. Our hastning must not prevent Gods coming; <hi>Hastening to the coming of our Lord Iesus,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 12. not before his coming. That's the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Orat.</hi>

               <item>2. <hi>Ob fidem depositi.</hi> He commits his life to be kept in the hands of God. The Saints in their death, do not utterly relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish, and for ever depart with life, but they depositate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust God with it. Thus <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Our life is, <hi>in deposito apud Deum, per fidelissimum sequestrem Dei &amp; hominum Iesum Christum. Those things that I have committed to him, he will keep.</hi> Our lives, they are the pledge of our faith we leave in Gods hand. Thus <hi>David</hi> puts his life into Gods hand; <hi>My time is in thy hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute</hi>

               <item>3. <hi>Ob specialitatem modi.</hi> It is strange; being in the fear of death, he begs death; he flies for his life, and yet he flies from it; desires to die, to escape death. True, but this suit of his is, for the special manner of his death, and dissolution.</item>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The two Meditations that work him to this willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> To speak of one of them onely; and that's an holy satiety, <hi>Satis est, It is enough.</hi> Take it in these four Expressions;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Satis vitae meae; It is enough, Lord;</hi> I have lived long enough. The Saints of God can set a full period, they can stint their desires of longer life. They wish not an eternity here. A worldly man, Oh, he could part with another life, might this life last always. No, 'tis Gods blessing to his children; they are satisfied <hi>with length of days, Psal.</hi> xcii. 16.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Satis mundo;</hi> They have enough of the world too. The comforts of this life, the pleasures, profits, preferments; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they can stop, and stay at them too, refusing with <hi>Barzillai,</hi> the offers of preferment. How shamefull is it for old men, to thirst after riches and honours! like the two Tribes, content to stay on this side Jordan, for the goodness of the Countrey?</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Satis officio;</hi> He hath finished, and fulfilled his course, that makes him willing to die, he hath accomplished his Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Happy they whose work is done, before their day be done. The ability of giving a good account of our service, is the powerfullest encouragement to be willing to die. Thus S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> observes, in compare of these two places; <hi>S. Pauls</hi> escapal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> out of <hi>Damascus,</hi> and his readiness to die at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> Then he had done no service, so he was loth to die; now <hi>Paul</hi> the Aged, had finished his course, then he is ready for bonds, and death. So <hi>Christ,</hi> till his work was finished, hid himself; after, he offered himself to them.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Satis miraculosae providentiae;</hi> 'Tis enough for that too. He hath been mightily, and miraculously preserved, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered hitherto, he will not thrust himself upon more miraculous ways; <hi>'Tis enough, Lord,</hi> now end my life. <hi>Non vult oneri esse misericordiae divinae,</hi> he will not be burthensome to the mercy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of God. The Apostles were sparing of miracles for their own selves, wrought none in their own hehalf; they valued not life at the rate of a miracle; accounted themselves less then an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary mercy.</item>

But the applause and welcome that the Saints and Angels give to him in heaven; and those blessed <hi>Euge's,</hi> that the Authour and finisher of his faith, hath received him with, are the true, and full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation that his soul rests in.

            <p>I found him at my coming, the chief credit and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the worthy pains of my reverend Predecessor; at whose feet he a long time sate as a good proficient.
