            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the High and Potent (his Grace the Duke of <hi>Queensburry)</hi> Lord high
Theſaurer of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> by his warrant of date the tenth day of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
inſtant, hath Commiſsionat Me to regulat and appoint the manner of
Collecting the In-land Excyſe of <hi>Aile, Beer, Brandie</hi> and ſtrong <hi>Waters</hi>
to be browen and vented after the laſt of this inſtant within the Shyres of <hi>Kincardine,
Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Bamff,</hi> and to give Advertiſement that no Brewer preſume to leave off
their brewing and venting upon any pretext whatſomever: and alſo that I should
appoint Collectors and Overſeers, and give them reaſonable allowance in each Shyre
or parts thereof as I shall find needfull, for taking notice of the quantities browen
and vented, and in-bringing the Excyſe thereof to the <hi>Caſs-keeper,</hi> not exceeding two
Merks for each Boll of Malt browen and vented conforme to the <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi>
thereanent, and with power to call the preſent Collectors or Tackſmen of Excyſe
and others concerned to give a clear account of the Condition and State of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Excyſe, and that I ſend Parties (if need be) for ordering theſe matters, as
in the ſaid Commiſsion at more length is expreſſed: In Obedience to which,
Theſe are Intimating to all Brewers and Ventners within the ſaid Shyres, that they continue their Trade
of brewing and venting as they will be anſwerable, wherein if they failie they will be punished to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
rigour that Law will allow, and to be looked upon as diſaffected and ſeditious perſons, and imbaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of His MAIESTIES Revenew: And to the effect they may be incouraged in their brewing, Theſe
are ſignifying that diſcreet and underſtanding Collectors will be immediatly appointed in each Presbytrie,
and theſe Collectors will receive ſuch Inſtructions as may be moſt conduceable for the orderly in-bringing
of the Excyſe, and with moſt eaſe to, and equalitie amongſt the Brewers, who may in this expect as much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and fair dealing as any others within the Kingdom, and judicious Perſons will be appointed to hear
and redreſs their juſt Complaints if any be: And therefore, ſeeing that ſuch equal and fair wayes will be
taken for Stenting and Collecting the ſaid Excyſe in theſe Shyres, and that there is no impediment why
the Brewers may not take ſuch competens Pryces for their <hi>Aile, Beer,</hi> and ſtrong <hi>Waters</hi> as may anſwer
the value of the Malt, with the Excyſe and reaſonable Profit, they can pretend no juſt excuſe for not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
to brew and vent theſe Liquors, which if they fail to do, it will be inquyred into, and looked
upon as contempt of Authority in thoſe that give over brewing, or yet shall advyſe any ſo to do: And
further, to the effect his Grace my Lord High Theſaurer may be truely informed of the preſent ſtate of the
current Excyſe, and the manner of Collecting thereof at any time thir three years laſt by paſt; Therefore
theſe are requyring all <hi>Magiſtrats</hi> of <hi>Burghs,</hi> all <hi>Collectors</hi> or <hi>Tacksmen</hi> of <hi>Excyſe</hi> within the ſaid <hi>Shyres,</hi> that
they immediatly bring in to Me ſubſcrived liſts of all <hi>Brewers</hi> within their bounds, whether thoſe that be

whether it be to the <hi>Collectors</hi> or <hi>Tacksmen,</hi> or to their <hi>Maſters</hi> in whoſe Land they dwell, or others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for that end, where the <hi>Excyſe</hi> is laid upon the <hi>Land-Rent;</hi> and that the liſts be ſo exact as that
they may make faith thereon, and that if their Books be not clear thereanent they may yet take pains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by calling for liſts of their reſpective <hi>Parishes</hi> within their bounds, and all <hi>Heritors</hi> and others concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

thereanent, and that the whole <hi>Tacksmen</hi> and <hi>Collectors</hi> give account of their diligence to Me at
