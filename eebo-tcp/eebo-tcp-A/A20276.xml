            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>¶ He chose Dauid his seruaunt also, &amp; tooke hym from the shepefoldes, euen from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Ewes great with yong tooke he hym: to feede his people in Iacob, &amp; his inheritance in Israel. So he fed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the simplicity of his hart, &amp; gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them by discretion of hys handes.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe Prophet declareth in this Psalme howe God of his iustice, for the great syn of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> tooke from that Tribe both the Tahernacle and the Scepter, &amp; gaue them to the tribe of <hi>Iuda:</hi> whom then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his mercy he had purposed to blesse with al pefect happynes. In which we learne not to abuse Gods mercies, least they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from vs, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tribe of <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> they were. And then what helpeth it vs that in times past we haue bene happy? And least this should happen also vnto the tribe of Iuda, to fal from Gods mercies, into hys
<pb facs="tcp:13849:3"/>
displeasure: the prophet in this place stirreth them vp to thankfulnes, that they might be found worthy to haue continued toward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so great blessinges. And this he doth by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in shewing both how merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully God had delt with him, and how obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>Dauid</hi> walked before the Lord.</p>
            <p>And herein he vseth as it were thrée reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s <note place="margin">Three reasons.</note> to moue them withall. The first is of Gods great mercye whence he had called <hi>Dauid.</hi> The seconde is of Gods intent and purpose whereunto he called him. The third of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> own person how faithfully &amp; how truly he did execute that wherunto he was called. The first argument or reason he comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in these wordes: <hi>He chose Dauid hys seruant, &amp; tooke hym from the Shepefolds.</hi> The second in these wordes: <hi>He chose hym to feede hys people in Iacob, &amp; his inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in Israel.</hi> The third in these wordes: <hi>So he fed them according to the simplicitie of hys hart, and guided them with the discretion of his handes.</hi> These argumentes wil I speake of as God shall geue me vtteraunce. And if they shalbe now more effectual to moue vs, then they were then to moue the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: then be we profitable &amp; happy hearers. If not, it is good right and reason, that as we haue bene in the fellowship of the same sinne
<pb facs="tcp:13849:3"/>
and iniquitie, so we shoulde be partakers of the same reward &amp; punishment: that if God shal so deale with vs, that we loose againe both the Tabernacle &amp; the Scepter, as they haue done before vs, we can say no other but the Lord is righteous, and behold we haue eaten the fruit of our own labours. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consider of these argumentes, and styrre vp as we may the gift of God that is in vs, that at length we may learne by them more holy obedience.</p>
            <p>The first argument is the good consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods mercies whence he called <hi>Dauid.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">I</note> Which argument alone is so effectuall and strong to styr vs vp to the obedience of our calling, that it is able ynough to rayse vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, though we were neuer so deepe soonken in rebellion. A sure proofe of the efficacie of it may be vnto vs the oft &amp; continual vse of it in the sacred scriptures. For seyng that Gods spirit in his holy word doth so oft aply it, both as a helpe to confirme the godly, and as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent remedy to turn againe the most obdurat and wylfull synner from hys obstinate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: surely, except al the dewes of gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be marueilously dryed vp in our barren hartes, the same argument if we can well thinke of it, wyl be effectuall in vs to woorke our regeneration in the newnes of lyfe. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <pb facs="tcp:13849:11"/>
it is an other attyre that wyll be accepted for the mariage garment. If we wil feede <hi>Iacob</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. xxij.</note> and <hi>Israel,</hi> let vs leade them to the house of wisedome, and traine them vp in the feare of God. The Lord open the Queenes Maiesties eyes, that she may looke to this charge: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise if we lyued neuer so peaceably vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her, yet when the Lord shal come to aske accompt of her stewardship, how she hath fed <note place="margin">Luke. xj.</note> her fellow seruants with the meate appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, then she will be found eating and drinking with sinners.</p>
            <p>But because we are so dul of hearing, that a little teaching of our dutye is not sufficient for vs, I will shew out of the scriptures some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more plainly, if ought may be playner, what is the duty of a Prince. The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> very effectually setteth it out in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our Sauiour Christ, saying: <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes shall be the girdle of his loynes, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Esay. xi.</note> 
               <hi>faithfulnes the buckle of his raines.</hi> It is true that the Prince must defende the fatherles and widdow, relieue the oppressed, and haue no respect of persons in iudgement, sake peace vnto his people, and gird him selfe with righteousnes: But this is also his duty, and his greatest duty, to be careful for religion, to maintaine the Gospell, to teache the people knowledge, and builde his whole gouernance

with faithfulnes. For this cause king <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> both the mightiest and the wisest kyng that euer was, called him salfe a Preacher.

            <p>And alas (dearely beloued) if this be the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophet, let vs looke vnto it. I dare not but speake the truth, seyng God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me hether. He hath raysed me vp so hye, when I was cast downe, that I cannot forget hys benefites. If this wyll not serue, I wil surely speake it more playnely, when the Lord shall open my mouth againe Surely if this be the saying of the Prophet (as it is in
<pb facs="tcp:13849:12"/>
déede) that lying, that swearing, that blynde and wylfull ignoraunce shall be punished, let not the Princesse deceiue her self, the spirite of God doth not posses her hart, if she heare daylye, lying and blasphemous swearing, and sée the peoples ignoraunce, and yet leaue all vnpunished.

And yet least you should seeke to buselye to be deceued, I wyll rehearse the pláyne law of the Lord.

That hys hart be not lifted vp aboue his brethren. That he turne not aside from these commaundements, neither to the right hand, nor to the leaft. But that he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long hys dayes in his kyngdome, he and hys Sonnes in the middest of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This law I know not how your Maiesty

shall interpreate, because I knowe not your spirite: but of this I am sure, it made <hi>Dauid</hi> that he would not suffer a wicked man in his <note place="margin">Psa. x. vij</note> house, It made <hi>Asa</hi> driue awaye the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites out of Israel, put downe the Idols, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <note place="margin">j.

Nay it made <hi>Salomon</hi> to put down <hi>Abiathar</hi> that <note place="margin">i. Reg xix</note> was the hye Priest, and to place <hi>Sadoe</hi> a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his roome. This made manye godlye Emperours in the primitiue Church, to call general counsels, to reforme many misorders crept into the church, to depose many ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and proude Popes, and plate better in their roome. And he that denieth this, denieth the Sunne to shine at noone dayes. And as this lawe hath thus wrought heretofore: so when it lighteth in a good spirite, I am sure it will do the like hereafter. It wyll mooue a godly Magistrate to haue his chiefest care to maintaine Religion, and to suppresse super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. And suche is Gods righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that whosoeuer shall do the contrarye, I am sure his own conscience wyl condemne him selfe.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded it, the godly kinges of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> haue euermore practised it, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Emperors in the primitiue Church made it their chiefest study, the law of Nature hath ingrauen it in the hart of man. And what godly Prince can now sléepe in securitie, if he haue no care vnto it? Especially seing God is the God of all Magistrates, and they are his creatures. This is their greatest studye, to shew obedience vnto him, to féede his people, and set forth his Religion.</p>
            <p>But here I thinke some wil easely say: If this be so as you teache it, then the case is cleare, the Prince is a spirituall Magistrate, it belongeth vnto him to reforme religion, he is the highest Iudge in the Church of God to

               <hi>Pharao</hi> that they were sent of God? They deuided the read sea, and went through on dry land: What madnes made him venter to go so desperatly after? Why would he not

Should the age that came after him reason thus against Israel: If your God be the Lord of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earth, why did not our fathers know him?

They are greeuous vnto flesh and bloud, and suche as Kinges loue not to meddle with al. This was one meane why Princes did not their dutie.

            <p>Especially and aboue althinges looke vnto your Ministery. There is no commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment geuen oftner in the olde Testament: none geuen oftner in the new. When God would specially blesse the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> he scattered the Leuits among the other tribes, <note place="margin">Num. iij.</note> that the law might be taught in al the costes of <hi>Iewry.</hi> When Christ would bring into the
<pb facs="tcp:13849:17"/>
world the light of the Gospell, he sent foorth his Apostels to preach vnto euerye creature. In the old lawe God signified by manie out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tokens, how necessary the Priesthoode was for the instruction of his people, &amp; what Priestes he required. The slaues were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <note place="margin">Exo. xxv.</note> in the rings of the Arke, the Lampe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer burning, to shew that the Priests should alwaies declare the wil of God vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and offer vp the sweete incense of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al praier. On the neat her end of the robe of the Ephod, were bels alwaye soundyng, to <note place="margin">Exod. 28</note> teache that the Priest shoulde be euer heard, where so euer he did go, and shew him selfe a Messenger of the Lord of hostes. In the brest plate he had <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim,</hi> two liuely <note place="margin">Ex. xxviij</note> presentations of Gods presence, to be witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vnto the Priest of his knowledge &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes. In the plate of gold vpon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head <note place="margin">Ex. xxviij</note> was engrauen in great golden letters, <hi>Holynes vnto the Lord,</hi> to testifie his vpright life and conuersation God forbad any strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to enter in among them, except he were circumcised in hart. And of the children or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron,</hi> if any had faulted in his ministerye, he should by no repentance be receiued again to the Priesthood. This was the care that God had then of his Priesthoode, that hee might kéepe in holines al the children of Israel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13849:18"/>
This is the care that we must haue of our Ministerie, if we wil haue the gospel of Christ to growe. This care was greatest vnto the godlye Rulers and Princes of Israel, to the end they might kéepe the sanctuarie vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. This care must be greatest in those that be Christian Magistrates, if they loue Gods glory, and increase of his Gospel. Thus dyd king <hi>Salomon</hi> in the beginning of his raigne, <note place="margin">i. Reg. ij.</note> when he put downe <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and made <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc</hi> hie Priest. Thus did <hi>Ieosaphat,</hi> when to <note place="margin">ij.

But of al other <hi>Moyses,</hi> who had receiued the commaundement of God hym selfe, as appeareth, did especiallye sée what was the necessitie of the Minister. In the. 33 of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> a little before his death, thus he maketh his praier: <hi>Let thy Vrim &amp;</hi>

They shall teach Iacob thy iudgementes, and Israel

O that our Ministers were suche as <hi>Moyses</hi> praied for, then no doubt God would blesse them according to their request, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their aduersaries that rise vp against them. And here also marke his great zeale for their prosperitie: He was the pacientest man, and had the miledest nature of all the people of Israel, yet could he not suppres his good and great affection, but brake out into these wordes: <hi>Smite through the loynes of them that rise vp against him, &amp; of them that hate hym, that they ryse not vp agayne.</hi> O Lord, if <hi>Moyses</hi> had liued in our dayes, and seue this adulterous generation that so spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

               <hi>O Lord, that defile thy Priesthood.</hi> And good were it for these synful men, that God would send his plagues vpon them, while yet they haue time to repent.

Surely, as <hi>Ahijah</hi> said of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> so we may saye of our Ministers: Haue we not made vs Priestes like the people of our <note place="margin">i.

Let them returne againe to their old occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet this is but one euill, and if it were reformed, yet much styll were amysse. If I would declare vnto your Maiestie al the great abuses that are in our Ministerie, I should leade you along in the spirite, as God did the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and after many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable <note place="margin">Ezec. viij</note> euils, yet I shal still say vnto you, behold you shal sée mo abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those.</p>
            <p>I would first leade you to your Benefices,
<pb facs="tcp:13849:21"/>
and behold some are defiled with <hi>Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> some with <hi>Sequestrations,</hi> some loden with <hi>Pensions,</hi> some robbed of their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities: and yet bet behold more abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then these. Looke after this vpon your Patrons, and les some are selling their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, some farming them, some keepe them for their Children, some geue them to Boies, some to Seruing men, a very few seeke after learned Pastors: and yet you shall see more abominations then these. Looke vpon your Ministerie, and there are some of one occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; some of another: some shake bucklers, some Ruffians, some Hawkers &amp; Hunters, some Dicers and Carders, some blind guides and cannot sée, some dum Dogs and wyl not barcke: and yet a thousande moe iniquities haue now couered the Priesthood. And yet you in the meane while that al these whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes are committed, you at whose handes God will require it, you sit stil, and are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and let men do as they list. It toucheth not belike your common wealth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are so wel contented to let all alone. The Lord encrease the giftes of his holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite in you, that from faith to faith you maye grow continually, till that you be zealous as good king <hi>Dauid</hi> to woorke his will.

counsel (as mans hart is blinded) that you can deuise no way, aske counsel at the mouth of the Lord, and his holy wyl shall be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto you.</p>
            <p>To reforme euil Patrones, your Maiestie must strengthen your lawes, that they maye rule as wel hye as low. As <hi>Esdras</hi> said once, so may I say now: <hi>The handes of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Rulers are chiefe in this trespasse.</hi> If <note place="margin">Esdra. ix.</note> you wil haue it amended, you must prouide so that the highest may be afraide to offende. To keepe backe the ignorant from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, whom God hath not called to suche a function, take away your authoritie from the Bishops, let them not thus at their pleasure make Ministers in their Closset, whom so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it pleaseth them. To stop the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that grow in the Ministerie by other, who say they are learned and can preach, and yet do not, that are as I said, dum Dogs, and wil not barcke, bridle at the least their greedy appetites, pul out of their mouthes these poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned bones that they so gréedely gnaw vp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that shall iudge the quicke and the dead in his appearaunce, and in his kingdome: amend these horrible abuses, &amp; the Lord is on your right hand, you shal not be remoued for euer.
