            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPHESIE, Of a Countryman, called <hi>Michel Lindeman,</hi> being 86 Years of age, living in the Dukedom of <hi>HAGEN;</hi> done in the Harveſt-time of the Year of our Lord 1699.</head>
            <list>
               <item>1. THe King of Poland, with the help of the Swediſh and Muſcovites, ſhall bring the whole Kingdom of Poland under his Authority, and ſhall cauſe the Goſpel to be preached throughout all his Dominions, and rout and deſtroy the Romiſh Religion throughout all his Realms.</item>
               <item>2. Whilſt ſhall the Lyon of the North, or Swediſh King, with the Wild-Ox, his Neighbour, or the great Czar of Muſcovie, and the Poliſh King, deſcend and come down into Sileſia with all their Forces: upon which the Romaniſts ſhall run away with great multitudes, and then the preachers of the Goſpel ſhall be reſtored to their former ſtate.</item>
               <item>3. And then the Papiſts will not know where to run or hide themſelves, ſo that they ſhall cover themſelves with Skins; yea, the Prelate of <hi>Hagen,</hi> will be known by a Swediſh Soldier; for, finding a ſoft skin upon his hands, he underſtands that it is no Country-man, but a Perſon of Quality, therefore he will deal very hard by him.</item>
               <item>4. The Swedes and Muſcovites ſhall receive great help, for the whole German Empire will Joyn themſelves together, and ſhall paſs thorrow <hi>Bohemia, Moravia,</hi> and the Empire, marching to the Emperour, to ſee what and how he hath dealt with the Proteſtants.</item>
               <item>5. Then they will march towards Rome, for to beſiege the Pope; before which place they ſhall reſt three weeks: But there will be great Thundrings; The fire ſhall deſcend from Heaven upon the four corners of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſetting all in fire and flame; and thus Rome, with all its Cloiſters, will be ſet in fire, and at laſt the Romiſh Monarchy will be in a confuſion, and the Goſpel ſhall be preach'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt throughout all the World.</item>
               <item>6. This ſhall come to paſs in the Year our Lord 1700, or within the time of a Year and a half. He exhorts all People to be conſtant and ſtedfeſt in their Belief, and ſays, that this will come to paſs within ſeven months and a half, and that they ſhall ſee it; and that the Papiſts, for fear of the Swediſh Army, wil run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out of Sileſia; and that God ſhall raiſe up the Believers of the Goſpel, within a ſhort time again, yea more as they ever were before.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Note. This man undertakes all the Puniſhments imaginable, in caſe it does not come as he hath ſaid. He alſo has foretold the coming of the Turk before Vienna, at which he was put into Priſon, but when the Turkiſh Army came before the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſaith he, take notice, for upon this very day, about two of the Clock, in the afternoon, he ſhall lay his ſiege. Three days after this his ſaying, came the Poſt where he was impriſoned, and told, that the ſiege exactly was laid at the ſame hour he had foretold, and then the Papiſts, out of ſhame, ſet him at Liberty: Of this the Gazette made mention at that very time.</p>
            <p>He alſo has foretold, the great perſecution which ſhould come to paſs in France, and alſo the War which followed on the back.</p>
