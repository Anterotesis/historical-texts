            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS
For Granting Letters of Mart to Trading Ships.</head>
            <head type="sub">Humbly offered to the honourable Houſe of Commons.</head>
            <p>THAT the <hi>French</hi> King forces his Subjects Merchant Ships to take
Commiſſions inſtead of denying them, and <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> grant
them freely; being of Opinion, That they are ſerviceable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and Allies, and hurtful to none except their Enemies.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>French</hi> Letter of Mart Ships have done us more damage in our Trade
than their Men of War; and ſuch of our Merchant Ships and Gallies that have
been ſo lucky to obtain Commiſſions, have done very good Service, by taking in
the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> only many rich Prizes from the <hi>French,</hi> to the Value of at leaſt
One hundred thouſand Pounds within theſe laſt Six Months.</p>
            <p>That upon the Incouragement of having Letters of Mart, which were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
till lately, the Merchants have built many very fine Frigats and Gallies, the
better to annoy the Enemy, and ſecure their own Trade, which was before in a
great meaſure loſt in ſeveral Places, and now thereby partly regain'd; but ſhould
not the Commiſſions already granted, which are expired or expiring (for they
laſt but for one Voyage, which is alſo eſteemed hard) be removed, and new
Ones granted to the Frigats and Gallies lately built, it will be a great Hinderance
to their hopeful way of recovering our Trade, and alſo a Diſcouragement to the
Merchants and Marriners.</p>
            <p>That in regard Merchant Ships of all other Nations in War have Commiſſions,
our Commanders and Sea-men are unwilling to go to Sea without being upon
equal Terms with them: For without Commiſſions they dare not ſeize a <hi>French</hi>
Ship, though ſhe falls in their way, for fear of being afterwards retaken by the
<hi>French,</hi> and hanged for Pirates. Beſides, Commiſſions encourage the Men the
better to defend their Ships; For who will fight, when if they ſhould overcome
they dare not ſeize?</p>
            <p>That ſuch Ships as have Commiſſions are obliged to give 1500 or 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to perform their Inſtructions, and particularly to carry one half of their
Compliment Land-men, which raiſes a great Number of Sea-men for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Service; and their Prizes pay conſiderable Cuſtoms and Fifths to the Crown,
beſides the Gain it brings to the Concerned and Nation in general; for each
Prize is a double Gain to us, in regard the Enemy looſes as much as we get.</p>
            <p>The Objection that hath been made againſt granting Commiſſions is, That
ſome of theſe Commiſſion Ships have committed Irregularities. To which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That there hath been ſeveral hundred Commiſſions granted ſince the
War, and its believed there never was fewer Irregularities committed by ſuch a
great Number of Ships as by thoſe, if any at all. But with ſubmiſſion, ſuppoſe
One in a Hundred of them have broken their Inſtructions, (though we know of
none) it would be ſevere for all the reſt to ſuffer for their Faults, when they
may be ſo eaſily puniſhed for it.</p>
