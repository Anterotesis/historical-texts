            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The like may be said of the present Text that I haue in hand, that albeit it be a part of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> made vnto the Children of Israel a little before their captiuity into Babylon, (wherein he assureth them, that piety onely, and no carnall sleights or abilities should be able to doe them good in that fearefull day,) and so might seeme to be proper to that Nation, and to that occasion; yet for all that, if we will not mistake it, we are to take it for an euerlasting Sermon: (there is mention in the Reuelation of an euerlasting Gospell,<note place="margin">Reuel. 14.6.</note>) and euen for a generall Proclamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all haughtinesse, and vaine confidence of men, whether they be Iewes or Gentiles, young or old, euen against all those that doe not set God before their eyes, making him their stay, but doe boast themselues of the sharpenesse of their wit, or of the strength of their arme, or of the greatnesse of their wealth, which the Lord doth not account of. And that this generall vse is to be made of this parcell of Scripture; the holy Ghost himselfe, the best Interpreter of his owne meaning, doth plainly declare,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.31. &amp; 2. Cor. 10.17. <hi>Tertullian. de spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaculis.</hi>
                     </note> 1. Cor. 1. ver. 31. and 2. Cor. 10. ver. 17. To which places for breuity sake I doe referre you. And here that obseruation of <hi>Tertull.</hi> in his booke <hi>De spectaculis,</hi> hath fit place: <hi>Specialiter quaedam pronunciata, generaliter sapiunt: cùm Deus Israelitas admonet disciplinae, vel obiurgat, vtique ad omnes habet.</hi> Certaine things vttered (in the Scriptures) for one special purpose, or vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one speciall occasion, haue yet a generall drift or importment: when God admonisheth the Israelits of their duty or findeth fault with them, (for neglect thereof,) it concerneth all. So then as the Apostle saith to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie, That he suffered trouble for the Gospels sake vnto bonds,</hi> but the Word of God was not bound:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. Heb. 11.</note> and as it is said of <hi>Abel,</hi> Heb. 11. <hi>That he being dead, yet speaketh</hi>; So it may said in some sort of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> that though he were bound, as concerning bodily presence to his Countrymen the Iewes, and though his bones are rotten long sithence, yet for all that his words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine liuely in operation, euen to this day, and by the same he speaketh and preacheth vnto vs now here assembled. And what doth he speake vnto vs in the words of my Text? In summe &amp; in grosse this much, to purge out the old leauen of arrogancy and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17966:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that we may be a sweet leauen of modesty, and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto the Lord. In particular these two points, first, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we would weane our selues from all carnall boasting, whether of our wit &amp; cunning, or of our power and authority, or of our wealth and other abilities; this in the former verse. Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that we would entertaine &amp; embrace a spiritual kind of reioycing for Gods great mercies and fauours towards vs, and namely for this, that he hath vouchsafed to reueale himselfe &amp; his truth and mercy vnto vs, this in the later verse. Touching the former, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are deceiued (beloued) concerning the mat-terof boasting; for neither is it proper to a few fooles onely, as some haue imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, (for these fooles are found euery where) neither is it a fault of vanity onely or indiscretion, but euen of iniquity &amp; sinfulnes. If any doubt of the general spreding of the infection, &amp; whether it be epidemicall, let him think but of two sayings, the one of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> the other of <hi>Seneca.</hi> In the 20. of the Prouerbs <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>Many will boast, euery one of his goodnesse, but who can finde a faithfull man?</hi> Where he sheweth the fault to be generall,<note place="margin">Prouerb. 20.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of wisedome first, this I haue to say, that of all the gifts wherewith the Lord doth beautifie the soule of man, none seemeth to be comparable to it; sure I am, none ought to be preferred to it. For it is the very sterne of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, the very Sunne of our Firmament, the very eye of our head, the very heart of our body. Where wisedome sitteth at the sterne, there matters are ordered in a probable course to a laudable end. But where wisedome is wanting, there the Sun goeth downe at noone-day, to vse the Prophets words, there the light that is in vs, is turned into darkenesse, as Christ speaketh; and then how great is the darkenesse!

And why? First, because it is not our owne, or of our selues,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyprian ad Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. lib.</hi> 3.</note> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>In nullo gloriandum, quia nostrum nihil est</hi>: wee are to boast of nothing, because nothing is our owne, or of our selues, and <hi>Augustin</hi> vpon <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, Christ said not, Without me you can doe little: but, Without me you can doe nothing. Where then is glorying? Is it not excluded? For if it were lawfull to boast of that which is not our owne, then the Crow might haue been iustified for brauing it with her bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed feathers, or stolne (<hi>furtiuis coloribus</hi>) &amp; the Asse for ietting with the Lyons skinne about him, and the Ape for skipping vp &amp; downe in his masters Iacket; but now these were ridiculous in so doing: therefore we cannot reasonably boast of that which is not our owne, except we will be like to these vnreasonable beasts; let this be the first reason against glorying in wisedome. The second this, Our wisedome is many wayes vnperfect; therefore if we be wise, we will not bragge of it; for will any bragge of his lame leg, or his one eye?

Fisher-men making of a draught, agreed with them a-great for their draught, that what they should hale vp to land in their net, should be theirs.

The same being claimed and seized vpon by the young men, by vertue of their bargaine, they cast betweene them how to dispose of it.

So for matters of peace; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> the wisest of all, thought that if he might ioyne in affinity with his neighbour-Princes, and take many of their daughters to be his wiues and women, he should not onely strengthen the Kingdome in his owne hand, but also stablish it in his house long and long; also he thought peraduenture, that by occasion of his marriages and affinities being so great, many of the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landish people would be trayned &amp; wonne to the knowledge of the true God of Israel, but how was he deceiued? His wiues and worshippingwomen turned his heart from the Lord, he could do little or good no vpon them or theirs. And as for the secret vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminers of <hi>Salomons</hi> State &amp; succession,<note place="margin">1 Kings 11.</note> where found they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment but among his allies? Let me instance this point in one or two examples more. <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, that worthy Christian and great Politician, though that if he might build a City in the confines of Europe and Asia, that might bee <hi>aemula Romae,</hi> a match to Rome, and place one of his sonnes there to keepe his Court, he should not onely eternize his name, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so fortifie the Empire no lesse, then if he had enuironed it with a wall of brasse. Also <hi>Phocas</hi> and <hi>Pepinus</hi> thought, the one if hee might dignifie the Bishop of Rome with an extrauagant Title, (to bee called Vniuersall Bishop,) the other, if he might lade the Church of Rome with Principalities, euen with Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vpon Principalitie, they should deserue immortally, well, not onely of that Sea, but also of the whole house of God. But <hi>the way of man is not in himselfe,</hi> as <hi>Ieremy</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Ierem. 10 23.</note> neither is it in man to fore-see what will fall out luckily or crosse. The building
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17966:14"/>
of new Rome was the decay of old Rome; so it proued: and the diuiding of the Empire was the destruction of the Empire, and no lesse, as wise men know: also the lifting vp of the man of Rome, was the hoysing vp of the man of sinne, and the loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him in the chaire, euen in the chaire of pestilence. Thus there is no policy so prouident, no prouidence so circumspect, but the same is subiect to errors and crosses, and therefore no cause why it should be trusted to, and therefore no cause why it should be gloryed in. <hi>Let not the wise man glory in his wisedome, &amp;c.</hi> If any wisedome might be boasted of, surely one of those kindes of wisedomes that I erst reckoned vp vnto you, to wit, wisedome or skill in the Arts, wisedome or knowledge in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, wisedome or policy touching matters of State: but these you haue heard, are not to be relyed vpon, because they are vncertaine, because they are vnperfit: and therefore much lesse are we to rely vpon any such as is worse, or inferiour to these. But yet the world is the world, it hath done so, &amp; doth so, yea, and blesseth it selfe for so doing; therefore this wound hath need to be searched &amp; ransacked a little deeper. <hi>Homer,</hi> I remember,<note place="margin">

Wisedome therefore is better then strength, and therefore this is one strong reason, why strength should not be boasted of, since wisedome is denyed. Another reason may be this; Strength of force, bee it equall to the strength of a Lyon, or Elephant, yet it is but the stren gth of flesh neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, and all flesh is fraile and subiect to foyle; whom one cannot ouercome, many may; whom sword cannot pierce, shot will; whom shot doth not hit, sickenesse may arrest; time sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and death will be sure to make an end of.

mighty, yet He that dwelleth in the Heauens, is stronger then you; bee you neuer so well lined, or backed, or guarded, yet He that sitteth betweene the Cherubins, is better appointed. Therefore trust not in your owne strength, much lesse in wrong and robbery; make not your selues hornes by your owne power; there is no power, there is no force, there is no puissance that can deliuer from wrath, in the day of wrath, the children of wrath; that is to say, them that hale downe Gods vengeance vpon them by their vnmercifulnesse. This might bee easily vouched by sundry examples, but the time being so far spent, it is time to come to the third speciall thing that we are forbidden to glory in, to wit, <hi>Riches. Nor the rich man glory in his riches.</hi> As I gaue this for one reason, why strength should not be gloried in, because it is not to be compared to wisedome; which I had proued before, might not be allowed to boast: So I may assigne this for one cause, why riches should not bee boasted of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not comparable to strength, which euen now I excluded from glorying.

If you doubt whether riches bee worse, or lesse to bee esteemed then strength, you may be perswaded hereby, for that riches doe toll-in enemies, but strength doth repel them from entring, and also expell them, if haply they bee entred; also riches doe make the theife more ventrous, but very seldome doe they make the true man more hardy. That riches doe toll and draw in enemies, it is euident by all Stories.

None e uer more faithful in Gods house then <hi>Moses,</hi> none deeper in Gods Booke, none more graced with miracles, none more carefull of the peoples good, &amp;c. Yet if any feare of hunger, or thirst, or enemies, &amp;c. doe assaile them, presently they are ready to returne into Egypt, and to that end to elect another Captaine in place of <hi>Moses</hi> (as you may see in Exodus, and the Booke of Numbers,) so great interest had he in them. I skip ouer <hi>Samuel, Dauid, Ieremy,</hi> and other Kings, and Prophets, and righteous men. Come we to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and his Galatians: his I call them, because he had begotten them in the Gospell, and as a Nurse cherisheth her children, so was he tender among them: but when he came to reape fruit from them, hee found that he reckoned without his Hoast, and so was disappointed of his hope. At the first, I grant, they receiued him as an Angell of God, euen as Christ Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither did they better intreat the Lord of the house, Christ Iesus himselfe; for these were but his seruants. It is true, the Father said, <hi>They will reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence my Sonne</hi>; and indeed so he well deserued, for hee went about doing good, and healing all that were possessed of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, or visited with any other sicknesse, for God was with him. He spake so diuinely as never man spake, his enemies being wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, yea the people wondred at the gracious words that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of his mouth, and flocked betimes to heare him, and hung as it were vpon his shoulders. Thus Christ might seeme to say of them; <hi>My beloued is mine, and I am hers, I haue married her to my selfe in righteousnesse, iudgement and mercy.</hi> But all this was but Hony-moone, or as the hasty Summer fruits; within a while they became rotten and corrupt, and forgate their first loue. Nay, for a word spoken, which that they did not vnderstand, was their owne fault onely, they gaue him the back, and became Apostates. Looke a little higher vpon the 51. verse, and so downeward. Because Christ said, that he was the <hi>Liuing Bread that came downe from Heauen:</hi> And, <hi>Except yee eate of the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke of his blood, you haue no life in you:</hi> Hereupon groweth a quarrell, and such a quarrell, as will not be taken vp by any Apologie or mediation, but they must needs part; yet all Lawes, and common reason also will allow a man to interpret his owne meaning, and when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that he speaketh figuratiuely, and spiritually, he ought

                     <hi>desiring to speake with thee</hi>; He answered and said, <hi>Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</hi> And stretching out his hand vpon his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he said, <hi>Behold my mother and my brethren; for he that shall doe the will of my Father which is in heauen, he is my brother, sister, and mother.</hi> Thus Christ. Now I aske, Was Christ ashamed of his kindred? By no meanes; for he taught others to honour father and mother, and not to turne away their eyes from their owne flesh; therefore himselfe would not be found defectiue in that duty. But this is that that <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>Hoc dicto vsus est ad excutiendam importunitatem ab opere reuocantium</hi>; That is, By this saying, he would meete with, and shake off their importunity or vnseasonablenesse, that withdrew him from his worke; and therefore I say, that he denieth that simply in shew, which hee denieth not but in comparison indeed; namely, that if any hinder him in his heauenly vocation, hee would not take him for his kinsman. So <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Iohn 4</note> 
                     <hi>My meate is to doe the will of him that sent me,</hi> and to finish his worke. Had he no other meat at any time? Yes, hee did hunger and thirst, and eate and drinke as other men doe; but in comparison of this, he cared not for the other, this was meat and drinke to him. So the Prophet <hi>Esay, Is not this the fasting that I haue chosen, to loose the bands of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esay chap 58.</note> 
                     <hi>to take off the heauy burdens, and to let the oppressed goe free, &amp;c. To deale thy bread to the hungry? &amp;c.</hi> There was another bodily fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, (or pinching of the belly) but that was nothing to this spirituall One. So another Prophet, <hi>Rent your hearts,</hi>

                     <hi>and not your garments</hi>; And another, <hi>Circumcise the fore-skin of your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Neither doe the Scriptures only vse to speake thus, but ordinary wise men also, whether they were in the Church or out of the Church.

                     </note> My hands are the poore, the blind, and the lame, whom I keepe of almes, said <hi>Amadeus.</hi> Lastly, doe you aske what is the Romanes their science or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation? I confesse, (saith the Prince of Latine Poets) Others can paint, and carue, and play the Orators, and play the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers artificially, but, <hi>Tu regere Imperio populos Romane memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp;c. Hae tibi erunt Artes, &amp;c.</hi> Thine Astronomy, and thine Oratory, and thy caruing and painting, &amp;c. must be to keepe in obedience Nations, and to be good to them that liue in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and as for the proud and refractary, to keepe them downe; this must be thy Art. Euen thus you heare that our Sauiour is not singular in his phrase in this 6. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> touching <hi>Eating his Flesh, and drinking his Blood,</hi> but that the same in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie is vsed else-where by himselfe, and euery where by others. And to say the truth, why should our Sauiour be thought to speake more properly and naturally, when hee saith to vs, <hi>You must eate the Flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his Blood</hi>; then when he saith of himselfe, <hi>My meate is to doe the will of Him that sent me, &amp;c?</hi> Yet of the former speech, our Aduersaries the Romanists take hold of, as did also the Capernaites before them, &amp; to the later they take no exception. It is certaine that it was <hi>Scandalum acceptum, non datum</hi>; our Sauiour spake none otherwise then he might doe; but these men tooke it otherwise then they ought to doe. And who tooke it in ill fashion? The Text saith, <hi>Many of his Disciples when they heard this, said, This is an heardsaying, who may abide it?</hi> Yea further, that <hi>Many went backe &amp; walked no more with him,</hi> ver. 66. If the vulgar <hi>Gnain Haarets,</hi> had ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilled with a few of the better sort only, or if they had kept their dislike to themselues, or if they had contained themselues within words, it had bin another matter, <hi>(Mortui non mordent:</hi> so words be but wind, <hi>Verba dum sunt,</hi> and so <hi>Muti non mordent.</hi>) But now, for his owne Disciples to doe it, and not a few of them, but many, and not within themselues, but to vtter it openly, and to proceed from words to deeds, and <hi>(de facto)</hi> to fall from him; as it made their sinne the more sinfull, so it might make Christs Passion the more passionate, though all his passions were sanctified, and alwayes without sin. Well: after much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration &amp; ridding of the way, (all necessary for the clearing of the occasion) we are come at the length to the Text it selfe; Wherein note with me three things: <hi>A question, An answere,</hi> &amp; <hi>A re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply.</hi>

A man may be tumbled downe from the ladder, as well when hee is within a round or two of the top, as when he is in the midst, or below the midst: and a man may make shipwracke, when he is within a ken of land, as well as when he is a thousand miles off. What had it profited <hi>Peter,</hi> to haue escaped the first and second watch, if they had stucke at the Iron-gate, and had not passed thorow that also? And what did it benefit <hi>Samson,</hi> to haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood and eluded <hi>Delilahs</hi> temptation three seuerall times, when in the fourth he gaue ground and was ouer-come? Who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth account of land Oates that shead before the Haruest? or of fruit, be it Apple or Peare, that falls from the tree before it be ripe? If you heare these things, happy are ye if ye doe them, saith Christ; and if you receiue the Word once with gladnesse, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are ye, say I, if you continue in liking of it. It is not an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or light sinne to fall from the Grace of Christ, neither was it a small fault of these Disciples, hauing beene once enlightned, and tasted of the good gift of God, to forsake Christ in the open field, and to turne to him the backe and not the face. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell therefore, if Christ seeme so to wonder as he doth, at their back-sliding; &amp; if he be so carefull to admonish the twelue, that they follow not their steps; but be warned by their falls: <hi>Will yee also g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To this effect our Sauiour. Now here a couple of questions may be demanded; the one touching our Sauiour himself, the other touching his Elect. Christ demandeth of them what their minde was? doth not this somewhat question his omniscience? Againe he asketh them, whether they would forsake him? doth not this call in question the stablenes of Gods counsell touching the Elect? These be the two questions which I will answere in a word or two. Touching the first: It is certaine, that as the Father hath life in himselfe, and light, and wisedome, and knowledge: so he giueth his Son to haue the same in him, nay he hath the same of himselfe as he is God. No want in the God-head may be imagined, nor degrees of hauing, but all is perfit and at once, yea and from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. He therefore being <hi>Iehouah, and Shaddai, all-being, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, all-sufficient, and euer-sufficient,</hi> may not be thought to haue asked this question, to be better informed for his owne part: for he knoweth all, and needed not that any should testifie of man, for hee knew what was in man,<note place="margin">Iohn 2.

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. But as in the 12. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Christ saith, <hi>This voyce came not for my sake, but for yours.</hi> So may we say of Christs words in my Text, that they were not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered for himselfe, but for vs. It was good that the world should be satisfied concerning the resolution of the Apostles to follow Christ, whatsoeuer came of it, for their honour, for our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the glory of God, in giuing such gifts vnto men. Therefore doth the Lord bring forth their righteousnesse as the morning, and causeth their faith to breake forth into confession. <hi>They beleeued, and therefore did they speake</hi>; Wee also, if we beleeue, we will speake, and will not be ashamed of him before men, lest he also be ashamed of vs, before his Father which is in heauen.

This therefore may seeme to be a speciall cause why Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth of the twelue, whether they would play the Turne-coats, as some others did, namely, to draw forth their confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and profession of their faith. As for the other doubt; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Elect can fall away? the same will easily be cleared, if we agree vpon the termes of Elect, and falling away, namely, if we vnderstand by Elect, such as are chosen according to the purpose of grace, vnto an inheritance immortall, vndefiled, that fadeth not away, reserued in heauen for them; and by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away, an vtter departing from the fellowship of the Saints, and an vtter renouncing of the truth reuealed. The truly Elect cannot so vtterly become cast-awayes. If then man and the world, and the Deuill were stronger then God, then the gifts and calling of God had repentance; then Christ should not loue to the end whom he loueth; yea, then some should be able to take them out of the Fathers hand. All which points, and twenty more to this purpose, are directly contrary to Gods Word, which cannot lye. Therefore we conclude that a man truly Elect, cannot throughly perish. I grant, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> were Elect or chosen, but it was to an office, not to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory. <hi>Peter</hi> and others fell away, but it was for a time, not finally, they wauered and staggered, and felt some eclipse in their faith, but the same was neuer extinguished nor rooted vp. Christ prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> and not for him onely, but for as many as should beleeue in his Name, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. that their faith should not faile; And can Satan or all the power of hell preuaile against Christs prayer? <hi>Praedestinatorum nemo cum Diabolo peribit,</hi>

Take for example the Ephesians, Actes 19. <hi>Demetrius</hi> bloweth the coales, and presently the whole City is vpon a light fire, yea, and vpon an vproare too, one cryeth one thing, and some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the assembly being out of order, the more part knew not why they were come together. And the case standing thus many times with the multitude, should any wise man pinne his faith vpon their sleeues, and hand ouer head doe whatsoeuer he seeth them to doe, or shunne whatsoeuer hee seeth them to forsake? Will you goe away, because many that haue beene Disciples doe goe away? Alas, beloued, the Campe neuer wanteth Turne-coates, nor the Common-weale Traitors, nor a Society false brethren, nor the Church of Christ, hollow-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christians.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to rest vpon the Scriptures, &amp; hold them to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient witnesses of Christ, euen without tradition. O, but though he doe not send vs to Tradition, or to the report of Fathers in that place,<note place="margin">Math. 23.</note> yet he doth else-where, as <hi>Math.</hi> 23. <hi>The Scribes &amp; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises sit euer vpon</hi> Moses <hi>Chaire: all therefore whatsoeuer they say vnto you, keepe, and doe, but according to their workes doe not.</hi> The Successor of <hi>Moses</hi> his doctrine must be obeyed, much more then, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor of the Apostles.

If Rome were called by that name in that Epistle, why should it not be as well vnderstood so in the Reuelation? and then the great whore, which was to make all the world drunke with the Cuppe of her fornications?

And I pray you, is not our cause like to <hi>Optatus</hi> his, and theirs to the Parmenians? When haue our Magistrates vrged any of them that haue beene sent from Rome (much lesse Recusants) to deny God, except they make him of Rome to be their God? Nay, both they and we doe exhort them with all instance, to turne from that vanity, and to trust in the liuing God. <hi>Cursed be he that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arme.</hi> So, When doe we vrge them to burne the Bible, or any part of the Bible? Nay, this hath beene their fault, (and sticketh to them for infamy, like the Leprosie of <hi>Gehezi</hi>) To set fire vpon the translated Bibles wheresoeuer they could finde them, and to burne them by hundreds on an heape; yet the worst translation (made by our men,) is founder, and more agreeable to the Originall, then the Translation of the Seuentie: and yet the Apostles themselues suffered the same, nay, vsed the same, (as is euident to the Learned:) so farre were they from defacing it. To be short, When and where haue our men forced them, yea, or perswaded either, to put Incense vpon the Altar, or to throw downe Churches? Nay, it is their proper guise; euen now in the time of the Gospell (when shadowes and carnall worship should cease,) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume their Altar, and their vestiments, and many things that I know not, nor care to learne, and it hath beene their ordinary practice, where they haue beene the stronger, to destroy not onely Churches, but also as many as haue beene assembled in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17966:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them to heare Gods Word, and to receiue the Sacrament, euen bloudily and butcherly, with a rage that reached vp to heauen. Witnesse the Massacres that they made at Vassey, at Merindol, and Cabrias, in Piemont, in Calabria, and where not? So that we haue great cause to flee from them, (not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to goe away,) and they no cause to flee from vs, who neuer thirsted after their blood, nor drew it but constrained, and in our defence. But to what purpose all this? Since they whom it concerneth are not here, and them that are here, it doth not concerne; yet as our Sauiour made full account, that some of his Auditors would relate vnto <hi>Herod</hi> what opinion he held of him, and therefore said vnto them, <hi>Goe yee, and tell that Fox</hi>: So we are content, that they take information by some of you, that we maintaine, and are instant, that there is cruelty in their side, and not in ours, and a good cause with vs, and not with them; and therefore that there is cause why they should returne to vs, and no cause in the world why we should turne to them. And let so much be spoken of the Question. It followeth, [Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter <hi>therefore answered him, Lord, to whom shall we goe? thou hast the words of euerlasting life. And we haue beleeued and knowne (for we doe beleeue &amp; know, Heb.) that thou art the Christ, the Son of the liuing God.</hi>] In this answere Saint <hi>Peter</hi> doth two things; First, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth flatly, that hee or his fellow Apostles haue any such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Then he bringeth reasons of their constant adhering to him. The denyall is set forth by way of Interrogation for more vehemency sake, and containeth in it a reason drawne from the excellency of Christ before other teachers, <hi>Lord, to whom shall we goe?</hi> meaning there was no Master worth the thinking of, in comparison to him, and therefore that they were farre from any such purpose. The reasons drawne from the excellency of Christ, are two. The one, from the excellency of his Doctrine, [<hi>Thou hast the words of euerlasting life</hi>;] the other, from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his person, [<hi>Thou art the Christ, the Son of the liuing God.</hi>] Our heart and conscience telleth vs so much, therefore we are not men, but deuils, if we forsake thee. To this effect is Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> answer in the name of his fellowes. Let vs take the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs in order as they lye, and first, speake of the Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Simon Peter</hi> therefore answered him, saying, <hi>Lord, to whom shall we goe?</hi> The first thing that we are to learne out of these words, is this, namely, That truth, and a good cause, hath alwayes some to maintaine it. The Disciples fell away, yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Disciples fell away, yea, they fell away so, that they came no more at our Sauiour, as the Text hath it: but yet hee was not left without witnesse, he had the Apostles to beare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to him, and to stand for him. So the High Priests and the Elders, yea, and the whole multitude of the Iewes cryed out
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17966:26"/>
against him, and would not otherwise be satisfied, then with his death; but <hi>Ioseph of Arimathea,</hi> a Councellour, a iust man, and a good, consented not to their plots and practices, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. So <hi>Obadiah</hi> was not carryed away with the streame of the time, to kill Gods Prophets, and those that worshipped the Lord with holy worship, but hid them in Caues, and prouided for them, though it were with the jeopardy of his head. So <hi>Ruben,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Kings 18.</note> though he had sinned before a great sinne, and had highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God thereby, and his father too, yet in this, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, he pleased both, that he dissented from his brethrens bloody designe, to murder their bother <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Genes. 37.</note> and both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them, and deliuered him. The like example of constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and magnanimity appeared in <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Iosuah,</hi> Numb. 14. who opposed themselues, not onely to their fellowes being tenne to two, but also to the whole Congregation of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel, being an hundred thousand to one: against all they stood boldly, for the maintenance of Gods glory, in the power of his might, and the truth of his promise, saying, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell not against the Lord, neither feare yee the people of the Land,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 14.9.</note> 
                     <hi>for they are but bread for vs, their shield is departed from them, and the Lord is with vs, feare them not.</hi> Thus they; and this was counted to them for righteousnesse vnto all posterity for euer-more. Yea, that God that prospered the Midwiues of Egypt, for not subscribing to the bloody decree of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, did also highly aduance these his seruants, not onely bringing them into the Land of Promise, the place of rest where they would be, but also making one of them, Generall Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ouer his people, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus there is a reward with the Lord, and a speciall reward for them that cleaue fast vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">Ioshuah.</note> and doe sanctifie him, both in their hearts, and in their tongues, as <hi>Peter</hi> doth in my Text, and will not be carryed away by the example of the multitude, to thinke or say as they doe. But on the contrary side, you know in the Psalme they are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">Psalme 50.</note> who seeing a Thiefe, runne with him, and are partakers with the Adulterers. Yea <hi>Saul,</hi> though he threw neuer a stone at Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> yet, because he kept the clothes of them that stoned him, he may be reckoned among the persecutors. Yea, <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe, that Saint of the Lord, at other times so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, so faithfull, so couragious, yet, because at the waters of Meribah he did not sanctifie the Lord, and rebuke the people for their rebellion, with that edge and resolution, as he ought
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17966:27"/>
to haue done, is told plainely by God himselfe, that he should not enter into the Land of Promise, see it he should, but put his foote in it he should not. See the 20. Chapter of Numbers, and the 32. of Deuteronomy. Let vs consider of these things, Beloued, <hi>It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God</hi>: It is a dangerous thing to deale remissely in his businesse, who is jealous of his seruice, and requireth the whole man. If this were done to <hi>Moses,</hi> a greene Tree, what shall be done to a dry? And if <hi>Moses</hi> were condemned, because he was not so hot as he should haue beene, doe they thinke to escape that are key-cold? This I say, because some thinke, that they make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion beholding to them, and God their debtor for euer, if they doe not fall away from it as well as others, and if they doe not openly blaspheme, and raile vpon it, though in the meane time they speake neuer a word for it. But, as God said to <hi>Moses,</hi> I will make thee a greater Nation and a mightier then these, though all these should be brought to nought: And as Christ said in the Gospell, <hi>I tell you the truth, that if these hold their peace, the stones shall speake</hi>; So we may write vpon it, that God is both able, and willing to defend his Truth, howsoeuer many shall agree to betray it, and rather then he will leaue it vnmaintained, he will open the mouthes of the dumbe, and the children that are yet vnborne, shall praise the Lord. In the meane time, as it is said in Genesis, <hi>The Nation to whom they shall be in bondage, will I iudge, saith God</hi>: And in the Gospell, <hi>Woe be to that man by whom offences shall come,</hi> and especially, <hi>Woe be to the man by whom the Sonne of man shall be betrayed</hi>: So let these men-pleasers, and place-pleasers know, that as they are ashamed to confesse Christ before men, so he will not be pleased to confesse them before his Father which is in heauen. <hi>Gordius</hi> the Martyr was of that minde: for being exhorted by a friend of his, to keepe his conscience to himselfe, and not to professe it, made answer (as <hi>Basil</hi> writeth) that the Truth is not onely betrayed of them that doe (plainely) forsake it, but of them also that will not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely confesse it. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> was of the same minde, <hi>Nec imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritò talis seruus &amp; abijcitur &amp; punitur, &amp;c.</hi> Such a seruant (saith he,) is worthily reiected and punished, because by one and the same silence, he establisheth error, who being forestalled by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror or time, doth not, by meanes of his silence, vouch and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Truth: Euen as, further saith he, he that doth not establish Gods glory, doth euacuate it; and he that doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute and ward the blow of dishonour from God, doth no lesse then heape it vpon him. Why? my Brethren, our cause is good, it is Gods, we haue proued it so to be in hundreds of discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; the times are fauourable, we haue the Bride-groome with vs, why then should any mans heart faile him? <hi>ô verè Phrygiae ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que

They feare where no feare is, saith the Psalmist, the shadow of the mountaines maketh these to feare, saith one, in the booke of Iudges. By the Art of dissembling many thinke they haue great aduantage. The Protestant taketh them for theirs, for their comming to Church; The Romanist theirs, because they speake neuer a word against them: so they gaine on both sides. Wherefore if they should be any thing busie (so they call sincere dealing,) then they should leese such a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans custome, and such a Gentlewomans fauour, &amp;c. Thus the loue of man casteth out the loue of God, and the feare of man casteth out the feare of God. But where is <hi>Elias,</hi> euen he himselfe, said <hi>Elizeus?</hi> Where is <hi>Brutus?</hi> I would thou wert aliue, <hi>Brutus</hi>: it was once written vnder his statue. We may say, Where is <hi>Peter,</hi> and his spirit? He confesseth in my Text, and denieth not, but saith plainely, that there was none worth the looking after but Christ, nor no Doctrine worth the harkening after but his. It was a great blot to <hi>Osius</hi> of Corduba his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, (that had beene a faithfull Confessor in the dayes of persecution,) that following the sway, he was seene to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and an abettor in the Conuenticles of the Arrians; and so those other Bishops did themselues most hurt, that deserued the imputation of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi>

On the other side <hi>Paphnutius</hi> is much renowned in Story, for withstanding the greatest part of the Councell of Nice in a cause of truth, wherein he also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed. And so in these last perilous times, <hi>Vergerius</hi> the Italian, and <hi>Dalthius</hi> the Hungarian, and <hi>Fricius</hi> the Polonian, excellent learned men, and great Statists, and two of them Orators, from great Princes deserued no lesse honour, though they had not so good successe, (for Trent Conuenticle would not be like Nice Councell,) in manfufully proposing, and defending ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny points of Christian Religion, euen as they are taught and vrged by vs. They learned it of the Prophet: <hi>I will speake of thy testimonies before Kings, and will not be ashamed.</hi> Or of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in my Text, who answered boldly, and cared not who heard him, that Christ was to be followed, and he onely. Let vs also (Beloued,) be followers of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in this point, and let this be our first note, or lesson, To be resolute. [Peter <hi>answered and said.</hi>] The next note is like to it, namely, That we be forward, yea and formost too in a good cause. As <hi>Peter</hi> doth not straine

courtesie, nor pause to see whether any other would speake, and ease him of his labour, but as though the waight of it lay vpon his shoulders, hee dischargeth himselfe of it valiantly and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily. The Lord loueth a cheerefull giuer, saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and so, <hi>The Lord loueth a forward Confessor,</hi> say I.

On the other side, <hi>Shimei,</hi> that had abused <hi>Dauid</hi> so villanously for words, that no man was euer abused worse by any, for hee called him man of blood, and man of <hi>Belial:</hi> yet because he was the first of the house of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that came downe to meete him after his restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Kingly Estate, <hi>Dauid</hi> thought himselfe bound to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, and so assured him of his life by an oath. So much it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth a man, what he doth well, to doe quickly, and to doe it betimes; then there is thanke with God, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Euen as <hi>Dauid</hi> setteth forth his forwardnesse, saying, <hi>I made haste, and prolonged not the time to keepe thy righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> his, <hi>When it pleased God to reueale his Sonne in me, immediatly I communicated not with flesh and blood, but went about that worke.</hi> And <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> being called, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. forsooke their ship and their father forthwith, and followed Christ: And <hi>Luke</hi> 19. <hi>Zacheus</hi> being bid to come downe from a tree, came downe in haste, and receiued him. Now, as this haste and forwardnesse is necessary, and to be vsed by all, so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by them that are Ring-leaders, and Captaines of the flock. In their countenance there is hope and despaire; in their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage there is life and death. If <hi>L. Martius</hi> had not bestirred himselfe, and shewed an vncontrolable quicke resolution, and an vndauntable fiery courageousnesse, after the ouerthrow gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the two <hi>Scipio's,</hi> all had beene lost in Spaine, the name of a Romane had beene no more in remembrance. This one example (for hundreds) for matters of warre. So if <hi>Nasica</hi> had not presently, vpon the hurly-burly stirred by the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected himselfe as a Bulwarke against their seditious complot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Common-weale had beene drencht in the gulph of sedition, out of which it would hardly haue popped vp: for the hearts of the valourous would haue failed them for feare, and the hearts of the turbulent would haue been strengthened. Thus one example out of hundreds for matters of peace. So if Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> vpon the reuolt of so many Disciples, and staggering peraduenture of some of the Apostles, had hanged the wing, as they speake, or let fall his Crest, who doth know, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by his example, would haue beene drawne away to obiect cowardize, or amazed distraction? Therefore blessed be God,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17966:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that gaue such strength vnto him, for by his strength, many were confirmed. Let vs thinke of this (Beloued) specially, we that are, or should be men in Christ, let vs reproue them that cannot abide wholesome Doctrine, and let vs confute such, (vpon occasion and modestie, and in order) as are contrary-minded, and teach contrary to the truth, that is, the Scriptures; For the Scriptures are true, and whatsouer is repugnant to the same, is false-hood. Let vs not draw backe and say, Why doth not such a one speake? and why doth not such a one? but rather as in a common fire, let euery man bring his bucket of water to quench it; let euery one presently put his hand to the worke, and helpe to beare anothers burden, and then he shall be blessed in his worke. This is my second note, That not onely we professe boldly, but also that we doe it presently. The third note shall be shorter then the second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, that we be charitable. What in Gods name, (might one say,) what meanes Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to be so liberall to vndertake for others?

To make the matter short, I answere in a word, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sheweth hereby his great charity, which thinketh none euill; and his brotherly loue, which conceiteth another as himselfe.

He knew whom he beleeued, and he knew that his owne heart was established, and his faith built vpon the Rocke Christ, and therefore thought, that others would be as forward as he, and as firme as he.

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hoped of the whole Nation of the Iewes, that in time they should be saued, Rom. 11. And shall we despaire of any particular man, that he belongeth to God, and that he may be reclaimed? O no, let vs teach, let vs improue, let vs admonish, let vs rebuke with all long suffering and gentlenesse, and then God will doe that which seemeth good in his eyes; he will in time giue them grace to repent, that they may escape out of the snares of the Deuill, though presently they be led captiue of him after his will: they may be graffed in (saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>) if they abide not in vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, for God is able to graffe them againe.

This is my third note. Fourthly, let me answer a false glosse of the Rhemists, for they like bryers take hold of our garment, and hinder our proceeding to that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. When company (say they vpon this place,) draw vs to reuolt, let vs say thus: <hi>Lord, whither, or to whom shall we goe, when we haue forsaken thee? To Caluin, Luther,</hi> or such, and forsake thee and thy Church, with the vnfaithfull multitude? &amp;c. Touching <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> I answere first, that though we doe not glory in them, for we are forbidden by the Apostle, 1. Cor. 3.21. <hi>to glory in men (whether it be</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Yet is there no cause why we should be ashamed of them; for he that was least learned of the two, was more learned then an hundred of their chiefest Prelates, take them one by one; and he that was lest vertuous of the two, had more vertue in him, then forty of those Prelates that might be named, put it all together. I know that they escaped not the tongues of the wicked, nor the pens neither of them that were hired to deuise whatsoeuer slanders they could against them, (as also our Sauiour himselfe was both traduced while he liued, and written against when he was dead.)

And why was this? For two causes, First, to resolue the Apostles and Prophets then, and the Church to the end of the world, that the doctrine deliuered by them, came not by priuate motion, nor from themselues, but that they should so write as the holy Ghost should giue them vtterance, and therefore, that their writings should be holy, sound, and true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A second reason was, to teach them and vs, how necessary the gift of the holy Ghost, yea, and a principall measure thereof, is, for all such as are called to this waighty charge, of being Gods Messengers, and Interpretors vnto the people. For if no man can say,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> that Iesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. then who can preach worthily of Iesus, and of the doctrine of saluation, but by him? And if this key of the Spirit be requisite for the opening of all points of doctrine: then is it thrice neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to reueale mysteries. Beloued, this point of doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Incarnation, and Office of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, is not onely a mystery, but a mystery of mysteries, that is, a most deep and hidden mysterie, which the Patriarches saw in a glasse, and as it were in a darke speaking; the Prophets searched after, the very Angels desired to behold. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not onely we, that take vpon vs to vnfold the same, haue need to pray with the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> Lord, open thou our lips, that our mouthes may shew forth thy praise, and speake worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this high mysterie, but also you that are here present before God this day, to heare words from my mouth, ought to pray with all manner of prayer, and with all instance, that he that tooke away the scales from <hi>Pauls</hi> eyes, (and is called by <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 12.</note> The Reuealer of Secrets) would so open the eyes of your vnderstanding, that, that which shall be deliuered vnto you, may not be as a booke that is sealed or clozed fast, but that you may know Christ, and comprehend him, for whose sake you are also comprehended of him.

This is the third. <hi>A Virgin shall conceiue.</hi> This truth is contradicted by two sorts of men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the wrangling Iewe, and by the doubtfull Infidell. The one saith, It was not so, the Prophet did not meane that shee should be a Virgin that should be the mother of <hi>Immanuel.</hi> The other saith, It could not bee, how can a Virgin conceiue, &amp;c? These be the obiections of the vnhappy miscreants, the Iewes, the Gentiles, the Atheisticall scorners, whom I will not answer diligently or at large, lest I should seeme too much to honour them, but I will confute them briefly, that I may furnish you with some reasons against the day of battell; against the time, I say, that your faith shall be shaken with such kind of persons. To the Iewe therefore this I say, That though we take no aduantage of the Etymon of the Word vsed by the Prophet (and yet as the Learned know, the Hebrew tongue doth excell all other tongues, in fitting the nature of things, with proper &amp; fit names,) yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the word signifieth one that is kept close and secret, who else but a Virgin can be meant? But to omit this aduantage, and to omit also the authority of the seuenty Interpreters which were Iewes, and so translated it before this matter was in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, and therefore not excepted against for partiality; Let vs consider the matter it selfe.

Therefore either the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> spake absurdly, and called these things which were not such, as though they were such (which was farre from that wisdome and eloquence that was in him,) or an extraordinary Conception, and which exceeded the bounds of nature, and the experience of the world, is here signified. This is enough to beat downe the Iewes, enough in this place: for if I should stand to refute all their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nils, I should seeme to forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To the Infidels, that cry out, It is impossible that a Virgin should conceiue, this I answere, euen as Christ did in the like case, That with men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

Indeed, Beloued, though he hath made a Law for all his creatures; yet he hath not made a Law for himselfe, he will be brought vnto subiection to none. He is and will remaine <hi>Liberrimum agens,</hi> a most free Agent. Therefore let no man say, (no Infidell, nor any whatsoeuer,) This is not wont to be done, therefore it cannot be done. I doe not see how it may be done, therefore it is impossible: for surely he speakes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther madly then foolishly, that speaketh so; since there be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite examples, and in all ages to the contrary. Why? natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we know the Lord hath made the sands for bounds to the Sea, and hath appointed the same to checke the billowes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp;c. and yet many aliue haue seene the same to range ouer its bankes, and to carry away with it whole Townes and Shires, &amp;c. So naturally man onely hath the gift of speech (and not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his birth, but he must stay a certaine time,) but yet when it pleaseth God to shew a miracle, euen Asses haue spoken, and Oxen at the Plowe, and a child in his mothers belly.

For as in these matters, we beleeue more then we haue seene in our Country, vpon the report of them that haue made tryall thereof else-where, vpon their report, I say, by word of mouth; so why should wee not as well beleeue their writings of old, that haue registred such strange and prodigious things done before time, though wee in our time haue had no experience of the like? Thus much for answer to them that are hardly brought to beleeue miracles: and so, that a Virgin should conceiue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they could see the like done in their time. But now to answer them more familiarly. What if without any miracle at all, euen by the demonstration of naturall experiments, the same may bee made probable; will they then relent and giue ouer their obstinacy?

This therefore I say (which yet is not my saying alone, but <hi>Origens</hi> and <hi>Basils,</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> his too, for the most part:) that in certaine birds and fishes, and beasts, the Lord hath drawne, as it were, certaine pictures and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of this mysterie, to condemne the incredulity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous, and to make Faith more probable to vs. And what be those vnreasonable creatures that conceiue without the male? Truly of fowle, the Vultur, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> remembreth, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the other Authors which I named euen now.) For fish, the

Thus as the Apostle became a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Secondly, that it is such a miracle, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hough it be aboue reason, yet is it not contrary to reason, and therefore the more easie to be yeelded vnto by them, that haue any reasonablenesse or equity in them. Now let vs see which kind of Virgin the Lord made choice of, to make his Mother, for surely shee did not chuse him, but he chose her, as Christ said to his Apostles, You haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you. The Mother of our Sauiour was to be a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that is no question, and for many causes too. First, to fulfill this Prophesie, <hi>A Virgin shall conceiue, and beare Immanuel.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to fulfill these Types. The first <hi>Adam</hi> was made of the hands of God of the earth vncorupted, vndelued, vnplaned. So the second <hi>Adam</hi> Christ, was to be made by the finger of the holy Ghost, of the blood of a Virgin vnstained, and vnpolluted. This may be esteemed for one Type. Another this: The Manna, and the Water in the Wildernesse (that I meane, which issued out of the rocke,) was made immediatly by the hand of God, without the concurrence of any second cause: So the true Manna which came downe from heauen, and the true Water of life, which whosoeuer drinketh of by faith,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17966:33"/>
shall neuer perish, Christ Iesus, I meane, he was none otherwise to be conceiued, but by Gods working. Other Types might bee alleaged, as of <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod which blossom'd without ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s setting, or watring; of the Gate mentioned by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> whereat no man entred, &amp;c. But the former be sufficient, and therefore I will not trouble you with the latter. A Virgin she ought to be, we heare, for the excellent Prophesies sake, and to expresse the Types which were of it, and so no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

But what manner of Virgin was shee? the fairest, the richest, the noblest of all the daughters of the East? Alas, these things, though they be much set by in the world, yet with God they be but vile, euen as dongue. Hee is not a respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of persons, as the Apostle saith; that is, hee respecteth not these outward things in any; hee lookes not vpon the outward appearance, neither vpon the countenance, neither vpon the height of ones stature, as God saith to <hi>Samuel</hi>; but if any feare God and worke righteousnesse, he is accepted of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note>

                     <hi>shall be loued of my Father, and I will loue him, &amp;c. Iohn</hi> 14. These and the like vertues doe please the Lord a thousand times more then either beauty, or wealth, or parentage, or friends, or the like: for if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected these, he would haue gone into the Kings Court, not vnto <hi>Nazareth</hi>; to one that was sued vnto and wooed by Princes; not vnto such a one as was thought but a fit match for a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; briefly, to such a one as had Kings for her kinsmen, and Queenes for her kinswomen and her familiars, and withall great store of men-seruants, and maid-seruants, great store of gold and siluer; and not to one that was destitute and vtterly voyd of all these outwards comforts, and which could leaue her Sonne none inheritance, no, not the breadth of a foote. Yet behold here the good pleasure of the Lord, and his free election, happy vnto the blessed Virgin, most happy, but to the eyes of all the world, admirable. This poore Maid so base in her owne eyes, so little regarded in her neighbour-hood, so generally obscure to all the world, was called to that honour that neuer woman was called vnto, nor shall be. For she was made of God to kindle that Light within her, which enlightneth euery one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world; to conceiue Him in her wombe, that brought forth the whole world with a word of his mouth; to giue him nourishment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word, she was made to bring him forth, whose beginning was from euerlasting, to swaddle and bind him, who bindeth the

But because I haue other matters behind vntouched, and the comparison being so odious and sacrilegious as it is: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will forbeare by word of mouth to vtter it, and referre them that care for such matters for Doctrine, to <hi>Iacobus de Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragine,</hi> and the booke called, <hi>Sermones Discipuli:</hi> and for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to <hi>Vincentius</hi> &amp; <hi>Antoninus,</hi> whereout they may haue enough to choake them. You haue heard, (Wel-beloued) that it was of Gods mercy and fauour, and of his fauour onely, that the blessed Virgin was called to that honour and dignity, to be the Mother of her Lord and our Lord; and therefore as she most frankly and deuoutly confessed so much; so wee must beware, lest vnder the colour of honouring the Mother, (with other honour then of praise and imitation, which is due vnto her) we doe not dishonor, and so offend the Maiestie of the Sonne, who is God blessed for euer. This I haue touched the rather, because many among vs bee not as yet purged from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer superstition and Idolatries: but notwithstanding, that they haue beene earnestly laboured and exhorted, that they would returne from their vaine and thankelesse wil-worships, to serue the true and liuing God (the Creator, of whom are all things, and wee of him; the Redeemer, in whom are all things, and we in him: the holy Spirit, through whom are all things, and we through him:) yet without commandement, without praise, without example of any that were Godly, for certaine hundreds of yeeres after Christ: they will needs inuocate the blessed Virgin in their necessities &amp; troubles, nay, put their trust in her, in deifying a creature, (which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth abhorre,) and forsaking God that bought them, by a spirituall kinde of fornication, which the Scripture doth euery where detest.

The Gentiles indeed, at this time of the yeere, celebrated diuers feasts in honour of their Idols, as <hi>Saturnalia, Vacunalia, &amp;c.</hi> wherein they allowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and their seruants too, (in one of them) all kinds of loosenesse and knauery.

Verily for this cause Christ was borne, that we should be borne againe, &amp; he would be borne againe, that we might walke in newnesse of life. The conclusion is this, that

as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith. <hi>It is sufficient for vs to haue spent the time past of our life, after the lusts of the Gentiles, walking in wantonnesse, lusts, drunkennesse, &amp;c.</hi> And as it is in Exodus, <hi>This moneth shall be vnto you the beginning of moneths,</hi> so we endeauour euery one of vs, euen at this present, to cast away the workes of darkenesse, and to make an end of those things whereof we haue cause to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and hence-forth to follow righteousnesse and holinesse, and charity, and brotherly kindnesse, and loue towards them that call vpon the Lord with assurance of heart.

                  <p>Let vs now come to the Third generall part, concerning the wonderfull vniting of two natures in Christ, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and fruit we may reape thereby. [<hi>And shee shall call his name</hi> Immanuel.] That we may speake in some order, and so you remember the better what shall be spoken, this course wee will take. First, we will speake of the party that was to giue the name, because it is said here, <hi>She shall call, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, of the giuing of the name, or calling, <hi>She shall call.</hi> Thirdly, of the name it selfe, <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and what mysterie and Doctrine, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is contained therein. The two first parts I will dispatch very briefly. The last, which indeed is the very kernell, not onely of this Text, but also of the whole Scripture, I will dwell the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on, and euen spend the chiefest part of the time that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me for this taske. For the first, it may be demanded, why this honour should be atributed to the mother to giue the name to the Child, since <hi>Adam</hi> gaue names vnto all creatures, and not <hi>Eue,</hi> (if she were then made?) And when <hi>Rachel</hi> tooke vpon her to call her second sonne <hi>Ben-oni,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen 35 18.</note> her husband crossed it, saying, His name shall be called <hi>Ben-iamin.</hi> And to be short, <hi>Elizabeths</hi> naming of her sonne, was not yeelded vnto by her kinsfolke, vntill they had knowne the fathers pleasure, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for writing tables,<note place="margin">Luke 1.63.</note> and wrote, <hi>His name is Iohn.</hi> This for examples. So for precepts, you know what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith to <hi>Timothy, I permit not a woman to vsurpe authority ouer the man.</hi> And to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Timoth. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>I will that you know, that Christ is the Head of euery man, and the man is the womans head, &amp;c.</hi> The preeminence therefore being in the man, and this being accepted a matter of excellency and preeminence, to giue the name, it would seeme that too much was giuen to the blessed Virgin, to haue this gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her. I answer, That if it were a matter of preeminence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and so much to be reckoned of, as many wise gossips with vs doe make reckoning of it, striuing for the same at the Font, as they would doe for the wall, or for an vpper-seat: If (I say) the matter were of importance, and argued superiority, and so not

to be challenged by the women without the leaue of the man, &amp;c. Yet for all that, since the ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sed Virgin was conceiued with child of the holy Ghost, and of none other, and so not subiect to man for her Child, it is no maruell nor no wrong, that the whole honour (if it be any honour,) of naming the child, be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to her. For the rule that is in the Decretall is true, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken out of <hi>Beda,) Quod non est licitum in Lege, necessitas facit licitum:</hi> Necessity maketh that lawfull, which the Law dissal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, (as our Sauiour Christ himselfe defendeth <hi>Dauid,</hi> for eating the shew-bread, in the extremity of his hunger.) Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much therefore, as the blessed Virgin was mother and father too, as it were, for any earthly father that our Sauiour had, by good reason is this honour ascribed to her, being the onely earthly partie that had interest in his nature. And verily for this cause especially, doe I thinke it to be said in my Text, [<hi>She shall call,</hi>] and not, He shall be called, or the like, to shew the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culousnesse of Christs Incarnation, as being to take nature of his moth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Absalon</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a peaceable father: and was there euer any more rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious child, whom though his father would haue had to escape, yet vengeance (Gods vengeance) would not suffer him to liue? The like may be said of many others in the Scriptures. The like also of many of our English names. They be not by and by craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that be called Foxes; nor mild, that be called Doues; nor sauage, that be called Wild; nor foolish, that be called Geese; nor vnthrifts, that be called, Carelesse. There was a <hi>Carelesse,</hi> that was so carefull of the Kingdome of God, that he chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be burnt at a stake, then to make shipwracke of his faith. And so there was a Goose, (<hi>Ioh Hus</hi> by name,) that made so so cleere and sweet confession of the Truth, that neuer Swanne in the world made a sweeter. On the contrary side, there haue beene <hi>Constants,</hi> that haue beene vnconstant, and <hi>Hardings,</hi> that haue beene timorous; and <hi>Loues,</hi> that haue beene vnlouing, &amp;c. All which together doth more then proue, that though <hi>Conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niunt rebus nomina saepe suis,</hi> though mens names doe expresse their natures many times, yet it is not so alwayes: they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, being good, rather of wish, then of Prophesie, and being bad, rather vpon occasion, then for cause, and rather moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly then truly.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause man hath no power of himselfe, neither to foresee what shall betide his child, neither for wealth or woe, nor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still vertue into him, nor to reclaime him from vice. But it is not so with God; hee is of another insight in matters, and of another ability. <hi>The darknesse hideth not from him, the darknesse is as cleere as the light,</hi> Psalme, 139. He declareth the last things from the beginning, <hi>Esay</hi> 46. <hi>He saw</hi> Nathaniel <hi>vnder the Fig-tree, Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>All things are naked and bare vnto him, with whom wee haue to doe,</hi> Hebr. 4.

Well, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you haue learned two things; The one why, it is said, She, the mother shall giue the name, namely, because the blessed Babe was to haue none other parent vpon the earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by reason, shee the fittest, and onely fit to appoint the name. The other point is this, that it is nothing derogatory to the truth of Christs Deity, that it is said in my Text, <hi>Hee shall be called Immanuel,</hi> and not said, <hi>He shall be Immanuel,</hi> since with God, to call so, or to cause to be so, is all one, and so is it to be such indeed, or to be called such.</p>

Doth it not signifie, as you haue heard, euen Grammatically, God with vs? Now in that this is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered but by one name, what doth this but imply, that he is but one person? for if more persons had beene here meant, more names would haue beene here giuen. And in that he is called God, what doth this proue lesse then his Deity? And in that he is said to be with vs, that is, in our nature, what doth it proue else, but the truth of his humanity? And lastly, in that the whole name is giuen as a pledge of Gods fauour and reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards vs, what other thing but the end of all his Offices, of Kingdome, of Priesthood, of Prophesie, is expressed, and comprehended? Now therefore (Beloued,) consider with your selues, whether this Word be worth your consideration, and whether, if we stand longer vpon it, we shall either mis-spend the time, or abuse your patience? It is profitable (certes) nay, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to saluation, that you be rightly perswaded concerning the Nature and Office of our Sauiour Christ.

vs to get by heart, and haue in a readinesse such Sentences as doe summarily and briefly containe the mysterie of Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and the chiefe benefits of his Mediatorship. And such a place of Scripture is this that I haue in hand, yea such a word is this <hi>Immanuel</hi>; so rich, so effectuall, so full of Doctrine, and consolation, if you doe not so much tell the syllables, as prize the waight, and doe not so much content your selues with the outward barke and rinde, as with the inward substance and pith. Consider therefore of it againe, and againe, and marke me opening and vnfolding of it. This therefore I say, that in this word, is couched together both Christs Nature, and his Office. His Natures of two kindes, both Diuine and humane, and yet but one Person: his Offices, though diuers for functions, yet all tending to this one end, to set vs at peace with God, and to vnite him vnto vs. [<hi>he shall call his name</hi> Immanuel, or God with vs.] Now to proue vnto you (Well-beloued,) that Christ is God, very God, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes; God blessed for euer, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him; I hold it superfluous before Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, since not onely the whole Scripture being giuen by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration from God, doth auow so much; The Law, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Psalmes, the Apostles, the Euangelists, &amp;c. but also the Father himselfe, the Word himselfe, and the holy Ghost himselfe, those three in heauen: and vpon earth, the works that he did, farre exceeding the power of any creature, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the raising himselfe from death the third day, together with the bodies of many Saints that had slept longer.

So is it true of Christ and his Deity, that he hath filled all places with the glory thereof, &amp; so the same needs not to be proued or demonstrated: no more needeth his humanity, whereof besides his birth &amp; shape, &amp; grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his hunger, his thirst, his faintnesse, and wearinesse, his feare and shrinking, his stripes and buffetings, his reuilings, his cruell and bitter death, and lastly his burying, be abundant witnesses. So be there also euidences enow of the vnity of his Person in two Natures, euen in these two places of Scripture, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>The Word became flesh, and dwelt among vs, and we saw the glory of him, &amp;c.</hi> He doth not say of them, though he were both God and Man, Word and Flesh.

                     </gap>, wee had not had it safely, nor surely. He addeth a little after; It became the Mediator of God and man, by his neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to both, to bring both into amity and agreement, as well to offer vp man vnto God, as to make knowne God vnto men. Thus <hi>Ireney</hi>; of whom you haue learned a second reason, and not onely a second, but a third too. For as this is one, The Deuill must be ouercome by that nature that had offended, and so by man, &amp; the recouered state of man must not be subiect to change, (as was his estate in Paradise,) and therefore to be settled by God; so this is another, and a strong one too: He that will take vpon him to reconcile two (being so farre at oddes, as God and man were,) must participate in the nature and disposition of them both, that so he may the better haue accesse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them. Thus in effect <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> A fourth reason may bee this, drawne likewise from the Iustice of God; There must haue beene some proportion betweene the sinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the satisfaction for the said sinne. Now the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit guilt, in asmuch as it was committed against a Person of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Maiesty and glory, (for such a one is God,) therefore the satisfaction must be of infinite price and value, which could not be performed by bare man, whose worke and meriting can be but finite. As therefore he was to be man, that in that nature he might yeeld obedience and suffer: So hee was to be God, and was God indeed, that, to that nature he might yeeld efficacy, and estimation to his suffering, and to his Sacrifice. These reasons be effectuall and good. There be also other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of this mysterie, yeelded by <hi>Anselmus</hi> and others, but as it is said the 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. <hi>Of</hi> Benaiah, <hi>that he was honourable among thirty, but attained not vnto the first three.</hi> So we say of those other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that they may haue their place and their vse, but nothing comparable to the former, which we haue heard, &amp; therefore I will not trouble you with them. Let vs consider now in the last place, what vse we may make of this Doctrine, that wee haue such a Mediator, such an <hi>Immanuel.</hi> The vse thereof is manifold, but principally it setteth before vs Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> great loue towards vs; And how great was that loue? The Grecians commend <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> highly, for that he stripped himselfe of his Kingly Robes, and put on ragges, to deliuer his Country from danger. So the Romans commend <hi>Brutus (Iunius Brutus,)</hi> for concealing his prudence and worth, and taking vpon him the gesture of an Idiot, to set his Country at liberty. So our Stories talke much of a certaine Countesse (as I remember) or a Lady, that yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to great deformity and debasement, to purchase the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a certaine City. And surely all these and the like, (for many such examples may be produced) should haue wrong of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

them, if their loue toward their Country should not be acknowledged to haue beene exceeding great, and if for the same they should not be extolled and aduanced. But yet, to say the truth, what comparison betweene the loue of these persons, and of our <hi>Immanuel?</hi> For these did, euen what they did, for their Countries which had deserued well of them, and so might challenge an interest in them; but alas, what had man-kind done for Christ: or what could it doe to moue him to the least indignity for their sake? Againe, these laid downe onely such base stuffe, (in comparison) and clothing, as would haue beene fretted by the moth, or worne out in short time, &amp;c. But Christ laid aside as it were, and shifted himselfe (<gap reason="foreign">

Thus by these circumstances of the persons for whom, of the thing which, of the manner how, the Loue of Christ towards vs, is not rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically amplified, but plainely demonstrated. Now (Beloued) if Christ so loued vs, if so exceedingly, so farre beyond all vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance or conceit of man, in that hee vouchsafed to take vpon him the forme of a seruant, euen our vile and contemptible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is he not to be loued againe for the same? Is not his Word to be imbraced, his Commandements to be obserued, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to be acknowledged, his sauing health to be desired, and to be longed after? The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> is angry with the Iewes, for saying they were wise,<note place="margin">Ieremy 8.8.</note> and yet reiected the Word of God, and therefore, (saith he,) <hi>What wisedome is in them</hi>? So Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Apocal. 3. is angry (in Christs name,) with the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> for saying she was rich, and increased in goods, and had need of nothing, when as she wanted the true riches, Iesus Christ. And doe we thinke that our Sauiour will not be angry with vs, if we say we loue him, and yet will not doe as hee hath bidden vs? if (I say,) our Loue be in word onely, and not in deed, and in truth? We thinke (alas,) that we be Louers good enough, if we can say, Lord, Lord; and, Christ was a good man, and did many goodly matters for vs, &amp;c. But as the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy</hi> saith, <hi>Offer this vnto thy Prince, and see if he will accept thy person</hi>; So say I, Offer this vnto thy neighbour, and see whether he will be content with such Loue. I pray you was the Father in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,

well pleased with his Sonne, that refused to labour in his Vineyard, because he had said, <hi>I will, Father?</hi> Or doth Saint <hi>Iames</hi> allow that for charitablenesse, if one say to his brother, Depart in peace, Warme your selues, and fill your bellies, and yet giueth them not those things that are needfull to the body? Euen so the Loue toward Christ, that is in the lippes onely, and not in the heart; in profession onely, and not in practice; in a shew onely, and not in true obedience; it profiteth nothing at all, it is but as a sounding brasse, or as a tinkling Cymball. Therefore if we will not haue Christ to come against vs quickly, for receiuing so many blessings in vaine, wee are to approue both our good acceptance by thankefulnesse, and our thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse by Loue, and our Loue by obedience, and our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by auoyding that which he forbiddeth, and ensuing that which he commandeth; And then hee will say, O good seruants, nay, O good friends: (for we are his friends, if wee doe that which he commandeth, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh,) nay, behold my brethren, and my sisters; for whosoeuer shall doe the will of the heauenly Father,<note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> the same shall be Christs bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and sister, and mother. Thus much briefely, concerning some part of our duty which we owe to our <hi>Immanuel,</hi> for vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safing so to debase himselfe for vs, and to take our nature. Now as the consideration of the benefit should prouoke our dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so may it also confirme our hope in all dangers that shall beset vs, whether bodily or spirituall. Many are the dangers whereto Gods children are subiect; from professed enemies, from secret, from the ayre aboue, from the company about vs, from euill humours within vs, &amp;c. When we lye downe, wee know not whether we shall arise; when we ride forth, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether we shall come home. When we send our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren abroade, wee cannot tell whether wee shall euer see them againe; when our cause is neuer so good, wee cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will not be carryed away by false oathes, and indirect pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.

                  <p>This may suffice for the opening of the Coherence, and the plaine and naturall meaning of the verse, wherein note with me two things:

                        <item>First, a constant resolution in the Apostle, to hold on his course, <hi>(i am not ashamed, &amp;c.)</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Secondly, a ground or reason, of that his resolution, <hi>For it is the power of God, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>quamdiu in sua qualitate perdurant, &amp; solida innatant stomacho, onera sunt, &amp;c.</hi> The food or nutriment that wee haue taken, as long as it abideth in its owne quality, and floteth whole (and indigested) vpon the stomack, is a burden, but when it is altered and changed from that which it was, then it strengthneth &amp; turneth into blood: In like sort (sayes he,) let vs deale with those lessons and instructions, that we receiue for the nourishing and ripening of our wits; let vs not suffer them to continue whole and vnaltered, but let vs concoct them and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest them, otherwise they will be for our memory onely, and not for our wit. To this effect he. And to the same purpose say I, Let vs not be like those filthy belly-gods, that swallow downe their meate whole without masticating, and passe away their drinke without any concoction, as they receiued it in. This is not to feed so on the word of God, that we may grow thereby; no: but hauing once taken it into the stomack of our soule, by the vertue attractiue, we must there heate it and cherish it by the vertue retentiue: yea, as the veines of our Liuer doe not suffer the nutriment that wee haue receiued, to abide still in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17966:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but doe sucke out of the same, that which is wholesome, and conuey it to the Liuer by the veines, whereof it is turned into blood: so it becommeth a godly soule, not to suffer any part of the Word which he heareth, to passe away without fruite, but to apply the same to his heart and conscience, and to make vse of the same, both for beliefe and sanctimony. But let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our Apostle; <hi>I am not ashamed, &amp;c.</hi> If any might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be ashamed thereof, a man would thinke Saint <hi>Paul</hi> might; for had hee not beene zealous of the traditions of the Fathers? was he not a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee? did he not perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this way, euen to the death? did he not make hauocke of the Church of God? how then could he without note of inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, change his note, and sing a new song? How could he goe about to plant the Doctrine, which before he pluckt vp? preach the faith which before he destroyed? Indeed if hee had stood vpon the day of man, or vpon mans iudgement, if he had stood vpon his credit in the world, his reputation with his friends, his rising and aduancement in dignity, his pleasure, his profit: he might in some sort haue smote vpon his thigh, and couered his face for sorrow and shame, that by giuing his name to the Gospell, he had stript himselfe of all worldly comforts and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages. But now Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cared not for any of these things, neither was his life deare vnto him, so that hee might fulfill his course. He was carefull to please him that had chosen him to be a Souldier, chosen him to his calling; and for other respects, he stood not vpon them, yea, the things that might haue beene vantage to him, he counted them losse for Christs sake, yea, he iudged them to be dung, that he might winne Christ. This was the Apostles resolution: and was not the same a godly one, and a wise, and to be imitated by vs all? There are, and euer haue beene some, who into what perswasion soeuer, <hi>Quasi tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestate delati sunt,</hi> they haue beene carryed by whatsoeuer wind of vanity or superstition of their friends, or subtlety of sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the same they thinke themselues bound to retaine and maintaine, euen for constancy sake.

Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was at the first of opinion, that it was vnlawfull for a lewe, to keepe company, or come to one of another Nation. So <hi>Act.</hi> 15.<note place="margin">Act. 10. Act. 15.</note> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that were of the Sect of the Pharises, <hi>(Nazarites,)</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, thought, and taught, that we must be circumcised, and keepe the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> euen the Ceremoniall Law, or else we cannot be saued. But afterward St. <hi>Peter</hi> was let to vnderstand, (and so were those beleeuing Pharises too,) that Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is nothing, and vncircumcision nothing, but Christ is all in all; and as many as be in Christ, are deliuered from the curse of the Law, and from the bondage also. So Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whilest he was in Iewishnesse, was most zealous of the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Fathers, and a most bitter enemy to the Gospell; who but he? but after it pleased God, (who separated him from his mothers wombe, and called him by his grace,) to reueile his Sonne vnto him, and to make knowne to him the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell, whereby hee might saue himselfe, and those that heard him; did he once communicate with flesh and blood? or did he asmuch as deliberate, whether a cancred and inueterate error were to be forsaken and changed, for a new and sauing truth? No, no: but presently he ioyned himselfe to the true Church, howsoeuer he had scorned, nay, detested it, and raged against it before; and chose rather to be a dore-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Gods house, then to be a great Rabby in the Synagogue of mis-beliefe. Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was not ashamed of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, for all the nouelty thereof, (as the world counted nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.) No more let any of vs be at this day for the like imputation, <hi>Where was the Gospell before</hi> Luther, <hi>who liued within these hundred yeeres?</hi> or before the Bohemians, (of whom <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Adde these times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and then what great prescription, not onely antiquity, can our aduersaries bragge of? It is certaine, that as God neuer left himselfe without witnesses vnder the Law, no more did hee

And haue we then any cause to be ashamed of the Gospell, which, howsoeuer it hath beene troden downe, yet it was not so in the best times, &amp; yet neuer so, but that God left himselfe still a remnant, that could not be brought to bowe the knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> or to worship the Beast? Now, as we are not to be ashamed of it, neither for the falsely so called newnesse, nor for that some of our selues were peraduenture for a great while of another perswasion: so ought we not chiefely for the holines, purenesse, and soundnesse thereof. The Pharises, and as many as were carnally-minded, would haue Christ to restore the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Kingdome to <hi>Israel,</hi> and to free them from the yoke of the Romanes: but now the Gospell assureth vs, that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vs from the power of darkenesse, and translated vs into the Kingdome of his deare Sonne, in whom wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in his blood, euen the forgiuenesse of sinnes. And whether is more spirituall? The carnally-minded Iewes would haue Ierusalem onely to be the place, where men ought to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, &amp; the Tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> onely to be the Sacrificers, and the flesh of Bulls, and Goates, and Lambes, and Rammes to be the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Sacrifices: But now the Gospell teacheth vs, that not in Ierusalem, nor in the Mountaine, but the true worshippers worship God in sincerity and truth, and that we are all become a Royall Priest-hood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp spirituall Sacrifices, (the Sacrifice of righteousnesse, the Sacrifice of a contrite heart, the Sacrifice of thankesgiuing, the Sacrifice of Almes,) acceptable to God in Iesus Christ.

                     </gap>, as if the quality inherent in vs could merit any thing in the matter of our Iustification, without res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect vnto Christ, but excludeth that together, with all worth and workes of ours. Not of workes, saith the Apostle, and rendreth the reason, <hi>lest any man should boast</hi>; signifying, that because God would barre all flesh from glorying in his sight, &amp; haue all the glory himselfe therefore; therefore that works are wholy excluded from being causes or instruments of our sauing. But there must be an end of the former part of our discourse, except we will haue the later altogether vntouched. Come we therefore to the reason or ground of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> resolution. [<hi>For it is the power of God to saluation, to euery one that beleeueth, &amp;c.</hi>] Euery word of this reasonisa reason; how strong therfore is the reason? I cannot be ashamed, saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> of power, specially of such power as is Diuine, specially of such Diuine power as saueth, specially of such that saueth not him that meriteth, but him that beleeueth, specially, such as saueth not two or three beleeuers, but euery one without exception. And such a thing is the Gospell, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot be ashamed of it. The major of whose Argument we will first consider of briefely; and then wee may insist vpon the minor more at large. <hi>Phocion,</hi> that worthy Athenian, being sent and employed by <hi>Chabrias,</hi> (then in the chiefest office) to gather the tribute of the Ilanders, and with twenty ships; made answer: That if he were sent to fight, the Nauy was too small; if to friends and companions, in waste; it was too great, one ship might serue the turne. The like is written of <hi>Tigranes</hi> King of Armenia, that when he espyed the Romane Army containing not aboue eluen thousand of horse and foote, his being of aboue 200000. he despised them in his heart, saying, If they come as Embassadours, they are too many; if as Soldiers, too few. So in the Booke of God, namely, 1. Reg. 20. When <hi>Benhadad,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Reg. 4.</note> that had so great an Army, that he vanted, saying, <hi>The gods doe so and so vnto me, if the dust of Samaria be enough to all the people that follow me, for euery man an handfull</hi>; and was otherwise, so puissant, that thirty two Kings did helpe him; When he, (I say) sawe the seruants of the Princes, as it were a forlorne Company embatteld against him, Whether they be come out for peace, take them aliue, or whether they be come out to fight, to take them aliue. So also Numb. 13.<note place="margin">Numb. 13.</note> When the Spies that were sent out to search the Land of promise, made report of it, that all the people that they sawe there, were men of great stature, euen Gyants, the sonnes of <hi>Anak,</hi> and that themselues were in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison to them, but as Grassehoppers, the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17966:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lifted vp their voyce, and cryed, and wept all the night, they were so much abashed at the report of their power. By which examples, (that I produce no more,) you may see, that as opinion of power and strength maketh the one part bold and couragious, so feeblenesse, and weakenesse dismayeth and confoundeth the other. <hi>Thou art not able to goe and fight with yonder Philistine,</hi> (said <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.) <hi>For thou art a boy, and he is a man of warre from his youth.</hi> So, lest any should say to our Apostle, You threaten to come to the Romanes, —<hi>Rerum Dominos gentemque togatam,</hi> and to bring your Gospell with you. Alas, what can you doe? what can it doe? Your bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is but weake, your speech rude, your words but wind, nay distastefull, and vnwelcome to all the world. Is it not euery where spoken against? Doth any of the Rulers, Consuls, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, Pretors, &amp;c. beleeue on Christ, but onely a few of the ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality, which know not the Law? Lest any, I say, should say so, the Apostle answereth for himselfe, that he knoweth what he doth, the Word that hee bringeth, is not his owne, but His that sent him: the Gospell that he preacheth, is not weake, but mighty in operation, able to cast downe strong holds, and whatsoeuer opposeth it selfe to it: It is power, and therefore what can it not doe? Yea, it is the power of God, that is, such a powerfull Instrument, as whereto God promiseth a blessing, and force for euer, therefore shall it stand out to the end. What if the Romanes be mighty? Yet he that dwelleth in the heauens, is mightier. What if he be a strong man armed, that keepeth the house? Yet when a stronger then he commeth, he will take away his armour wherein he trusted, and rifle him. If God be on our side,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.14.</note> if his presence goe with vs, as <hi>Moses</hi> said, we shall find all things worke for the best, to bring men to faith, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to Saluation. <hi>Therefore</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul, In nothing doe I feare mine enemies, neither am I ashamed or weary of the Gospell, it will haue the preeminence, it will preuaile in the end, maugre all aduerse power and policy.</hi> We see therefore, that the first part, or major of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> reason is firme, namely, that wee are not to bee ashamed of that which is powerfull. Now for the <hi>Minor</hi> or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Argument, namely, that the Gospell is the power of God. That, that I say, is no lesse cleere, it will many wayes appeare. First <hi>à pronunciatis.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> that could not lie, hauing the seale of his Apostleship, and of infallible truth from the holy Ghost, sayes it is so in my Text, therefore it is so, euen a Diuine power and powerfull Instrument, able to conuert soules to God. Secondly, <hi>à genere</hi>: The whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration from God,<note place="margin">2.

Which cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17966:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the power and Word of the Lord, which (without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) is liuely and sharper then a two-edged sword. Then the Gospell which is a part of the Word of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> that must be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Thirdly, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> The Law that was giuen by <hi>Moses,</hi> and written in tables of stone, that was powerfull, it gaue light to the blind, wisedome to the simple, conuerted the soule, &amp;c. Psal. 19. Therefore the Gospell, which was deliuered by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ, and had more precious promises, and a greater largesse of the holy Spirit, that must needs be powerfull. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>ab exemplo.</hi> Did not all wonder at the gracious words that proceeded out of our Sauiours mouth, when he interpreted to them the Gospell of the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi>? (for euen before the Apostle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were borne, the Gospell was, it was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.)

Cor. 14? Lastly, <hi>Ab effectis,</hi> more plainely. <hi>As the lightning commeth out of theEast, &amp; shineth to the West, Math.</hi> 24. <hi>And as the Sunnes going forth is from the end of heauen, and his compasse vnto the end of the same, and none hid from the heate thereof,</hi> Psal. 19. So the efficacy and working of the Gospell was so sudden, and so wonderfull, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could say for his part only, that from Ierusalem round about vnto Illyricum, he caused to abound the Gospell of Christ, Rom. 15. And for his time, that the Gospell was come vnto all the world, and was fruitfull, euen as it was among them.

Now I aske (Brethren,) is God a God of the Iewes onely, and not of the Gentiles also? And he that was mighty through <hi>Peter,</hi> may not he be mighty through <hi>Paul?</hi> May not he giue a blessing to the Gospell preached now, as well as he did in former times? Truly, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>How knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt saue thy wife? and how knowest thou, O woman, whether thou shalt saue thy husband</hi>? Nay, as <hi>Dauid</hi> said to <hi>Saul, I haue slaine a Lyon, and a Beare already, and truly, this vncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them.</hi> So we may perswade our selues probably, nay, be resolued and out of doubt, that our labour shall not be in vaine in the Lord.

No, he is debtor to none, and therefore will be brought into subiection to none. Therefore let no man so thinke of the power of the Gospell, as that he be wanting to himselfe, and looke for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary illuminations and incitements, and thinke it is no matter how seldome he heareth it, but rather let him thus thinke of it, that it is a power perswasiue, not compulsiue, alluring, not enforcing, and all that it doth, it doth by the power of Gods Spirit, which must be begged of the Father, and by most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent prayer, and well vsed also, that it be not grieued; and foste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it be not quenched.

And consequently be saued; Therefore, the Gospell, (that is, the Doctrine of our Saluation by Christ,) should be our first study, and our last, our plaine-song, and our discant, it should be all in all vnto vs. If the vessell be saued, though the wares be spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Sea-water, or cast ouer ship-boord, yet we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue vnto the hauen, and there be in safety: So if the field bee gotten by vs, as <hi>Alexander</hi> told <hi>Parmenio,</hi> our baggage &amp; horses will be recouered againe with aduantage. So if a tree be sound at the root, there is hope, that it will sprout forth, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it should be lopped and shred neuer so much; but now if it be rotten at the root, then fare it well. In like maner if the soule be safe, if it liue by faith in the Sonne of God, if it fight the good fight of faith, and winne the field, all other losses are not to be reckoned of; wee are more then gainers, more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours; but if the soule perish, (and it will perish, except it be fed with the Word of the Gospell, and it will make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, if Christ sit not at the Sterne, and it will be ouercome in the day of battell, if Christ be not his Captaine, his Sauiour, his deliuerer,) then all the world is gone with vs, it had beene good for vs if we had neuer beene borne.

Therefore (Beloued) accept this, the greatest fauour that God euer vouchsafed you, that he hath reuealed his Sonne vnto you in the Gospell, whereby you may learne to liue and beleeue in him, and be saued by him, euen saued perfectly, not onely directed, (as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> taught,) not onely holpen, as the Papists. The Gospell is the power of God vnto Saluation, and no lesse: but now, whom doth it saue, or how doth it saue? not by being tyed about the necke, or carryed in the bosome for an <gap reason="foreign">

If thou couldest beleeue, all things are possible to the beleeuer, saith Christ. The Word did not profit some, because they did not mingle it with faith, saith the Apostle. Indeed the Gospell consisteth not in sound, but in sense, not in hearing, but in beleeuing. He that beleeueth in the Sonne, hath euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

life: he that obeyeth not the Sonne, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. Whereby we see, that though faith be a free assent and perswasion; assent to the truth of God, perswasion of his goodnesse toward vs in his Sonne: yet for all that, we are not free, nor at liberty, whether wee will beleeue, or no; no, for this is the worke of God, (which he especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,) that we beleeue on him whom he hath sent; &amp; except you beleeue, surely you shall not be established; and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth not, is condemned already, because hee beleeueth not in the Name of the onely-begotten Sonne of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wee must not forget, that the Apostle speaketh here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely, and precisely, that the Gospell saueth such as beleeue; them, and none other. For what if a man reuerence the vtter side of the Bible, as if he were to handle a heauenly thing, and care not for the contents thereof, (which fault <hi>Chrysostome</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in some,) or doe put it to their head, for the head-ake,<note place="margin">

No, no, as it maketh no matter how neere we come to God with our lippes, if our hearts be farre off, and as when the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude thronged vpon our Sauiour, yet one onely, (a woman that had faith) touched him; and as the most blessed Virgin her selfe was not so blessed for bearing Christ in her wombe, as for beleeuing on him, as Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> speaketh.<note place="margin">

Neither is Gods mercy in the Gospell the lesse free, because it requireth the duty of faith, (to come now to the third point of my amplification,) for who will except against a mans charitablenesse, because he saith to the poore man that craueth an almes, Reach thy hand, or hold open thy lap? Or who wil deny that God gaue the Israelites victory against the Medianites, because they brought Pitchers into the field, and light in the Pitchers? Or that God did not feed them with bread from heauen, and water out of the rocke, for that they gathered the one, and brought vessels, (at the least their mouthes,) to receiue the other? It is one thing to be the true cause of a thing, the conduit-pipe, or fountaine, another thing to bring a bucket, nay, not so much as that, but to bring

But now when he saith vnto vs, Beleeue onely, and the Lord will doe great things for thy soule: trust perfectly in the grace of God, that is brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee in the Gospell, and thou shalt become a child of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> an heire of God, and fellow heire with Christ, euen a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of Saluation; who can impeach or blemish Gods bounty and liberality, with the least note of mercinarinesse? for he that saith, Beleeue the Gospell, and it will saue thee, seemeth to say in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no more then this, <hi>He that hath an eare to heare, let him heare,</hi> as it is in the Gospell; or <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it</hi>; as it is in the Psalme; or <hi>Wash thy selfe in Iordan and be cleane,</hi> as it is in the holy Story. Now as this maketh much against our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries that are merit-mongers: So it maketh nothing at all for Gospellers, that turne the grace of God into wantonnesse, and thinke, that because they pretend a faith, that they may doe all things, and be excused for all things. This therefore shall be the twofold vse of this Circumstance, of the quality that ought to be in the persons to be saued by the Gospell, both for confutation, that the Aduersaries of our free iustification, by Christ preached in the Gospell, be proued to be false Teachers, deceitfull worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c. And for reprehension, that if any man thinkes he may vse the cloake of faith, for a colour of vnrighteousnesse, that he be vnmasked.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Prophet hauing declared in the foure verses immediatly going before my Text, what griefe King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and his faithfull subiects had suffered, by hearing what Gods enemies had done to their brethren, those of the ten Tribes, in destroying their Country, burning their Cities, killing a great number of them, &amp; carrying away the remnant of them into captiuity; &amp; all this, because oftheir wickednes &amp; rebellion against God. Now here at the 13. verse, he beginneth to shew what, and how much they suffered in themselues; And what was that? Surely they were not onely afflicted with present euils, as of the spoiling and sacking of most of their Townes, of the exhausting of their Treasures, both prophane and sacred, and with blasphemous reuilings of them and of the true God, whom they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, &amp;c. but also with feare of future euils, as namely, that the mother-Citie it selfe, the glory of that Kingdome, Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17966:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should be taken, their Temple destroyed, their King and Nobles led away; their young men slaine with the sword, their women abused, &amp;c. And which did most of all vexe the soule of the righteous, that they that were so sawcy with God, as to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him before the victory, would, if they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, be hardned in their villanies, and say of a truth, that the Iewes worshipped a thing of nought. This is the summe of the euils mentioned in this Chapter, and in part of the next; partly suffered indeed of the faithfull, partly suffered in feare, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Now what mercy the Lord shewed them in the end, and what confusion he brought vpon their enemies, the same is described towards the later end of the Chapter following. Let vs now take the Story in order as it lyeth; hauing thus before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand pointed at the generall heads. The first thing that I note vnto you, is, The continuance and progresse of troubles to the Church, noted in this word, [<hi>Moreouer.</hi>] Good Lord, might one say, what a world is this? one depth calleth on another, one misery in the necke of another; <hi>Finis alterius mali, gradus est futuri,</hi> The end of one mischiefe is a step to another, as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith;<note place="margin">

Surely not of slight matters, which might be borne with, but of things which immediatly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the glory of God: he was to purge out Idolatry, which had taken deepe roote in the time of his wicked father, and to settle an order for the right seruice of God, which for a long time was decayed. This, and more hee was to doe, which purchased to him great charges, great jarres, and great contradiction. Now he was no sooner out of this, but his neighbours, nay his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren according to the flesh, the Israelites, are inuaded by the common enemie. These hee dare not helpe, lest hee should bring present mischiefe vpon himselfe. Againe, he must see them perish before his eyes, though hee knew that his owne day was comming, and after that the enemy had done with them, then he would haue a saying to him. This was bitter, euen as bitter as death, but yet for all this, the wrath of the Lord is not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away, but his iealousie burneth like fire, and catcheth hold vpon the Iewes themselues.

But what followed within a while? The Lord stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp another enemy against them, from out their bowels, as it were, which was hunger, and this pinched them sorer, they thought, then the Egyptian. But was this the last? No, after the hunger, came thirst, and this made them to murmure as much as the former, and after the thirst, came fiery Serpents, and fire, and Pestilence, and Amalekites, and Madianites, and what not? Thus hath it beene with the Church, not onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, but also vnder Christ; as it might be easily decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you.

No, for then Lachish being a City of Iudah had beene taken, which yet he was in besieging himselfe; yea, and then too Hierusalem had beene taken before it was besieged by them whom he sent. But by <hi>All,</hi> is meant in this place, a great many, as it is also in diuers other places of the Scripture. All the Cattell of Egypt dyed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. and yet <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had a great number of horses to chase the Children of Israel with. So, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. <hi>He to whom thou bearest witnesse, behold, he baptizeth, and all men come vnto him.

I will spend no more time in opening the litterall sense. For the morall sense, or that which may be picked out for our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, thus we may profit by the example of <hi>Sennacherib.</hi>

                  <p>First, he and his Souldiers may teach vs, what a dangerous thing it is for any people to entertaine strangers into their Land, to helpe them against their enemies, and to fight their battels for them. They that doe so, commonly pull more vpon them with one hand, then they can put off with both. They may come in readily for your pleasure, but they will not goe forth so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The men of Iudah in <hi>Ahaz</hi> his time, thought they had dealt politickly, to get the Assyrians to take their part against the Israelites, and those others that fought against them; but what sayes the Oracle of God, 2. Chron. 28. verse 20. Tiglath Pilnesser, <hi>King of Ashur, came vnto</hi> Ahaz, <hi>but he troubled him, and did not strengthen him, yea, though</hi> Ahaz <hi>gaue him great gifts, yet it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him not.</hi> Why, might one say, <hi>Tiglath Pilnesser</hi> inuaded the enemies of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> both them of Israel, and them of Aram, and made a great slaughter of their people, and a great spoile of their Countries; therefore it would seeme that hee strengthned him greatly, in thus reuenging him of his enemies, and weakening of their forces. Thus indeed it would seeme at the first blush, and to a simple man, but the Prophet, as a man of another kind of reach, had a respect vnto the end, and to the mischiefe that came thereby. For the Assyrians tasting by this meanes the goodnesse of the Land, and the weakenesse of the people,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17966:57"/>
thought both that the Countrey was too good a Countrey for circumcised ones, and the people vnworthy to enioy their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and therefore sought by all meanes, &amp; from time to time, to bring them vnder their yoke. Thus profitable was <hi>Ahaz</hi> to his Countrey, by hyring of the Assyrians. And surely in like sort haue they sped, and in like sort haue they benefited their Countrey, whosoeuer haue sought in any age, either to defend themselues, or to reuenge themselues by strange forces. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether it be worth while to bring forth examples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be so common, as that which is most common.<note place="margin">

After that the Saxons had serued the Britans turne a while, they serued their owne turne of the Britans themselues. The Soldan of Persia hyred the Turkes against the Caliph of Babylon: what became of it? Well, by their meanes the Caliph is ouercome: but is the Soldan euer a whit the neere? No, out of the frying-pan, he fell into the fire, and was ouercome by those Turks himselfe, whom he had hyred. So who made them Lords of Constantinople? Did not the Emperour of Constantinople himselfe, who hyred them against the Bulgarians? Who of Hungary, in our owne time? Did not <hi>Iohn</hi> the Vayuod of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluania, who laboured them against the Austrians? Let vs passe to another Countrey. It was thought high policy, forsooth, by certaine of the Romane Emperours, to entertaine the Gothes in seruice, that so they might be secured from other Barbarians: but were the Gothes content to become stipendaries? No, they picked a quarrell to sacke Rome it selfe, and ceased not till they became Lords of the greatest part of Italy. Well, the Gothes are insolent, and cannot be endured: therefore the Longobards must be sent for: but did the Longobards remaine faithfull to them? No: after they had helped them to beate the Gothes, they turned them also out of their possessions, &amp; called the Land by their owne name: So the Longobards also they became Tyrants, as it was conceiued, and therefore the French must be sent for; but were they set at full liberty by them? No; they changed onely their Lord, they were not deliuered from a Lord; nay, in stead of one Lord, they had two: the Emperour, and the Pope; the one ouer their heads, the other at their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes. Should I runne this course, and tell you how the French were serued by the Normans; the Spaniards, by the Moores; the Moores or Africans, by the Arabians, &amp;c. I might hold you too long. In a word, the danger of strangers is confessed by all, whom folly or priuate respects hath not blinded. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if either of these be in a man, then the case is altered.

But tell me, how you will like of it, when the day of paiment commeth? then you will cry out vpon the Vsurer as fast, and complaine, that you were eaten vp of him. So is euery Nation that seeketh not to God for helpe, nor stirreth vp it selfe to valiantnesse, nor is desirous to be trained in feates of warre, but trust vnto strangers. They that are gotten for money, will also forsake you for money; and when you shall haue most need of them, then they will call for their pay, or impudently bid you adieu. I could tell you of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Princes, that by these meanes haue beene deceiued and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, euen at the instant when they were to ioyne battell with their enemies; But let vs returne to the stranger <hi>Sennacherib</hi> and the Assyrians.

Let this be the first thing that we note in the person of <hi>Sennacherib.</hi> The second thing shall be his ambitious couetousnesse. My Text saith, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib <hi>King of Ashur, came vp against all the strong Cities of Iudah and tooke them.</hi> Why, might one say, did his Ancestors leaue him nothing to doe at home, that he must find himselfe some worke abroad?

It is true, that <hi>Henry</hi> the last French King, hauing but a couple of Crownes of Polony, and France; the one in title, the other in hand, seemed to haue beene fully content with them, and therefore he gaue for his Symboll of Posie, <hi>Manet vltima coelo,</hi> the last remaineth in heauen. Howbeit if you marke the Posie a little better, you will confesse, that it containeth not that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty or contentednesse indeed, that it promiseth at the first sight, or beareth shew of.

                     </gap>eir enemies warning, what they should trust to. Thus whilest there was either loue of fame, or feare of shame, or sparke of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in mens hearts, they denounced warres, before they waged Warre, and if there had beene any friendship betweene the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they solemnly renounced the same. But now in this weake old age of the world, where the Lyons skin will not reach, there
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17966:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they itch it with the Fox skin, and nothing seemeth vnhonest that will serue their turne; nay, as children are deceiued with huckle-bones, or with Puppets, so many seeke to circumuent Princes vnder pretences. This is the new Diuinity that our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies haue learned, and this they and we may thanke the Iesuits and the Councell of Trent for: the Councell of Trent, as being the broachers; the Iesuits, as the practizers. The Councell of Trent, they defined, that whosoeuer would not receiue their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, had forfeited their Kingdomes, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be inuaded by whomsoeuer. The Iesuits, they grin like a Dogge, and goe about the Citie, as it is in the Psalme, nay, like the Enemy of mankind, mentioned in the 1. of <hi>Iob,</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe the earth round about,<note place="margin">Iob 1.</note> and buzze into mens eares, that keeping of faith out of the Church of Rome, is not faithfulnesse, but perfidiousnesse. Thus they. Howbeit, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> said of one that excused his running away,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tertull.</hi>
                     </note> by <hi>Vir fugiens iterum pugnabit,</hi> one said so (I grant, saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) but he was a cowardly runne-away himselfe. So may it be said truly, that he that would not haue faith or promise to be kept to a man of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion, is a man void of faith himselfe. For if it be not necessary to keepe our promise, (made in the name of God, and by swearing by him,) then it is not lawfull to make any such promise. Otherwise, in that we sweare, we shew our selues to be afraid of him to whom we sweare, that is of man; but in violating the same oath, we shew our selues not to be afraid of Him by whom we sweare, that is, God himselfe. This by the way to their Doctrine and practice, who are moued with no conscience to inuade them, whom they hold to be out of their faith, not onely without defiance sending, but euen against a League solemnly made. And let so much be noted from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample &amp; person of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> the Inuader. First, what a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing it is to drawe strangers into a Land: Then, how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable a thing Ambition is. Lastly, what a violent thing it is. Now, let vs come to the person that was inuaded, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by name, and see how wee may profit by him. [<hi>In the foureteenth yeere of</hi> Hezekiah.] So my Text. This <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (wel-beloued) was not an ordinary man, but comparable to any of the Kings of Iudah that were before him, or after him. If Piety be to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, He did vprightly in the sight of the Lord, according to all that <hi>Dauid</hi> his father had done, verse 3. If Zeale, He tooke away the high places, and brake the Images, and cut downe the groues, &amp;c. verse 4. If Faith and assurance, He trusted in the Lord God of Israel, and was peerelesse in that respect, verse 5. Further, if Constancy and perseuerance, He claue to the Lord, and departed not from him, &amp;c. verse 6. Finally, if valiant acts, and good successe in warre; The Lord was with him in all that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17966:60"/>
he tooke in hand, and he got a famous victory of the Philistims his bordering enemies, verse 7, 8. This manner of Prince was <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> so religious, so zealous, so faithfull, so vertuous, so constant, so valiant, so successefull. And who would haue thought, that he being so precious in Gods eyes, should haue beene so much honoured in the world, and hauing deserued so well of his owne subiects, should for the same haue beene no lesse beloued and regarded of his neighbour Princes? Indeed it pleaseth God many times to reward vertue, and specially piety, with such reuerence from men, that either for feare or for loue, they are suffered to enioy their owne quietly. So <hi>Salomon</hi> had peace forty yeeres together almost round about him on euery side, and Iudah and Israel dwelt without feare, euery man vnder his Vine, and vnder his Fig-tree, all the dayes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1. Reg. 4. So <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of the Philistims,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 4.</note> came to <hi>Isaak</hi> a priuate man &amp; a stranger, &amp; desired to enter into a League with him, Gen. 26.<note place="margin">Genes. 26.</note> We saw certainely (saith he) that the Lord was with thee, and we thought thus, Let there be now an oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs, thou shalt doe vs no hurt, as we haue not touched thee, &amp;c. So <hi>Iacob,</hi> though he had greatly offended <hi>Laban</hi> his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and <hi>Esau</hi> his brother, yet the Lord so wrought for him, by mollifying the hearts of the other, that they durst not, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe him hurt, but not so much as speake a rough word vnto him. This is that, that <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in the Prouerbes,<note place="margin">Prouerbs 16.</note>

As the example of <hi>Constantine</hi> (at the first stablishing of the Gospell,) proueth; To whom the King of Persia, nay, most of the barbarous Kings of those dayes, (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> shewth) sent presents, and desired his friendship.

It is very true therefore, that as God hath made many hills so high, that there is no wind to be felt vpon the top of them; and some stones so hard, (as the Adamant,) that they will not be broken with any hammer; and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17966:61"/>
some trees also so fat, and so oyly (as the Bay-tree,) that the Winter stormes haue little power on them, though they make the most trees besides to let fall their leaues, So there haue beene some in the world so graced, and priuiledged by God, that euen those things which doe vsually strike thorow other men, (Enuy and Malice, I meane,) haue had no power to enter vpon them at all. They haue beene placed by God <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, out of gunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot vnder his owne wings, as it were, and vnder his feathers, they haue not beene confounded, neither of the Pestilence that walketh in the darkenesse, (this is secret Enuy,) neither of the Plague that destroyeth at noone-day, this is open and professed Malice. Lo thus haue some beene blessed, that feared the Lord, not onely they had fauour with their owne people, but also they haue beene awed of their very enemies. Some haue beene so blessed, some few — <hi>pauci quos aequus amauit</hi> Iupiter, <hi>atque ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens euexit ad aether a virtus,</hi> sayes the Poet. Some few that haue beene extraordinarily tendered by God, and which haue beene mirrors of all vertue and goodnesse. Howbeit, that you may not thinke the worse of our <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> nor derogate from the perfection of his vertues hereby, for that he was inuaded by <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi> and not suffered to liue in peace: You are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that as in naturall and artificiall workings, it is not enough, that the Agent haue vertue and vigor in it, but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient also, or that which it should worke vpon, must be rightly disposed and capable of the working: as for example: How long would it be before you could mould Iron, or make mortar of sand, or make a piece of dadocke-wood to flame, &amp;c? So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for the price and estimation of vertue, it is not enough, that there be excellency in the doer, but there must be some inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and affection to it in the beholder or witnesse. In the great battell that was fought betweene the Romans and the Parthians, wherein there were so many thousands of the Romanes so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably slaine, there were twenty Romane Souldiers, (as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> writeth) that fought so valiantly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
                     </note> and laid about them so manfully, that their enemies that had beene able to hacke them in pieces, suffered them to escape thorow the middest of them. How so? The Parthians were valiant men themselues, and therefore, no maruell if they honoured valour in other men. On the contrary side, <hi>Proculus,</hi> a goodly tall man, that had gotten the victory of as many as encountred him, striking them downe one after another, <hi>Caligula</hi> did not suffer to escape aliue, but commanded him to be slaine. Why so? <hi>Caligula</hi> was a cowardly wretch himselfe, and therefore enuyed the opinion, and marke of man-hood in whomsoeuer it was eminent. So <hi>Xenocrates</hi> (as the same <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth in the life of <hi>Phocion,</hi>) was of that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend estimation and credit,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
                     </note> for his wonderfull grauity, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17966:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they who knew him, thought that it was impossible for any to be so carryed away of his passions, but euen by the sight of him, he should find an alteration in his mind, yea, and shew some blushing too in his countenance. This impression he wrought in others, but yet when he came to <hi>Antipater,</hi> with other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, to waigh him to equity and clemency, he could not get as much as a good morrow from him, or that he should take him by the hand. Why so? <hi>Antipater</hi> was a wicked man, the Story sayes, and being not vertuous himselfe, he had not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to know vertue in others. Hereupon it is found true, that was said of the ancient Philosopher, that honor is a matter of courtesie, and rather in <hi>honorante,</hi> then in <hi>honorato</hi>; And which a learned man of late dayes hath written, <hi>Quidam laudem meren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quidam habent,</hi> as though it were not alwayes giuen to whom it is due, but others that doe not deserue it, will goe away with it sometimes. You see therefore that it is not a certaine rule to iudge of mens worth by their renown. For although Wisedome, and so Vertue and Piety, be iustified of her children, that is, of them that be wise, vertuous, and godly; yet for all that, with them that are wicked, it is not of that price, but contrariwise despised, scorned, abhorred. No maruell then, if <hi>Hezechiah</hi> were not esteemed of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> according to his vertuous acts, all the while <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was so bad a man as he was; first, an Idolater, then proud, then couetous, then crafty, then puffed vp with successe of his warres else-where, &amp;c. For the contrary were rather to be maruelled at, if darknesse could abide light, sowre sweet, or euill good. The same is to be said to those that are tempted thus, to thinke in their hearts, Why, if our Prince were so peerelesse a Lady as we make her, so godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so wise, so iust, so clement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> also, if the reformation which she hath wrought, were according to the Word of God, as it is pretended, then surely the Lord would haue caused the feare of her to be vpon all the Nations round about vs, and no man should be so hardy or so malicious as to assaile vs all the time of her gouernment. Answer as the truth is, &amp; as hath beene partly shewed already, that God sometimes for the comfort of his weake ones, and that his bounty may be the more sensibly felt, euen with carnall hands, doth grant peace and quietnesse to his Church, and restraine the hearts of Tyrants, so that they haue neither power nor heart to doe any euill to his Sanctuary. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, this commeth by priuiledge, and is not ordinary. Againe, for some certaine time it is granted, but not for ones life. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> indeed had peace round about for the greatest part of his raigne: but had <hi>Dauid</hi> likewise? No, he had both his hands full all the dayes of his life; and yet who comparable to <hi>Dauid?</hi> So <hi>Hezechiah</hi> a great part of his raigne was free from any inuasion
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17966:62"/>
by the enemy, and though his neighbours Lands were on a fire, yet in his owne he felt no losse: but did he remaine in that secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? No: about the middest of his raigne, he was brought in ieopardy of his Estate by the Assyrians, who could not keepe in any longer the malice that boyled in their brests. But some man will say, Yet by your leaue, <hi>Hezechiah</hi> was to blame, so to prouoke <hi>Sennacherib</hi> as he did, a Prince of farre greater puissance and strength then himselfe; for did he not deny him his tribute, and so bring vpon himselfe and his people an vnnecessary warre? Indeed if it were so, <hi>Hezechiah</hi> was much to blame, and <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi> was before him, not onely for strength of Forces, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for goodnesse of cause, and therefore a very euill match made. But (wel-beloued,) iudge nothing before the time, but iudge with righteous iudgement, and as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, Psalme 40. so say I,<note place="margin">Psalm. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed is he that iudgeth wisely of the poore or afflicted, whom God hath visited.</hi> In the 53. of <hi>Esay,</hi> the godly confesse their fault, for iudging Christ to haue beene plagued and smitten of God for his owne sinnes.<note place="margin">Esay 53.</note> And in the 9. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Apostles are told their fault, for that they could no sooner see a blind man (one that was borne blind,) but they must presently aske, <hi>Master, who did sinne, this man, or his parents, that he was borne blind?</hi> The like reproch doth belong vnto vs, if we take the like course of mis-iudging, either of <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> or of them that be in like case with <hi>Hezechiah. Hezechiah</hi> did not pay him tribute. Why? Because he did owe him none; for if he had owed any, then he had sinned in not rendring it; according to that of the Apostle, Rom. 13. <hi>Giue to all men their duty, Tribute to whom Tribute, Custome, to whom yee owe Custome.</hi> Now that he did not sinne therein, may appeare, not onely by the silence of the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> who in all likely-hood, would haue perswaded him to haue submitted himselfe to the King of Ashur, as well as <hi>Ieremy</hi> afterward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded <hi>Sedechia,</hi> to yeeld to the King of Babylon; but also by the very order of the Text, here in this 18. Chap. of the second of Kings: For if you looke vpon the 7. verse of that Chap. there you shall see, that it is reckoned amongst his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, among his good deeds, his worthy acts; that he rebelled against the King of Ashur, and serued him not. Now that it is called rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, let no man be offended thereat, or thinke that hee hath warrant thereby to condemne <hi>Hezechiah.</hi> For it is not called so, because the Lord did so esteeme it, but because <hi>Sennacherib</hi> would haue it so reputed. As in the 43. of Gen. it is said, <hi>The Egyptians might not eate bread wih the Hebrewes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Genes. 43.</note> 
                     <hi>for that was an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Egyptians.</hi> It was not so indeed, it did not defile them at all, but yet the Egyptians counted it so, and therefore so it is called. So then, because <hi>Hezechiah</hi> will not fall downe before <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and suffer him to goe ouer him, and tread
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17966:62"/>
vpon him, because he will not enthrall his Land vnto him, and lay vpon the neck of his subiects such a yoke, as neither they nor their posterity should be able to beare, <hi>Hinc illae lachrymae,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hezechiah</hi> is a Rebell, and deserueth to be persecuted with fire and sword. And is not her Maiesties cause the like, and the quarrell of her enemy the same? What point of Tyranny, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause warres are commonly vndertaken by great Princes,) may she be charged with? except this be Tyranny, to cast downe Images which were perking in the Rood-lofts, and to purge her Churches from Idolatry, according to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m%nt of God, and the example of good <hi>Hezechiah?</hi> And what point of wrong can shee be conuicted to haue done to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, except this be wrong, to preuent his lying in wayte, and to seeke to saue her owne life, and the liberty of her subiects? There was in Rome one called <hi>

                        </gap>imbria,</hi> a mad fellow, and a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, if euer there were any. The same man hauing a quarrell to one <hi>Scaeuola,</hi> a worthy man, and of speciall reckoning, sought to murder him, &amp; did indeed stab him into the body very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously. Well, the wound proued not to be deadly, and <hi>Scaeuola</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped with his life; now what doth <hi>Fimbria?</hi> He maketh no more adoe, but indicts <hi>Scaeuola</hi>; and why? <hi>Quòd totum telum corpore non exciperet,</hi> Because he brayded aside, and did not suffer himselfe to be slaine out-right. So <hi>Caligula</hi> complained of the iniquity of the time, that one doubting to be poysoned of him, did take a counterpoyson, or a remedy against it. What, sayes he,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotum aduersus Caesarem?</hi> Thats faire play indeed. Except the great enemy of Spaine will lay such a thing to our charge, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that when he, or his Councell had suborned desperate Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians to stabbe our Queene, or to pistoll her, she hauing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence thereof through Gods mercy hath auoyded the danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or when he had hyred her owne Physician to take away her life by poysoning, she being warned thereof, did not consent to take the fatall drugge. Except, I say, this be her fault, that she hath not yeelded wilfully to cast away her life for his pleasure, I see no cause why he should complaine of wrong suffering from her. But yet now, I remember my selfe, he hath another quarrell against her. And what is that? Mary the same that the Galles had to the men of Tuscan: We want Land, say they, and you must spare vs some; Againe, your Land is a better Land then ours, this is quarrell sufficient. Howbeit as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth of the men of Andrus,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Herodot.</hi> 1. <hi>Vrania lib.</hi> 8.</note> that when <hi>Themistocles</hi> would needs haue money of them, and to that purpose, said, that he had brought two Goddesses with him, Perswasion, and Necessity. The men of Andrus answered him, that they all had two great Goddes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with them, which did forbid them to giue him money, and those were Pouerty and Impossibility. So say we, If they haue
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17966:63"/>
need of our Lands, and of our commodities, we cannot spare them; and if they bring a sword against vs, to enforce, I hope we shall find a Buckler, and a sword too to resist. Well, this is our comfort, that <hi>Hezechiah</hi> is inuaded, that is, such a one as hath abolished false worshippings, (her Maiestie I meane,) for which cause, the Lord seemeth to haue had a speciall care of her, and so I hope He will haue vnto the end. Againe, this is our comfort, that Ierusalem is inuaded, England, I meane, wherin though otherwise abounding with sin, yet God hath had his Sanctuary now a good while; and will He now bring it, that it should be destroyed, and layd on ruinous heapes? No sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if yet we shall repent, and turne vnto him. Lastly, this is our comfort, that <hi>Sennacherib</hi> is the Inuader, that is, such a one as doth not so much please himselfe in the multitude of his ships, and in the expertnesse of his men, and in the heapes of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, that is, in his arme of flesh; as he doth certainely offend God by his desire of ioyning Dominion to Dominion, which is vnsatiable, by his raising of tumults, &amp; nourishing of broyles in all his neighbour Countreyes, which is most malicious, and specially through his wicked zeale to aduance Idolatry, and to set vp the Kingdome of Antichrist, which is abominable. If any man thinke that I offer the Spaniard hard measure, to match him with <hi>Sennacherib</hi>: first, one out of the Church, then a Persecutor of the Church, &amp;c. Let the same know that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though superstition be not altogether so bad in it selfe, as Atheisme, (albeit <hi>Nazianzene</hi> is bold, and sayes that <gap reason="foreign">

(by which Antichrist is meant,) said to doe all the first beast could, (that is, the Romane Tyrants,) and to be alike enraged vpon the Saints of God? Therefore to the Church, you see, they be alike cruell, &amp; therefore no great wrong done to our enemy in this respect. But now for other respects, his dealing hath beene lesse honourable. For <hi>Sennacherib</hi> had some colour of a cause to make warre vpon <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> for denying the pension which his father paid, though indeed it dyed with his father: but this man by no colour can demand any such thing. <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was no way beholding to the Iewes, for any merit or seruice they had done him. This man got Saint Quintins by our meanes, and when we lost Casis in his quarrell, he left vs in the lash, and gaue vs the slip. Thirdly, <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was not tyed to <hi>Hezechiah</hi> by any band of affinity, or consanguinity. This man, besides

                        <hi>Crantzius lib</hi> 9. <hi>Vandal cap.</hi> 14.</note> And because that Conspiracy doth much pourtray forth, and fore-describe that same hellish one, that was lately vndertaken by our cruell &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall ones, (for the confusion of whom we praise God this day,) let me briefely tell you the summe of it, as it is set downe by <hi>Crantzius.</hi> Some foure male-contneted wretches, sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying that the Gouernours had that which they wanted, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ouer them, &amp; kept them vnder; gat as many partizans as they could, &amp; bound themselues by an oath to be true one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; to keep one anothers counsell. Their plot was to destroy the Senators, &amp; to take their pleasure of their wiues &amp; daughters, &amp; to rifle the City, &amp; to make themselues Lords of it. The day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this Tragedy, was S. <hi>Lamberts,</hi> at 8. of the clocke in the morning, when the gates should be opened. Of this practice, though there were some muttering abroad, yet in the City there was not the least inkling, vntill the very euening before it should be designed. The euening before, God wrought so vpon ones conscience, that perduenture was priuy to the designe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but had beene sworne before to keep it secret, that hee came vnto the house of the Burgo-masters Deputy, and missing him at home, found his sonne there, that was of good yeeres and discretion, to whom he deliuered his mind, in these words: Your father, (said he,) is in Councell, and there is now as great need of Counsell and circumspection, as euer there were any where. With that he called fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a glasse of beere: &amp; when it was brought, he said, I tell thee, thou glasse, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I tell no body else, that if there be not the better care taken, and preuention vsed, to morrow next before noone, this City will become the sepulcher of the chiefe Burgesses, and of all that be of worth, the treason is so dangerous, and there be so many Traitors. When he had thus spoken, he threw the glasse against the wall, and hastily betooke himselfe out of doores, and rode away. When this was done, it was no boote to bid the Deputies sonne to hasten to the Councell-house, nor yet for the Senators to looke about them. They presently tooke order for a strong and substantiall watch and ward, and seizing vpon one of the Conspirators, (for so he proued to be) they forced him by torture, or feare, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale the whole plot: and so by Gods mercifull Prouidence, that danger was remoued, and the State preserued from ruine and confusion. I need not paralell our danger with theirs; Male-contentednesse bred both, oathes and imprecations kept both secret, both were at the point to haue beene accomplished, and nothing, but Gods mercy, defeated both. There were onely two speciall differences, that the Traytors of Lubecke sought the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17966:66"/>
but of a few States-men in comparison, euen of one City, Ours of the Nobles, and chiefe Commons of the whole Realme. They had one among them that compassionated their Countrey; ours had neuer a one that was touched with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse to their Countrey, but onely bare some priuate affection towards one of our Nobles, &amp; gaue him warning to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe away. But much honoured be that honorable man, that would not scape himselfe alone, but would his King, and Peeres, and Countrey, to escape too. Yea, I thinke he would not haue thanked them for his life, if none of rekoning had beene left aliue but himselfe. As in the Romane Story, when <hi>Sylla</hi> that Tyrant put the Praenestines to the sword, and would haue spared his hoste, he generously refused it, thrusting himselfe among them that were appoynted to be slaine, and so was slaine with them.

to high strength, which he compassed in <hi>Gregorie</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenths time, by superstitious false-hood, established in <hi>Innocent</hi> the third his time by bloody Lawes; but the faithfull went to the post, and wandred vp and downe hungry and naked, and had no dwelling place, and were counted as the filth of the world, and the off-scowring of all things; yea the time was, that whosoeuer killed them, thought he did God good seruice; and this for the most space (in a manner,) that the persecution lasted in the Primitiue time. This may suffice to shew Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, both towards his seruants, and towards his aduersaries. The second thing is his Iustice.

                     <hi>Hee will make his arrowes drunke with blood, and his sword shall eate flesh, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 32. This for his Iustice in punishing the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; as for his Iustice to right the Godly, and comforting of them, you know whats written in the 12. Psalme.

It is a righteous thing with God, to recompence tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them that trouble you, and to you that are troubled, rest with him. <hi>For that the righteous should be euen as the wicked, be that farre from God, said</hi> Abraham, Genes. 18. In this world many times there seemeth to be but a small difference betweene the deuout and profane, the pure and polluted, him that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth, and him that sacrificeth not. Thus all things seeme to fall out alike, to the one and to the other: nay, the wicked seeme to be the warmer, and to haue a greater portion in this life. What then, is the way of the Lord vnrighteous? God forbid; nay, let God be iust, and all men sinners, as it is written. But this it is, The Heauen of Heauens is the Lords, and for them to whom it was appointed, euen for them that call vpon him in truth, and thinke vpon his Commandements to doe them; but the earth and the commodities thereof, He distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth without respect of persons, euen to them that are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by creation onely, and not by adoption But yet there is a difference betweene the prosperity of the one and the other; for the ones is but with anxiety of heart, (euen in laughter their heart is heauy,) the others is with cheerefulnesse and ioy in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17966:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Spirit; the ones is a pledge of the greater preferment in the world to come, the others is their whole portion, and as if God should say, Let them take that and looke for no more; the ones is with the blessing of the people, who wish they had more; the others with their curse and hatred, who are grieued that they haue so much: Briefly, the one flourish but for a time, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fore-see the ruine of their house in their life-time, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally within a few Generations their name is cleane put out, but now the other hauing their house built not with blood or oppression, but vpon the foundation of Iustice, feele no shaking or tottering of it while they liue, and when they are to leaue the world, they are full of hope that their house shall not be like the grasse on the house tops, which withereth before it commeth forth, Psalme 129. but that it shall continue for a long season, euen for many generations.<note place="margin">Psalme 129.6.</note> Therefore let not the godly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, because he is kept downe and troad vpon, neither yet let the wicked be bragge, because their imaginations pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: for God hath not forsaken the earth, neither hath he forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to doe Iustice, but his eyes are ouer the righteous, and his eares are open to their prayers; as for the wicked, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is set against them to roote out the memoriall of them from off the earth. God is iust, let this content the godly, he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all their bones, so that none of them are broken, he hath all their teares in his bottle, &amp; will right them in due time. And that God is iust, let this appall the wicked, he shall cast vp that which he hath gotten vnlawfully, the Lord will draw it out of his belly. [<hi>God ariseth to Iudgement,</hi>] This we haue considered of. It followeth, [<hi>To saue all the meeke of the earth.</hi>] It is good to be zealous in a good matter alwayes, sayes the Apostle; to be wise to doe good, and in euill to haue no skill, as the Prophet doth intimate. So it is good to rise betimes to serue God, to doe the workes of righteousnesse, of mercy, and of our lawfull and honest vocation, that is pleasing to God, that is well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of by men. <hi>Abraham</hi> did so, he rose vp early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to offer a sacrifice to the Lord, which he had prescribed.

And in <hi>Esay,</hi> they rise vp early to follow drunkennesse, and to smite with the fist of wickednesse, and to catch their brother with a net, &amp;c. and I would to God there were not infinite such among vs. Well, the Lords rising is not of this fashion, he riseth to helpe, to deliuer, to saue; and whom? Not all without difference, tag, and rag, good and bad, but the meeke of the earth. And how many of these? Not a few, but all, all the meeke. So then you haue in these words.</p>

When I say, they were to be led as sheepe to the slaughter, had they not need to be as a Lambe, dumbe before the Shearer, and not to open their mouth, &amp;c? Thus meekenesse becommeth Gods Church espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and therefore no maruell, if vnder the name of meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be promised saluation. And this truely the Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrast, and some of the Rabbins commenting vpon this Text, did see that they were not to be appropriated to any particular ranke of men, but to the visible Church, (called otherwise Gods first-borne, Gods flocke, Gods Spouse, Gods secret-ones,) though <hi>Kimhi</hi> as a Iew, would haue it to be vnderstood of Iewes by nature, and of Israel according to the flesh.

For had not the Lord himselfe beene on our side, may we well say, had not he himselfe beene on our side, when man rose vp against vs, it had not failed vs, but our soules had beene put to silence, they were so wrathfully disposed at vs. They thrust sore at vs, that we might fall, and the plowers plowed vpon our backes, and made long furrowes, and thought to haue swallowed vs vp quicke, at the least-wise, to haue blowne vs vp quicke, or dead, that the name of a Protestant might no more be had in remembrance.

Thus the rage of man turned to Gods praise; and the more, and the mightier, and the fiercer they were, the more was God honored, in taking part with vs his weake ones. This for defeating of Forces. So for defeating of Policies, we need not to goe farther for an example, then to the Gun-powder Treason: Was there euer any thing carried with greater secrecy? They digged deepe, euen to hell almost, to hide their Counsell from God, and said, No eye shall see vs; we will giue them a blow before they be aware, that whosoeuer shall heare of it, his eares shall tingle, but whosoeuer shall heare it, and feele it, he shall be torne in pieces. Thus as King <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon, when he resolued vpon the surprize of Sicily, kept his plot so secret to himselfe, that hee swore hee would teare his shirt from his backe, if he thought it were priuy to it.

Thus much our Traitors felt to their woe; and we found, and doe find to our vnspeakeable comfort. No Nation vnder heauen more bound to God for wonderfull deliuerances.

Onely I will endeauour to helpe the ignorant to vnderstand what is the difference betweene Iustice and Iudgement, lest they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. For Iustice and Iudgement be not one and the same thing, though they be ioyned together in my Text, as also they be in halfe an hundred places of the Scripture, as I thinke. Neither yet doth Iudgement signifie Discretion in this place, as it doth, when we say, Such a thing is done with iudgement. No, the originall word <gap reason="foreign">

But these be the differences betweene <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Iudgement; Iustice</hi> is the vertue or good quality, <hi>Iudgement</hi> the exercise and practice of it. <hi>Iustice</hi> is considered as inherent in our selues, <hi>Iudgement</hi> hath relation vnto others, euen to them with whom we haue dealing. Briefely, <hi>Iustice</hi> is the letter of the Law, and tenor of right; <hi>Iudgement</hi> is taken often for the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it by conscience and equity.

and besought liberty to seeke out his fellow. It would not bee granted, but he was condemned to die, and a Centurion char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to carry him out of the Campe, according to the manner, and to see execution done. When they came to the place of execution, behold, the Souldier that had beene missing, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and then there was great ioy betweene him and his fellow, and in the whole presence also, who were glad to haue life sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: The Centurion also thought hee could doe no lesse, but bring the supposed murderer backe, for as much as hee, for whose sake he was to die, was found to be aliue.

                     </gap> or <hi>Paroxysm</hi> thereof. What was the cause? (for me thinks the Prophet proceedeth after the manner of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, from the disease, to the Symptomes; from the Syptomes, to the causes; from the causes, to the remedies.) <hi>They knew not shame</hi>; The light of Nature that was in them, they had for the greatest part extinguished by their custome of sinning: And as for others that should reforme and reclaime them by setting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the things that they had done, and by thundring forth Gods Iudgements and plagues against them, for holding the truth in vnrighteousnesse; such, I say, as should doe this great worke of the Lord seriously, and sincerely, they wanted. Thus the people perished for want of knowledge, for want of knowledge of their sinne and shame: and in this forlorne estate the Iewes are described to be, in the verse before my Text. In my Text is set downe the last thing that Physicians doe, and is most acceptable to the Patients, (namely, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and medicine for cure, that should remoue the disease, and bring health to the Patient,) in the words which I haue read vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: <hi>Stand vpon (or neere) the wayes, and aske for the old pathes, (or euerlasting pathes,) where is the goodway, and goe therein, and find rest for your soules.</hi> As if he said, One of the greatest causes of your shamefull and shamelesse carriage, both towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, at the leastwise, one of the greatest matters that you can pretend for your excuse, is ignorance, or want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the will of God, that you doe not know the Royall Lawe; that your Leuites teach you not Gods Iudgements and Lawes; that the Priests rebuke not in the gate; that the Prophets sooth you in your sinnes, healing the wound of the daughter of Gods people with soft words, &amp;c. But how? The Lord hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nothing in secret, neither is his Word darkenesse, neither are you so blind, that you need alwayes to be led by the hand. Why then, doe you not take Gods Booke into your hand, and there search for the right way, for the good will of God, and acceptable and perfect? Why doe you not learne at the length to be your owne caruers? or if that place be so difficult, that you cannot vnderstand it, why doe you not consult the more learned, them that haue their wits exercised and acquainted with the Word of God, that so you may finde satisfaction, and rest for your soules? This know for a surety, that <hi>the old way, that</hi> which was at the first chalked out by God himselfe in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17966:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mount Sinai, and after laid open by <hi>Moses</hi> the man of God, and the Prophets sithence, which spake and wrote as they were moued by the holy Ghost: that is the <hi>Good way,</hi> and the straight way, neither is there straightnesse or goodnesse in any other.</p>
                  <p>This I take to be the true coherence of the words of my Text, with the former verse, and also the naturall meaning of them; wherein note with me three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A perswasion, consisting of diuers branches; <hi>Stand vpon the wayes,</hi> this is one. <hi>See,</hi> this is another. <hi>Aske for the old way,</hi> this is the third.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A correction, or limitation. Aske not simply for the old way, (for that is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Touching the first.

As if he had said, Did I bid you aske after the <hi>Old way,</hi> and walke therein, as though that were a safe and certaine direction of your faith? Alas, you may be deceiued in this inquiry, except you aske for the <hi>Old way, which is the good way.</hi> For as some of your Ancestors haue beene good, and some bad; some true worshippers of God, and some Idolaters: So by that reason, some old or bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wayes must be crooked and erronious, as well as other some right and straight. Decline therefore from that way, seeme it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so old, if it may be proued vnto you to be wrong; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and hold on that onely which is good. Thus the Prophet; and this to be the true meaning of the place, any one that will looke into the Originall, may easily finde. For though it be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfully translated, as though the Prophet would haue the <hi>old way</hi> to be esteemed for the <hi>good way,</hi> &amp; rule of faith, yet it is a truth, that the Hebrew Text doth import no such thing.

Now then, if this be all that the Prophet mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that we should <hi>aske for the old way which is good</hi>; doth not this imply, that there be old wayes which be bad? and consequently doth not this make against our Aduersaries, that doe rely vpon Antiquity simply without distinction?

The British Clergy being sent vnto by <hi>Augustine</hi> (not the learned Bishop of Hippo, whom you heare so often cited out of this place, but an vnlearned, and vnsauory Monke, whom <hi>Gregory</hi> sent ouer hither, (reade but his questions moued to the said <hi>Gregory,</hi> as they be registred by <hi>Beda,</hi> and you will say he was no better,) to make their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance before him, consulted a graue man, famous for his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in those dayes, what they were best to doe; He aduised them to be ruled by him, if he were a man of God. But how shall wee know that, said they? If he be milde and humble in heart, said he. And how shall we know so much? Why, said he, vse the meanes, that he, and his may come to the Synode, and be there before you; and if he rise vp vnto you, when you come neere, know that he is the seruant of Christ, and (therefore) hearken to him obediently. But if he despise you, <hi>(si spreuerit)</hi> and will not vouchsafe to rise vp vnto you, you being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number, then doe you also despise him, and care as little for him. Thus they were aduised, and accordingly they make tryall; and <hi>Augustine</hi> keeping his place, and not daining to rise vp vnto them, they condemne him for a proud fellow, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his opposites to the vttermost.

man out of the euill treasure of his heart, bringeth forth euill things, for of the aboundance of the heart the mouth speaketh; yea, and so doe all the rest of the parts of the body, and all the faculties of the minde shew themselues outwardly.

But how few doe dissemble vertue? how few doe appeare worse then they are indeed?

For thus is the Tenant racked, the poore repelled, the Broker enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the Vsurer almost Lorded. He that begunne with an hundred, nay, with tenne, increaseth to thousands, and hee that began with thousands, decreaseth to nothing. But as in <hi>Tacitus</hi> his time, there were euery yeere Edicts, and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions set forth against the Mathematicians or Astrologers, and yet they could neuer get Rome to be rid of them; so let the Preachers speake neuer so much against the vanity of apparell now-a-dayes, the speech shall be as the sound of one that hath a pleasant voyce, (as the Prophet saith,) or rather as of one that speaketh vnpleasantly, and most harshly, and he shall labour in vaine, and for nothing. Well, if we humble our selues, let vs humble our selues, euen in our apparell. In like manner, let vs humble our selues in speech and in demeanor. <hi>Rehoboam</hi> through an vncourteous and rough speech, lost tenne Tribes at a clap. <hi>Demetrius</hi> lost a whole Kingdome, and the same a rich one, euen the Kingdome of Macedony, by his arrogant behauiour. <hi>C. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> lost no lesse then an Empire and his life, and all by keeping his seat, and not vouchsafing to rise vp vnto his Peeres. Why should it be thus among Christians? I stout, and thou stout, I dare not venture a cap, or a salutation, lest I should be a loser. Why doe we not rather behold in our brother our owne image,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17966:94"/>
yea, the image of God, and for his sake, make our selues equall to them of the lower sort? Why did wee not goe one before another, in giuing honour, and beare one anothers burden, and in humblenesse of mind, looke not euery one of his owne things, but vpon that which is in another, and esteeme of that better then of our owne? This is true humility, and this is thanke-worthy with God, when a man not in apparell onely, or in word, or in gesture humbleth himselfe, but when the hidden man, which is within, is decked with this vertue as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For when humility is once rooted in the heart, there will be a correspondency and conformity in the outward behauiour, that no exception shall be taken against it: for a tree will be knowne by his fruite. It is not a good tree that bringeth forth bad fruit, neither is it a bad tree that bringeth forth good fruit. <gap reason="foreign">

For what haue we that we haue not receiued? what haue we receiued, but we haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and made worse? what haue we corrupted, but for the same we deserue to be called to account, yea, to be cast forth of Gods house asvnprofitable seruants?

A slander, a vile slander, our State did blowe the coles any-where, nor stirre them neither, but finding them flaming &amp; on a light fire, &amp; not being able to quench the flame, they were carefull to prouide that the sparkles might not flee-ouer into our Land, to set things in a combustion here: and this was wisely done, &amp; this was necessary to be done.

The Easterne Church went one way, and the Westerne another; And what was the cause of their iarre? The Easterne Church pretended a Tradition, as from Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist, that he (forsooth) should command it to be kept vpon such a day. The Westerne Church a Tradition, as from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that he should ordaine it to be kept such a day, vpon a Sunday by all meanes. What shall we say to this? were Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> diuided, that yea, should be with them, nay, and nay, yea?

                  <p>I will therefore speake no more of the dignity of a King, nor of the worth of our King; and I haue shewed reasons, why I need not to deliuer one word of instruction for him. But now for our duty, (which I said was a second reason, why such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

So then in order; If Kings be Shep-heards, then we that are subiects are sheepe, then we had need to haue two properties (at the least,) of sheep, the one mentioned in the 10. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the other in the 53. of <hi>Isay.</hi> In the 10. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is said, that the sheep doe follow their Sheep-heard,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.4, 5.</note> for they know his voyce, but they will not follow a stranger, &amp;c.

So much of the notes that arise hereby, that a King is called a Shep-heard.

The matter is not so difficult as you thinke, neither the remedy so far off, if you would looke about you; It is not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that you should say, who shall ascend thither and fetch it vs, neither is it beyond the Sea, that you should say, who shall bring it vs thence?

Now the same appeareth more plaine by that which followeth. For doth not the Apostle make it manifest in the fourth verse, that he speaketh of that <hi>Ruler</hi> that beareth the Sword? Now to whom doth that belong? doth it belong to any but to the Ciuill <hi>Ruler?</hi> Indeed <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth, he flourished, and braued it with his, <hi>Ecce duo gladij,</hi> Behold here are two swords, said <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> therefore said <hi>Boniface,</hi> I am the highest Prince, not onely the highest Priest, Emperour at the least, specially in the vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

of <hi>Peter,</hi> that was bid by his Lord to put vp the materiall sword into his sheath. But we may say vnto him as <hi>Bernard</hi> said to one of his predecessors, <hi>In his successisti non Petro, sed Constantino,</hi> that is, In these things you shew your selfe not the Successor of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but of <hi>Constantine.</hi> This therefore is one reason, whereby we may proue the Ciuill <hi>Ruler</hi> precisely to be meant, for that he is said to beare the Sword. Another, and the same a strong one, may be gathered out of the sixth verse, where the paying of Tribute is mentioned. Now Tribute is not due to any but to them that haue <hi>Iura Regalia,</hi> which no Church-man euer could claime by vertue of his Priest-hood, or Father-hood either. There was once in England a young Earle made of an old Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, which same had <hi>Palatine</hi> power, which was little lesse than <hi>Regall</hi>; but he could not say as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I was free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi>; But as the Heathen Captaine said there,<note place="margin">Act. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now this was very hard, that it should be death to accuse one wrongfully; for it is necessary that there be accusers in a State, that they which be perfect may be knowne, and they that are faulty, may be found out; as it is very behoouefull that there be dogs about a house to giue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theeues, or suspected persons; yet as these, if they catch a true man by the bosome, deserue not onely to be rebuked, but also to be banged, yea, and to haue their legs broken: so it is not vniust, that the very accusing of a righteous man, if it be prosecuted with eagernesse, and vpon no probable ground, should be chastized, and fined deepely; but now when a man shall aduisedly and maliciously forsweare himselfe, and procure

If, I say, he should alleage this, or the like circumstance being grounded vpon truth, should this man be challenged as spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king against the King? I trow no. He doth not speake against the King, that speaketh for his true subiect: but he speaketh against the King, that would haue his true subiect to be hanged. <hi>Tully</hi> auerreth, that he that was seuen hundred miles off, two dayes before the thing was done in Rome, could not possibly be present at the doing of it.

Barre, as he is bound in conscience to reueale it, (for this is to open the mouth for the dumbe,<note place="margin">Prouerb. 31.</note> as <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh,) so I make no doubt, but the Reuerend Iudges would gladly heare him, and allow him. Thirdly, there is another meane to make Iudges terrible, euen to good men, when one either corrupted by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or bearing a secret malice vnto a prisoner, findeth meanes to be one of the Iury, and the prisoner suspecting nothing, doth not challenge him; now this is <hi>Ouem Lupo,</hi> as they say, for the Iuror craftily crept in, maketh a vow with himselfe either to hang the prisoner, or to starue his fellow Iurors, at leastwise, to weary them, and to make them dance attendance after the Iudges into another County: This is hard, but I thinke it is not rare, for my selfe haue heard one confesse, that being vnequally yoked with a tugger, he was faine full sore against his will, to bring in an innocent man guilty, for feare of some mischiefe towards himselfe. It was weakely done by him, to yeeld at last; for where is fortitude, and the patience of Saints, but to stand for Truth and Iustice, euen vnto death? Blessed are the dead that die so, for no question they die in the Lord. But yet this sheweth what men be, if the Iudge doe not carry an eye and a hand ouer them.

So they that know Story, know that <hi>Gallienus</hi> was a bad man, and a worse Gouernour, yet an act of clemency that he did, gat him much loue, and couered many of his vices. The act of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency was this: There was one that sold vnto his Lady a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit iewell, instead of a iewell of great price, and so cooze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her of much money, she complaineth to the Emperour, &amp; will haue the Law executed in all rigour; to make the matter short, he seemeth to giue way, and commands the offendor to be carryed towards the Lions denne, and when he looked for nothing but death, and that a cruell one, by the teeth of a Lion; Behold in stead of a Lion rampant, there was let forth a Capon, and all men maruelling at it; the Cryer was ready to proclaime, <hi>Impostur am fecit &amp; passus est,</hi> Behold, the reward of a coozener, he coozened others, and now he is coozened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he was made to beleeue that he should die the death, and now he is suffered to liue, and hath a Capon for his supper. This one fact of <hi>Gallienus</hi> purchased vnto him exceeding much good will and great honour, and this sheweth that nothing is better pleasing vnto men, (if they be not turned sauage) than clemency. On the other side, let a man haue neuer so many vertues, yet if he be seuere, too seuere, he may be feared, but he will neuer be loued, no, nor much honoured neither. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> may be an example hereof, who for all his valour and prowesse, wherein he did excell all the men of his time, got in the end, but this dry cold commendation, that he was a Prince rather necessary than good: What then, doe I speake against Iustice, which is the strength and Bulwarcke of a Common-weale?

Otherwise, if the King say thus vnto you, I haue appointed you in my place, to minister Iustice vnto my people, and you may meet with many circumstances, which the Law that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall cannot prouide for; looke what your heart tells you, that my selfe would doe if I were there in person, that sticke not to doe, I will allow you, or excuse you; then me thinkes you haue your Dormant-warrant, as it were, and then you shall please better in losing a point of the Law, than in straining it too hard. This is true, that as the Magistrate must be very vnwilling to draw blood, (like as the Physician proceedeth vnwillingly, <hi>ad vrendum &amp; secandum,</hi> that is, To vse the hot-iron or the knife,) so he must alwayes beware, lest the complaint of <hi>Lucan</hi> be taken vp against him,<note place="margin">

And shall the committing of a small offence, and the committing of it but once, bring destruction vpon a penitent person, that peraduenture hath wife and children? and all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he cannot read, which was not his fault, but his parents, and which now if he could doe, were to no purpose? for as the King of Gath said, <hi>Haue I need of mad men?</hi> so we may say,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 21.</note> Hath the Church need of Stigmaticks, of such as haue beene burnt in the hand? <hi>Ratio legis, anima legis,</hi> the reason, why a Law was made, that is the soule of the Lawe, when the reason ceaseth, the Law may be spared.

                     </note> leaned vpon his sword, as the Prophet speaketh;<note place="margin">Ezec. 33.26.</note> and boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kishnesse was counted cowardlinesse, (as it is also at this day in many parts of Turkie,) there was some reason to grant some priuiledge or immunity, to such as shewed any desire to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to the end that learning might be more generally embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But now the case is altered, there is not so much doubt, lest too few should put their hand to this plow, as lest too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the people are rather to be restrained from offering their sonnes to the Church,<note place="margin">Exod. 36.</note> (as <hi>Moses</hi> put backe many of the peoples offerings for the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36.) than to be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forward: therefore they that are thought worthy to liue by

their book, it is pitty but they should liue euen without the book. So might the Ordinary be eased of his duty of attendance, (which at the first, as it seemeth to me, was voluntary, if he lusted, he might challenge for the Church, but now is made necessary, and the neglect finable some-where,) but specially, so might his Deputy be discharged from the sinne of vntruth, for calling euill, good; a bad reader, a good reader; which he must be faine to doe sometimes, or else he will be called as <hi>Moses</hi> was by his wife,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note>

But this can hardly be done without a Parliament, I beleeue verily; yea, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this too, that no man would doe it more willingly than your Lordship, if you had warrant for it; but now vntill you haue warrant by Parliament or otherwise, I hope I shall not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, if I request you, (and indeed I doe request you,) to hold on your charitable course of repriuing, yea, and to increase therein, euen to repriue all such that might be saued by their bookes, (if they could read.) Now whereas it is obiected that once in the Gaole, and neuer good againe, there they learne to be their perfect craftsmasters in all kinds of lewdnesse and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea, by this meanes the Country would be charged with keeping them, that is ouer-charged already; I answere briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for the former point touching their incorrigiblenesse, this,<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.</note> that I hope for better things, and things that accompany saluation, howsoeuer some speake to the contrary. When I finde in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philemon.</note> that <hi>One simus</hi> a runne-agate, and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, became afterwards profitable to his master and to others, yea became a faithfull Minister, (if the report be true in the Canons of the Apostles, <hi>Can.</hi> 31.)

To the later, of charging the Countrie by their liuing, and so consequently by their maintenance in Gaole, it is so sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, that it cannot be touched without the dishonour of the Country. It bringeth me into remembrance of the barbarous and inhumane dealing of them of Sparta, (for which they were condemned by their fellow-miscreants,) whose manner was, when any infants were borne lame or vnlusty, to cast them vnto a by-place, (they called it <hi>Apotheta,</hi>) some pit or ditch chosen for the purpose, that so their mothers, forsooth,<note place="margin">

                     </note> might be freed from a great deale of paines in looking vnto them, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from a great deale of misery to be indured in the world, but specially that the State might be eased of a great deale of trouble and charge. Brethren, let me speake vnto you freely of the City of Sparta, (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith <hi>Acts,</hi> 2. Let me speake vnto you freely of the Patriarch <hi>Dauid,</hi>) it had beene better that Sparta had beene made a fish-poole, or beene swallowed vp of an earth-quake, as many better Cities haue beene, than that so many examples of more then inhumane immanity should haue beene shewed by it. To be short, it putteth me in minde of the vile speech of <hi>Plautus,</hi> so much detested by <hi>Lactantius: Plautus</hi> had said, He doth very ill, that giueth an almes to a begger, <hi>Nam &amp; illud quod dat perit, &amp; illi producit vitam ad miseriam,</hi> that is, For both that which he giueth is lost, and by lengthening the beggers life, he doth but lengthen his misery.

Therefore let this be no motiue vnto vs, to shift poore soules away, because they seeme to stand in our way, because we must be at some three halfe-peny charge vpon them, (<gap reason="foreign">

Albeit it would seeme, a small liberality would serue the turne, if good order were taken. For they that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues can be content to worke for their liuing in the Gaole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their tryall, when they are not sure of life, why should they

not be much more willing after their repriuall, when their life seemeth to be giuen them for a prey? If the worst come to the worst, they may be forced to worke: for they ought not to looke for more fauour, than they who are in an house of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, where he that will not labour, is not suffered to eate. Thus,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, concerning Virgins, <hi>I haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord, yet I giue my iudgement, as one that hath obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mercy of the Lord to be faithfull:</hi> So I haue beene bold, euen without warrant or commission, to shew what I thinke to be the more excellent way, for mercifull proceeding towards them that be light offenders, and I wish with the Greeke Orator, <gap reason="foreign">

Thirdly, that there is no reason, that they should be esteemed for terrible, and that they are not of themselues terrible to any, but onely to such, as haue a terrified, that is, a guilty conscience. As for good men and innocent, to them they are not terrible, but <hi>per accidens,</hi> namely; First, if false forsworne witnesses haue their scope against them. Secondly, if they being not well able to speake for themselues, such as can helpe them, and giue testimony to their innocency, should be repelled. Thirdly, if any corrupt or malicious persons, that haue vowed their destruction, should be suffered to passe vpon their tryall, Lastly, if they should not find fauour to be repriued either in a doubtfull case, (or for a small offence) notwithstanding they cannot reade. In this case in my poore opinion, (I know not how politicke it may be thought, but sure I am, it is charitable,) mercy should <note n="*" place="margin">Or glory, (<gap reason="foreign">

Thus farre I haue proceeded already; now by the tenour of my Text I am tolled-on, to answere an obiection against Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> speech, namely, how he could say truely, that Rulers were not terrible in his time, when <hi>Nero</hi> that ruled the roast then, was such a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Tyrant,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tertull.</hi>
                     </note> euen such a one, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, It was no discredit vnto the Christians, but rather an honour, that he was the first that lifted vp his hand against them; hauing first beene at defiance with all vertue. This for the chiefest Ruler; As for his Delegates,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sueton.</hi>
                     </note> Scholers know out of <hi>Suetonius</hi> what was the Commission he gaue vnto them, namely, to pill and powle, and ransacke, and take such order, (or rather disorder,) that no man should thinke any thing he had to be his owne, but that all should be brought tumbling into the Tyrants coffers. And must not such Rulers. High, and low, necessarily appeare ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible?
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:17966:135"/>
This is one point therefore, that I might discourse vpon, if the time were not past. Secondly, hauing shewed how Rulers are terrible to euill doers, I might take occasion by that which followeth immediatly, to shewe how by their institution they are comfortable to the pious and vertuous; but one contrary may easily be vnderstood by another; This for the latter point; and for the former you are to vnderstand, that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote not this Epistle to serue for <hi>Neroes</hi> time onely, but for all succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ages; And therefore though he were as bad as bad might be, yet there might come worthy Princes after him, and againe, though many of his Officers were bad like their Master, yet he had many good. Howsoeuer their persons were bad, yet their calling was sacred and venerable, and therfore their faults to be winked at, and their manners to be indured. I forbeare to be further troublesome. The Lord giue a blessing to that which hath beene spoken already, Amen.</p>

Remember the example of <hi>Parry</hi> the Traitor. Our late Queene (of famous memory,) gaue him his pardon, after he was condemned to dye for a foule offence. Did he take it to

the heart? No, he made but a pegh at it, saying, She gaue me that, that without cruelty she could not take from me, I had serued her long. So the Gun-powder Traytors, (the memoriall of whose confusion, as also Gods gracious preseruing of our Gracious King, and the whole State, we celebrate this Day with all thankefulnesse,) had receiued great fauours from his Maiesty, liberty of body to goe whither they would, liberty of conscience to belieue as they lusted, liberty of accesse to the Court, without any touch of disgrace or exception against their person for their Religion, but yet all this was nothing, they thought they were worthy of a great deale more, euen to be made Princes, at the least Priuy Counsellers, at the least, to haue vp the Masse againe, at the least, to haue a generall toleration. Thus as <hi>Caesar Borgia,</hi> (a wicked sonne of a most Atheisticall father,) said and bragged, that either he would be <hi>Caesar,</hi> that is, a Soueraigne Commander, or no body, and so became no body: And as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith of <hi>Adam,</hi> that by abusing his free-will, he lost his free-will, and vndid himselfe:<note place="margin">

But why did she not say that the King was risen vp against him? did she not take <hi>Saul</hi> for King any longer, now he was become a Tyrant, and persecuted the faithfull? Yes, no doubt, for the Iesuites were not then borne, nor their doctrine broached, to wit, that subiects may lawfully take armes against their Prince, as soone as they become Tyrants, and enemies to the faith in the language of the man of Rome. This is not that fire, that Christ saith he came to cast vpon the earth; the fire of teaching the truth, the fire of rebuking sinne,<note place="margin">Luke 12.49.</note> the fire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicting errors, the fire of the Spirit that worketh all in all; but this is that fire, that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of, that inflameth the course, (or wheele) of Nature, and it selfe is inflamed of hell.

                     <hi>and to dust thou shalt returne;</hi> so we say of that diuellish doctrine; From hell it came, and to hell let it returne. But yet why did not <hi>Abigail</hi> call him King? was it of contempt? No, but of caution: for she was very wise, she lay at the mercy of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and knew that it was as easie for him to kill her, as to speake the word, therefore she keepeth her selfe in clouds &amp; generalities, for feare of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before the time.

thereby, nor charity towards our neighbour violated; vpon these two points hang all the Law and the Prophets. Well, we haue seene against whom the offence of enuious ingratitude was committed, namely, against <hi>Dauid,</hi> and by whom, namely, by <hi>Saul</hi>; now if we looke vpon the Text againe, we shall finde the extent, or grieuousnesse of it, [<hi>A man is risen vp to persecute thee, and to seeke thy life:</hi>] Marke, <hi>Saul</hi> was not content to hate <hi>Dauid</hi> inwardly, but he proceeds to action, he persecutes him also; he is not content to persecute him, or driue him out of the Country, but he seekes his life. Thirdly, neither will he trust others to execute his malice, but he followes the chase him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: This is vnlimited malice, deepe malice, bloody malice; the like we read of him aboue in this holy Story, that when word was brought him that <hi>Dauid</hi> was sicke,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19.</note> he commanded him to be brought, bed and all: No question, but because he would make sure worke, and see the killing of him, himselfe.

But the eye of Iealousie that saw this, vrged the arme of reuenge to cry quittance for it. But what had the righteous done, what had <hi>Dauid</hi> done, (to returne to him againe,<note place="margin">Psal. 11.3.</note>) that he should be tossed from post to pillar, nay, that his life should be sought out for a prey?

Therefore the <hi>Tenet</hi> is, that they that doe some acte of hostility, be viler Traitors, than they that stay themselues at words.

Now, if this were done in a greene tree, when the leaues of piety and vertue yet remained, I meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Satan was let loose, and men had abandonned themselues

In those dayes was nothing but warres and rumours of warres, a Post went to meet a Post, and a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a Messenger, as the Prophet speaketh, and the Powers of heauen and earth seemed to be moued, and mens hearts to faile with feare and anxiety, and all to be brought to a combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. But what was the issue of all this? The Emperour had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in most battels, (and he fought 52. more than euer did any before, or since,) and saw the end and confusion of all his foes, saue of his sonne, whom God suffered to suruiue, to make him a subiect and spectacle of his wrath.<note place="margin">

To make the matter short, he maketh peace in the East, to the aduantage of the Christians there, and hasteth home with all speed, and by his valour and prudence, soone recouereth what was lost in his absence.

And the like complaint might be taken vp, and might haue beene taken vp this many, and many yeeres past, concerning the Iesuites, that their attempts are desperate, and their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions bloody for the most part. They will not play small play, nor busie their refined wits about trifles, (as <hi>Domitian</hi> is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue spent certaine houres in the day in catching flies.) O no, but as one said to <hi>Antonius</hi> the <hi>Triumvir</hi>; Thy fishing is to take vp Townes and Fortresses, and Kingdomes, and the lik: so their fishing is to hale vp at one draught a whole Seignory or Principality. Is any man great with a Prince, or a State? him they seeke by all meanes, (by promises, by gifts, by threats,) to winne him to their side; if they cannot make him to be for them, then they will doe their best or worst to make him away. Nay, they are not content to strike at a seruant, and to seeke to vnhorse him, but no worse than <hi>Dauid</hi> will serue their turne. <hi>Dauid</hi> the Anointed of the Lord, him they persecute, his life they seeke to take away, as it is in my Text, <hi>Fight not against small nor great, but against the King of Israel onely,</hi> (said the King of Syria.)

time. What doe you speake of killing of <hi>Leicester,</hi> (said one of the foureteene Traitors that were En-Iesuited,) the Queene is the onely marke? Thus in England. So in France, Let King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, a counterfeit Monke, be killed by a true Monke; <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> doe thou, vpon the remission of thy sins, and to be made a Saint, strike him, and one blow for all, that thou needest not strike him againe. Thus they dispatched <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the third, for feare lest he would wholy reuolt from them. So did they deale against <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, though he had turned to them, yet because he had stood out long, and the holy Father was not wholy reconciled to him, therefore they proclaime, that it was a meritorious deed to kill him. Hereupon one <hi>Iohn Castile,</hi> a Nouice of theirs, attempts vpon his person, and strikes out one of his teeth, (he meant to haue striken him to the heart, but the King stooping downe vpon occasion, receiued the blow into his mouth, <hi>(My mouth, said the King afterwards, conuinceth the Iesuites.)</hi> And <hi>Barrier,</hi> a disciple of theirs, came with a resolution from Meloun to stabbe him. <hi>Barrier</hi> missed then, but <hi>Rauillacke</hi> afterwards did the deed, being poysoned by the Iesuites their doctrine; that for as much as the Pope is Christs Vicar, or Vice-gerent, whosoeuer fighteth against any of his creatures or fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, he fighteth against Christ himselfe, and therefore may lawfully be murthered. Before that, euen about this time twelue yeeres, they attempted against our now Soueraigne, (whom God in his mercy preserue,) and as though it had beene a small thing to kill a King, and no body besides, they conspired to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the whole State with him, head and tayle,<note place="margin">Esay 9.14.</note> branch and rush, as the Prophet speaketh. The King, Queene, and their Children, they were (as it were) the head; the Counsellors, and Honorable men, they as it were the brest; the Commons assembled in Parliament, they (as it were) the feet. Vpon all these, and vpon thousands more that dwelt or lay neere the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-house, they thought to bring a <hi>Panolethry,</hi> an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall destruction.

So we read of many hundreds, yea, thousands, blowne vp into the ayre, and torne in pieces by gun-powder, bestowed in mines vnder the earth for such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; but this was in time of hostility and by enemies.

So Philosophers teach, that when exhalations and vapours haue gotten in great store into some hollow places of the earth, if they hap to be stopped there, so that they cannot haue a vent, they first worke a strange rumbling, and hurly-burly in the earth, making it to reele to and fro like a drunken man, as the Psalmist speaketh, and then in the end, breaking forth with violence, they carry away whatsoeuer is in the way, trees, houses, Towers, transplanting or translating them from one side to another, from one end to another maruellously. And euen in like manner, these <hi>Enceladi,</hi> or <hi>Ennosigaei,</hi> by working vnder the ground, and piling together a great deale of sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and combustible, or rather inflammatory matter vnder the vault of the Parliament house, made reckoning with the turning of their side, nay, with the turning of their hand, (by setting fire to the match,) to blow vp all that were aboue or neere, and to bury in one common sepulchre the whole State. <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth of <hi>Nero,</hi> that when heard one vtter out of a Tragedy these words, <hi>When I am dead, let fire and earth be iumbled together</hi>; Nay, rather, said he, let this happen, <gap reason="foreign">

Why should the name or office of a Censor be odious vnto vs? (albeit I stand not vpon the name, let such be appointed, that will proceed as farre-forth as the common Law, or locall ordinance will warrant, and I haue my desire.) It was not refused by the Romanes, when they were at the prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, but being free, they subiected themselues to the yoke of discipline, euen the most noble of them did. So I could tell you that a great politician, and a very wise man findeth this fault with the Venetians, that hauing such a world of Officers as they had, yet they had neuer a one that looked to mens behauiour, to see the publicke peace were not violated; on the other side the same authour commendeth a City that shall be namelesse at this time, (though he were not of the same sound Religion, that is practised in that City,) that by their discipline they kept men in such awe, and order, that seldome whiles any grosse offenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But what is the Common-wealth the better, if one City be reformed for one sinne of drunkennesse, when the whole head is sicke, and the whole heart is heauy? when from Dan to Beersheba, from one end of the Land to the other, all the foundations of the earth be out of course? Shall the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of a few, diuert a common destruction? or shall it deliuer the righteous themselues in the euill day? what good then will it doe? Much verily; First, a booke of remembrance shall be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the Lord, for them that feare the Lord,<note place="margin">Malac. 3.</note> and thinke on his Name, and in the day of death they shall haue enough, and

in the day of publike calamity they shall either be deliuered, as <hi>Rahab</hi> in Iericho, <hi>Ieremy</hi> in Hierusalem in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> time: the Iewes that were turned Christians in Pella, (who by Gods prouidence were maruellously saued,<note place="margin">

O ye Corinthians, (saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>) my mouth is open vnto you, my heart is enlarged.

But this Fryer was not alone, he had an associate; True, but the associate did onely interpret what the Fryer did deliuer in Latine, so the speech, or exhortation was but one, if one.
