            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce I had the honour and ſatisfaction of ſeeing your Papers, I have blamed your delay in the publication of them; eſpecially being deſigned to recall a <hi>Romiſh Proſelyte</hi> that was gone from the Communion of our Church, they might (in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and diſtracted Juncture) have ſeaſonably help'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the recovery of others, whoſe temporal as well as eternal Intereſts make them as eager and deſirous of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. I know that Modeſty is a vertue, and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a very commendable thing: but Charity and Love to the Souls of men is much more ſo. You have lived to ſee the Church forlorn and deſolate, perſecuted and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly forſaken; and after a little reſpite and the hopes of ſettlement, to be again threatned and menac'd with a final overthrow. <hi>Down with it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 137.7.</note> 
               <hi>down with it even to the ground,</hi> cry our Modern <hi>Edomites.</hi> And when the Church did need the Aids of thoſe who loved her, we know ſhe found your Zeal, and Reſolution and Courage in her ſervice: And that now you ſhould flag when you are ſo well arm'd and prepar'd for Combat, or be backward when her Adverſaries are pecking at the very foundations with Axes and Hammers, and striving to undermine her by Artifice or Violence; And you a Champion ſo try'd and experienc'd, and furniſh'd to defend her; I cannot imagine, unless you
<pb facs="tcp:100338:2"/>
are more tender than formerly, and fear taking of harm by being expoſed to the open Air. I think I have heard that the time has been,<note place="margin">Neh. 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> when, like <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Builders, you wrought with one hand in the Churches ſervice, and with the other you h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld a weapon for her defence and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. You know the Arguments that mov'd you then; and what hinders but they ſhould now prevail? I am, you ſee, warm in the Churches cauſe, nor do I believe that you are less concern'd. But if I ſeem to reproach or lament your remissness in theſe ſeaſonable Circumſtances to ſend abroad your uſeful preparations, let me not be thought rude or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly, becauſe I hereby not only vindicate you from the common fault of being forward to print, but likewiſe ſhew the high value I have for your Perſon and Papers, and that I believe them to he very uſeful for the Publick benefit.</p>
            <p>As to the Gentleman you deſign to reduce, I only know him upon this occaſion, and therefore can ſay little of his Learning or Ingenuity, or the Motives that made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us: But if after all your endeavours to convict him he ſtill remains hard and untractable, and <hi>refuſeth to hear the voice of the charmer, charm he never ſo wiſely,</hi> he muſt be let alone in the obſtinacy of the <hi>deaf Adder,</hi> and to our Prayers to ſoften him, when your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot alter him; but when the World have ſeen your Papers, and know that he has done ſo; They'l ſtrain their Charity to ſuſpect, that ſomething elſe beſides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb facs="tcp:100338:2"/>
advantage of <hi>Infallibility</hi> perſwaded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt; and till he can anſwer your Arguments, they'l be apt to think, that the exchange of Opinion was not for Faith but Fancy, and that while he dreamed that he left uncertainty, it was to be ſecure of nothing.</p>
            <p>But if you ſhould have that Friendly influence upon him by your pains and endeavours to call him back, hee'l (by that Charity that is more Catholick than the Religion he leaves) be glad, that by his fall ſo great an advantage has been offer'd to the world, and that others may be reduc'd thereby to the ſober enquiry upon what bottom they truſt their Salvation, and ſee upon what ſlender and fickle grounds their Faith has been fixed; And what thoſe Grounds are, all men will ſee when they peruſe your Tractate. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have reaſon to thank ſuch men as you for aſſerting the Churches cauſe in theſe Controverſies; For who now that is moſt freakiſh in folly and Enthuſiaſm, has a front to ſay, That the Sons of our Church are warp'd from what is Primitive and truly Orthodox; or Factors for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Intereſt; or wiſh well to the promoting that Cauſe amongſt us, &amp;c. Let us hear no more ſuch outcries againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor againſt thoſe who are exact and punctual in the decent performance of Gods publick Worſhip, and the circumſtances of Order and Diſcipline. For the gaudy Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> are more contemned by ſuch men, than the looſer and more careless dress of <hi>Amſterdam</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100338:3"/>
and <hi>Geneva.</hi> And you amongſt many others have freed our Church from this whining &amp; unjuſt imputation, in that you have not only ſhaken, but everted that fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, upon the fall of which all the ſuperſtructure tumbles.</p>
            <p>As to your Quotations, they are ſo proper and peculiarly adapted to every period, that you had very great luck to happen on the choice of them. And for the Tranſlations which your Charity ſuffer'd to be made of them, for the uſe of your meaner and more unlearned Reader; they, I perceive, were done by one whoſe skill in Grammar did exceed his ſenſe in Theologie and Divine Controverſies, which may excuſe them to the Criticks and men of brisker fancy. However, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating is a very tedious task, and ſo long as they are true and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>teral, they are juſtifiable enough againſt the keeneſt and moſt ſnarling Cenſurers.</p>
            <p>I am loth the Meſſenger ſhould ſtay, and therefore only wiſh your Reader may be impartial and conſiderative, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd and ſerious, and that your Papers may convince and confirm him, that they may have their deſign on the Gentleman you'd recall, and advance the intereſt of Truth and Goodness amongſt all men; that they may help to allay that bitterness, and heal thoſe Animoſities and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Miſconception therein on the one hand, or the other, may expoſe us unto the Charging of God fooliſhly, even whil'ſt we take our ſelves to be pleading of his Cauſe; and may occaſion in us unbecomming thoughts of our ſelves, and hard thoughts of him, unworthy the Revelation that he hath made of himſelf to us, tending to Expunge out of our Souls all due ſenſe of Sin, and acknowledgment of the Holineſs, and of the Equity of Gods Law, and of his Righteouſneſs in his procedure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon with us.</p>
            <p>The Theſis or Poſition which I maintain, in ſhort is this, namely, That God doth not Premove, or by his Tranſient Influence as the firſt cauſe, Predetermine men unto all and every of their Acts or Actions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; not in particular to thoſe which are ſinful; ſuch as Blaſphemy, Inceſt, Murder, <hi>&amp;c. in ſpecie.</hi>

            <p>Nor yet do I take all Extrinſick Predetermination to be Inconſiſtent with humane Freedom in Acting.

the nature of the ſubjecy to be wrought upon, as that all the vital Wheels of the ſoul, the Reaſon, Elective power, Will and Affections go along with choice and delight in their determination, without the leaſt Rape or Violence offered to the Innate freedom of the ſoul, though God and Chriſt be carried into the heart, with a greater weight of Love than any other Object can ballance, to turn the ſcale of its Predominant Elecion an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and yet it's Invincibly or Irreſiſtibly wrought upon, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity Induced upon it in a ſenſe.

For that, the diſpenſation of this grace is, as to us, contingent, and in the uſe of means; And the ſecond cauſe hath its immediate, formal, and proper Efficiency therein. It is man that believeth and repenteth, (not God; yet the Effect of God's power overſhadowing the ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.) whoſe Action is not only the firſt cauſe in the preſence of ſuch a Creature, (as in the gifts of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:) but is ſpecified by the ſecond cauſe, in the virtue of its proper form ſuitably to its nature, as a reaſonable Creature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. Gods Efficiency changeth not the natures of things; though he rectifieth, and healeth the Mind and Will morally, yet he altereth not its proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or manner of operation naturally.

The conſequence I know is denied by them whom I oppoſe, yea and the thing diſowned; they will not affirm, nor grant God to be the <hi>Author</hi> of ſin, nor do think, that from what they aſſert, it will unavoidably follow; whatever odious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences we faſten upon an opinion in the way of Argumentation, we take for grant the contrary. Namely, that they who do hold that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, do not hold that which we connect with it, or, that which we tell them will follow thereupon.

            <p>Laying aſide therefore all <hi>Philoſophical</hi> and <hi>Scholastical</hi> ſubtilties, let us attend to the Scriptures, and ſee whether we can find out what is Sin; and whether it may be ſaid to have any Author of it, or no; and if ſo, what it is that denominateth any one ſuch in the Language of the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Sin is either Orginal, or Actual. Original, is either that of <hi>Adam,</hi> or of all mankind in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. which was <hi>Origo,</hi> the firſt beginning, and Spring-head of all ſin: Or the immediate Product thereof, that which though it be not the firſt S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Actual Sin, is either of Omiſſion or Commiſſion. The former, is the ſubject's not exerting, or not coming up to ſome particular <hi>Act,</hi> which by the Law he ſtood obliged to. The latter, the Perpetration of ſome <hi>Act,</hi> or the Doing of ſome thing, which the Law of God forbids to be committed or done, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.42. The formal nature of Sin <hi>in abſtracto,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:100338:18"/>
is a Repugnancy to Law or Rule; ſo the Apoſtle defines it, a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Law, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. All Sin, however Diſtinguiſhed, is ſuch, and for the ſame reaſon is Sin; becauſe Inconform to the Law of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Illegality; it's not the Object, or Circumſtance of an Act, or Intention of the Agent in Acting, that is the Rule or Meaſure of its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; but the Act or Action ſo modified, is Good or Evil, as Conform or Inconform to Rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15.</p>
            <p>Sin <hi>in concreto,</hi> is a Peccant Habit, Act, or Omiſſion, againſt Law or Rule. In it there is nothing more nor leſs to be conſidered, but the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit or Privation, Act or Omiſſion of the Law; and the Habitude of the former to it. The Law, that is Good and Holy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. it's alſo <hi>index recti &amp; obliqui,</hi> the Rule and Standard of what is Right, and what Not. God is the Authour of That, Man of the Habit or Act Deviant from it; the Habitude or Relation of Sinfulneſs, <hi>ſtante lege,</hi> reſults from the former Act. The Formality God is the Authour of, in ſome Senſe, he Conſtituteth the Law; what Action ſhall be Good, what Evil, his Nature and Will giveth it ſo to be, it's of Him; but the Exiſtence of the Act or Action diſcrepant to Law, is of Man; God is not the Authour or Predeterminer of That; he might not do it, or was not Neceſſitated ſo to have done it.</p>
            <p>Sin is ſometimes in Scripture predicated of the Soul now depraved; ſomtimes of its Faculties; of the Underſtanding, Will, and Affections; and ſometimes of the Body its Inſtrument, as the Subject and Efficient of it; ſo it is of the Habit or Propenſion to Evil; and Privation of Light, and of the contrary Inclination to Good, (whereof the Soul it ſelf, and its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculties, is the <hi>ſubſtratum,</hi> the prime Subject of ſuch Depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vicious Inclination, and in like manner of all ſinful Omiſſions or Non-agencies) and of actual ſinful Commiſſions, (the <hi>ſubſtratum</hi> or <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riale,</hi> the matter whereof is the <hi>act</hi> it ſelf) yea, it's denominated of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Fact, or Omition I mean, not the <hi>anomie</hi> only, which reſults from the ſame? plain People underſtand well enough what I ſay, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.29, 30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. It denieth to man his Eſſential Nature, and ſpecifick form, (the Natural Image of God, <hi>in genere phyſico,</hi> wherein he was made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.) which is to have Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own Acts; A Power of <hi>Willing,</hi> or <hi>Nilling,</hi> this, or the contrary (in ſuch ſenſe as hath been opened.) What is a Natural Faculty or Active power, but an Ability connate to the Subject, (founded in nature,) rendering it potent to ſuch an Effect? Actually ſo, or, that it may and can reduce into Act? <hi>Voluntas noſtra, nec voluntas eſſet, niſi eſſet in noſtra poteſtate; Porrò quia eſt in noſtra poteſtate libera eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Yea the former <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> debaſeth Man beneath the whole creation of God. It's not denied but that in the virtue of their firſt Qualities, and active Principles, (ſuppoſing the General concurſe of God,) other Creatures can Operate; The fire can heat, and VVater cool, and they ſpecifie their Operation alſo by virtue of their proper forms, (not that the firſt Cauſe is hot, or maketh hot in the preſence of the one, and cold in the preſence of the other.) By Ingrafture, or Inoculation, Man may ſpecifie the active Influence of the firſt cauſe, of what Nature it ſhall give the fruit of ſuch a Stock to be; Never to be altered without a Miracle. And better were it to move neceſſarily as the Stone downwards, or Fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, than to be moved univerſally like a clock or an Engine, (not in all points; but as to the Effect, without an Intrinſick Power unto the contrary Event,) eſpecially in a matter of Offence and Puniſhment, (of which our queſtion is, and) with which a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neceſſity is by all men granted inconſiſtent, and would totally excuſe. But what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to add any more?</p>
            <p>Finally, the aforeſaid notion is not only ſubverſive of all Religion, Policie and humanity, in its genuine conſequents, as is before proved, if I be able to judge; But it's Expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to ſeveral plain Texts of Scripture; As, to Name no more, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.16. <hi>All that is in this World, (as the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life,) is not of the Father,</hi> (not the exiſtence of them,) <hi>but is of this World</hi>; or of the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. who is a Lyer, and <hi>when he ſpeaketh a Lye,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ſpeaketh de ſuo of his own,</hi> is the Author of it. So <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Let no man ſay that he is tempted of God to Evil. But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own Luſt</hi>; That is an <hi>Entity</hi> yet <hi>Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Conceiver</hi> of it, both Father and Mother of that which when it hath finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bringeth forth Death: Oppoſed to Grace, which is from above, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>chap.</hi> 3.15, 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31. The Lord give us Underſtanding herein, and a due ſenſe thereof upon our Souls.</p>
